experience researcher or something like
that we're still figuring out what our
name is these days scaring people I'm
delighted to present today dr. cornelia
Brunner Cornelia has entertained and
informed me in previous at a previous
presentation at the association of
science and technology centers and I'm
absolutely delighted to bring her here
to contribute to the conversation around
gender &amp;amp; technology google the questions
around gender in technology shape who we
are how we hire products that we make
and how we think about the people who
use them so she'll be speaking today on
girls toys and IT careers please give
her a lot thank you folks a pleasure to
be here it's gorgeous here um I have to
I'm going to report to you on some
research that we did starting 20 years
ago and I'm going to just tell you what
we found then and then I'm going to want
to have a conversation with you all
about whether any of the stuff still
holds true okay we've been doing it ever
since so it's not all 20 years old but
essentially I work for a place that's
called the center for children
technology and we were spawned at a
school of education graduate school of
education when when the first
microcomputers came out there was a lot
of hoopla about how they were going to
change everything how they were going to
revolutionize education how our brains
were going to be rewired and this
particular College of Education which
was called Bank Street College that i
worked at decided to take a critical
look at all these claims about
technology so at the time we got a whole
lot of from a lot of donations IBM Apple
a lot of people were sending us
equipment because we were trying out
stuff and we noticed that our particular
Center we were maybe I forget 20 30
people we were maybe two-thirds women
and we noticed that when the big boxes
came in from IBM or from apple with all
this stuff we noticed that there was a
interesting difference in how some of us
responded to it now the people who were
in charge of our technology were women
so it wasn't about that but we noticed
that
the boxes came in some people most guys
would like rip them open were tear into
them would start throwing around stats
and talking stuff and many of us who
were equally technologically savvy would
sort of sit back and say when you
figured out how this thing works give me
a call and I'll come and play with it
right so we thought there's something
here that we ought to look into because
it was very clear that it was not a
matter of knowledge or sophistication
about technology but there was some
other kind of attitudinal difference so
we applied for some grants from the
Spencer foundations and others and we've
been doing it ever since looking more
deeply into not so much what gender &amp;amp;
technology in the sense of what we know
or do with but more about what we want
from and how we feel about in how we
relate to technology in some
relationship to gender so the research I
want to tell you about is about that
okay first however my postmodern
disclaimer which is that we're not
talking about male and female we I have
been talking for most of the time about
feminine and masculine as the socially
constructed notions that have to do with
gender rather than about biology okay
now this isn't working too well because
people are confusing it again so I'm
proposing that instead of talking about
feminine masculine we talk about butch
femme there are all of you know that
there's a lot of in my gay community
there's a lot of femme men and there's a
lot of butch women some of you know less
that they are just as many femme women
and Butch men in my community but what
we do know in my community is that those
concepts Butch and femme I'm in no way
related to sex that's where I want to
get we tend to confuse them again we
tend to talk about them as if all women
were feminine and all men were masculine
so I want to just leave those words out
and I just want to talk about butch
femme okay does that make sense so
that's what we're with so femme just
means a perspective a particular way in
which we've all been in culture ated
that is considered feminine most people
and Butch really means a kind of
perspective of voice our attitude
that is considered or recognized as
masculine by most people and it is
without question that there can be as
many butch men as women and vice versa
okay alright so now when I go into this
stuff and when I by mistake talk about
girls and boys and men and women you
know that I'm making a mistake I don't
mean it i'm old i forget but this is
what i actually mean okay all right so
we did a series of studies oh we had I
think it must have been 120 1820
something I got high technology users at
the time i'm talking about the late
middle to late 80s people who were
really using technology and we did very
extensive interviews with him at the
time a book had just come out that was
called women's ways of knowing and we
sort of used that as a starting point
for the kind of in-depth interviews that
we conducted and we did a bunch of other
stuff what I'll tell you about um just
I'm going to give you a nutshell because
I want this to be more of a conversation
and I talk fast anyhow if I go too fast
to stop but we talked we asked our
respondents which ranged from NASA
scientists architects filmmakers all
kinds of programmers that were all kinds
of folks we asked them to tell us the
story of their careers and the first
major findings that we had was that it
turns out that there is a butch and a
femme way of telling the story of your
career most of the the butch way of
telling the story of your career is to
say I was in kindergarten when I
realized I wanted to be an engineer and
then ever since then after making a
series of steady linear moves to achieve
that goal I took the right courses I did
all the right things I had to write
hobbies I did all the right stuff and
Here I am today the fam way of telling
an analogous career story could be
exactly the same career path is well I
sort of didn't know I was going to do
and then there was this person who said
well maybe you could help out and then I
had a friend over there who needed me to
and then I realized that there and I
don't know Here I am I don't quite know
I got here but I kind of like it okay
same career now the implication of that
if you think about it for young women
is that if you don't sound butch if you
don't sound like you knew in
kindergarten that you wanted to be in
the IT profession it must mean that this
is not the right place for you that it
takes that kind of mindset in order to
find your place in this sort of
technological universe so it's very
important to keep in mind that a kind of
I don't quite know maybe I'm not sure
somehow that that way of expressing your
desire to work doesn't mean you're not
really interested doesn't mean you're
not motivated doesn't mean you're not
going to work hard and doesn't mean that
you're not passionate about what you do
it just means that you have a different
relationship to what the career means to
you it's essentially what it boils down
to okay all right the other thing we
asked talks about in these interviews
which were long was about what
interested the most about technology and
the nutshell version of this is the
butch relationship to technology is all
about the object all about the machine
all about the thing its power its speed
its capability the femme relationship to
this was very different it was all about
well them they are the machines they're
useful but what really matters to me is
their function I look right through the
object to its purpose so I'm much less
interested in being feminist in the
actual machine itself and much more
interested in what it can actually do
for me and that has a whole bunch of
implications for instance about
education if we educate young people and
we glorify the machine we're going to
turn off femme thinkers we're going to
turn off people who want to talk about
the social purpose of the thing rather
than the thing itself then learning
about the machine itself okay if you
have to that make sense but it is not
the thing that attracts us ok we asked
them about mentors and learning
experiences and we discovered which will
come as no surprise that they were
enormously important for everyone for
women and men in our sample having
somebody who said I think you might like
this I think you're good at this I
believe that you can do this was
enormously important women were much
much and I mean women now not fem think
as women were much more aware
of the kind of help that they got along
the way that's just a matter of sort of
gender acculturation that it is harder
in some sense for us first about the
claim that we did this on our own so
we're more likely to give somebody else
credit for our own achievements and that
it is less likely for a guy to admit
that he was helped along the way okay
then we asked them this question we
asked them what was it like what is it
like to be a man or woman in your
profession when we asked the men what's
it like to be a man in your profession
they went huh that was it end of
interview when we asked the women what's
it like to be a woman in your profession
we usually ran out of tape because they
had a lot to say these women in very
very high tech profession many of them
so there was a whole lot of stuff that I
can talk about a little bit but again in
a nutshell what we're really talking
about is that the experience at least 20
years ago was that being a woman in a
high-tech profession means that you have
to do something which we ended up
labeling a kind of compensatory dance
well you have to sort of find a way to
fit in which means you have to leave a
lot of the stuff that it's really you at
home out of the way you pre-screen it
you do stuff so to fit into this world
because the world is clearly not
designed for someone who thinks and
feels the way you do I don't know if
that's still true you're going to have
to tell me we talked about this course
at work what is it like in your
profession what kind of talk actually
goes on and we found that there was a
very powerful difference that the kind
of talk that by and large women like to
do combines personal and professional
integrates home life with work life we'd
like to talk about it all at once and
that most of us feel that in a in a
high-tech profession that is not
legitimate discourse that what we have
to learn to do when we work in a place
which is largely populated by men and
Butch thinking which are not the same
but what we find is that we have to find
a different way of talking and that a
major portion of us has to somehow be
left out and we have a desire in some
way that if we found that it's quite
different as it was it made
difference we have a desire to integrate
the two whereas a lot of the men we
talked to actually said that what they
like best is that they don't have to
integrate them that there really is a
powerful and to them meaningful and
possibly restful separation between all
that stuff they have to deal with at
home which includes all that emotional
stuff and the sort of cleaner life at
work we don't have to deal with that
kind of stuff it wasn't a universal
gender difference but it was very
powerful that it really the very same
thing that made women feel like not
quite comfortable because it wasn't
quite real made the men feel like this
is good this is what we want another way
we saw that was um we asked them at some
point something about how technology
when they first encountered technology
how how they how they felt about it and
we got these wonderful stories which are
exactly parallel whether the guys were
talking about finally now that I have
this powerful piece of technology I can
do all of that stuff on my own I no
longer have to rely on all these people
who are used to have to rely on to help
me do it the computer as it were lets me
do the whole thing by myself and they
love that and I thought it was very
positive whereas women wanted to felt
afraid that the computer would isolate
them and would somehow keep them from
having those kinds of collegial
relationships I think all of that is
quite different now from the way it was
then this was when the internet was
really something that university folks
and military folks knew about and nobody
else really did so I'm assuming that has
it changed it but what I really want to
tell you about is we did some fantasy
work with them we we decided that what
we really wanted to do is go below the
surface of knowledge and really get at
help what people's desires were in
relation to technology so we did a bunch
of exercises with them we made a little
piece of software because we knew that
if you're going to ask people to spit
out their fantasies chances are there be
a little inhibited if you're sitting
there writing it down right so we made a
little interface at the time it was very
playful in which we asked them to spit
their fantasies directly into the
computer on which worked out pretty well
because we got some really interesting
fantasies and we essentially ask them
for these three kinds of things we
them to paint for us in words a former
portrait of them posing with their
machine their work machine their
technology and then think about it as
the way for instance art historian might
do 100 years from now sort of really
describing it in structural terms we
also ask them to fantasize about what
would be a perfect extension of their
current technology a futuristic machine
that would do exactly what they would
want it to do and finally we we actually
did a movement we videotaped them we
gave them a very complex looking object
which actually was a Mexican orange
peeler which if you've ever seen one
looks very complicated and we told we
did nobody knew what it was and we told
them that they should pretend they were
archaeologists in the future and that
they had just uncovered this artifact
and they should describe they should try
to figure out what it might possibly be
and we actually videotaped them and
checked out I movement stuff exactly how
they deconstructed this complex looking
mechanical object from all of this stuff
what we were really looking for with the
codes that we use to analyze the data
that we got from here we looked for the
how people talk about this whole issue
of integration of integrating public and
private work life home live etc
integrating technology into life
retracted but we looked for how what
relationship they seemed to see between
technology and nature we looked for a
relationship of any if we could see one
between technology and the body and
finally something about technology and
creativity and creation I have to
remember 20 years ago the creative
potential of these technologies were
much less obvious than they are now and
finally we looked at the relationship
between technology and communication
which again at the time was not an
obvious connection okay so that's what
we looked for now I'm going to give you
a nutshell version of what we found so
that we can talk here's the butch
version okay magic wands if you see a
pun bear its intended technology that
makes you Bionic allows you to transcend
all limitations of time space on the
body that is the sort of single most
potent of powerful fantasy that we got
from butch thinkers who
by the way in this particular study were
really really largely men I mean in most
gender studies to get a serious overlap
so you don't get a completely clear
relationship between sex and gender but
we got a very powerful relationship
between sex and gender and that could
have shifted by now but any other so we
got a lot of men but thinking like that
now here's the other one digital amulets
little tiny wearable devices which at
the time was like you know portable
computers at the time with this big
right so little tiny digital annulus
small flexible objects that can be worn
with a multifunctional and that allow
you to communicate connect share I did
we um we had a we had a one respondent
talked about a flute for instance a
little tiny flute that you could use to
make music but you could also use it to
somehow communicate with somebody or you
could use it to share a picture cell
phones none of that stuff existed so the
idea that you could have a little tiny
object that could do many things most of
them communicative or even creative was
like a really far-out idea okay so that
in a nutshell was the major powerful
difference that we found now the
discourse around technology that we had
heard then and I think we still continue
to hear breaks down in this way that the
sort of butch this course is all about
stretching the envelope and it is based
on a face that whatever problems are
created by current technology will be
solved by the next generation of either
that technology or another one but that
it is possible to overcome whatever
limitations you see whether it's in the
world are in the technology through
stretching the envelope pushing further
designing more better stuff the femme
version of this is a kind of more
conservative making do because it is
based on a worry that we don't know what
the unintended consequences are of
dropping a new technology into the
natural human social surround we don't
quite know what's going to happen to the
fabric of life if we put a new invention
in there and that concern is a
a powerful one you could say because in
the end women are the ones who have to
clean up the mess or you could just say
that it's sort of built into a different
way of thinking a more holistic way of
thinking um for instance when we did the
orange peeler thing we found that what
by and large what the men did with it is
they sort of identified parts and they
said oh this part sort of looked like a
lathe so this must have this function
and they came awfully close to sort of
figuring out what this thing might
actually be we had by and large two
women who looked at it looked at it
didn't do that looked it all over and
then invented these beautiful narratives
about how people might have used this
object but the relationship between the
actual structure and of the object and
this gorgeous story about how it might
have been useful wasn't all that clear
because you really can't quite get there
holistically you really do have to
identify pieces to decipher an object
like that but the difference whether or
not we were talking they were looking
holistically and trying to understand
the function of this thing in the world
or whether or not they were looking only
at the object and seeing what its
function might be was very powerful okay
so this is in a nutshell on a summary of
what we found now every time I show this
to anyone it always sounds like I'm
being it sounds like propaganda that's
what it sounds like okay it sounds like
I'm making it up but this is what we
found we found that in this sort of
femme voice a feminine voice women
talked about you know using technology
as a medium the butch version is to see
it as a product the femme perspective is
to see it as a tool and the butch
perspective is to see it as a weapon a
communication versus control creativity
being able to use it to make stuff
versus the powers of for instance one of
the differences we found was that I give
you an example when I am I like
cappuccinos and before cappuccino makers
were in evidence everywhere my son who
was then 17 went to Europe for the first
time and he knew her like cappuccinos
and while he was gone I bought myself a
little milk steamer which was
a beautiful Italian design and it says
little silver thing it's gorgeous and
has this very curvy beautiful little
spout and then you hold a little cup
underneath it and if you do everything
just right and you don't burn your hand
you get steamed milk but you have to
hold it just right and cleaning the
thing is a bitch because it's curved and
little is but it was it worked it was
beautifully designed when my son came
home from Holland I think he brought
home a little tiny flat sieve with a
handle what you do is you put a pot on
the stove you put a little milk and it
and you go like this and it aerates the
milk and you got steamed milk the
difference to me is this gender
difference that it is doesn't do the
work for you you still do this with your
hand the tool aids in making this team
but it doesn't do it for you that was
one of the major gender difference we
found that the butch perspective wants
the tool to take over do all the work
they wanted brain implants that would
allow them to blink an eye and mountains
would grow the very same idea many of
the men who actually responded said was
also a nightmare they understood the
dangers it wasn't that they didn't get
it but that's what they really wanted
from the technology to be Bionic to be
godlike the feminine defend perspective
is much more tools that are sort of
small helpful they don't take over they
don't do everything but they make it a
little easier to do what you need to do
and a lot of making do a lot of figuring
out how to use something in another way
because it works reasonably well it may
not be the best or most powerful and
most efficient way to do it but it works
so why invent a new thing those are very
very different attitudes so in the end
when we go down to the bottom here we
had a lot of people talking about women
talking about how the technology was
empowering them they liked it but what
they meant by empowerment was it enabled
them to do more things in a slightly
different way not that they no longer
had to do the work men talked about
transcendence about the tools themselves
allowing them to transcend all the
limitations that were working them about
having to actually do the work so that
was a very powerful difference and this
is the last one which i already
mentioned
the fascination that the butch
perspective talks about the fascination
with the object itself with these
features capabilities with getting your
hands on it with looking inside it is
not shared by fam thinkers who look
right to the object is transparent to
them for them to this for its function
that's a very very different different
way to approach technology and has
enormous implications for how we teach
kids about technology now I want to get
two kids just a little bit we asked them
to fantasize yet
that would be a fitting metaphor yeah I
think that's true
an evolutionary perspective but you want
little things that make incremental
changes as opposed to a revolutionary
idea where you build something that
completely changes the way you do things
in everything right that's a reasonable
metaphor for this very same thing all
right so we did this stuff with kids
kids from ages 8 9 up to college age and
this is we asked them to imagine a
machine fantastical machine that they
would like to be able to invent and this
is pretty much what we got from a lot of
boys we got some kind of vehicle that
would allow them to transcend time and
space and that when we asked them to
draw the inside would include such
things triangle windshield moon suits
twin valve seven rotor nine class post
of rocket hidden turbo jets and a snack
bar so that's it that's what we got a
lot of right so now here comes the fam
version a little tiny object little tiny
multifunctional so for instance this is
a little hard to read so this very same
thing when the snow comes up it turns
into a shovel so that you can shove us
know when the leaves fall down it turns
into a rake so you can rake the leaves
now you know this had been done by a boy
there would not be a rake there would be
a ray gun that would pulverize the
leaves right okay an umbrella that
senses when the Sun comes out and then
this turns into a cedar day so it's a
perfect example of a little tiny
multifunctional object that doesn't do
the work for you but it allows you to do
the work that needs to be done then we
asked lately this must be now 45 years
ago we went back to some whole bunch of
kids and we asked them to draw the
internet which by then had become
ubiquitous this is what we got the butch
version of the internet then and I don't
know if it's so different now this is
hard to see this is a this is a browser
this shows you all the stuff you can get
on the internet all the information all
the goods that's what the internet is
for them here comes the femme version
web that connects people's they
communicate and share right so we find
these differences in kids and we find
that they hold even now when technology
has changed and when in fact technology
now really is in many ways the very
thing that both the sort of Butch and
femme thinkers in our sample back then
were asking for you can do all of those
things now that they were asking for 20
years ago right so what this all means
for the real reason about I'm talking
about all this is the pipeline there is
as most of you know a dearth of young
women going into these professions going
into technology professions and IT
professions and what I think we have to
think about is that most of the time the
pipeline really means that you're taking
things directly out of Boy culture and
that you're promising young people that
they will be able to play with that
stuff and think like that and play like
that in these professions when we talk
about inducting young women into the
universe universe we tend to talk about
finding the kinds of girls who are able
to think in butch ways who are
interested in thinking like that and we
want to make it possible for them to
feel comfortable and invited into this
world and that's okay that makes a lot
of sense the missing piece is this is
really inducting femme thinkers into
this very same universe and we were
talking about a little bit at lunch
there are so many IT professional needs
now that privilege and require the very
feminine kinds of skills and
predilections that are traditionally
associated with feminine feminine
thinking we need them now but very very
few young women out there actually
understand or young men who are fam in
this way actually understand that
there's room for them in this world they
really don't know that it doesn't mean
you have to love to get your hands in
a machine to work at a place like ooh so
the missing link i think is that it's
really recognizing that girl culture
femme culture also has to be addressed
in some way and that we have to make it
clear to young people that those you can
love barbie and actually work here it is
possible because there are things that
make you love Barbie that are also
called for here and I think that is a
very serious error that we make now I'm
not going to go on much longer but one
of it we've at the center where I work
we do a lot of we make we have a lot of
projects that are designed to help k-12
school kids think about technology
differently learn with it differently
etc and a series of different kinds of
projects have been based directly on
this gender work the one that we've been
working on for a while now which is
directly related to this is we try to
figure out a way how do we make it
possible for young women to understand
that what they like to do is necessary
in this world so we invited we sort of
divided the IT professionals into these
five layers something about networking
about connecting people letting people
talk to each other something about
writing code cracking code understanding
secret code language stuff like that
something about information or data
management really being able to find
things and put things together something
about web design being able to make
beautiful stuff that other people can
read and something about helping people
deal with their equipment so if we have
those so there are five layers of the IT
professions we can make we can make
inroads we can show young women that in
each one of these layers there are
there's a call for the kind of skills
that they actually bring to this kind of
stuff we ended up sort of trying to make
two kinds of games that are the exactly
identical gameplay but that have a butch
femme narratives around so this would be
the butch surround right so that you're
using these machines to there's a guy's
who has some kind of secret device which
you see there and you got to track him
down and find him and you got to open up
the device and decipher what it is so
that he doesn't blow up the whole world
or something like this was we did this
at around nine eleven so we've changed
the store
since then because this won't work
anymore it's too scary now because it's
too realistic right but something like
that would be the butch version and
here's the femme version of the
identical game you have to the team of
people as to this young woman a'right
this skill ooh girl arrives on the
island she's wearing a mysterious device
which you have to somehow decipher in
order to reunite her with her family
it's exactly the same gameplay exactly
the same stuff the only difference is
that in this case we're featuring the
people and in the other case we were
featuring the machines so it's just a
little tiny example of how understanding
something about these gender differences
can actually inform the way in which you
present what you do what is necessary
and what this universe is actually about
I want to stop because I actually wanted
to have more of a conversation we have
done a bunch of other things that may
come up that are relevant to this whole
issue but my sort of final parting shot
is this if you want to if you want to
induct young women into this world
showing them role models that say yes
women can do it with just as good it's a
good idea but it's not going to do the
trick because what it doesn't do is take
into consideration the genuine valuable
worries that we bring the worries about
whether or not the technology will have
unintended consequences that will mess
up the earth the worries that something
about human interactions is changed in
some way that we don't know how to
manage the worry that you won't be able
to combine private and public life
social life and a professional life
those worries are legitimate the worries
that young women were then talking about
about you know not being able to talk
about personal stuff those kinds of
worries may still be legitimate I don't
know because I don't work in a place
like this anymore but if we don't
address them if we don't let young women
know that it is okay not only is it okay
to worry but it's actually a good idea
that somebody needs to worry and that if
the butch attitude is yes we'll make a
bigger better faster harder machine
that will allow us to do things that we
haven't even dreamt of then the femme
version of this which is like we'll wait
a second let's just see what might
happen and how we can manage your cope
with what's going to happen is also
necessary otherwise we have run away
technology right so all I'm really
saying is that what we need to do is not
choose but it's really legitimate that
other voice that FEM voice in this world
rather than making young women feel as
they do now by and large we did at the
AAUW that a study the American
Association of University Women did a
study not very long ago that we were
part of where young women now talk about
yeah they could do that they can do
anything that's true women can do
anything but I just don't want to so
that attitude which is I think is really
about this underlying stuff is the one
we have to deal with and that attitude
requires that we legitimate those
worries that we legitimate that career
path rather than that we leave them with
the impression that unless you're a
dedicated geek who loves machines there
is no room for you in this world that's
it so
you can later
so identify the first stage and pipeline
is
girls for the drop
there is
by this social reason
and that doesn't seem too
notion of
the same side of thing
watch so
if they drop out then
what Krista let's set party dresses
that live in public administration
policies I'm very bad at this and
there's a mic it's whether or not when
the pipeline first drives a blue jersey
in middle school but none of that
problem is addressed in a certain sense
by this business I was talking about
about legitimating a more feminine
except that um the notion at age
thirteen that you have to be a dedicated
geek in order to fit into this world
means at that age that nobody is going
to ask you out you will never have sex
as long as you live right and that
moreover um that it will somehow
transform you into a person who always
wears a lab coat and glasses right
that's no it's to that notion that you
have to choose between appealing being a
14 year old glamour girl will a Barbie
and this world that it's a completely
unrelated set of world is still very
much around and what we have to do to
overcome it is to help them recognize
that those very same ambitions and goals
wanting to help people wanting to rescue
etc that there is room for them in this
world and that you don't have to be a
geek in order to be meaningfully
employed in this universe and they don't
know that
should
it distresses me that the choice is
between
the Barbie had
joining this world the choices
well I see you say yes about Barbie okay
math and science and technology
education by and large does not address
the fem way of thinking it by and large
presents the subject matter in a butch
fashion it by large especially
technology education we teach know girls
don't take programming courses because
we we did a little project in which we
we made a little flash application in
which what you have to do is put
together an ice skating routine you have
a little game and there's a little ice
skater and you have to put together an
ice skating routine you have like 10
different steps that you can put
together and if you do it and you ask
for instance to make an elegant figure 8
the steps don't quite do the trick you
have to do something to change them now
girls bring with them as two boys a lot
of prior knowledge about ice skating
what with the Olympics and everything so
the whole enterprise makes sense to them
why you would have to change things
slowly as you begin to realize that the
steps you have available don't quite do
it you have to start to think about
variables and what you might have to
change to make it possible to make a
figure 8 and after you've done that and
it still doesn't quite work you unpeel
it even more and you actually look at
the code and you actually change some of
the JavaScript underlying it that
process which starts from a meaningful
enterprise that makes sense a function
and then slowly you'll learn to look at
what you need to do in order to make
that work even better that makes sense
so we had 6th graders up through 10th
graders learning the kind of programming
concepts that are tested on the AP test
in high school but it's because we
turned that whole thing on its head
instead of teaching them about code and
giving them the building blocks that
eventually lead to something meaningful
we started out with something meaningful
a function that makes sense and then
slowly allowed them to investigate just
what they needed in order to be able to
do that that's a very different approach
to teaching program that's what we need
to do more of in order to invite the 14
year olds to take the programming class
same is true in science same is true in
math that the whole enterprise has to
somehow be meaningful rather than that
you learn a lot of stuff
you're told someday we'll be meaningful
it's not working oh look it so this does
go to the video okay I should throw this
instead of this one you oh I got one I
got one on all right okay right Michael
that won't work so if you want to ask
questions a little bit towards the back
we can do that
the values of
because I sort of feel like
some of the values are quite
it's still like this and I started to
feel like some value
like very
I did I did you're asking me whether or
not we what I'm saying is that we have
to change the story we tell young women
or the values that are actually a sort
of inherent in this world changing the
values is not an enterprise that I know
anything much about but I'm assuming
that a place like Google which is
clearly deeply invested in somehow
living up to its values is a place where
you could fruitfully think about what
does it mean to really make people feel
welcome so you guys would be at the
front lines of figuring that one out the
other one is the story how do we tell
the story so if each one of you were
interviewed and you were to tell the
story of how you ended up here what
would this story look like and if every
story sounds like a bush story you know
by age ten I knew it would be
discouraging if some of your stories men
and women sounded like you know I really
had no idea I was going to do and I sort
of like didn't find my passion until I
was like and then I got this job in the
neighborhoods oh this is cool if some of
the story sounded like that it would be
very encouraging most of the role models
we parade in front of young women don't
admit this degree of ambivalence and
uncertainty most of them sound even if
they are women as if they were born to
do this and that I think means that we
do people young people men and young men
and young women a disservice because we
don't sort of own up to the fact that
many of us discover that we like working
in this kind of environment rather than
we knew it going in most of us do
alright
wait say that again I could I couldn't
hear it I'm sorry so different in person
I think about how
lego robot
this
they're side
oh yes okay so here's my Lego story
which I ready so let's go too much when
they first did they go go go at MIT and
they tried it out with kids on you could
build a vehicle and they could follow
paths and see census etc and the boys
thought is great the girls thought it
was kind of boring because who wants to
just build a vehicle that can follow a
pass what they wanted was Legos that
could interact with each other
eventually based on that research they
built the second version of this where
the bricks actually have some
intelligence built in and you can indeed
make things that relate to each other it
was a more sophisticated technology but
they did it and those kinds of Lego
bricks that you can now do things with
are more attractive to girls than the
original ones were so it's not robotics
itself if it's all about a robot being
able to do something it's interesting
but if you look at this sort of you know
the eyeballs soccer league and all that
kind of stuff where you have robots
interacting with each other that's
interesting if you are allowed to enter
/ more files a little but it's even more
interesting in other words if the
metaphors that you are allowed to use to
understand what the robots to the
metaphors are allowed to be
anthropomorphizing you are allowed to
talk about feelings and moods and things
like that rather than being told that
that's illegitimate but sports metaphors
are legitimate that's another way of
legitimate image so those that home
medical the way we started this whole
research is that many many years ago
remember when you wanted to get the
computer to do something you could do
one of two things you could issue a
command or you could pick something from
a menu issue and command is a butch
thing to do scares the bejesus out of
some of us because we have visions of
armies dying picking something from a
menu and you pick the wrong thing you
pick another one right big deal that's a
femme way of thinking about the same
thing some of it is in the metaphors we
use some of it is in the language and
some of it is just in the narratives
that we spin around doing this stuff so
robotics has to have a more of a
narrative than just I can get a machine
to do something
yes I
familiar
a ship called that nice cool
the new
okay because
we don't have work that
good question i don't know but that
would be a very good idea because we
know i mean the research that we do know
is that girls are using technology and
every bit as much as boys don't they use
it to communicate they do a lot of
texting they do a lot of talking to each
other so cool technologies is and now a
concept that works for girls it didn't
use to work for girls 20 years ago the
words cool technology by definition man
dibuj thing so I for instance I'm a
gadget queen I love gadgets but the idea
that you could be a gadget Queen didn't
make all that much sense now it makes a
lot of sense so cool technology by now
is meaningful and it usually is the kind
of technology that allows us to connect
to communicate to share ideas and to do
all of those family things yes I wish we
had more
into those categories
support
at the bottom which is
not as a bias but that's the way yes the
general value
organization and yet that is probably
the high
yes which I
oh this and that was not accidental that
entire hierarchy was not accidental
because it isn't because it's true that
I mean there are very few young women
who find themselves deeply interested in
the notion of what we now call
networking even though the idea of
networking makes a lot of FEM sense
right but that's not what we think about
when we listen to the guys who we have
to talk to when the thing is down again
and we can't communicate right so
translating that into something else
will be very interesting but it is true
that that hierarchy is the more techie
the more esoteric technique from our
perspective the higher up in the
hierarchy and the people who actually
deal with people are on the bottom
and no a filter
and river I'm alone
like it
trying two percent
no idea to an odd
Alshon of them
whoa
also just like
written by pirates
college and
our very first semester for freshman
year it was like
we were outcasts compare you want to do
yeah so the amethyst articles when they
started having more attractive
that is the impression we leave young
women with and we know it's not really
true I Carnegie Mellon did a whole thing
and I gather Lenore bloom was here
talking they were awful about the van
went it was it was it a while ago well
they they say now that they have changed
around their recruitment policies and
their whole program to me more inviting
to young women and Lenore bloom says
that as a result of that they're getting
what they consider a better class of
male programmers as well because it is a
more holistic or a different approach to
programming I can't vouch for the fact
that that's true that's what she says
but at least theoretically makes a lot
of sense that if you make the thing more
inviting to young women who may not have
been thinking since middle school that
they want to do this that you get a more
interesting more creative mix of people
and at least that's what they claim has
happened
shahnaz expressing them go to defend in
trust and it's much more easily you know
what can I do what can I doing this why
is importing something right talk to
Robin it they go home ray goes to the
time it's making something that's
actually useful on any kind of Ages yes
but you know Cassie yeah who cares if it
all goes away no but it doesn't matter
it's not useful and so that means apiece
absolutely to focus on that is the fence
thing that I meant by we look right
through the object to its function that
we really want to see what makes it
useful and then that's what matter more
then whether it's the most efficient to
a most powerful way to do it in person
sectional burst their enemies universe
they still wanna solve problems and
being in a environment where that you're
told I seamlessly bush and you all can
care less about technology or you have
to talk to everyone all the time I'm
actually bergamot you have talking
everywhere all the time is appalling so
having things that work towards that
other piece I wanted to
you're putting support as the only sort
of interacting people for whatever
primary interacted with people in the
occupation missing a whole set of Oh
class requirements user definitions of
what functionality supposed to be
getting loose to talk together
understanding how the phrasal vaporizer
you're a fool
teamwork and manage myself it has to go
on babies under the technology and if
people remember that is they're not
going to realize that Johnson exists and
then you get you know the crate through
scenarios I think you're absolutely
right i think we should include that I
think you're absolutely I also want to
say that it is in my community we know
that every single human individual has a
complex mix of Butch and femme
characteristics so that we don't end up
with stereotypes so you don't have to be
a Butch who is always butch or a
family's always fam right that's very
important but I think you're absolutely
about the other stuff and the support
category does need to be widened to
include the very kind of stuff you're
talking about absolutely absolutely
five different hues
one thing
good alums on
Oh
just like
but now they
Oh
so
haha
there are many different ways of
thinking about that okay one of them is
that you shouldn't have to do anything
special that it's okay for only some
girls to be interested in that and to go
that way as long as you also legitimate
as the previous young woman just said
those other kinds of jobs the other way
to think about it is that if you really
think hard about what you do in the cell
group it's conceivable that the boys are
creating an atmosphere that is more
butch than it needs to be it's very
often the case that you can femme things
up if you just think about it a little
bit harder okay you can also butch
things up if you think a little bit
harder but butchering things up almost
comes with the territory of having guys
in there because they're so determined
not to be considered femme it's still
such Anatomy to be considered family of
your god that they're very determined to
show whatever butch thing could be
happening there so it requires usually a
sort of extra effort to fem things up
which usually means legitimating certain
other ways of thinking about things
certain other interest it's usually
doesn't mean changing the whole program
it just means being a model for that way
of thinking as well as for the actual
work but there's no simple answer to
that
if the woman mentor is willing to be
somewhat femme about it yes it can be a
male who is willing to be firm about it
I don't think the sex is nearly as
important as the attitude she is more a
broadening of
moles to be playin
then I've seen
I guess people with sort of femme
persuasions of taking butch roles
and I'm wondering if there are some
roles that you just there a lost cause
to try to make them not appeal or to
make them appeal to somebody with
sort of the opposite mine
and maybe what you know what you're
saying and what what's really possible
is to sort of broaden the goals and
redefined the walls and make a little
bit more flexibility for the
whole work rather than having you know
spending a lot of time trying to
convince people with
nice to be data center engine
grace yes I think you're absolutely
right and i think the missing piece
however is that as is historically
always the case if you have a lot of
women doing something it tends to be
undervalued so the other part of that is
to also make sure that you highly value
and legitimate those are there more fem
kinds of jobs and we very often neglect
that part so you know there's the old
story about how in Russia and the Soviet
Union excuse me medicine became a less
valued profession because a whole bunch
of women went into it right so that is
always a danger and you always have to
look for that but I think it's
absolutely true that there are certain
kinds of jobs that require a butch
attitude and a butch set up credit
elections and interests and then if you
find women with that set of interest
great if you don't forget it but we tend
to value those professions far more than
we do the other ones which are more like
Social Work and that's the part we can
change so I want to thank you know what
actually just asked for nearly one last
question so to wrap up I wanted that
cific thoughts or suggestions about
Google's approach to recruiting and
hiring an interviewing I know that you
don't know in all the details but maybe
you have some suggestions for us and
they can sort of take into account the
exodus yeah I don't actually know
anything whatsoever about this of course
I will now continue to answer your
question I think Google because what you
do is make it I mean what you do and
what the general public knows you do
okay is that you make it possible for
people to find out stuff essentially
that's what the public knows you do
right that's fam that's okay that's
interesting it's useful there's nothing
wrong with it right the fact that
there's computers and equipment and
machines and stuff involved in but it's
okay you know guys no sir I think at as
a as a place as a profession it's very
different from a company where people
expect that you spend all day in a lab
like making chips it's very hard to
interest young women in making chips but
Google is a different place so if you
have a recruitment policy that says we
help the world deal with all kinds of
important issues because we help people
find stuff out that they need to know I
don't think it's a hard sell then you
have to make sure that they understand
what the difference so what you were
saying about really understanding all
the different roles that are necessary
to make this thing that the most of us
just know as a site that you go to the
find out right um that's the part
that's missing so if you do that if you
go into high schools and middle schools
and it's clear to young women that
they're all these interesting jobs that
you can do that support that enterprise
I think you would get young women
interested then you have to make sure
that when you interview them you don't
listen for the butch passion if you're
listening for the butch passion I want
to work room you're not going to hear it
or you're going to find only those young
women who have that if you listen for
different ways of sort of talking about
the same kind of stuff but that has
never really been connected with
technology in the same way before you
may find that there are certain kinds of
town
that you're particularly interested in
but there have never been expressed in
relation to technology before that's the
best I can do with that question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
