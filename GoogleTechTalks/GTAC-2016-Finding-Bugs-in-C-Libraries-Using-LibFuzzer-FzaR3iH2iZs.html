give a lightning talk good afternoon
I hope you're a little bit of weak but
to to make you more weak let me ask you
a couple of questions first of all how
many of you care about C++ applications
stability and security total little
everyone please raise your hand because
you you do care about stability and
security of C++ applications even if you
don't develop them yourselves how many
of you have passed something in the past
C++ or not
okay please some of you in the audience
know what fuzziness I will talk about
fighting and I will talk about one
particular tool to do fuzzing and I'll
have tiny live demo today so what is
fighting why do you want to fast
what do you want to file how do you want
to fight a little bit about about the
particular fuzzing tool and the live
demo let's go so what what is fuzzy you
can define it in many ways but
essentially it is an infinite loop of
create a test input for application and
feed it in the application there are two
things you want you want to get out of
out of fuzzing first you want to crash
the application so if you if you crash
application you found the bug even if
you don't crash the application you
still grow code coverage overall and you
can use the the the corpus you've grown
for regular regression testing why would
you like why would you want to pass
something
first of all C++ offers you many unique
ways to treat yourself into the heat
like buffer overflows use of the free
integer overflows and some such and
fuzzing is a very efficient way to find
such C or C++ specific bugs but even if
you are not using C++ using some
safer and slower language like I don't
know any other
you you might still have divided by zero
you may still have now the reference you
may still have certain failures you may
have concurrency bugs you may have bugs
that cause the application to consume
too much resources CPU memory or network
bandwidth or whatever sometimes actually
fighting may allow you to find logical
bugs as well what two files the the
usual suspect for fuzzing is any
application in your library that
consumes untrusted data
so anything that consumes files from the
internet or from users anything that
monitors the network activity which
accounts the more or less anything right
there are two specialized targets
operation system kernels and UI
applications and I'm not touching those
two how two files one of very popular
ways to fuzz is to apply some kind of
application specific generation based
rule for example if you know the syntax
of the files that the application
consumes you can generate files that
follow the syntax and this approach has
been very very useful in in many cases
at Google on the outside but I'm not
touching this today another approach is
called mutation based fuzzing this is
when you already have a set of valid
inputs all invalid inputs for your
application and you start mutating
random inputs in random ways and feeding
these inputs into your application and
sometimes mutations could be as simple
as bit flipping sometimes mutations are
much more complex and this approach is
also very powerful but if we make a
little one tiny step to improve it it it
will become much more efficient like
orders of magnitude and we've seen it in
in in many cases so the the tiny step is
called guided meditation phasing
and by guided I mean that we use code
coverage to guide both the mutation and
the extension of the corpus the
workflows as follows you build the
application with some kind of coverage
instrumentation so every time you
execute an input with the application
you know what parts of the application
have been touched and then you start
mutation fuzzing if some of the new
mutations caused new code coverage to to
appear you say oh this is a good input
it touched a part of application that
the rest of the test corpus didn't so we
added back to the corpus and we have
lots of evidence that this increases the
efficiency of passing by several orders
of magnitude
come on yeah we are working we mean my
team right now are working on a very
specific way of fighting with us C and
C++ API or libraries would not right now
if as large binaries we do not file
services with a small or medium-sized
API like API entry points you can think
of it as unit tests like fuzzing
so we define I think which we call fast
target which is a C function called C
function that consumes bytes and inside
that function you can do whatever you
like with these bytes basically feed
these bytes in one way another into your
library we can find the bug on this on
the slide yes correct so on this slide
you have C code that given one specific
input will trigger buffer overflow on
the line which
says data sub 3 equals Z can everyone
see the bug I leave it here for 10
seconds raise your hand when you see the
bug come on
so father will find this bug much
quicker than you there are lots of there
are several fuzzing engines on the
market and the faster the engine is the
tool that finds inputs that are
interesting enough and feeds them into
your into your first target in the
application one of them was developed by
my teammates called lip father it's an
engine for guided in process fuzzy
guided means that it is using code
coverage and in process means that
everything does it doesn't a single
process it does the mutations and it
feeds the inputs into the API and the
tests all in the same process it's a
library in a regular C++ sense which
provides the main function if you want
to use this library you need to build
your code with some extra compiler flags
that actually do provide the the code
coverage information then you link your
application with the lip buzzer then you
go in parallel or before that you have
to find a set of inputs for your
application somewhere an initial test
corpus sometimes it's okay to have
initial test corpus empty but in most
cases the battery does test purpose it
have the more efficient fashion will be
and once you have this directory you
just pass this directory as a parameter
to the to the just compiled binary of
the father this is it let me show you
some example this bug was made public
about three or four four weeks ago it
was
buffer overflow in one of the network
one of the open source network libraries
see areas and you have the CVE and the
names on the screen the bargain that
library was a single byte buffer
overflow which over at one bite
somewhere outside of the of the object
it caused a full exploit of Chrome OS so
there was direct impact for Google that
Google had to pay $100,000 for the
researcher who provided us the
information but there was also indirect
harm because who knows maybe some
someone else has discovered this bug
before and was using it against our
customers so this is a pretty nasty this
was a pretty nasty bug which is now
fixed and all you need to find this bug
is on this slide everything you need is
on this slide so count how many lines
here can we switch the demo
okay so I have I have a prebuilt library
binary of the the fuzzer that I've just
shown you on the screen how many of you
believe me that I can find $100,000
worse bug before the end of the stock
come on
okay done so I've started the fuzzer
on a single CPU on this laptop now this
is not the most recent laptop and it
started finding new inputs and on the
very left you may see the numbers it's
the most significant digit is eaten but
it basically executed several thousands
of inputs before it found an input that
triggers a bug and the bug is heap of
rubber flow right of one byte and here
is where so if if someone invested 10
lines of code into finding that bug he
would find it instantly as you have seen
what what else is is convenient about
leaf father is that once it reports a
bug it also creates a file on disk which
has the complete which has the bytes
that caused the the bug to happen and if
you want to reproduce it can you see it
yeah if you want to reproduce the bug
all we need is to feed these bytes again
into your target function like this and
it will happen again and so you can
debug it you can verify that it's fixed
you can add this input or your
regression test suite etc switch to the
slides please
so I've just shown you a very very
important very scary bug that can be
fine by fuzzy instantly
fortunately or not not all scare bugs
are like this for some bugs we need to
spend hours for some bugs we need to
spend months finding them and Google has
these resources and Google has to some
extent humans to do this
not all open-source projects have it and
we are trying to help so what what we
want to do we want every open-source
project at least every every important
every significant open-source project to
move away from it has been fast at some
point or it has never been fast to the
situation when we can say this project
is being continuously fast and we
actually know that the coverage produced
by the fuzzing is good enough and for
that we are starting to introduce what
we call what we call OSS file open
source fuzzing which is a fashion is a
service for important open source
projects it is based on the same file in
infrastructure that were using for
Chrome and that has found many thousands
of bugs for for chromium so far it
provides multiple fuzzy engines under
the hood but the user shouldn't know
about it all the user should know is how
to interface how to create a glue
between their project and the OSS files
and this slide again is an example of
such glue the project is now public it's
on github and if you own or work with
some open source project you're welcome
to participate thank you and I have 55
seconds for questions
excellent talk any questions from the
audience we have one all right so in
terms of like detecting like memory
issues like like how does this compare
against like valgrind and stuff like how
much effort and time to have to spend
with this tool versus something like
valgrind which has been out there
forever
forget about well grant use address
sanitizer but this well grant and
address integer versus fuzzers
are complementary things you cannot find
bugs with welcome to addressing it
either just by running tests because the
tests will not execute the buggy code
you need the father and the tool like
welcome to address sanitizer together to
find interesting bugs my question is how
is the actual mutation done can you
provide some details on death
we start from bit Philippian by flipping
those simple things but also as the
fuzzy neurons will gather the statistics
about the comparison instructions and
library calls and we actually
accumulated a dictionary of tokens that
I used by the input language and then we
start feeding these tokens into the
input stream so over time it gets much
more sophisticated than by flipping bit
flipping I think that's what all we have
time for for lightning talks but thank
you Kostya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
