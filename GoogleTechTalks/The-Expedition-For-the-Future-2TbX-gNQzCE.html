for nomad industries which is a content
agency today I'm going to speak to
specifically about the expedition for
the future but to give you some context
i'd like to share with you i guess a bit
of philosophy where I come from how I
work and basically where I'm going so
I've had this realization that came not
all in a flash but true through the
years I've been I guess working as a
creative professional for about 10 years
and it's just been a couple of years
that I had this kind of sentence come up
the medium is life you know I was very
inspired by McLuhan thinking like a lot
of people are even almost most people
that are involved in media one way or
another and I always like this idea then
the medium is the message and I always
thought about that a lot and at some
point in recent years I say only a
couple of years ago because it's because
of the interconnectivity of all the
technologies that I came to this to this
step in my own creative endeavors where
I kind of let go of the technical part
and really just started focusing on life
itself as my medium so I'll tell you how
I came about this is my daughter Jane
she's just turned 3 a couple of months
ago and the reason why I put up here is
because she reminded me of when I was
just starting to watch movies I guess
five years old or so the first films I
ever saw and a filmmaker at at heart and
my grandfather showed me these musicals
so having seen mostly musicals by five
or six years old for me this this was
not just movies it was movies of course
but I didn't think I have to make a film
my idea of making movies was a lot like
the way we saw in singing in the rain if
any of you have seen this film it's like
there's this one shot for example the
whole movies like this but they're
walking across the studio space and you
have three movies being done in the
background so throughout this
conversation you're going from one you
reverse to the next in the background as
if it's just happening and they just
have to go okay roll you know and and
the captured and that's it or the
character is going to go I had this
great idea it go something like this and
then you see the whole piece the last 10
minutes and then Deanna goes that yeah I
love that okay we'll put in the film
move on you know and it's it was just an
instantaneous kind of very I guess
intuitive thing that we seem to be doing
which is why I wanted to get into that
that universe not necessarily the idea
of making films themselves I studied in
California I studied that in why you as
well film production it when I stepped
out of school I guess I was 22 I came
back to Montreal bro I was on a very
hard time making money in doing video
doing what I love doing cinema I didn't
want to kind of work my way up as a PA
and you know cameras isn't that sort of
thing just wasn't me and someone the
friend of mine put me in front of them
makes her one night a video mixer and i
discovered VJ and it broke everything I
ever learned about cinema I was always
very much at the improv my whole life so
when I discovered VJ for me it was a
real kind of Revelation where I could
improvise with cinema this this brought
me to start the moment factory which you
might know of it some moment factory is
a company whose mission it's been around
for 10 years now the base mission of it
for me was to push the limits of the
medium I'd always been obviously into
those I give storytelling on screen but
this was really about breaking that that
boundary of the screen and bringing it
out into environments in to bring an
interactive level to the to the video
into the storytelling and ten years ago
with the when Vijay was
a lot of those ideas were needed a lot
of technological development for us to
bring them to life there were three
people at the start of moment factory
that I think really made made it work I
was coming from film that was section
was coming from décor in art direction
in film and w nicole day was really come
more from that I guess the technical
part of it so he was making our ideas
possible basically so this company did
well enough and it led me four years ago
to start a nomad things that we're
bringing out of what we're doing with
moma tractor in terms of environments
and so on and getting more into
transmedia not just multimedia but
really telling stories across media it's
a company that i started mostly to focus
on content because I'd really pushed I
felt those limits of what I could do in
terms of projections and environments
with video and storytelling to the point
where I really wanted to go back to the
content that stuff and get away from
even the technical and nomad became this
space as well our whole business model
change we have this building on bed horn
some 10,000 square feet so we're on two
floors we have shooting studios
downstairs recording studios downstairs
as well on the second floor we have
basically created space for rent so so
we're some 35 people in the building and
I ended up going from a staff of always
between 12 and 20 people to one
basically now I'm really working from
with the people in the space which are
all independent creative professionals
and the results are incredible the
reason being mostly I think that for one
thing people are there in their own
accord so they're really responsible for
the space what goes on in it and that
means as well that they bring their
their own activities to
space so obviously their own projects
and so on but also things that fall
outside of the professional realm these
are things that out oh I've always been
doing with momentum every moment trap
you started with a website where i was
posting one movie week up through the
films they were putting up on the
website it got us to know all of our
resources for for the first few years of
moment factory and now it's kind of like
with no man those have become something
that we that is much more tangible
something as physical people are there
they're exchanging it's really been an
incredible collaborative context for us
that also brings activities like events
and exhibitions and shootings and even
improv that we've gone back to doing
video improv that are making them our
collaborations on the professional level
very strong a good example of this is a
project that we just wrapped up very
recently I which brings me back to my
daughter I want to convince her that the
world is very much how she sees it in
those films you know that it is easy now
to make a film to tell a story you know
no matter the medium it's not you know
she's not thinking in that scope and
it's really about living that story
that's that's what it's become about for
me as a filmmaker anyway and that's
really what I want to share with her I
want to open up her perception so that
she's watching a film like that singing
in the rain and that she's turning
around and seeing what her dad is doing
for a living in myself I looked around
and realized wait a minute
and living those dreams it has become
like those films you know which is why i
remade her favorite film The Wizard of
Oz starring herself at the beginning she
transforms into her babysitter and then
using you know strictly the the space
itself people around the community in
seven days remaking this this feature
film for my daughter to then go oh yeah
that's right that's just the way life is
and she sees the link she sees it as
something that's just part of a lot of
that it's a possible thing I wanted to
grow up with them now I'm going to kind
of step away from the career side of it
more into the personal I guess artistic
development in my life which will bring
us right to to the expedition for the
future I made this film the eye of the
Sun is going to be about 10 years I
guess next year I the incredible
opportunity to climb mountains with my
father first one I climbed was the
Kilimanjaro an 18 years old it was a
very difficult mount for him and it was
very difficult for me we didn't think
we'd get to descend together I got up
there I thought he was way behind and he
wasn't even going to make it and when I
saw him come up only a few minutes after
I really felt that link with my father
that I never really had until that that
age I guess until 18 you know when I was
younger for me my father was the amount
of all mountains you know but but by 18
years old kind of you see things
differently as far as your parent old
guidances is concerned and I saw the
strength that inhabit both of us and
that brought us up that mountain this
led us to the dent climb long story
short the Seven Summits the highest
mountain on every continent I made a
film about this called the eye of the
Sun when I was in fifth grade I i drew a
comic book called the men in this dream
about a boy who was climbing Mount
Everest because his father had died on
the mountain and you know he so I kind
of had this dream way back but I even
about until I was on the mountain and
there was filming a story that I knew
already you know because I I I knew the
story I wanted to tell so I was really
treating it as a piece of fiction I
wasn't treating it like a documentary I
never saw myself as a documentary
filmmaker I was just following this
story and it brought me to the summit of
the world and this was a major
breakthrough for me because not only get
it open up the circle of what was
possible in my life it opened me up to
what was possible within the realm of
filmmaking within the realm of
storytelling that suddenly through the
excuse of making a film perhaps we could
do just about anything it'll live any
dream 99 cent dreams took this idea this
theory and applied it to friends of mine
people around me that were inspiring me
and the idea was that I took these eight
characters including myself so seven
characters and ask them all what their
dream was I tried to get to the core of
their dream and then just for the sake
of making a film we made those dreams
come true just for the sake of the
camera and in that kind of manifested
itself for better for worse within the
characters one example is it's not a
year whose dream was to be famous in
Tokyo is that we put put it to me in
this way in an interview i want to be a
pop star in tokyo and just kind of broke
out of him so we brought over there we
put it up on the big screens in Shibuya
square and people were going up there
and asking for autographs and that sort
of thing my own dream was the time
travel this brought me to the South Pole
to the North Pole where all timelines
meet so it was really always taking
these metaphors and bringing them within
a very real context and again this whole
idea of the medium is life for me was
really being developed you know where I
was seeing that obviously we weren't
following a script in this case we're
really just following those dreams and
seeing where they would bring us and in
just about every case i can say that the
no matter what they
even in the case of time travel or
something like that I could say that in
my own way through the making of this
film re-editing the past and also
finding myself in the present space
where there is no time that I had some
form of time travel experience I guess
which brings me to the future now the
expedition for the future truly is a
transmedia project it will take us from
Cape Horn in South America the end of
the world essentially or the end of
exploration to the Cape of Good Hope
which is in South Africa so the
beginning of civilization this
opportunity came to me I'll tell you a
little bit how it came about it again
really understand where I'm coming from
because it is an urgent matter I've been
meaning to do a project about 2012 for
for a few years now just because I find
it so interesting this idea at the end
of the world that's in the zeitgeist
right now I've been interviewing people
the past few months about what their
vision is of the future what where they
think things are going and so on and
it's incredibly fatalistic the kinds of
it answers I've been getting and this is
from all ages you know from all walks of
life basically people in politics and
education in creative industries as well
people seem to have this idea that
whether it's this year or in the next
few there's not much of a future for
Humanity this is reinforced I think this
year with obviously the whole Mayan
prophecies it creates an opportunity
because it's a design geist but what I
see it is we may just be manifesting
this end of the world as we know it
anyway if it truly is the end of a great
cycle and the beginning of a new one
then it's a great opportunity for us to
look toward the future so how do we have
this reflection my father
a few months ago 3-4 months ago comes to
me with the idea of going to bouvet
island the reason being that he is
visiting all of the World Heritage Sites
this is a personal project of his but
when he mentioned bouvet island first
line that I never heard of it bouvet
island is the most remote place on earth
in other words it's the furthest you can
be from any other human being without
leaving the planet so it's a very
special place fewer people have been on
avait Island than the moon so where this
is real exploration territory but in
this case I was just like why why go
there of all places you know like why
don't we just leave this one alone you
know it's a lot of energy a lot of
resources to get the displace we managed
it to to create a trip by adding you
know fuel capacity on the boat and so on
that could go from Cape Horn to cape of
good hope I have this kind of vision
this is probably the best opportunity
I've ever had to have a global impact of
some kind this this trip is big enough
you know that and in a time as well
that's that's just right to go from the
end of civil as a from the era of
exploration to the beginning of
civilization in 2012 I thought there's
an opportunity here so the next day I
offered to take on and charter the boat
myself and invite people onto the trip
that could create with me a collective
vision of the future so that's the
expedition for the future before we go
and while we're we're out there I want
to be collecting visions of the future I
want to hear from people what they see
as it as a destination for Humanity and
that's the whole idea here I want to I
want to be arriving at Cape of Good Hope
and I as we just see the coast I want to
have that vision in my mind it's about
collecting those visions collecting
those ideas
and bringing them onto bouvet island
we're going to leave a time capsule
there to be open some hundred years in
the future it's really about the
exercise and putting this up online for
people to take apart it quickly i'm just
going to take you through the trip we're
leaving from australia as as you can see
we're going to be stopping we have these
long legs out at sea sometimes five days
sometimes as long as seven days so that
those are really going to be like
creative part of our creative processes
out at sea and then when we're visiting
islands were able to either be shooting
or are really just concentrating on the
incredible places we're seeing here in
south georgia south sandwich islands
then some six days at sea until bouvet
this is this is an eleven thousand mile
journey and if we have enough fuel by
then we're going to visit Kirk Whalen
otherwise we're gonna go through Prince
Edward frozr Capello finally our longest
stretch to complete our map of the
future all the way to Cape Town we're
going to once we go to pave we're going
to bringing a guide along to help us
climb to the summit of the island this
has never been done before so once again
we're in real exploration territory here
so it would be fantastic for us to bring
the street view camera along and do
something from the island itself during
our trip people can communicate with us
through google plus so i'm doing it
every way that i can on the personal
level obviously a soul idea of
projecting into the future is really a
personal need that i have with a second
child come
figured that if we're going out there
let's really have this reflection with
the right people on board so even on
that level if you figure it's a quest
all of this you know it's not just the I
told you about the whole career sign you
know and it's then there's this whole
other side that's that's where life and
work kind of mix together and become
this one question this one life so it
comes back to my first point the medium
is life and so you are part of that to
medium and hopefully you'll go get
involved in the expedition as well I
