I'm the webmaster for KCRW com Casey
adobe com is the website for the public
radio station KCRW we call ourselves
kcrw calm because KCRW org is a little
bit difficult for some of our on-air
people to say so it's smoother to say
kcrw calm and hence we are that even
though we are a public radio station
today I'm going to talk to you a little
bit about podcasting and the origins of
KCRW's podcasting efforts and where
we've been and where we're going and
begin we start podcasting a March 21st
2005 we were not the first people to
podcast but we were the largest single
organization to put out podcasts we
started with 22 programs three of which
were daily podcasts the rest were weekly
podcasts arranged in time from four
minutes to 60 minutes initially we
started out encoding them at 48 k mp3
mono files the reasons we did all this
were to expand the reach of kcrw
programs to stay on the technological
cutting edge to create new avenues
fundraising and we thought we could do
all this with minimal cost using our
existing infrastructure both in terms of
hardware and people power at the station
we met basically our first goal we did
expand the reach of kcrw podcasting
initially even before iTunes came along
it was kind of taking off a little bit
amongst the technologically fluent
people and they were constantly looking
for new content and we became known for
for our podcast sins we start getting
mentioned in newspaper articles and
magazine articles as a podcaster we
achieved our second goal we stayed on
the technological cutting edge
because we were the largest podcaster
people came to us and asked how did to
do it what do you do what kind of
programs use to edit audio what kind of
programs you use to serve your audio and
we thought that we could potentially use
this as a way to make money though
initially podcasting was not that big
and we did a chief our last goal we did
all this on our existing Hardware
existing Apache web server we have the
files look located there and it seemed
to be going along smoothly and great and
then Along Came iTunes and with iTunes
that was huge for us APPL or Steve Jobs
used our treatment program which is a
kind of a Hollywood talk show as an
example in a talk he gave at a
developer's conference and after that
just that brief little mention even
before itunes was podcasting
subscriptions to the treatment went up
tenfold then iTunes launched they
featured us as one of their initial
podcasts they created a very nice page
for us that we supplied the graphics too
but they laid it out they listed us as a
banner on their podcasting page and we
had a very successful and at the same
time unexpected thing happened to us we
went from having just a nice kind of
peeking at around a 40 megabit per day
traffic to our website coming down to
around 15 or so during the weekend the
Monday was a normal day and then Tuesday
iTunes happen and we more than doubled
our bandwidth coming out of our sight
not our station we crashed our server we
had to set up another server very
quickly to put move all of our podcasts
on to segment it from traffic going to
our regular website it was crazy and
crazily successful to
and as a result of that we grew our
audience beyond our wildest dreams with
itunes we achieved over 100,000
downloads on our first day and over
300,000 downloads in the first week
bandwidth usage wins for the roof we
added additional mp3 servers and because
we were the people that were listed on
the front page because we had the
promotion we were featured in all the
press articles you know iTunes launches
featuring ESPN ABC and kcrw so it raised
our profile around august 2005 initially
all of our podcasts were talk shows that
we produced ourselves that we held all
the rights to and that the host of the
shows all agreed that you know it's fine
we can podcast it no problems nobody's
concerned about rights or their image we
were a little bit scared at first to get
into the music podcast area you know
what do we do about bands what do we do
about labels who's conscious of image do
everybody's kind of a little bit crazy
about offering a download of their
content of their music so we tiptoed
into this with a few bands in our
initial band that or the initial bands
that we did the podcasting with were
unsigned unknown bands and as a result
of the podcasts that they featured on
our site through iTunes downloads and
purchases of their music on their
websites went through the roof so they
had kind of a side effect of our success
in promoting their bands and we set up a
rule that still exists today that we
post downloadable podcasts of live
performances these are 40 minute long
podcasts that feature about 8 to 10
songs and an interview in between sets
of the songs
for about two weeks and it for the
longest time it was always listed in the
top 100 new subscribed podcasts on the
iTunes Top 100 page and occasionally
we're still in there as well whenever we
have a new artist or a band that is of
note in January of 2006 we started do
video podcasts for the last five four
years the station has been video in
bands that come into the station about
two years ago we upgraded our video
system so that we have a system of for
remote control cameras that one person
maintains and mixes and we've put all
this stuff together for under ten
thousand dollars and was great until the
camera started breaking and we ran into
replacement costs problems but these
videos are we're just sitting on our
site streaming in real audio but we had
the tapes of them so we we started going
back and in Korea encoding videos and
making podcasts out of the podcasts were
in the m4v format or h.264 codec that
quicktime puts out and initially initial
launch of it we had 7th over 7,000
downloads in january this presentation
was made in February so it was done in
the the about the second week of
February's so two weeks into februari we
had 700,000 that month rounded out at
about 12,000 so not quite doubling the
first month of video podcast now we're
in a phase where we are putting maybe
two or three videos up about every
couple weeks maybe more it's slowed the
pace of updating that the videos has
slowed down because bands have tightened
up a little bit not as many bands are
allowing us to do a video download of
their performance again people
our bands are or more importantly labels
are a little bit image content conscious
we think but still we're averaging over
7,000 over nearly 10,000 downloads a
month for video content so many podcasts
so little time podcast take a lot of
time to make from a production
standpoint I have a staff of four people
that work along with me two of which are
audio editors one is a video editor and
one's a content editor that produced the
case sort of a website we upload
anywhere from 10 to 12 hours of audio to
the site every day and we also produce
videos whenever there's a band in the
studio we upload that as a streaming
content and sometimes as a podcast we
produce audio in multiple formats
everything from real audio to Windows
Media it's a quicktime to mp3 or the m4v
for video and we do all this with our
small little staff and we have different
programs to help us do all this but it
ultimately takes a lot of our day just
editing mixing the final audio for the
website we upload it so this this
process needed some fixing it in order
for us to maintain doing it we needed to
come up with some sort of automated way
of putting on a bumper adding a little
trailer adding a little underwriting
credit to go with the the podcasts so we
worked with a group of programmers from
WNYC in New York City and came up with a
really simple tool a web-based tool that
will take a an ad and a bumper and maybe
a trailer file and automatically
assemble these two
a source raw file of audio and do this
on a scheduled way where we can make a
change on a spur of the moment
practically and Riaan code or recombine
all of our mp3 files with new ads or new
underwriting bumpers or new trailers on
the end this works for the most part and
in is great because it takes away that
step of the editing process of chain of
adding a bumper especially for the
podcast when we edit the files so we're
still using that system and for the most
part it's working it has the little few
little hiccups right now I believe it's
cutting the trailer off but no it's a
software development as you all know is
a ongoing process and we are right there
with everybody so making podcasts pay
our initial sponsorship was for a I
believe a six-month period for a hundred
thousand dollars by Lexus and it was to
put a just a very simple message in the
beginning of the podcast case your
double you'd pop podcasts are supported
by Lexus that was about it and for that
they were on all of our podcasts that
would that win out they got huge
promotion because we had thousands and
thousands of downloads through itunes
through people that were all across the
country and that ad helped us to get a
new host for our podcasts the bandwidth
costs for for doing this are enormous we
were putting out over a hundred mega but
megabits daily in our megabit speak
daily for podcast traffic so we needed
to find somebody some way of either
advertising supported or somebody to
host these these files and our friends
over at AOL actually came to our rescue
and they agreed to
most our podcasts in exchange for
putting an AOL message on the the front
of the podcasts and so now our podcast
files are actually hosted through AOL
distributed through alchemy and we have
a system that automatically uploads it
from our server over to the AOL server
and life is fairly good they've come up
with a system that manages our at the
distribution fairly nicely so we'll ask
the bringing podcasters back so kcrw
calm is a website it's a web identity of
the radio station and as this podcasting
phenomena took off much of it happened
through itunes some of it happened
through yahoo some of it happened
through the various different podcasting
portals some of it happened through our
own website but the majority of the
people that get our podcasts come
through our outside sources outside of
our own website so there's this
challenge as the web for a public radio
station d centralizes you know how do we
entice people back what do we do within
a podcast file to get them to check out
our website to find out LG there's a
music podcast that you're watching but
there are thousands of other archived
video and audio performances back on the
home website how do we communicate that
how do we get them to say to type into
their browser outside of iTunes go to kc
owm and we're still struggling with that
issue right now a little bit but one of
the promising things Apple has done they
came up with this kind of an enhanced
AAC format for audio or maybe it's not
enhanced but it's a feature of the AAC
codec but you can put in chapter marks
within the audio and have different
images show up and have different web
links show up so that when you're
listening to
file you can click on it and go to a
website that's being mentioned at a
particular point that might be something
we're going to get more involved in
moving forward in the future we're also
looking into ways of producing our shows
differently at the station to reference
the website to reference to talk about
you know you find pictures you can find
links you can find additional content
you can find a longer version of this
show or this interview at kcrw com so
there's a bit of a paradigm shift that
that is going on in radio NPR is
actually doing a fairly good job of this
right now if you listen to programs like
all things considered in morning edition
after every segment they mentioned their
website they mentioned you know for
enhanced or for more links or to read
the document that they were talking
about or to see pictures of what we're
talking about go to our website we need
to work and do a better job of doing
that through our own programs that we
produce as well and we are constantly in
search of new ideas to keep podcasts
fresh no podcasting has been around now
for approaching almost two years which
seems like a short amount of time if you
look at the scope of the internet and
everything but it's actually a long time
and podcasting is kind of everybody's
doing its part of iTunes it's an
established part of the way people get
content get information and do their
routine but what's the next thing what's
the next podcasting phenomenon what's
the next streaming audio paman on what's
the neck what can we do to keep our
website and our online efforts fresh and
relevant and moving forward so we're
constantly looking out for that and
perhaps what Google is doing and the
efforts you all are undertaking with the
way you search the web with the way you
index things with the relationships you
draw out of of partners in the the world
hopefully there's a possibly a place for
kcrw to be part of that and to allow our
content to be more accessible and more
noticed and in turn have google be more
noticed and more accessible so that's
about it if you have any questions I'd
be happy to my question I was going to
mention that the video is probably going
to get posted as long as Jason and
everyone's okay probably get posted the
video Google so be aware that questions
did you ask so but you mentioned that
you guys started off with 60 something
podcast when you initially started doing
podcast you start it off with 20 shows
20 ships each of those shows had little
starting off with one show that was
podcast and that grew to about a month's
worth of programs so for a weekly show
like to the point or which way la it
would have anywhere from 20 to 30
individual mp3 files that could be
downloaded up at a given time because we
had it on our own servers after about 30
days we'd take it off the server and
would no longer be available for the
podcast that's now it's it's about two
months we even though it's being hosted
by AOL we still have concerns about
consuming their servers and we want to
keep you increase the number of shows
yeah oh yeah well now the busy you guys
now have like about 26 during this whole
time you guys started the Kaiser hmm its
own yes so on top of the morning becomes
eclectic music podcast we also have a
as a music exchange which is features
one band that's talked about between nic
harcourt in LA and steve lamacq in
london at the BBC they talk about an
artist and they did play a song because
we're unsure of the rights that song we
go up about anywhere from 30 to 60
seconds and then fade it out NPR
actually set up an agreement with the
RIAA to allow for public radio to sample
60 seconds of music as opposed to the I
think the traditional is like 15 or 20
seconds that can be sampled online so
we're taking advantage of that we also
have a podcast called today's top tune
which is an entire song by itself no
underwriting attached to it no bumper
it's us a song to download to your iPod
or player or your music collection and
we see that this is kind of a loss
leader we want it to get out to get case
you're being known to get our message
across of we are a source of knowledge
of music and everything and to support
us our message is basically this is this
is not all free it's it's a paid for by
individuals no negotiating the
individual bands and they and their
labels so you
it's a promotional and so the top tune
is supposed to be up there for a day 24
hour period for various technical
reasons and scheduling reasons it's
usually up there for a little bit longer
and they know that but it's it's a
promotional tool a single song by an
artist that's not on the charts yet
available through kcrw gets their name
noticed it gets them noticed and they
they're in itunes already they might as
well type in the name of the band in
itunes and lo and behold they have a
whole album I could buy for nine dollars
99 cents for track we did actually we
were approached a couple of years ago
when Google video was just starting to
put our video into google video and the
reason why we didn't had less to do with
you know is this technically feasible as
it had to do with we just don't have the
time our video is pretty much all
encoded in real video format that's
changed now that now that I have a
full-time video person working on staff
he's been going through and kind of
re-encoding all these adaptive suite or
mini DV tapes we have of the
performances into a big server we have
in two formats that can be exported out
into other video formats when we have
the time so potentially there's there's
a place for KCRW to get involved in in
Google video and maybe it might be I
don't know if it's possible but if you
host the video file in a flash format is
it possible for us to then also feature
that on our site or so
cool so probably he probably also upload
the audio you might have to make a date
you know
yes what trailers
I think about car on the car you have in
the front of the car you have a front
bumper it's in in the audio the bumper
is the thing at the front the trailer is
the thing at the back the audio source
that goes on the end so in the bumper of
an audio file we might have KCRW's
promotion nil this is podcasters
produced by kcrw and featuring thousands
of hours of audio at kcrw com supported
by Lexus and here's AOL and the these
before we had our little assembly
program we were using our audio editing
software to paste these in together and
saving off a new mp3 file that contained
all these things inclusive and that just
took too long to do so we created an
automated system to put those things
together as a rule of thumb I mean you
guys have it is there a reason that you
don't actually overlap any of the
broadcast with with these trailers I
mean are they is there any overlap
between the audio of whatever you
recorded the song and then the bumper or
the trailer you know right now ya know
we kind of keep everything segmented so
that is it isn't like musicians don't
want you you don't talk
yeah I'm sure if we wanted to we could
have fate / or prostate to make it kind
of a watermark so it's people yeah
that's kind of what I was saying is a
lot like maybe maybe maybe musicians
would have allow you to post their
content longer if they knew you know at
the last 10 seconds there was kind of
you know big heart corn comes in and
here is thing about our relationship
with musicians and labels is that
there's not a lot of dialogue about what
goes on the website you know there's an
understanding and there's something that
they read and agree to but for as far as
I know they probably wouldn't care what
we did with it as far as it was
presented in a positive light and was
promoting their artists or the mayor
yeah I hope cross my fingers I hadn't
all few weeks ago from
Sony in New York I wanting to know about
our top tune podcast and they're looking
at it and going they say it's only 24
hours but I see three podcasts here what
how do you explain that it's like well
you know we promote it for a day and it
was kind of I hope that that didn't sour
their relationship with us that you know
is we are what we are we're a very our
general manager booth see more talks
about when we do pledge drives talks
about we're a little public radio
station in the basement of a cafeteria
building at a community college we
really are a small entity that produces
these huge things and what we're doing
the best we can and we're not at Google
we're not a big company that has all
these resources all around you so we're
constantly scraping to get by in to do
the best we can yes as far as our even
viewing on on the website itself
music versus talk shows what's the
breakdown is it more talk music folks
downloading music now than ever said
because it sounds like they mean you
initially started off in just our number
one podcast is michelle harry shearer
stuff yeah is that music shop or a
tzaddik option wish she wouldn't
actually do my kind of show things
happened and actually for rights reasons
we do have to have to edit his show and
take out some songs that he doesn't have
permission to or or in the podcast trim
them down to a few seconds of sample and
so is podcast is often around 43 minutes
44 minutes long whereas this show is an
hour long which pry your friends who
don't like the music should download the
podcast piece of number one podcast one
becomes eclectic is often number two in
terms of number of downloads number
three is an hour-long news program
called to the point and it's a big
podcast file it's a daily podcast and we
get thousands and thousands and
thousands of people downloading that
show and whenever it's late we get
thousands and thousands of emails saying
what happened to to the point and
there's some guy in Florida that that's
just on it every day it's like it's two
o'clock it's not here yet where is it
I'm trapped by hurricanes I can't this
is my only connection to the outside
world is this show where is my podcast
so we definitely have a caring audience
and and people that we try to be
beholden to because you're your audience
is brought in considerably in the last
couple years and you guys altered your
program
do you really when you look at your new
programming ideas as as far as what you
might be able to do more national I mean
are you doing we have a lot of we are to
the points a national program carried in
major cities across the country left
right and center is a four-way show
talking from all points political view
about the major issues of the day it's a
weekly show we have entertainment shows
the business and the treatment that are
nationally distributed we have a book
show bookworm which is nationally
distributed carried on other radio
stations I'm leaving something out what
else is that it what oh let's try and
listen Harry Shearer is anywhere
probable
so you know we do have the advantage of
having a voice outside of the Internet
to promote the internet and without that
voice I think we wouldn't be as large as
we are new programming ideas that you
guys are floating that this national
audience that you have was that way more
heavily no decisions on the portion is
actually we had a nice extreme going
that that was featuring live music
whenever we were playing it on air and
then kind of rebroadcast so the previous
evenings shows during times when we
didn't have music playing on our
simulcast and addressing that very point
of you know what more can we do to
address a national or global audience we
chucked out that that format of music
stream and replaced it with each shows a
two-hour produced show of Morning
Becomes eclectic of metropolis of
Nocturna of cafe la of all of our main
music shows in and we made a stream
that's comprised of these two hours
shows making up an eight-hour segment
that's repeated three times a day and
each of those shows is available for
syndication now morning becomes eclectic
is going to be heard in Alaska and the
Alaska will have the best public radio
north of of continental United States it
there I the idea that was the exact idea
we had we have a person trying to market
all of these shows to other radio
stations and also to other streams as
well other internet radio stations so if
there's an internet stream that's
looking for content they can get KCRW's
program and on a regular basis and we
distribute it via the internet so the
stations can download the sound files
and then play them as they they wish and
we have playlists that go along with
everything
they can keep valid app up-to-date
connections come from outside the United
States let's um
it's probably around thirty percent come
from outside the US or from 34 outside
the US / unknown the it's there's a very
long interesting graph I don't have it
on me right now but it shows the
distance from LA of connections a peak
is in LA and then as you move farther
away it goes down and then it goes down
as if you look at think about the
continental United States west coast
east go so middle the country it's down
a little bit there's a little spike in
Kansas and and and then it gets to the
east coasting it has another peak of
traffic we have a lot of people on the
East Coast that come to our website and
then the tail goes off and in that tail
outside of the united states that goes
way down are all the connections outs
overseas or more than the distance to
New York outside of LA and it's it's
stunning to see the reach of KCRW and
and where people are getting us if it
would plot a graph of all our IP
connections around the world it makes a
map of the world and if plowed Napa the
Google's IP connections around the world
that probably you know makes mountains
around the world at least we get the
outlines of contents
changes his aliens different people
often it new posts come from Maine
guests or come from ideas that that are
generated in house that come to fruition
and a host is found for those shows
sometimes people send in tapes and CDs
and I have this great idea and this
would be perfect and if Ruth is in the
open mood she might listen to it and and
who knows we had a show that was pitched
to us called final curtain last year it
was a obituary show for the for the
radio it was a really interesting idea
and a really interesting show but it
became a monthly show and the resource
was involved to produce this one monthly
show were so big because you're
researching people you're producing
sound bits and trying to gather sound
clips of a person's life to put in there
that it was just not practical for us to
maintain producing it so it eventually
got can but it was an interesting show
for about a year there are other shows
that that grew out of pitches the
business is a new I new show that we it
was co-developed by Variety magazine one
of the editors a variety you know
they're in the business they're
connected and one of the producers at
the station and they put together this
show and it's a hit show it it's being
syndicated syndicated nationally and
picked up even got picked up by NPR as a
distributor which is a huge honor for to
have them you know featuring one of our
shows so there are different ways but it
doesn't happen very often
maybe else if they're not thank you very
much for coming out and thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
