rector of a group called link Liberty in
North Korea and I'd like to thank
everyone for taking the time out of your
days to come join us for a little bit
and also for Google for graciously
hosting this talk I'm here to speak with
you about a I guess a cause that we work
on it's called essentially it's the
North Korean Human Rights crisis and I
did speak here at Google in fact in this
very room last year in June of 2007 and
since then as far as the issue itself is
gone nothing has changed I can say
equipment unequivocally that as far as
the number of people that are suffering
as far as the crisis goes in the depth
of what is happening whether it's in
China or North Korea nothing really has
changed and in a way it's become a fact
of life for the people that work on this
issue and also for the people that
suffer as a result of this crisis but I
also think that the fact that progress
is not happening the fact that
fundamentally the issue continues to
live on the way it is means that we have
to take more actions to stop it and so
today we wanted to come by and share
with you some of our work and some of
the issue itself and also introduce you
to a special guest of ours mr. Shin who
is the main speaker for today but before
we go into that I'm going to share a
little bit about the issue as a whole
and give you a bit of background or
context for I guess mr. shins
experiences North Korea today is
possibly the last communist or
totalitarian country left in the world a
lot of isms and government systems that
we write about in high school or college
have largely become extinct but North
Korea has steadfastly and stubbornly
held on to a lot of relics of the past
the country has about 24 million people
and in the 1990s an estimated two to
three million North Koreans died of
starvation which is one of the most
painful ways to die as a human being two
to three million North Koreans it's
about one tenth of the population starve
to death without getting into human
rights without getting into political
religious freedoms just talking about
health the country is that a
unbelievably stunted and handicapped
state when it comes to public health
when it comes to nutrition when it comes
to rates of malnutrition and non
nourishment large proportions of the
population do not gate get daily food
all rations of food in fact as of last
week NGOs reported that this fall
most likely 200 to 300 thousand North
Koreans would starve to death we would
lose 200 to 300 thousand people from a
resurgent famine I cannot comprehend
what 200 or 300 thousand people looks
like the most I could think of is 1
football stadiums worth of people that's
all I could think of to me these numbers
are very staggering and difficult to
grasp and understand but at the end of
the day maybe the statistics don't
really matter and the fact that is most
relevant to us is that people are
suffering and dying when they don't need
to diseases like tuberculosis scarlet
fever even the common cold spread
throughout the North Korean countryside
and because their immune systems are so
weak from not having daily food and
nourishment many people die of these
diseases some diseases that you can get
over in a day or two asleep here in the
United States people die of in North
Korea moving beyond that the education
system is at a very very low level many
children and young adults spend most of
their time learning about the government
and the leader what Kim Jong Il used to
do as a child anecdotes and stories
about how he is a brilliant man and
brilliant campaigner and artist and
writer and musician and very little
attention is really spent on information
that actually is relevant for many North
Korean people and it's it's a system
built to keep these people in
subservience to the country most North
Korean children especially of this
generation of our generation are
physically stunted if you meet a North
Korean if any of you have ever had the
luxury of meeting in North Korean
whether they're diplomat or an athlete
or a refugee they're usually very small
and very frail if they're a survivor of
a concentration camp they usually have
telltale signs of forced labor as a
child arms that are disproportionately
long a slight limp or a slight bend
towards one direction and you'll
recognize that in mr. shin when you meet
him in the few minutes children that do
not get regular food do not suffer just
from physical stunting they are not just
a foot or a foot and a half shorter than
their average peers anywhere else they
also suffer from permanent brain damage
if you do not get regular nourishment
from the ages of zero to maybe five
crucial critical formative years for
life you will have
permanent mental stunting it's something
that you cannot recover from an entire
generation of North Korean people have
been lost to this and they're lost
generation in a lot of ways and the
world is largely not noticed and we
began this work because we found it
shocking that this kind of suffering on
this scale could happen in the world and
nobody would pay attention and the world
would continue to move and we would
continue to go about our days without
changing any of our habits or changing
anything at all that's just the health
situation beyond that once we get into
the spectrum of freedoms and civil
liberties every single freedom every
single one that we understand and
appreciate here in this room or in this
country or pretty much anywhere else in
the Western world does not exist in
North Korea freedoms of religion of
speech I mean freedoms of religion of
speech assembly of movement of dissent
the right to complain that the ration
was not enough the right to complain
about the leader or the government the
right to go to the town next door to
visit your aunt or uncle in North Korea
you cannot leave your hometown without a
government permit you cannot go and and
sell goods that you have on the market
without permission from the government
black market essentially a black market
has been created and the soldiers
continue to clamp down on it when people
are essentially selling food to survive
because they're starving to death all
radios and televisions in North Korea
are built just to accept government
frequencies and if you alter your radio
or television to accept other
frequencies say Voice of America Radio
Free Asia or broadcast from Japan China
Russia South Korea or even the United
States you will be sent to prison
and so following along that know North
Korea has developed an extensive system
of concentration camps throughout the
country a network of camps that has
several different tiers the worst tier
is called the total control zone which
mr. Shin is the only known survivor of
beyond that there are several other
tiers of forced labor and reeducation
camps we have satellite imagery of these
camps we know the exact locations of
every single one of them we know which
buildings are used for ration
distribution or for the military
barracks or for the public executions we
know where the barbed wire runs we know
what the hours of the guard
routes are and who runs each camp we
know everything about these camps and
nothing has been done
so in these camps today an estimated
quarter million North Koreans live and
die in this system of political prison
camps the kind of crimes that have been
committed for these people to enter
these camps range from folding a
newspaper so that the crease fell on a
picture of Kim juniors face - sitting on
a picture of the Dear Leader - not
wearing a red pin if any of you have
seen pictures or photo galleries of
North Korea and life in North Korea
every North Korean has a red pin on
their left label and that image has
either a picture of Kim Yuna song the
former leader Kim Jong another current
leader his son if you do not have that
you're not being sufficiently patriotic
or sufficiently dedicated to the
socialist paradise and communist
revolution and essentially you'll be
dealt with accordingly most of the
people in these political prison camps
have no idea why they're there and North
Korea also pursues a policy that
punishes three generations of people for
every crime committed in other words if
I commit a crime my children and
grandchildren will also be sent to these
camps my father and mother my uncle my
cousins anybody in my direct relation
will be punished for what I've done so
if you've lived in North Korea if you
were raised in that country if you are
not among the political and military
elites that have the luxury to get food
and and in fact iPods and Mercedes
Benzes evidently and Hennessy and
Rolexes if you're not among the party
elite you're probably not going to be
entirely too happy and many North
Koreans have manifested that desire for
freedom or food by leaving it's
estimated that a quarter to half a
million North Koreans have left North
Korea across the border into China over
the last decade there are tens of
thousands of North Koreans right now in
the streets in this country and the fact
of the matter is they're refugees North
Korea is law their very Constitution and
national security laws say if you leave
the country without permission you will
be committing treason and you're
punishable it's punishable by death it's
a capital crime if you leave the country
without permission because you wanted
food your uncle went ahead your family
left and you're catching up with them or
even because you got drunk and stumbled
across the border you left the country
without permission from the Dear Leader
and the punishment can go up to death
and most refugees that get cotton sent
back to North Korea are severely
tortured and interrogated pregnant women
have babies forcibly aborted
children are often sold into the black
market and in worst case scenarios
especially if you met with a South
Korean or an American or a westerner or
became a Christian for example or went
to an underground church you will be
sent to a concentration camp and in many
cases you will be publicly executed
North Korea is one of the few countries
remaining in the world that holds public
executions where they bring out the
entire village in town to watch in fact
two months ago there was an execution of
three individuals in North Korea where a
hundred fifty thousand villagers all
came out and were forced to watch what
had happened they were shot at the stake
and their crime was having attempted to
leave to China that was their only crime
the Chinese government has captured and
repatriated North Korean refugees by the
thousands every month for the last 10 15
years I myself and several of my
colleagues were arrested in China about
a year and a half ago for just
protecting refugees for giving them food
and shelter and just trying to get them
to safety the Chinese government
criminalized this act in violation of
international law as they seem to do
everywhere else and essentially sends
his refugees back to their deaths
knowing exactly what happens until I
went to prison I assumed that maybe the
authorities were not completely aware of
what North Korea does to them I assumed
that maybe it was a top-down initiative
from Beijing and their government and
they were just ordering the locals to
comply and that the locals maybe did not
know exactly what they were doing but I
spent a lot of time in interrogation and
a lot of time speaking with Chinese
officials and guards and and foreign
ministry officials and they all know
exactly what happens in North Koreans
when they're sent back to that country
they're tortured they're put in
concentration camps without executed so
what I've come here to share with you is
that we have on our hands
possibly the worst humanitarian crisis
in the 21st century and there are a lot
of crises that demand our attention
rightfully so and this week in
particular Burma is having a significant
amount of issues we've had crises in
Darfur for the last five years we've
called it a genocide for five years and
we still have not done anything but
North Korea is unique in a lot of ways
and the the greatest distinction I can
make with North Korea is that the scale
of human suffering and the amount of
energy and effort that has gone into
perpetuating the system far surpasses
anything else this is
people dying of machetes or mob violence
this is not a natural disaster or crisis
where people are fischels are negligent
of responding and therefore causing
suffering this is not a natural-born
famine that is spreading throughout the
country and the government just doesn't
want to intervene so won't there's not a
situation where you have rival feudal
lords fighting over natural resources or
even a civil war the North Korean
government has gone through the effort
and spent the money and resources to
build concentration camps it takes a lot
of energy to build these places one of
these camps is four hundred square miles
four hundred square miles in size the
camp that mr. Shin was born and raised
in he spent twenty four years of his
life in this camp had 40,000 inmates
40,000 inmates the amount of energy and
the amount of thought and preparation
that the North Korean government has
spent on this system I think is not just
indicative of the culture and mentality
that the government has but indicative
of a human rights violation or crimes
against humanity is that that far
surpasses anything else that demands an
answer from humanity and I'll be honest
with you over the last four years of
doing this work I'm not exactly
optimistic about the United Nations or
the US government or the powers that be
but I remain optimistic about the
potential of the grassroots and the
potential of individuals like yourself
to do something about this crisis the
only lives that we've been able to say
for the last four years have been saved
as a result of average people common
individuals around the world getting
together and doing something and we have
been able to save lives and so
essentially we're here not just to share
our stories and to share mr. shins
experiences but also to ask for help and
so I'll share one a story with you
before mr. Shin comes up the story of
the Good Samaritan which many of us have
learned whether off hand or going to
church or it's just culturally we are
aware of these things I was told by I
guess Jesus in the Bible and he talks
about this guy that was beaten on the
side of a road and left for dead and a
priest walks by and ignores him a Levite
walks biting Noren and later on this
third guy who was a Samaritan who at the
time was not exactly socially popular
stops helps this guy gets him up takes
him to and then make sure he's taken
care of
and essentially pays for his Karen liens
and the whole moral of that story is
that everybody is your neighbor you
should care about your neighbors and
even this guy who was not exactly a
social celebrity who was not well-liked
during the time stopped to help him
while much better a higher profile
people with more resources did not the
moral of that story is like as I said
just that we should all look out for one
another and do what we can
dr. Martin Luther King jr. shared this
story in one of his speeches but told it
a little bit differently he said that
maybe the priest was on his way to a
sermon and the whole choir was waiting
and he had his robes on and he thought
if I stopped to help this guy not only
am I going to be late to service but I'm
going to get my robes dirty and he
calculated that it's in his best
interest not to help him and maybe the
next guy the Levite stopped by and
thought maybe this guy was tricking
someone he's pretending to be dead he's
pretending to be heard so there if I
stopped to help him we can attack me and
take my money and he moved on and both
of those men asked themselves a very
important question that I think
consciously or subconsciously every one
of us in this earth including myself ask
ourselves every day maybe even several
times a day and the question is if I do
not stop - if I if I stop to help this
man what will happen to me right we
asked ourselves that question every day
whether it's with homeless people on the
street or things we read in the news if
I stopped to help this man if I do
something about this situation what will
happen to me to my health to my finances
to my abilities to my resources but the
question that the Samaritan asked was
different it was fundamentally flipped
and he said if I do not stop to help
this man what will happen to him
it's a subtle distinction but I think it
means everything in the world and I
would ask you as you watch this footage
as you listen to mr. sheean story to ask
yourselves that question and I think I
fundamentally believe that if more of us
are enough of us start to care about
this issue and do whatever we can for
this that we will make a big difference
and so mr. Shin who will now come up
with his translator was born in 1982 in
concentration camp number 14 and Quechan
North Korea it's one of five total
control zones that we know of his camp
as I mentioned earlier has 40,000
inmates
and he's winning some terrible things
because his camp was the kind of camp
where no one was meant to ever leave he
was not even taught basic North Korean
propaganda which every other North
Korean knows by heart what year kim
jeong-hoon was born what his favorite
songs are different speeches that the
great and Dear Leader's had given
throughout their lives they know there's
propaganda by heart by instinct but mr.
Shin doesn't know any of it because he
was considered basically a dead man
walking he would bow he was born in this
camp and he would die in this camp and
there was no reason to even bother
teaching him any of this propaganda
mr. shins first contact with the outside
world came at the age of 24 when he
managed to escape from the North Korean
concentration camp he did not escape for
political freedom he did not escape
because it strongly held views and
liberty and justice he escaped because
he was tired of being beaten and he
decided that he didn't want to starve
anymore and everyone has asked him what
his biggest impression and shock was of
the outside world and they all asked him
what have you thought about South Korea
what have you thought about America and
he said American South Korea were great
but the biggest shock for him was the
day after he left this North Korean
concentration camp he says he went to
the North Korean countryside he saw
people walking around in different color
clothing buying food as they wanted and
moving as they wished and that time was
freedom for the first time he recognized
what freedom was that's where mr. Shin
comes from what they had to wear the
same clothes every day he went to the
Holocaust Museum in Washington DC last
week he pointed out the uniform that the
inmates and now shoots in Dachau it to
wear and he said we had toured the same
thing he has scars around his ankles
from shackles when he had to walk half a
foot at a time doing forced labor he has
scars along his back and his torso from
when he was tortured after his mother
and brother tried to escape from the
camp they were publicly executed as a
result and he has a lot of remnant
remnants of his time in this camp but
he's taken it upon himself to use what's
remaining of his life to to fight for
this cause and spread awareness and so
mr. Shin will now be joined by Michael
yang who was generously offered to help
us translate our original translator was
not able to make it and we're going to
first show a short video clip of his
story and that's because it's very
emotionally draining and difficult for
mr. Shin to keep talking about in
graphic detail how his mother was
publicly executed at what you know he
saw in this camp
and afterwards mr. Shin will share a
little bit and we'll have to some time
for questions the footage you're about
to see before mr. Chan's interview we'll
start with some footage of refugees in
China attempting to find sanctuary as
well of North Koreans inside North Korea
as well this is all footage from from
just one or two or three years ago it's
all very new and the biggest thing I
want to stress again is that this is not
a history lesson this is happening right
now and nobody is really doing anything
about this so we'll start the video clip

concentration camp there is around the
Taedong River in North Korea
KJ he'll go over there and explain okay
so to the right is the concentration
camp and left is the outside of the
concentration camp
so that's the where the the military
personnel are stationed to to keep the
prisoners from escaping so there is a
number of different lookout posts at
different points to for the North Korean
soldiers to keep an eye out on the
movement movements of all the prisoners
I could only imagine my tummy j22 mom

how they keep all the prisoners inside

Kahneman Johanna narou yo Chris well
modern gdtq Seaton chronologically so I
came to be convict convinced that with
the 13,000 North Koreans who escaped to
South Korea and with with the
participation of different people like
people in this room and other parts of
the world we can overthrow the Kim Jong
Il real government in North Korea and
bring democracy to North Korea
with that we're going to be wrapping up
our session but if anyone has any
additional questions for mr. Sheehan we
will stick around here in the corner for
a little bit longer so you're welcome to
come up and ask us but as far as the
work goes saying that we can do a lot
with your help you know as mr. Shannon
said and as I have said it's not just to
make everyone feel warm and fuzzy and
encouraged I know a lot of times when
you hear about this these problems at
the first at the onset of that it's kind
of overwhelming it's depressing it's
frustrating it's easy to become angry
but it really is true I mean I get phone
calls in the middle of the night to my
cell phone from people out in China or
other countries ask for safety and
protection we get emails from people in
the field and hiding from local police
or authorities asking us to tell them
where to go we have situations where we
need to open up shelters in Asia and we
have link protection officers hiding
refugees in basements and attics all
over Asia where we need to open up a new
location but we simply don't have the
funds and we're not talking millions of
dollars we're talking hundreds and maybe
thousands of dollars so in terms of ways
to help whether it's a funding or
raising awareness or spreading this
Google video out when it gets online
around with your friends and family and
colleagues we need help as much as
possible we need we need a lot of help
with regards to this Google Earth layer
I want to share with you that a very
high-ranking US senator recently when
the South Korean president Lee myung-bak
visited Washington gave him copies of
Google Earth images of the concentration
camps and said Google Earth makes
witnesses of us all the South Korean
president was visibly moved and more and
more of the leadership of the world is
starting to come to grips with the fact
that not only is this real and the
evidence undeniable but that we have an
obligation to protect and responsibility
to protect these individuals so I would
ask of the people here to have the same
convictions that Google Earth makes us
all witnesses that anybody in the world
can log onto their desktop and find the
concentration camp he was born and
raised in in 30 seconds it's a vast
difference from the Holocaust from every
other genocide and and situation of
crimes against humanity that we've seen
in the last hundred years information is
undeniable at this point
and I think the clothes there's a quote
from Albert Camus where he says perhaps
we cannot prevent this world from being
a world in which children are tortured
but we can reduce the number of tortured
children we've come here to Google
because we firmly believe that oh we
don't have any illusions as to the power
of our efforts I don't think we can
change North Korea overnight but we can
change the lives of individuals like mr.
Shin slowly but surely and for those
individuals
it's difference between life and death
literally so if you'd like more
information about our work we encourage
you to go to WWE global urg that's Li n
kg and thank you very much for spending
your time with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
