tech talk number 29 on panoramic
photography today I have the pleasure of
introducing Scott heightened Scott
heightened is a professional
photographer that was there in the
beginning when Apple computer started
doing panoramic photography and
immersive imagery with QuickTime vr
Scott in the subsequent decade or so has
established a number of techniques that
help improve a lot of the quality and
aesthetics of resulting panoramic
photographs and today we have the
opportunity of having him talk about
those techniques he is also in the
process of finishing up a book on
panoramic photography and I'm sure he'll
be talking a little bit about that
there's also a few brochures around for
related kinds of equipment that you
might want to take a look at but without
further ado I'd like to bring up Scott
heightened thank you can and good
morning how many of you here have have
done panoramic photography you're done
vr at all oh good most of you that's
nice good so the rest of you or you just
new to it interested yeah thought it'd
be fun to figure out what's going on it
really is a neat technology i was as Ken
mentioned I had the opportunity to be
one of the firsts at Apple when they
were were putting together quicktime VR
technology and when I first saw it you
know I was gone Wow as a photographer
this is this is you know the next best
thing the since sliced bread so since
then and I was not an apple employee I
was an independent contractor I've been
a photographer for you know years before
that and it just opened up a whole world
of possibilities and as a photographer
this VR technologies sort of expand your
mind and your creativity the areas that
you can go and so I've had a lot of fun
with it
we'll talk first a little bit about the
the visual impact of VRS let me get some
sound here and and how they can work
most you most of us unfortunately are
familiar with VR technology by seeing
home tours you know in real estate sites
and those are probably the lowest
caliber of panoramas out on the market
because they're done quick that I'm done
dirty I've always strived to do
something a little more creative and a
little better than that and to use a
little bit higher quality technologies
as well but when you have a you can have
a static image obviously you know which
which can tell a whole story but having
a panoramic view allows you to see so
much more and to explore more
interactively than you would otherwise
this is actually a panorama done on the
side of Mount Kenya at a high camp in
Africa it was done as a night shot so
these are five minute exposures giving
you star trails and things but I also
like the idea of doing something that
you could get a little more immersed in
so we kept the tripod set up overnight
and some did similar shots at dawn and
look up the wrong direction there and
during daylight so you can have lots of
fun with it you can still explore each
one pan and panning around go back and
forth these are all linked together it's
also used commercially a lot of
companies are now using it for their
facilities brochures or their facilities
promotions so this was was down at
communications company down in San Jose
one of their control rooms of satellite
control room its global star was
actually the phone company it allows you
to see the if I'm panning too fast let
me know some people get kind of sick and
dizzy watching them one day when they
pan by too fast but of course you can
zoom in and you can zoom out in any part
of these
I also liked being able to take viewers
places that they might not normally go
or to show them things that they might
not normally see or may not yet
understand and certainly in this case
this was a NASA wind tunnel down at
Moffett Field was a Mach 3 wind tunnel
had been shut down we spent about three
days lighting it and setting it up but
you know created a very nice image
showing you know the environment and how
it worked again you can zoom in on parts
of it zoom out this was a panoramic done
in one of the NOAA p3 Orion's the
hurricane hunter that they have flying
and I actually got to fly on assignment
with them and did a whole series of
panoramas to do a tour through the plane
while it was going on one of its
missions and you can travel you know
back to other positions and see what's
going on and the rest of the plane keep
traveling backwards looking around go
back forwards
back to the cockpit
sit in the pilot's seat if you want fly
it fun stuff I think underwater in the
Galapagos Galapagos sea lions on a reef
this is a fun shoot that I did with a
mountain travel so back about 10 years
ago we did a whole virtual Galapagos
tour where we were doing live broadcast
every day during this expedition down
there a little bit closer to home this
is a Fitzgerald marine reserve over on
the coast here in San Mateo County and
it's simply a tide pool with the camera
underwater and a relatively shallow tide
pool get to show the environment there
which most people who visit will see
from the surface looking down but
actually putting the camera in the water
is a nice way to show what's going on
under there can also take us to places
that most of us will never go to such as
the side of El Capitan in Yosemite gives
us the opportunity to look around see
what it's really like being up on the
the edge of the cliff like that or the
side of the rock face you can look out
into the valley zoom in zoom back out if
you really want to get nauseous you can
look straight down and see how high you
are
so getting into the technical side of
things when we talk about panoramas were
we're talking about a number of
different dimensions and to understand
this will talk about the horizontal
dimension first which is the field of
view in the X direction we call
panoramas partial panoramas if they're
less than 360 degrees around so if
you're seeing less than a full circle
refer to that as a partial panorama if
you're seeing 360 degrees or more you're
seeing what we call a full panorama and
sometimes you know photographers will
use a greater than 360 degree view in
case you want to show you know something
changing as you pan around I think can
actually did one years ago was it a
Paris subway stairwell yeah where was
2,500 degrees and basically he did a
panorama up the stairs of all the the
the artwork the murals on the wall that
went up this spiral staircase and it was
really it was quite dynamic so you can
you can use these you know the
technology all sorts of fun ways you
just have to be creative with it the
next element is the vertical field of
view and this is where early technology
the early quicktime VR was limited we're
generally limited by the field of view
that our camera's lens can capture in
most instances with with the early
technologies this was restricted to
about a hundred ten degrees maybe a
hundred and twenty degrees because that
physically is as wide as you can design
a camera lens that is corrected has
rectilinear correction in rectilinear
correction means that you're straight
lines stay straight you know it's not a
fisheye warped view or curved view at
all and then these images these
panoramas were projected into virtual
cylinders the cylinder was chosen
because it was it's the easiest
mathematically and the simplest
mathematically to yet to project and to
do all the computations based on what
computers people have available at a
time they were pretty limited relative
to what we have today
so when you're stitching an image or
when you're shooting most panoramas the
the common way to do it is to shoot a
series of still images around in a
circle all 360 degrees you have overlap
in between each one of them then you
stitch each image together matching the
pixel patterns in the overlap area and
you blend it and you create the seamless
panorama so rules for that are you
generally want to have your images
overlap by third to a half you generally
want a pan left to right why is that
it's because we tend in the
english-speaking countries we tend to
read left right most of the early
software was set up to stitch left to
right you can do it the opposite way now
if you're shooting but you're usually
going to have to reverse things as
you're as you're putting your doing your
post production so just get in the habit
of shooting left to right it's it's the
way we read so do it that way you'll
save yourself a lot of headaches later
on you want to keep everything constant
between shots the only thing you want to
change is a direction that you're
shooting that means you want your
exposure to stay the same your white
balance your focal length if you've got
a zoom lens you don't want that to
change and you want your focus to chain
it to stay constant as well because if
they move if they adjust at all you're
going to wind up with stitching errors
you'll have areas your pixel patterns
that may match up physically but the
color is different so you'll see a
visible scene there where the changes
have occurred if you change focus or if
you zoom at all or your camera zooms
because it's on automatic it too will
have problems matching those pixel
patterns throughout the area so set
everything on manual when you're
shooting these stitched images keep them
that way tripods very good idea it is
possible to shoot handheld panoramas
there are some people who do it
extremely well but you really want to
know what you're doing and understand
you know alignments and what's going to
happen in the stitching process later so
generally you want to make sure you have
a tripod set the camera on it you know
align your nodal point and go nodal
point alignment hang on a second we'll
get to in just a minute but this is
going to be a critical element to
shooting stitch pan
Rama successfully so that they stitch
smoothly yes I'm sorry what was question
Ken how did you shoot the spinal
staircase spiral staircase shot when
you're inside a cylindrical space like
that the difference between moving from
the center where the point is and moving
closer is going to be identical to
assume
pretty much identical in that particular
instance if you're pointing radially out
for now I was a little bit off so I a
few stickers but it's just pretty much
yeah the nodal point alignment is not so
critical when all of your subjects are
distant from the camera but as they get
closer you get more of a parallax error
as you pan between them so they're
changing their relative positions in the
viewfinder or on the film film plane so
it's pretty important when you're doing
ultra wide shots that you know have
stuff in the foreground that you need to
keep aligned there are a number of
stitching applications out there some
some very good software ones some of
them that I have listed here the apple
quicktime of your authoring studio is no
longer supported or sold by Apple but
it's still one of the the best stitchers
around it only runs some mac under
classic mode but I still use it fairly
regularly there others like Petey GUI
which is probably the best and the most
reasonably priced one out there in my
experience as well real vis stitcher is
also a good one a bunch of these are
available on both Mac and Windows
platforms so you know try a few of them
a lot them have free downloads that you
can do trial periods on and test them
out for yourself getting back to the
nodal point alignment what is the nodal
point most camera lenses or all camera
lenses I think have its six nodal points
or nodal planes are there any optical
engineers here no it's something like
that and the only one we care about is
what they call the rear nodal point and
that's where you have the light coming
in the lens let's even get my mouse
going here when the light comes in the
lens it gets inverted as it goes through
the lens and is projected onto the film
plane or the digital sensor upside down
it's the point at which that light all
crosses in the center okay the point
within the lens where all that comes
together that's the nodal point and
that's where you want to have the axis
of your camera's rotation aligned over
and that's that's important i'll show
you a little later how that works or why
that's important to do this you
generally need to have a vor pan head
and this allows you not only to put the
camera in a vertical position but to
adjust
the the cameras position relative to
that axis of rotation both in the
forward and sideways directions and
here's what happens when you have nodal
points that are not lined up properly in
this case you won't notice it just
looking at the images unless you're
knowing what to look for you'll see
there's a little handheld radio on the
foreground here in both these pictures
and the radio hasn't moved but it's
relative position to the doorway in the
background has see how there's a small
gap right here and a large gap right
here nothing changed as I was taking the
picture you know the scene remain the
same it's just the nodal point of the
camera was or the lens was off it wasn't
lined up over the axis of rotation so
those two subjects relative to one
another from the cameras viewpoint
change their positions the result is you
get a stitching error over here when you
assemble it you know all the light and
everything looks fine but you see you
get these ghosted images you know you
get ceilings that don't line up properly
here so this is important to do so when
you actually have the lens aligned
properly as you pan you see these this
gap or this relationship between
foreground and distant subjects remains
the same and the stitch works pretty
well so next thing to be concerned about
most of us are shooting digitally these
days particularly for panoramas are our
sensor sizes and how much of the view
were actually capturing with our cameras
for a 35-millimeter film frame and this
is where everything started out you know
we fields of view calculations are
generally done based on a 35-millimeter
film frame size you see the entire frame
that's captured in the film with the
newer cameras and generally the more
expensive professional digital cameras
they have full frame image sensors and
for VR photographers or panoramic
photographers this is a godsend finally
because you get to see that the coverage
of the film set or the
the digital sensor is very similar to
the size of the 35 millimeter film frame
in this case this is a new Nikon d3
which was announced a month or two ago
it would be out next month it has a full
frame or very close to full-frame
digital sensor some of the cannon I
think two of the Canon models currently
have that also and so you capture the
full fields of you if you're using most
SLR digital cameras today they have a
smaller image sensor that crops down so
your fields of view are significantly
reduced and in this case this is the
nikon d2x the d200 most of the Canon
cameras as well so you know you're
really not capturing that that full
scene that you need there so you have to
shoot a lot more images in order to
stitch them together and it causes some
some problems it still works quite well
but you have this is a magnification
factor of about one and a half times so
you're 24 millimeter wide angle lens
effectively becomes 36 millimeter lens
in its focal length yes
right well when you're shooting
panoramas for the most part you're
wanting to get is wide a field of view
as you can okay because you want to be
able to see up you want to be able to
see down usually you know if you're
shooting the Savannah and Africa and all
the animals are off in the distance a
long telephoto would be a great way to
shoot a panorama but generally we're
wanting to see as wide of you as we can
so when your cropping down you know your
film frame or your your digital sensor
is cropping these the effective focal
lengths of these down suddenly all that
money you spend on these ultra wide
lenses you know the 18 millimeters the
15 millimeters and all is just you know
it's not working for me I'm it's like
shooting with a 24 now so that becomes
very restrictive so these new full-frame
sensors have really been there very
welcome for panorama photographers so
anyway you can see that's a pretty
significant loss of the field of view
even on very good cameras otherwise so
we talk about fields of view in both
directions the x-direction the
horizontal or the y direction doesn't
matter whether the cameras turned
horizontally or vertically we still have
you know why is vertical X's is a
horizontal now when we're shooting
panoramas generally we will turn the
camera vertically why that gives us a
greater vertical field of view I can
shoot more shots you know around the
circle instead of every 30 degrees i
might do it every 20 degrees because
I've got the reduced you know the small
side horizontally but I want to be able
to capture that vertical field of view
and to maximize that so I'll turn the
camera on its side or in the portrait
orientation as well this is why if you
have the top shot the top panorama there
is shot with it's a old nikon coolpix
camera doesn't have a very wide lens and
it's shot in vertical orientation I can
see the tops of things like the Golden
Gate Bridge things that might be
important if I shoot horizontally I get
the bottom
because my vertical field of view has
now been reduced to the horizontal
dimension that way there are charts then
a bunch of these there these whoops
these are available on line you know
their calculators I think Ken's got some
of his sight to tell you what the fields
of you are for various lenses you can
put your particular camera in and all
but it just I just show this because it
shows you what your fields of you are
with a wider focal length and the 14 15
and 18 millimeter range you have you
know a pretty broad field of view these
are this chart here is for a 35
millimeter or full frame sensor what
happens so if you go down let's say you
have a 24 millimeter lens down here that
you're using on a 35-millimeter camera
you get a 73 degree vertical field of
view this isn't portrait orientation if
you're using a digital SLR that's got a
smaller sensor on it and you have a 1.5
times magnification factor then your 24
millimeter is essentially becoming a 36
millimeter lens so you've got about 50
degrees of vertical coverage rather than
the 70-plus so and you don't worry about
this this this sort of charts you know
they're available online we actually
have the VR photography site have a
little slight book that includes this
and a bunch of other charts so you can
always look them up this this may become
important with some stitchers because
they will ask you what lens you were
using so they can calibrate the
stitching properly so you want to know
what the equivalent is even if you're
not using you know even if you're not
getting the exact number so it has a
place to start the cylinders are used
this is just to give you an idea when
when Apple first started with QuickTime
vr they use the cylindrical model and
it's very good because it's it's a
simple one to calculate but its limit is
that vertical field of view for
displaying them panoramas as well and as
you can see as the vertical field of
view that it's showing as the high
or the dimension of the angle the
viewing angle the vertical reviewing
angle increases the amount of data that
you have to provide to fill that
cylinder with images increases almost
geometrically in fact as it approaches
180 degrees so you can see straight up
and straight down you reach an infinite
amount of data or an infinite cylinder
size so there that's why other
technologies other projection systems
have been developed since then so how do
you how do you shoot instead you shoot
the series of 12 images in this case
this is done with a 18 millimeter lens
on a Nikon film camera and that's done
with a head this one in particular is a
kite an head that as you can see as it
rotates the lens the nodal point of the
lens remains aligned over the rotation
access and these heads all have that
they can be used on many different
camera and lens combinations because all
of these posts and things slide so you
can adjust yours you know to to fit your
own set up the heads there are a bunch
of different models out there and they
range anywhere from i know i think nodal
nodal ninja has one for a hundred and
something dollars this kite an one is
now an older model but their new one I
think goes for seven or eight hundred
dollars there others that are you know
fifteen hundred dollars or so so there's
broad range and construction of the
designs are all different but again the
important thing is it allows you to do
this to do this nodal point alignment
and to keep everything set while the
camera is in a vertical position it'd be
much easier if it was just horizontal
you wouldn't have to have all these arms
you know sticking out the side and then
once you finish the stitcher actually
takes all of these individual
rectilinear images that don't look like
they match up you know you look at the
edges here but it takes them blends them
warps them and and overlays them so that
they give you
seamless panorama below another option
which is fairly new it's been the last
few years are the parabolic mirror
attachments for your camera lenses these
actually allow you to shoot an entire
360 degree panorama in one shot and
that's very useful when you're doing
scenes that have action in them where
things are moving and you don't want to
have somebody you know jumping here in
the one shot but then they're not you
know they're in the next shot is you pan
to the right which will cause a
stitching error because you can capture
everything at once they're pretty slick
they're a little bit limited in their
their resolution because you're cramming
all this data into one shot yes I'm
sorry in the back yes it has been yeah
and be here had it you know a long time
ago as well I think they had to probably
ten years or so ago so there's been a
lot of work and experimentation in it
this is one I think the 361 has been out
for final four or five years or so but
anyway they create a torus shaped image
or a doughnut-shaped image and then with
the software that comes with it you can
d warp it and get a full frame panorama
next one is to use a cylindrical I'm
sorry a slit scan rotation camera
company like round shot makes these and
it's pretty slick because the camera
actually rotates on a motor and does the
pan and then the records an image
through a slit behind the lens and then
as the cameras panning so too does the
film move so the film moves an identical
speed to the camera pan based on the
projection on the film plane yes
they do they actually have a whole set
of camera models that use film they have
a new one there d3 which is a digital
one and they've made a few digital
models before that as well yes a single
single pixel array sensor yeah very cool
and we'll get in I'll show that a little
later on anyway these work pretty needs
there they're very beautiful Swiss
engineering and Swiss design there's a
little computer below the camera head
there and the really neat thing about
this design is you can put any focal
length lens you want on it and it will
figure out what speed the film needs to
rotate at in order to record sharp
images as well so another option what
you can use so let's get away from the
cylindrical viewpoints or the
cylindrical captures which sorry this is
take a little bit to load so this is a
panorama shops in Washington DC sorry
it's running a little slow there we go
at the Lincoln Memorial and it's a nice
shot you know it gives you a good view
and it probably shows you almost
everything you would want to see but if
you do a cubit you're limited I'm sorry
you're limited on how far up or down you
can pan a cubic version allows you to
look straight up look straight down and
still all the way around as well there
are different ways of capturing these
you can use fisheye lenses you can use
multirow so our panoramic capture with
traditional lenses the two different
projection types that are used or the
spherical projection whereas the images
are projected in a virtual sphere versus
a virtual cube for our purposes we don't
care they look the same to the N viewer
if you're a programmer and you're
designing you know these these displays
yes you do care but the rest of us I
just need to get the full coverage you
know as a photographer vertically and
horizontally these are the difference
the results for the different kinds of
lenses will use for it on the left is an
eight millimeter nikkor which is called
a true fisheye and that's a true fisheye
because the entire image circle is
contained within the film or the digital
sensor frame the sixteen millimeter or
the full-frame fisheye is has a similar
fisheye characteristics of the curved
lines around the edges and the
distortion that way but its image circle
is large enough to fill the entire film
frames and what you do is you lose a
little bit off the edges compared to the
eight millimeter over here you can't see
you know the part that's cropped off by
the edges of the film frame here but
it's still a very valuable lens for for
shooting large field of view panoramas
particularly now that we have stitchers
that can handle fisheye views on the
right is a 15 millimeter rectilinear
lens this is one of nikon's widest think
their current one is a 14 millimeter
their widest rectilinear lands and a
rectilinear lens simply means that the
lines are corrected so that you have
straight lines in real life are
projected on your film plane as straight
lines across where the lights are up top
the vertical lines don't have curves in
them as well and the fields of view are
significantly limited on the rectilinear
lens design another advantage to fisheye
lenses is you don't have so much light
fall-off towards the corners and the
edges these are just an idea of the
fields of you and what you can
accomplish and why I particularly like
the the full-frame fisheye because it
gives me 135 degree vertical field of
view which is enough for most everything
that you shoot except for the Sistine
Chapel or looking over the edge of a
cliff I don't feel limited when I'm
doing that like I do with a 15
millimeter or a 14 millimeter in most
environments like if you come into this
room you look around and you see it well
if I'm going to shoot a panorama do I
really care about the ceiling you know
I've got
you know various ductwork or I've got
acoustical tiles or whatever that's not
terribly interesting the carpet on the
floor is not terribly interesting either
so you don't always need a full
spherical view and so you choose your
tools accordingly this is the model that
I pics or internet pictures originally
had claimed as theirs where you shoot
with 28 millimeter or true fisheye
images opposing hemispheres and then you
will but them together and display them
as the entire spherical panorama around
you another way to do it excuse me to
capture these spherical images is to use
the the scanning digital cameras and the
scanning digital cameras have the
advantage of as we were talking about
earlier of having a single pixel wide
sensor so there are only capturing the
images at 1 1 pixel row at a time or
column at a time this allows them to use
fisheye lenses on there so you can with
a scanning digital camera you can
capture a full 180 degree vertically by
360 degree image around without any
blurring or distortion on a film
scanning camera they go through a slit
that has a certain width to it and as
you saw on the fisheye lenses there's a
curved perspective up at the top so as
you get to the extremes of the the edge
of the frame those will blur as they're
moving because they'll move up and down
as the camera pans and they're not
staying in a consistent spot so these
are extremely valuable also extremely
expensive a round shot makes one pana
scan down in Southern California makes
another one I think they're in the
thirty to fifty thousand dollar range
each so automotive industry uses a lot
of car shooters have gone to these law
enforcement uses panas can quite a bit
now they're extremely high resolution
they can capture a crime scene and you
know it's it's there's a lot of detail
captured in it so they can be very
useful
the option that I really like now is to
use the full frame fisheye lens and
basically stitch these images together
and instead of shooting a dozen images
around in a circle I can only only need
to shoot six images and then if I need
it if I need to be able to look straight
up and straight down I can also shoot
the zenith shot and the nadir shop
shooting multiply Row panoramas is
pretty simple you tilt the camera up you
shoot a series of images around the
circle and you tilt it back to horizon
and you tilt it down low in this case
you know this is for an 18 millimeter
nikkor rectilinear lens you know it's 45
degrees up or a level with the horizon
and 45 degrees down you can also you
know once you've got your three rows
that are set up you can shoot a Zenith
shot as well as a nadir shot below if
you have a longer focal length lens you
might need to shoot more rows so instead
of 45 degrees up you might need to be 60
degrees than 30 degrees then even so
these really add up there's a lot of
imagery that you wind up having to shoot
in this case we're using a panhead again
this one is from KY dan but it allows
you to tilt the camera up and down while
the nodal point remains aligned with
both axes so you have a rotation axis
down here and then you have that's the
vertical rotation axis and then the
horizontal rotation axis that goes along
here and the nodal point has to remain
aligned on both of those as you're doing
these they can be a little bit
labor-intensive so when you're shooting
one you start out and I will usually
shoot a slate at the beginning of each
shot this slate contains information
what lens I'm using you know the
exposure just because I like to know
what that is what my panoramic sequence
is and I'm going to want to know that
when I go to use a stitcher later on and
I
won't remember for you know 20 different
shoots I want to have this recorded with
my my digital files or with my film in
this case it was you know 12 shots up on
three different rows each so this is
what you go through shooting a
multi-role panorama that's our first row
of 45 degrees second row of shots
horizontal and you see there's overlap
in both directions both vertically and
horizontally once you're finished with
all that the stitcher blends everything
together now in this case you can see I
also moved because it's a 360-degree
panorama I liked having this half dome
that's shot on the left side I was able
to rotate it around after the stitching
process and composed the image so it was
a nice image to look at just as a flat
panorama now I happen to when I shot
this I was envisioning it as a black and
white image so I actually shot it both
ways and in reality I never even scanned
the black and white image because I just
converted the color and got the result
that I wanted but I was seeing it as an
image that I wanted to keep or to put up
on the wall and indeed it makes a nice
wall print yes
within one
can always your tremendous planet
yeah the comment was why ever shoot in
black and white you know because you can
convert digitally from color to black
and white and then went that way you've
got both and I think that's a good point
there are some purists who say you know
I get a certain quality of look out of
black and white film now if you're
shooting digitally I don't know too many
black and white digital cameras there
are some that you can convert to
infrared you know by removing the
filters and things but I think you're
right in this case this was a long hike
long trek into this spot in Yosemite I
wanted to have the very lightest
equipment I I could carry and I also
didn't want to have to rely on a digital
camera that it was more subject to bumps
and dust and things like that so I was
shooting film because it was very small
lightweight and it was just my choice at
the time today you know things are a
little bit more reliable i would
probably pretty easily choose choose a
digital camera and just shoot it this is
the result what you get when you make
your movies you can do it in black and
white it's the black and white version
allows you to look around or you can use
the color one which allows you to see
everything in color now I don't know I
should probably take a little pull
what's your preference here what do you
guys like more color everybody likes
color okay and that's fair and I found
that for the print the wall print I like
the black and white version better than
the color one it just it grabbed me more
but for the movie I like the color
version better so think about this as
you're shooting also so I think multi
purposing you know what how can I use
these panoramas how can I use these
image later you may even find yourself
as you're shooting the individual
elements of a panorama aligning them so
that that shot by itself can be
something useful to you you know it's
it's framed properly if you're orienting
your camera as you as you start
panoramic sequence oriented so that the
first shot or the six shot or whatever
is in a spot that would make a nice shot
on its own because you may want that
someday and you know think multi-use
just a quick reminder when you're going
back to choose your tools will go back
to these images on your fields of view
okay what are you going to need to shoot
what's going to be important for you I
find that it's better to choose your
stitcher choose the software application
that you're going to use first and then
go and decide what equipment you're
going to need to do it that way that
involves deciding do I need a full 360
by you know 180 panorama or am I just
going to deal with a cylindrical one you
know is it a horizontal more viewpoint
better and then after that i'll go and
i'll choose the camera the lens you know
what i'm shooting digital or film all
those other things most of us will at
some point do this backwards
particularly as you're starting out when
you say well i only have you know I've
got this camera and I've got this land
so what can i do to use it and that's
perfectly fine but as you start
expanding and say you know this isn't
working for me anymore there are more
things I want to do go find your
stitching application first play with a
bunch of them see which ones you like
and then figure out what its limitations
are and what are what it's you know
features are that you can exploit and
then choose the new equipment that
you're you're going to acquire based on
on that I also want to think about how
are you gonna light things you know
other things that are going to happen on
the locations where you are actually
shooting now I'm going to show you a
brief video on how all this gets put
into practice this was a shoot that we
actually did down at global star in San
Jose a short while ago and you can see
what happens behind the scenes
our assignment was to shoot a series of
360 degree VR panoramas showing the
facilities and Technology backbone for a
global satellite telecommunications
company the company's goal was to be
able to show their resource and
technology commitment to their potential
clients the VR scenes were to be used on
CD ROMs the company's website and an
interactive kiosks due to the different
user interfaces involved we were asked
to shoot every panorama in QuickTime VR
I pics and high resolution formats don't
you be throwing gear it was a very
typical corporate vr shoot which
required lots of preparation and
planning but also a willingness to
modify those plans once on location
there's an antec 67 35 millimeter
fisheye some lenses will actually have a
filter holder in the back this one
doesn't so we'll just have to tape it on
but we'll put a magenta gel on the back
of the lens to color correct
for the fluorescent lights what's
bugging me else the vertical lines there
they're just sort of like a blind it
doesn't suit in tappable is that gonna
hold it okay take smaller want to go top
yep Patel this is Ronald Adrian we're
using Polaroid to test back it's not as
good Polaroid that doesn't change the
color balance very much but it does a
little bit these are a lot yeah we did
add a stop but see this monitor looks
really good there a big monitor and we
blew it out there hey well we'll go with
the 30 magenta filtration and everything
so everything up here we are going to
see it we are going to pick up Blair and
reflections off these lights down here
with a fisheye allows the Rachel linear
lens for QuickTime vr will be a lot
better what we're doing now you're
seeing what we're seeing through the
venetian blinds you in this room down
there ok so we're closing these blinds
what we're going to do is to light this
fairly bright in here so that there's
kind of a red glow going through the
blinds and you're not seeing the tail in
here let chef see how to see their lines
right just to kind of cover up this room
since we don't have people sitting sugar
let's try that I'm big on red ok she has
what happens when you let your kids in
here to trip takes all your good stuff
disappears
okay bye you can do is if we can feather
ya down that way so little this angle
coming up here is war up in the ceiling
good falling we have to sort of picture
the transition yeah as you come down
there okay so as you pan around you guys
sort of bright and airy it's gonna go to
this neutral very in there and then the
darker in the back it's a subtle
difference but i think i think it was
there some chips or cookies left in
there we can throw for these guys will
be able to link oh thank you slink year
so juicy look like and then you go
skidding
you
so that was a brief look at what goes in
that's a full day shoot to basically do
two panoramas in a corporate environment
where everything is critical they will
really want to be able to see details
and and everything balanced properly in
color and all again this is when we were
shooting on film so it was a little bit
harder than than it is now with you know
auto white balancing on digital cameras
this can go a little bit faster now this
was the result however we wound up with
these panoramas that show this was a
satellite control room that they have
for their their satellites you can look
all the way around
to everything hey do you notice that
remember that red gel that we were
putting on in that room in the
background that's the room it turned
blue well it was because the fortunately
the client was there the art director
for the client was there and after we
had set it up they said you know we're
really having a problem with the red
because red to me is like alarms there's
something wrong okay so they said can we
change that well yeah we just put a
different gel over it I love having
clients there because they give you
input like this trying to fix venetian
blinds colors in Photoshop after the
fact would have been a nightmare it
could be done but it would have taken a
long time so again this links so this is
the ground control room over here so you
click on the doorway and it takes you
into that room and you look around so
this was showing their facilities that
they were trying to show off at the time
and then you can click back and go into
the first room now that was the
quicktime VR version of it yes
pan around by the effect of things
moving and you know getting deformed
during the motion isn't it awkward to me
this is something that can be done just
as a user yeah there is it's actually
done when you're creating the movie and
it's an option you get in yours your
your your applications your software
applications you can either have
correction on which gives you that
rectilinear correction of the cylinder
as it's you know panning or you can turn
it off so you just see you know things
are pretty static and they don't change
their shape that's yeah that's also more
noticeable at very wide views when you
zoomed out than it is a telephoto view
or the longer view so for instance here
if we're looking at this one you see the
shape of the screens up here are
changing as we go but as i zoom in
that's now minimized right because my
field of view and my perspective on it
has changed so yes the user can control
it at that level but it's actually the
who's controlling whether that
correction is there or not I like it you
know I did because it gives me the sense
that oh I actually am turning in an
environment on turning my head and
seeing it rather than there's just a
picture sliding by in front of me so you
know different people different tastes
but yes you can do it yes
very high resolution
yeah and and that's something you can
also control some of these are older
movies that I you know created based on
the need at that time you can set it so
it remains at high resolution and you
don't see quite so much distortion there
are newer viewers out there you see
there's a little bit of a jitter on
these also as you pan there are some
newer viewers out there that are really
slick they'd not accept it on every
browser automatically is sometimes have
to download you know plugins but they're
very smooth and you know you look at it
wow that's just beautiful and I'm not
quite using those yet because I want
them to come fully accepted before I
start pushing clients you know towards
that but yes there is some distortion
there are limitations to this certainly
when you're looking at it you know at
web resolution that's going to be lower
than it would be if you were using it in
a you know presentation no so this was
the I showed you the quicktime VR
version this was the I pics version or
the fisheye version that we did also it
allows you to look straight up and
straight down which in this instance you
know I didn't see a lot of value in you
know I want to see pretty much what's
around me this is a room very much like
the room that we're in now you know the
stuff that's straight up and straight
down doesn't matter but the client
wanted us to shoot every possible way we
could so we did and ultimately they
wound up using the cylindrical quicktime
vr version for their presentation
because they saw the same thing you know
do we really want to show a boring you
know boring ceiling up there it's not
critical when you're on location
shooting I try to find ways to show to
show the environment you know in an
interesting way any idiot can basically
go in stick a tripod in the middle of a
room or a middle of you know a field or
whatnot and shoot a panorama now it's
very simple to do so you need to have a
perspective you need to have a story
that you want to tell there's something
in that scene that you want to show or
you want your viewers to know about so
you want to highlight
and part of doing that means positioning
yourself or your camera in a place where
it will show you know interesting things
in the foreground this was actually a
shoot that I did for a outdoor clothing
or product company up in Seattle we shot
for about three days and the last day
you know they needed this canoe shot
with their you know the guys the models
wearing their their jackets and you know
holding a GPS unit in their hand at all
and it involved you know to make it
interesting and thinking about a 360
degree view that didn't have you know
ugly parking lots or things you know in
part of the scene you had to get down
low and you had to get in the water
basically and to me that's kind of fun
that's fun stuff to do you know you're
not just standing in a room shooting a
picture in this instance I shot this
with a fisheye lens we were doing I pix
format the client wanted that at the
time I tend to shoot when I'm doing full
frame fish eyes rather than shooting two
opposing hemispheres I'll shoot a series
of four so I get instead of every 180
degrees every 90 degrees that gives me
the option if a first hemisphere pair
doesn't work for some reason let's say
there's a lens flare or something that I
missed or they just didn't line up
properly they don't a but properly I've
got the second 90-degree you know
version 2 to try again furthermore there
are some stitches out there now that
allow you to stitch these images so
having an overlap between them is great
so to me getting four images is an ideal
way to do it yes
nothing
right right the question of the comment
was if you that there seems to be an
advantage to the I pics approach to
things where if you can get two cameras
with two fish I true fisheye lenses on
it you could just put them back to back
and you know shoot everything at once
yes you can do that unfortunately the
alignment of the cameras and the images
does not line up properly there's going
to be because of the space of the
cameras you know that they take in the
lenses take you're going to have a gap
that big between the edges of the images
if there's something important in that
area that's going to be a problem these
nikkor eight millimeter lenses truly
have a hundred and eighty degree field
of view and it's on some of them it's
maybe a little less 170 979 points
something other fish eyes you know may
have 181 so that gives you a slight
overlap 184 but that still can be very
problematic if you've got something in
the foreground that might fall in that
that dark area what you're not capturing
so trying to line those images up later
on can can be a nightmare unfortunately
I don't know how many of you have kept
up with this but the eye pix corporation
went out of business a year ago all
their assets were sold off they went
bankrupt so this technology you know
still exists but it's you know it's not
we don't really call it the eye pix
technology anymore it can be used you
know the many other companies are you
know providing stitchers and software
applications that do the same thing
there were a bunch of patent suits and
everything you know that that happens
over the years there was a very sordid
tale but uh that's pretty much over now
and and yeah you can use these tools
almost any way you want so it was funny
on this shoot I was we had shot for a
couple days already in various locations
around Seattle and this was the early in
the morning on the third day last day
and the art director hadn't shown up yet
again I really like having the client
or the art director there because they
look at stuff and they say yeah I like
this I don't and she finally showed up
and and she stood on this this dock over
here you know looked and said hi and
then she left you know and I asked her
later on after we'd finished a shoot and
and she said well you know we'd shot
together for two days I showed up seven
thirty in the morning it was freezing I
needed coffee and there you were a chest
deep in the water and I just knew that
we were in control here it's kinda okay
it would have been nice to have you
there but but it's it's nice when you
know things are working and you're
getting creative and other people can
tell your clients can can really tell
that that that's working for you I think
we have time to do this I'm going to
talk a little bit about lighting on
location you don't have to take big
lights with you but you want to be able
to utilize the light that's there to
make the image work for you as well as
you can this was that Lincoln Memorial
series and i want to show you how the
light changes very quickly at dawn and
dusk this is a 6 30am shot virtually no
light in the sky five minutes later
we're starting to see a little bit of
glow and this is getting pretty because
you're realizing that you can balance
the interior light and the exterior
light and there there's something good
happening there but it goes fast five
minutes later it looks like this
three more minutes later it looks like
this so these two are kind of where the
lighting is working for me they're
balanced five minutes after that now
it's starting to get not so interesting
and seven minutes after that the sky is
basically blown out now as you can see
it's an overcast ugly day and it's not
doing a lot for me and 25 minutes after
that first shot the the days were owned
I mean you should you're not going to be
shooting this subject now so yeah
hope you're right
right
choosing the right image
and that possible
yeah certainly it is in fact in fact
that kitchen shot that I showed earlier
the the first sequence of stitching was
done that way where you're shooting
interior and we had no choice but to
shoot during the middle of the day so we
could wait till dawn or dusk so that the
light outside the window was balanced
with the light inside and you can do
multiple exposures you can you know
assemble them over over top of each
other and to balance those it's called
there are a lot of tools now called HDR
high dynamic range where they you're
doing that you're actually keeping the
camera in a fixed position it's not
moving at all and it's pixel accurate so
that you can align these images and the
software actually does it automatically
it looks and says you know okay this is
the bright one this is the dark one and
then it takes the dark parts of the
bright image and you know assembles it
so that so that they match with the
light parts of the dark image it depends
on what software you're using some
software applications PT GUI well
actually you can do it within the
stitching application in their new
version when i was using quicktime vr
authoring studio I usually would do it
to each source image before i stitched
that way so I'm sorry the question was
about balancing the lighting between
real hot highlight areas and real dark
interiors again when I'm shooting I want
to try to show whatever subjects that
I'm showing in an interesting way how
can I make it how can i immerse my
viewers into it this was a shot that I
was actually a personal project that I
did I had this idea that ok I wanted to
shoot a nighttime a long night time
panorama and you know a lot of people
once you figure out how to do long
exposures on your camera you can do star
trail pictures but I wanted to do it as
a panorama so that you could actually
look all the way around you know see the
whole sky see the star trails throughout
see the entire environment
so think about the challenges in doing
this how do you shoot it you know and
this is the part of the creative process
that I love it's solving the problems ok
ok I could shoot it with multi no
multi-row but then the star trails
aren't going to match up I could shoot
it with a fisheye lens but then if I
shoot a hemisphere this way the star
trails aren't going to match up with
this hemisphere so what to do on it and
my solution was I tilted the fisheye
lens upward or lay it on its back so
that I was capturing the whole sky in
one exposure and then capturing
everything below it and the second one
so I rotated the axis of my my
hemisphere pairs and that allowed me to
get a three-hour-long star trail
exposure and then another three hour
exposure you know facing the ground and
this one actually required a little more
than that i shot the the same scene with
a camera in the exact same position
before it got dark so there was a little
bit of light actually illuminating the
you know the little island there and the
lake so that I could again do the HDR
technique where I was bringing out some
of the dark shadows by having a lighter
exposure on there and that's always fun
and I love this because this you know
not only does it show the axis of your
the Earth's rotation but it also shows
things that I didn't expect and I didn't
know I would see in this instance this
this i think it was middle of summer it
was up in northern idaho so we're a
fairly high latitude and sun was it was
dark out at around nine-thirty i waited
until eleven o'clock to start the first
exposure because i wanted that sky to be
really dark i didn't want any light
pollution you know coming in and
interfering this glow over here is
what's left of the glow in the sky of
the sun going down you know even though
it's well beyond the horizon it still
shows up enough and a three hour
exposure so i thought well that was kind
of cool i didn't really expect that but
but it were
now I was thinking okay what's this glow
over here this is looking well that's
Polaris up there this is looking north
what the heck you know it's not the Sun
coming up in the East over here it was
something in the north and yeah it's not
Northern Lights it wasn't you know just
wasn't making sense until I realized and
I was remembering back while we were
there there was a forest fire 50 miles
away and this was the glow in the sky
from that direction from the forest park
you don't see that you know when you're
when you're there in person because your
eyes don't pick it up but that that's
the exciting part of doing you know fun
stuff like this I'm going to leave you
with one more quick video it's about
seven minutes that describes the yeah
I'm sorry cam a good tripod oh you
there's there's some retouching involved
here when you mean the when you're doing
the nadir shot on multi-row panorama
yeah generally there's a lot of
retouching done to retouch that that
bottom stuff in what what I'll usually
do if I'm not shooting something that's
a really long exposure is I'll shoot
everything at exposure and then I'll
move the tripod away take the camera
back to the position hand hold it you
know and that I can stitch in there okay
and that allows me to have enough
material to do the retouching of the
bottom there a lot of people myself
included instead of doing that will just
put a little round you know digital
tripod cap in there and doesn't really
bother people some people put their logo
on it so they know who shot it you know
it's all in the image there are a lot of
tricks you can use in the instance of
this nighttime star trail panorama I
actually had the camera set up on a
tripod with an arm going out so the lens
was leaning out and the tripod legs were
slightly off to the side and that way
the view straight down was clear and all
I had to do was read
much you know the legs out of there that
were there so this is just a video to
show you that you somebody shoot that I
did and I hope you enjoy it oops that's
not it I need to click the wrong button
in april of nineteen twenty seven Ansel
Adams created one of his best-known
photographs entitled monolith the face
of Half Dome shot from a precipice
almost 4,000 feet above the valley floor
the image marked what Adams described as
his first conscious visualization
meaning that he accurately planned and
visualized the final print in his mind
at the time he was creating the image
with his camera even near the end of his
life he described the experience as
being one of the most exciting moments
of his photographic career
generations of photographers have
followed in Adams as footsteps sometimes
photographing the same or similar scenes
with their own visual interpretations
as a panoramic photographer I often
wondered what we didn't see in Ansel's
framing of Half Dome
upon reaching the summit of the diving
board one stands cautiously in awe of
the scene ahead almost 3,000 feet of air
below in the massive face of Half Dome
continuing for another 1,500 feet above
the thrill of seeing the spectacular
view in person is surpassed only by the
excitement of realizing what the
resulting images on film will yield
you
so thank you that's it any other
questions yes dick
I
okay I am NOT an engineer and I'm not an
optical engineer either and I may be
wrong but I understand that it is the
rear nodal point what they call the rear
nodal point and I believe that's in I
got that from vocals encyclopedia
photography and there's another one on
opticon optics yeah it's a good one to
look up okay so if I'm wrong I'm sorry
but it's what we commonly call the nodal
point and I suspect that it was called
that for a reason but but I could be
wrong I'll check it yeah well I know
there are two nodal points for the lens
and and it also differs for fisheye
lenses versus rectilinear lenses so if
you're shooting with a fisheye lens you
generally want to align I think the
nodal point moves but you want to align
the front field of view of you know the
of the lens where the images are going
to abut you want that aligned over the
axis of rotation rather than a hard to
find nodal point and and again it's a
little tough to pin it down and yeah and
and that's that's a good question also
how do you find the nodal point
unfortunately lens manufacturers don't
don't put this on their lens they don't
put a little line you know marked
anywhere and you you I have never been
able to find even printed information
from them about where the nodal point is
on a given a lens so you do have to do
it on your own you have to put it on a
head that you can adjust and their their
methods to doing this but basically you
pan and you look to see if things are
aligning you move the camera forward or
backwards a little more yeah yeah that's
that's that's a good good way to think
about it but it's that's interesting
because I I thought I had that one
nailed down so but I could be wrong I'll
check it now
well thank you thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
