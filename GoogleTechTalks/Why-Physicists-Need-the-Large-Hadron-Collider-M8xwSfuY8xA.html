everybody it's my great pleasure to have
edward phi here was us in santa monica
actually the main reason that Edward is
here is to work with us and help us with
our efforts in quantum computing and
while he was here he actually graciously
offered to give a talk and this talk
will actually not be about quantum
computing since some of you may recall a
half year ago when Edward was here
already addressed his latest work in
this topic and so we thought it may be
much more fun to talk about the recently
started up ok sorry there were some
audio issues so yeah we thought it's
much more fun to talk about the Large
Hadron Collider and this is what the
talk of Edward will be about and we'll
leave it as such okay well thank you can
everyone hear me okay okay well I'm
sorry am i okay am I am i all right
so this is going to be a talk about the
Large Hadron Collider which is the giant
accelerator that everyone knows is
turning on in Geneva Switzerland and I
although I work on quantum computing I
got my start in particle physics and I
do know a little bit about particle
physics and I worked at CERN for a year
at the before the Large Hadron Collider
was built I worked there and so I feel I
have a pretty good idea of what the
issues are that are going to be
addressed by the law Hadron Collider I
would like to say another thing I am a
theorist so I really don't know that
much about how it works
to me it's just this amazing machine
it's the most complicated thing ever
built and I decided not to stand here
and show you pictures of it because I
can't really explain the pictures other
than to say this is an amazing piece of
apparatus and you can just go on the web
and look for pictures of the LHC
yourself so my goal is more to try to
explain to you a little bit why it is
that
so excited by the LHC and I understand
that most of you probably have
backgrounds in computer science and
engineering I don't know how much
physics you know so please feel free to
ask me questions because I want you to
understand and I will alter my talk if I
discover that you know I'm addressing
issues that are opaque to you so and the
only thing is if you ask me something
I'll try to repeat the question so
people remotely can hear okay
so the Large Hadron Collider you know
it's it's the most powerful particle
accelerator of a belt and it's going to
smash together protons on protons and
the protons are moving the energy of the
protons is 7 TeV so let's just set the
scale here I'm gonna use very rough
units okay and you know equals MC
squared so if we set the speed of light
to 1 we can measure mass and energy in
the same units so the standard unit I
would like to use just so we can wrap
our head about it is a GeV a GeV is the
energy a particle of children with the
electrons charged gains if it moves
across a GeV is 10 to the 9 electron 29
volts so it's how much power energy of
particle picks up and indiana GeV units
the mass of the proton is about 0.94 GeV
so that sets the scale okay so the mass
of the proton is about a GeV and the LHC
has energies the energy in a beam at the
LHC is at e--e--evening it's a 7 TeV
and that's like 7000 GeV so for those of
you who know a little bit about
relativity that means that the gamma
factor in other words the energy divided
by the mass of the particle of the
proton is let's say about 7,000 so
means that for example the clock if the
proton is carrying a clock with it it is
in its rest frame that clock is going
about 7,000 times slower than the clock
on the in the lab frame and for example
it also means that the you know the the
the proton sees the accelerator as
contracted by a factor of 7,000 so
instead of it seeing a twenty kilometer
you can do the arithmetic I don't know
so maybe it's this big or something the
accelerator in the rest frame of the
proton and of course these relativistic
effects have to be taken into account or
the thing would not work so these things
are being smashed together and also
another thing you should know is that
this is proton on proton so there are
two counter circulating beams and the
particles are then brought together in
collision in the sand the lab frame is
the center of mass frame because you
have one beam going this way and one
beam going that way so the lab frame is
the center of mass frame and that means
that all the energy that comes in the
collision can go into making stuff and
you know you don't have to take energy
to set something moving if you have a
particle at rest and you hit it and you
make something you still have to send it
that way but here in the center-of-mass
frame you collide the two particles and
if you make something you can make it at
rest which means all the energy in the
beams can go into the production of new
particles that's why they built
colliders as opposed to fixed target
machines to take advantage of that
center of mass energy effect so this
thing is going to be up at 7 TV and
that's about a factor of 10 higher than
Fermilab let's say which was working at
about a tenth of that and this thing
will also have much higher luminosity
the luminosity is a measure of how many
interactions are going to be per second
and maybe I should just even though I'm
not an expert on this you should know
that the data rates coming out of the
LHC
so enormous that it would be absolutely
impossible to write to tape all of the
collisions that go at the LHC because
the number of collisions per second and
the amount of information that the giant
detectors will gather for each collision
is so high that there would be
impossible to record all the events and
what that means is again I'm really
shouldn't talk about this because I'm
not that much of an expert I'm a
theorist but that really means that when
the experimentalists decide they have to
make a decision should we write the
event to tape I call a tape I'm not sure
it really is tape but you know should we
record the event they have to look at
some characteristic of the event and
then make a decision yes we're going to
keep it and of course that's called the
trigger and that and so obviously when
you're trying to design your data
analysis the trigger is crucial because
if you might trigger on something which
is not the characteristic of the thing
you're hoping to find so there are a lot
of really great of subtle issues and
data analysis at the LHC I believe the
LHC will be producing you know more data
than was ever produced by you know all
the phone calls in the world or
something there all these analogies to
how much data is going to be coming out
but the data rate is phenomenal from the
LHC and it's the job of the
experimentalists to extract from this
incredibly complicated data signal and
one of the real challenges there in
looking for signals that the LHC is
since there is so much data and it is so
complicated it's very hard to know what
it's very hard to look for things unless
you know what they are because if I gave
you an incredible amount of data and I
said look for something anomalous well
that's a lot more complicated than if I
said look for a particular particle with
this mass decaying in this channel so
knowing what to look for helps and
therefore the prejudice of theorists
about what will be seen at the LHC is
very very important because the
theoretical prejudices of what might be
discovered affect the way the
experimentalists look at the data and of
course our hope is that the
experimentalist will not listen to us
that the experimenters will not pay that
much attention to the theorists we'll
look for things that they have decided
are really the good things to look for
and find one of them that would be the
ultimate thing now what is it that we
want at the LHC well in order to talk
about what we want at the LHC we need to
talk about where we are in particle
physics so let's let's go back and talk
about what what do we know in particle
physics now what what are we really sure
of and it's actually remarkable how much
we know in particle physics let me tell
you what we do know well first of all
I'm not going to talk about gravity
unless you force me into a discussion of
string theory or something so let's put
aside gravity the reason I'm putting
aside gravity is basically as you all
know gravity is an incredibly weak force
at the level of particle physics the the
gravitational attraction between two
protons is miniscule and can be
completely ignored in everything that
goes on at the LHC but don't ask me yet
about making black holes or something
let's forget that okay so let's just
talk I'm gonna stick with the standard
line I'm gonna take give you the party
line on particle physics before we go to
the exotic if we you can't go to the
exotic till you first do the party line
so in the party line gravity is
incredibly weak and we can ignore it and
then you know there are three forces of
nature than at work at the LHC there's
the strong interaction which holds the
proton together the quarks inside the
proton and which is responsible for most
of the stuff that's going to be seen at
the LHC
there's the weak interaction which has
to do with of the decay of particles and
there's the electromagnetic interaction
and we can talk more about these in a
few minutes now so there are basically
three forces in nature at work at the
LHC the strong interactions the weak
interaction of the electromagnetic
interaction and as far as we know those
are the only three forces of nature
we could speculate about other forces
the fifth force oh because when they say
a fifth force that's because we add in
gravity so there are three particle
physics and then there's gravity so when
they talk about the fifth force that
would be beyond that but for our
purposes there are three forces of
nature and what we do have quite
remarkably well we have forces but then
we need to have a list of particles that
interact and there is a short list of
elementary particles which we have
discovered to date which are described
by which interact through these forces
okay and I could list those particles
for you the list is not very long let's
just start with the with the fermions
those are the spin 1/2 particles so for
the fermions there's the electron the
muon and the Tau the electron we all
know and love we're made of electrons
the muon is the cousin of the electrons
just like the electron but much heavier
the Tau is a cousin it's just like the
mu and the electron but it's much
heavier then we have the three neutrinos
and then we have the quarks we have the
up type quarks I call them up tight
because they have a charge two-thirds up
charm and top and then we have the down
type quarks down strange and bottom so
we have a list of 12 fermions all of
which have been seen in some form or
another either indirectly or directly
they all have mass and what's very
interesting about these particles is
that they come in groups so this
particle this particle and this particle
have the same charge and the same
quantum numbers this particle this
particle in this particle have the same
charge two thirds and they're both
triplets under the color force if that
means anything to you this is down
strange and bottom they're all charged
minus 1/3 and because these are quantum
mechanical particles with the same
quantum numbers they can actually
sometimes you have to you're forced
quantum mechanically to consider linear
combinations of them in certain
processes and that's actually I could
maybe talk more about that that's what
the Nobel Prize was awarded for last
week was figuring
something about the linear combinations
of these particles which interact in the
weak interactions maybe I'll tell you
about that later because it's very
topical I could tell you why kobayashi
and maskawa won the Nobel Prize I cannot
tell you why could be Bo wasn't included
that's the political thing I don't know
so the Italians are all upset about
kabhi Bo not getting the prize but the
Japanese are happy because the kobayashi
and maskawa now these particles this
list is just handed to us we don't
really know where it comes from
we just have this list and then we have
a description of the forces between
these particles and that is described
quantum mechanically if this means
anything to you in terms of a
Hamiltonian the Hamiltonian is the thing
that determines the dynamics quantum
mechanically once you know the
Hamiltonian of a quantum system you know
everything about the quantum system
assuming I mean in principle you know
everything and that's because all
quantum systems obey the equation i D by
DT on sy the wavefunction is H sy so let
me just tell you what this equation
means it means that if the size is a
vector and H is the Hamiltonian and this
is a time evolution equation and it
tells you that if you know the state of
your quantum system at one time its
future is determined by solving that
differential equation so the Hamiltonian
governs the dynamics of the system just
like the force in Newtonian mechanics to
determines the dynamics if you write F
equals MA if you know the force you know
the future quantum mechanically if you
know the Hamiltonian you know your state
vector
you know the future so the Hamiltonian
contains all the information about the
interactions of these particles and we
have written I shouldn't say we
other people have we're people kind have
written down the Hamiltonian of the
strong the weak and the electromagnetic
interactions those Hamiltonians were
written down and they were really
completed in the late 70s and maybe
there
early 80s and the amazing thing about it
is that if you take the Hamiltonian of
the strongly we can the electromagnetic
interactions and you take these
particles as input and then you ask a
question like what is the probability
that at a certain detector at a certain
accelerator when I collide together two
particles two other particles will come
out at a certain angle you make the
prediction you compare with experiment
dead-on you calculate a property of the
of the muon you know the muon for
example this particle over here it's a
it's a spin 1/2 particle which means it
carries annual momentum but it also has
a magnetic moment because it's it's a
charged particle has a magnetic moment
and you can ask what is the ratio of its
magnetic moment to its spin angular
momentum and you can calculate that in
the standard model and you calculate it
to ten decimal accuracy and the and and
the prediction of the theory agrees with
experiment to ten decimal accuracy so
when you can make ten decimal
predictions you feel like you have
confidence that you have some
understanding of your theory and it's
more than that it's that the standard
model of the strong that we can the
electromagnetic interactions there has
not been a single prediction of the
standard model that has been that
contradicts a single experiment so this
is kind of amazing you know we live in a
time when we know the forces between
quarks and we know we know we have a
mathematical framework for making
calculations
it's called relativistic quantum field
theory how to teach that class so we
have a mathematical framework for making
predictions in this theory and it allows
us to make predictions about properties
of particles and it also allows us to
make predictions about what will happen
in Collider experiments or other kinds
of experiments and again I cannot
emphasize to you enough every prediction
of the theory which every calculation
that has been carried out when compared
with experiment is an agreement
and that's pretty remarkable now that
doesn't mean that there is there is not
lack of understanding or unhappiness in
the particle physics community where
does that a lack where does that
unhappiness come from it comes from the
fact that the theory has a lot of
arbitrariness in it for example let me
give you an example of the arbitrariness
in it that we feel like shouldn't be
there we just have an intuition that
this arbitrariness shouldn't be there
for example we input the masses of all
these particles as inputs okay we and we
input them into the theory and then we
make measurements and then we just
adjust the input to agree with the
measurement so for example there's a
parameter in the standard model the mass
of the electron and then well you know
you go out and you measure it and you
discover the mass of the electron is 0.5
1 1 million electron volts because I'm
using I'm measuring mass and energy
units it's 0.5 1 1 a million electron
volts that's the value who you put in
end of story
now once you have that value you might
use that as input to making another
prediction about some other property but
that's an input and the masses of all
the particles are inputs but there are
some very strange aspects to it for
example if you look at these let's let
let's just look at these three quarks
just as an example okay these 3 quarks
well the top quark which is the heaviest
quark its mass the mass of the top is
about a hundred and seventy GeV okay
huge remember the proton is 1 GeV so the
single quark has the mass of a giant
atom
okay but it's an elementary particle
just like the up quark but it's a single
quark and it has a mass of 170 GeV
that's like somewhere high up in the
periodic table or something that has
it's like something that has 170 protons
and neutrons okay that's how much it
weighs the mass of the charm quark is
1.5 GeV and the mass of the up core
is about 0.005 GeV so here we have three
particles identical in all respects but
have incredibly disparate masses which
we take his input that seems very
unsatisfactory and it's very atypical
like for example you know just think
about um you know think about something
like chemistry right suppose I told you
well let's look at the periodic table
before you knew how to order it and you
had all these elements and it all looked
very scattered and very complicated but
then once you realize for example that
at the nuclei of atoms are made of
protons and neutrons you get it very
quickly a good rough estimate of the
mass of the atom right the mass of the
atom is roughly you know the number of
nucleons times the mass of a nucleon and
that works very very well when you just
go right up the periodic table up to
little Corrections from binding energy
and throw in a few electrons I mean
that's the basic picture right the mass
of an atom is the sum of the masses of
the protons and neutrons and the nucleus
that's it you know very simple but in
that kind of picture it's very hard to
imagine a mass ratio like this huge mass
ratios in the standard model and this is
completely not understood and this meant
this weirdness of these mass ratios
persists everywhere like the electron
weighs half a million electron volts
this is a billion electron volts and
this lepton weighs over a GeV so this
huge disparity in mass is a tremendous
mystery in the standard model there's
another problem in the standard model
which is this you know basically what
are we made of well we're made of up
quarks and down quarks because protons
and neutrons made of up quarks and down
quarks and then we're made of electrons
now why are we made of electrons and not
muons and Tau's I just told you they're
very very similar well the reason is
very simple and not that deep in a way
and that is
heavy particles decay into lighter
particles so for example the muon can
decay into an electron plus two
neutrinos so if I have a muon and I put
it on the table it'll spontaneously
decay into an electron now the electron
is the lightest charged particle now if
you believe in that particles decay only
into lighter objects and you believe in
the conservation of charge then the
lightest charged particle is stable
because it's got nobody to decay into
right you think about any decay chain it
ends at the lightest charged particle
because the lightest charged particle
cannot only decay to another charged
particle because conservation of charge
and there's nobody lighter so the only
reason so the distinction between the
electron and the muon
is that the electron is stable by
accident of it being at the bottom of
the list and of course that makes it a
very good thing to make us out of
because it's better to make you out
people and stuff out of stable things
but it really has nothing to do with its
fundamental Nassif is except art achill
physicist all these particles are
equally fundamental and equally
interesting it's just that we happen to
be made out of electrons and we also
happen to be made out of protons and
neutrons and of course the proton is the
lightest particle that carries baryon
number so it can't decay let's not go
into grand unification of something but
roughly speaking the proton is stable so
you know it's a convenient thing to make
things of because it's stable but it's
not a fundamental thing it's just an
accident so one of the things that we
really don't understand is why is this
pattern repeated and there's a very
famous quote you know from ia Rabi
because after the muon was came to be he
said who ordered that you know like at
the Chinese restaurant where that dish
come from so he couldn't understand
where the muon came from and that has
just continued we now have what we call
three generations three sets of
particles absolutely no understanding
for why it's three but we really don't
think it's four certainly not not with
very light neutrinos
because there's a certain decay of the Z
boson which you can look at I could
explain this if you forced me but if you
look at the decay of the Z boson you
would see you can count the number of
massless neutrinos or almost massless
neutrinos and the number is three and
then you can also infer that from
certain early universe data that so it
looks like this is the lest as long as
we assume that the neutrino if there's
an if there are more of these out there
that the neutrinos associated with the
next generation is light then this is
the list so physicists they don't like
this they don't like the fact that there
is a group of particles whose properties
are seemingly very very arbitrary and in
physics the goal is all very often to
try to remove arbitrariness to try to
get some larger picture just like we
have in chemistry right chemistry's not
mysterious in a certain way it's very
difficult to understand maybe detailed
chemical reactions or properties of
complicated atoms but if you ask me
about the periodic table it's all
determined once I tell you I have
protons neutrons of the strong force to
keep the nucleus together the
electromagnetic force to keep the
electrons buzzing about and quantum
mechanics and the entire periodic table
is determined right so there's no
mystery in chemistry at a fundamental
level it's all determined by the
underlying physics yet we have no
understanding of this now I of course I
didn't tell you all about all the
particles there are other particles in
nature they're all the force carriers
which are associated with this let me
just talk about the weak interactions
for a minute in the weak interaction
sector there are two particles called
the W plus minus it I call that one
particle because the plus and the minus
are anti particles and the Z boson and
both of these particles have been found
this weighs about 80 GeV and this weighs
about 90 GeV they've both been made they
decay but all their decays are
consistent with the standard model and
there they are now but there's another
particle there's one particle
in the standard model one who's which is
part of the standard model but has not
yet been found and that's called the
higgs boson the Higgs boson and the
Higgs boson is an integral part of the
electroweak or the weak interaction part
of the theory it's a key ingredient to
the theory but it has not yet been seen
and not only that its mass is also a
free parameter something which we do not
yet know based on first principles okay
so it's not known it is not specified by
the theory however I told you that you
can do detailed calculations in the
standard model of processes and those
detailed calculations of processes rely
on our understanding of the existing
particles so what you do is you put the
pigs particle into the calculation even
though we're not talking about a thing
in which an actual Higgs particle is
made I'm gonna use the Higgs particle as
an intermediate step in part of a more
complex calculation and then what you
discover is that there are certain
observables of things which have been
seen which depend on the mass of the
Higgs okay so from the existing data
from the existing data you can go and
say what is the most likely value of the
mass of the Higgs in order to fit the
existing data since some of the
experiments act some of that data
actually is sensitive to the mass of the
Higgs does that make sense and it turns
out if you do that you pick the mass of
the Higgs to be about 90 GeV okay 90 GeV
well it turns out that if the Higgs
weighed less than 115 GeV
it already would have been made at
Fermilab
because what again what we have now how
can I say what we have now we have
limits on the mass of the Higgs in other
words what we can say now is if the
higgs weighed less than 115 G V then we
already would have made it at Fermilab
okay so the most likely value for the
Higgs mass based on a pre-existing data
is lower than the than the experimental
bound from Fermilab so what you can then
do is something else you can kind of
make a confidence curve for the mass of
the Higgs and you could say you know
let's say how likely it is based on the
data so I just told you the most likely
value is like 70 so I'm gonna make some
likelihood curve you know I'm just
drawing some likelihood curve the most
likely value is 70 based on the
pre-existing data however it's excluded
but on this side by experiment so it
means that the mass of the Higgs is to
the right of 115 with some falling curve
out from 115 so if you had to bet on
what the mass of the Higgs is you would
probably say you know it's 120 130 150
because it's getting less likely based
on the pre-existing data and that means
that the LHC will find it because the
LHC has the reach it has the energy
capability to produce the Higgs boson in
fact you know what you should really say
to me is look the Higgs boson if it only
weighs 115 GeV why do I need 70 V to
make it because equals MC squared so
you'd think that if I collide together
two particles I could convert all that
energy simply into the mass of an object
because I'm colliding together particles
and I'm making something but the reason
is is because that one of the things
that goes on with the LHC is it's a
proton proton Collider and a proton is a
little dirty bag of three quarks and a
bunch of gluons and what actually
collides
at the LHC or the quarks inside the
protons and the quarks inside the
protons are not carrying 7tv
they're carrying a smaller fraction of
the energy and momentum because they're
just constituents of the proton so it's
actually happening at the LHC is you're
just you're smashing together two little
dirty bags of quarks and the quarks
collide but they don't each carry seven
TV they carry a much smaller fraction
and that's why the LHC could could never
it could never make a 14 TV Higgs boson
even though you have 14 TV in the center
of mass because you're never going to
find two quarks carrying all the
momentum of each proton so that's why
the reach of this is a little bit lower
than you might have thought going all
the way to 7 TeV
so the betting money is that the LHC
will discover the Higgs boson because
the Higgs boson is a key ingredient in
the standard model which to date has
been 100% successful in all of its
predictions okay I should say something
else about the standard model which is I
think worth understanding you know
people talk about all kinds of models
where they have extra dimensions and
supersymmetry and all kinds of variants
of the standard model and basically what
happens is as soon as you muck with the
standard model as soon as you change it
a little bit you make a prediction
that's inconsistent with experiment the
only way really that these extra that
these models manage to be consistent
with experiment is to have an enormous
number of free parameters so the way
that the extra of the theories that are
supposed to go beyond the standard model
if you actually look at them and say how
do they manage to be consistent with the
extra with the current existent it's
because they have so many free
parameters that they can adjust they can
match the standard model so if you
actually ask yourself I try to be a
little bit objective and say you know
what is the alternative to the standard
model that actually is either explained
let's say either makes a prediction a
post diction a post diction that would
mean explained something we couldn't
already explain or a very clear oh let's
say a post diction so explain something
that we couldn't already explain and
that is in some sense minimal and not
excessively complicated the answer is
nothing so one of the amazing things
about the standard model is not only is
an enormous ly successful very
frustrating because it has all these
free parameters but it has no old
competitors it has no competitors and by
a competitor I mean an alternate theory
which actually explains something which
is not a contradiction with experiment
it doesn't have competitors and that
makes it very very hard to understand
also why it's so good now so I would say
the better the odds on that is that you
will find the Higgs boson I've set up a
betting pool of my work for the mass of
the Higgs and we were taking bets and I
you know I would bet it's gonna be 150
GeV or something and they'll find it and
it'll probably decay into according to
all so in the standard model given the
Hamiltonian the standard model we know
it's decay channels we know it's
favorite decay channels and the most
likely scenario that will come out of
the LHC is that the Higgs will be
discovered and it will decay in the way
predicted by the standard model and in a
way if that's all that's found it will
be a big disappointment that's in a way
the worst possible outcome the worst
possible outcome for the LHC is the
Higgs boson is created it's a case
according to the rules of the standard
model and nothing else is found I would
say that would be a disaster for
particle physics because it just means
that we built this enormous machine and
all we did is confirm what we already
know and and since we can't predict the
mass of the Higgs if it turns out to
weigh you know 100 like just like the
numerical value of the mass at the top
it doesn't inform anything you know if
the mass of the top or 173 GeV nobody's
theories would change it's just an input
just like if the mass of the electron
were twice what it is nothing would
change you would just have a mass of the
electron it would be
1mev instead of 0.5 mev that's it I mean
maybe it would have implications for
chemistry or something maybe would have
implications for devices but have no
implications for fundamental physics and
so I would say that at this point if we
find an intermediate mass Higgs a low
mass Higgs then it's it's very
disappointing in some deep way for
particle physics the alternative would
be the very fighting in a very high mass
Higgs if we find a very high mass Higgs
then it's hard to account for the
existing data that would be more
interesting
another possibility we don't find the
Higgs at all well that would of course
mean only that we place a limit that we
say if the Higgs weighed let's say less
than a TV with high probability it would
have been produced after 5 years of
running of the LHC that you can never
exclude it entirely you can only say
with a high probability had it been in
this mass range we would have made it so
if that would be very interesting to the
particle physics community the non
existence of the Higgs that would be
great in a certain way no Higgs I'd love
that you know I'll be great cuz then
really be in trouble now
obviously the thing we want at the LHC
is something we didn't think of right
that's obviously what we want that's the
hope for the LHC the hope for the LHC is
that some particle will be made that no
one ever thought of or some
cross-section a cross-section as a
scattering probability at given angles
it was going to go down when we thought
it should go up that's what would be the
best thing some weird phenomenon which
is absolutely unpredicted and i really
hope that that is what is found and i
would say most of my colleagues hope
that that's what's found now again the
scary part is as i told you in the
beginning the LHC has so much data that
it's very hard to know how you would see
something anomalous unless you knew what
you were looking for that's one of the
difficulties of the experimental program
at the LHC because it's so complicated
you don't know if you don't know what
feature to select how do you say it's an
odd feature when you have data sets
which are unimaginably big and so that
is a huge concern at the LHC for people
like me I mean how do we really gain
confidence that the experimentalists are
not going to overlook something simply
because they didn't look for it and that
that's terribly scary well wait maybe I
should are there any I've been ranting
so other than anybody have any questions
about that up till now because I'm happy
yeah right well let me tell you why one
thing we do know there is a constraint
in the standard model let me just say
hold on how can I am I sure that the the
the theory as we write it down now if it
doesn't make sense actually it's not
mathematically consistent unless if you
unless you have all four particles at
once there are certain consisting
standard model has certain constraints
on its particle content which are
satisfied by these and if you added
simply a lepton doublet meaning a new
let's say neutrino and a new a new
corresponding lepton there would be
something wrong with the standard model
so the general thought is that if you
add this you have to add this to not
encounter that problem now there could
be another problem there could be other
problems but the standard law is a hole
we call this a generation a whole
generation has to be added or else you
would have to have some other
explanation for a little math problem
which I didn't tell you about so there
is some hint that particles come in
generations and actually what happens is
I can tell you how they know that how
many neutrinos there are you see the Z
boson decays into neutrinos it decays
into many many things but in particular
it decays into education to be B bar
that's a bottom but anti bottom quark
and it decays into neutrino anti
neutrino of all three types
now when a particle decays that induces
uncertainty in its lifetime I mean
there's an uncertainty in the lifetime
of a particle which is B how long is the
particle stay on the table well that's
its lifetime and the more channels that
has to decay into the the shorter its
lifetime because the more things you can
decay into the shorter your lifetime
now when you produce a particle
energetically the uncertainty in its
lifetime reflects itself in the
uncertainty in the energy at which you
can produce the particle so for example
when you produce a particle like the Z
boson there Z boson weighs what did I
say 90 GeV but if I plot the production
cross-section versus energy of the Z
boson it's actually peaked at 90 GeV and
because there's a little spread and the
reason there's a little spread in energy
is is a little it's coming the time
energy uncertainty principle if that
means anything to you so there's a
little spread in the energy at which you
could produce these things and that
arises because the thing is a nonzero
lifetime if the lifetime we're narrower
this would go the the other way and for
a very long live particle this is very
narrow so this production cross-section
is a measure of the lifetime of the
particle so even though the Z boson can
decay into neutrinos which are not
detected by studying the production
cross-section you measure its width is
what we call its lifetime width and by
measuring its lifetime we count the
number of neutrinos that's kind of
amazing even though you don't see them
you know so now and we know there are
three if you fit the number of neutrinos
from that data you get the Ray I think
3.1 good
oh because yes so the question is this
when Heath you know what he's heard is
that the mass of the Higgs that the
Higgs boson is responsible for giving
mass to all the elementary particles so
what he thinks is that if we find the
mass of the Higgs we find the Higgs that
somehow know that we get the pattern of
masses that's actually not true I mean
what happens is that the cup the Higgs
it is true that there is a coupling of
the Higgs boson to each particle which
gives it its mass I could explain that
in more detail but each particle has an
arbitrary coupling so there are as many
or in other words but you know you could
think about why what you're saying can't
quite be right because if 12 parameters
could be predicted from one I could have
constrained the data even though I
didn't know the mass of the Higgs right
I could have had I could have had 11
relations and I don't so the mass of the
Higgs is a input parameter which really
if it just turns out to be 150 G of a or
something will be very very frustrating
to theorists people like to say that the
LHC is going to discover the origin of
mass you know they say that but if you
already look at the standard model the
way mass is generated is by a coupling
of the Higgs boson to the fermions and
the actual discovery of the Higgs is not
going to change my understanding so
that's one of the scary things about the
LHC I mean I already understand the
standard model and if they find the
Higgs I'll just say okay I always knew
it was there nothing will change for a
lot of theorists and that's very very
scary the only thing that's gonna change
things is if the none of the above is
found but the discovery of a single
people higgs-boson will change nothing
about the way I understand the standard
model for example I'm just using myself
as an example because I already assume
it exists and and I don't have any
handle on the mass parameter and since I
have no idea what the mass should be put
by discovering the number isn't that
going to change anything it's a it's a
scary prospect I think and I think that
sometimes people oversell a little bit
how much will be learned by the
discovery of the Higgs I think if we
discover the Higgs and it decays
according to the standard model we'll
have learned nothing other than all
preconceived ideas were correct which is
reassuring but it doesn't tell you how
to take the next step because we would
already anticipate the next step
go ahead how can we know we haven't
found the Higgs boson I'm not really
sure what you mean by that I mean the
Higgs boson is a particle which which
has definite decay properties and in
certain experiments they collide
together particles the Higgs bosons very
short-lived and they took they they
collide together particles and they say
that if the Higgs boson had this mass
then in our detector we would see these
particles coming out with this fraction
of the time at these angles and they
don't see it because you know the
existence of the particle leads to very
definite predictions about how things
would work and and so when we say we
haven't that the Higgs doesn't exist we
haven't seen it we mean we take the
existing theory we we say given our
knowledge of the theory given a
particular accelerator experiment like
like Fermilab what is the probability
that a collision would give rise to the
Higgs we multiply that probability by
the number of collisions we have and we
say that if the Higgs existed we would
have seen it God
right what-whatever yeah oh I don't know
he the question was I'm supposed to
repeat the question for the remote
viewers you know he says well you know
if if the Higgs if the Higgs is found
and everything is according to what we
know how we're going to make progress in
particle physics well the honest answer
to that is that has frustrated me so
much that I have developed a second life
doing quantum computing and and that's
really one of the main reasons I have
been working on quantum computing it's
because I have found it very so
difficult personally I'm telling my
personal story to make progress in
particle physics that I have developed a
sideline and you know I would i if if
something really really bizarre happens
in particle physics
my interest in quantum computing will go
down but that's I I can't really answer
a question like that other than by
telling you what I do you know I don't
have an answer beyond what how I
organize my life about what what I think
is the answer and I think I don't know
enough to do something else yeah oh sure
yeah well the question is I guess
everyone could hear that because it was
broadcast so the answer is he's asking
me why does why does nature prefer one
handedness which is really the question
of why is parody violated in the world
is the standard model violate parity
parity is the symmetry that says if you
look at the world and then you look at
it in the mirror that any reaction you
see in the world in the mirror world you
should be able to reproduce in the lab
and of course that's not the case and
the reason for that is because neutrinos
are left handed and left handed means
that their spin angular momentum points
opposite to the direction of motion -
assuming they're massless which they're
not but anyway if they're moving this
way they're spin they're left-handed
means that their spin goes the opposite
way now if you look at that in the
mirror when you reverse momentum you
don't reverse spin actually in a mirror
so in a mirror a neutrino would be
right-handed we don't see right-handed
neutrinos and that is a fundamental
ingredient of the standard model that
parity is maximally violated I would say
there's absolutely no understanding of
it and it's just the way it is and in
fact I would say that if you're as an
old dog like me you don't even ask that
question anymore I mean I just more say
myself well why should parity be a good
symmetry
it just isn't I mean it's just not a
symmetry of nature I mean so you thought
it was but it isn't and the same is true
of charge conjugation and time reversal
that although you would think that these
should be symmetries of nature they're
not but you know I can't really explain
why they're not but they're not and I
think it's better at a certain point to
stop saying why are they not symmetries
of nature and just say well that's the
way it is I don't know why should it why
should parity be a good symmetry it
isn't I guess we good well maybe I
should talk about the Nobel Prize do you
want me to explain to you what the Nobel
Prize was for this year so the Nobel
Prize this year was well there were two
aspects to of it wonderfully do with
what's called spontaneous symmetry
breaking and one of it had to do with
neutrino masses basically a mixing oh no
not midnight readers I misspoke um I
misspoke I'm sorry with a quark mixing
quark mixing well remember I told you
that these quarks are the same in all
ways
up charm and top and these quarks down
strange and bottom they're the same in
all ways so that means that actually
quantum mechanically you can you can be
forced to consider super positions and
when I talk about the up core usually we
mean the quark whose charge is 2/3 which
has a certain mass when we talk about
the down quark it's a certain charge of
minus 1/3 with a certain mass but in the
weak interactions in the weak
interactions there are actually
couplings between the up quark and the
down quark but now you have to say is it
the down quark or is it some linear
combination of these three okay because
that's naturally what arises the thing
that the up quark couples to is
something I call down but what is down
mean well down could mean any of the
down quarks and what you have to do is
take them in linear combination now the
history of it is this it was known in
the old days we didn't know about these
quarks top and bottom and we barely we
only the very beginning we really only
knew about up down and strange and also
when I say quarks I'm putting a modern
language on something which at the time
was not so resolved as quarks so I'm
giving my it's a revisionist history I'm
using the language of quarks even though
they didn't use it at the time because
it's easier to explain it and a guy
named kabhi Bois said that what the up
quark mixes with is a linear combination
down cosine theta plus s sine theta and
this linear combination is what is
really the debt of the up quark couples
- in the weak interaction this linear
combination and this angle was called
the kabhi bow angle it always has been
well
kobayashi and maskawa before before the
existence of the top and bottom quark
said the following thing they said
imagine a world in which we had six
quarks imagine a world in which we had
six quarks then these three would met
and there would be a linear combination
of down strange and bottom that would
appear here and what linear combination
you get which it was just determined by
um sort of matrix algebra with certain
free parameters and they showed though
that if you did the little matrix
algebra the linear combination of these
quarks is expressed in terms of a
unitary matrix quantum mechanics let me
get unitary matrices and but there was a
way to reduce that unitary matrix by
making phase rotations so it ended up
the linear combination had four
parameters oh there was a four parameter
linear combination and one of those
parameters though they realized would
give rise to the violation of time
reversal or CP violation so that which
had already been observed in the in the
world cuz Fitch and Cronin had already
shown that time reversal or CP violation
which is actually the same thing is not
a good symmetry of the world so what
they realized is that if they extended
the quark model to include another quark
they could cat they could account for CP
violation and that's a good prediction I
mean if you can extend the theory
account for CP violation and then those
quarks are discovered well then you
really had a good insight in advance and
what's amazing is that those four
parameters which make up something
called the ckm matrix the the khabib Oh
kobayashi maskawa matrix those four
parameters are determined by at least 50
experiments so you have four parameters
and least fifty data points and they're
consistent in other words you know the
four numbers in the Kobayashi maskawa
predict 50 different experiments
consistently so that's it's a beautiful
theory of quark mixing which in advance
predicted CP violation in the standard
model and has correctly parameterised
the weak interaction mixings
since its invention
so it's a very deserving prize in my
opinion I mean why they left out could
be Bowl I don't know yes sure about what
well the most favourite value based on
current data except for the fact that
it's excluded a bit bigger than 115
right no no they're not because they
weigh 80 and 90 GeV Oh Oh big oh oh oh
oh why did we find oh just because
they're produced in different channels
oh you're saying how can we find the 90
G we've already produced the top quark
which weighs 170 GeV it's because it
sticks out more it's because the
signature at the top is much more
striking than the signature of the Higgs
and the production cross-section is much
higher so it's just a question of signal
it's a question of signal it's not a
question necessary the mass we have the
energy to produce the Higgs but you have
to have the signal you have to multiply
the probability of making it by the
luminosity times the probability of
detection times the number of years you
run your detector and you know the Higgs
the top court could be made and the
other one couldn't it's a question of
the details of the production
cross-sections you know one thing I
haven't said though you know well I mean
I have only I've only had an hour and
I'm going over but I have not you know
at all dealt upon alternative theories
or weirdness I've been giving you kind
of a very Orthodox and down-to-earth
picture of what the LHC is I'm just
staying very grounded here we could
press me to get more you know far out
but I don't want to do that right away
because I think it's important to
understand the framework in which the
far-out theories might be what they're
competing with I think it's important to
understand what the far-out theories are
competing with there was a question yeah
there were no predictions for these
particles for well no okay wait a second
the W plus minus and the Z they were
predicted that's a very good quote the
quark s' no predictions the doublet well
no well let me let me be very rough
about it basically no predictions here
the W mass was predicted precisely in
advance of its discovery and the Z boson
mass was discovered and the Z boson mass
was predicted precisely in advance of
its discovery and that aided the
discovery and in fact it aided it so
much that if you look at the original
data sets which got found the the W
boson okay they knew the mass and those
data sets which they used to claim the
existence were no longer past the the
cuts or the consistency related
requirements for the for the later data
analysis in other words they claimed the
discovery because they knew it was there
based on crappy data and then they
didn't even include that data in the
later data analysis because they were so
sure they had seen it and they did so it
helps to know in advance what you're
looking for and they certainly knew
about the mass of the W and the Z before
they were found and you know rubia and
event or somebody or other won the Nobel
Prize for finding that at CERN hmm no
because the problem the problem with the
mass of the Higgs is that we don't have
a clear prediction of its mass value we
don't know in advance what its mass
value is we just have a little bit of
inference from preexisting data whereas
the W mass was predicted dead-on I mean
it was known it was gonna be 80 GeV and
it was found at 80 GeV and the that was
done by you know Steve Weinberg and the
Z mass was predicted 90 GeV that really
helped find it and the Higgs is
unconstrained there's no advance number
there's just a window and the window is
big but the window you know has there's
a bias in the window based on
pre-existing data but there's no
predicted single number and the top core
people were shocked
wait 170 GMA I mean before the top quark
was discovered knowing imagined you
could have a quark that weighed so much
the the lightest other quark is the
bottom quark it weighs 5 GeV and the top
quark came in weighing twice the W in
this a I mean the top quark is just so
far out there very few people imagined
that the top core could weigh 170 GB
it's really high yeah yeah ok that's a
big question the question is you know
what are the wz and all the other force
carriers that's a big question but let
me just say the following thing in the
in the electromagnetic theory in
electromagnetism there is it's basically
a theory of electrons and muons
interacting electromagnetically and
there's a force carrier particle called
the photon and and the photon is a
massless spin-1 particle which you know
is seen all the time it's hitting
photons they're hitting your eyes and
its associated though in this theory
with a force in other words there's kind
of always this in in quantum field
theory or in elementary particle physics
the forces are associated with particles
the exchange of particles gives rise to
forces and in a sense it's the exchange
of photons that gives rise to Coulomb
forces so in the electromagnetic theory
there's charged particles and the photon
well there are other interactions in
nature for example there's a thing
called beta decay if you put a neutron
on the table and you wait a few minutes
it will spontaneously decay into a
proton and two neutrinos okay no pro
excuse me a proton an anti electron and
a neutrino I misspoke I have to conserve
charge a neutron goes to a proton and
anti electron and indeed no I got that
wrong Neutron goes to proton electron
because and a neutrino and antineutrino
I don't know I can't get it straight but
a neutron decays
into some things okay now that the that
reaction is mediated by a force called
the weak force and the force carriers of
the weak force are the W plus minus and
Z and they they are an integral part of
the theory of the weak interactions
now you're probably you know you know
weak interactions are very very
important in in processes in the Sun and
in in in in in certain kinds of
reactions but they they have less impact
on your everyday life which is probably
why you don't know that much about them
even though they're a fundamental force
and they have a lot of wonderful
properties they don't impact your
day-to-day life as much as let's say the
electromagnetic force so but these
particles are part an integral part of
what's called the standard electroweak
theory this model was written down by
Weinberg and it all meant it in a way by
Glashow and Salam and others and it
gives you a consistent way in which
particles can undergo beta decay in
which the the Z boson can decay into
neutrinos and all kinds of reactions
which are important for burning in the
Sun etc and one of the ingredients of
this is the Higgs boson and the Higgs
boson is a particle which is integral to
this discussion but whose mass is not
predicted by the theory and it's the one
we're waiting to see I don't know how
much more specific I can be the other
force carriers which I did not mention
are the force carriers of the strong
interaction those are called gluons and
there are eight gluons and the reason
they're called gluons is they glue the
proton together they keep the quarks
together and the theory of the strong
interactions which is really the theory
of what holds the proton together what
holds nuclei together is called
sometimes quantum chromodynamics
and that has been very successfully
tested but with much less precision than
the theory of the weak interaction and
that's basically because it's my
charted to do precise calculations in
the theory of the strong interactions
and the weak interactions basically
because we do a perturbative expansion
and the perturbation theory is in a very
large coupling constant and in quantum
electrodynamics and the weak interaction
we do perturbation theory in a small
parameter we have much better control so
there those are the other I didn't
mention those so but we would complete
this list entirely if I include the
photon which I write as a gamma and the
third and the eight gluons and now now
if I include the a clue once the photon
and the Higgs the W plus minus and the Z
and the twelve fermions that's the
entire standard model there are no other
particles in nature Oh graviton yeah I'm
not talking about gravity I don't know
what talk matter is made of those are
great great mystery you know I don't
know what dark matter is made of there
or you know that's a very very good
question I mean I just was talking about
the LHC that what what the query is
about is dark matter now I think most of
you know that if you look out with a
telescope and you look out in the sky
and you look at objects very very far
away you see only objects you basically
only see objects that are luminous
that's what you see with a telescope
objects that are emitting and um dark
matter is matter out there which is not
emitting it's not glowing you don't see
it with the telescope but you can infer
its existence and the reason you can
infer its existence is because for
example if you look at a galaxy and you
look at the galaxy and it's it's
spinning around its center and the way
you can measure that spin is looking at
the Doppler shifts of the stars in the
galaxy and you see that some part of the
galaxy is coming towards you and some
part is coming away from you and you can
then look at it head edge on and you can
look at the velocity versus the distance
from the center and you can use that
simply using Newtonian mechanics just
Newtonian mechanics and if I give you
the velocity
versus distance relation for a object
you can infer the mass inside the region
that the outer things see they at the
outer from the outer particles for any
given radius you can figure out how much
mass is inside to give that orbit those
orbital characteristics and from that
you infer that galaxies have ten times
more mass than they are luminous and
there are many other meant there are
many other reasons to suggest that the
universe is filled with with dark matter
at least ten times or more the amount of
ordinary matter there are also reasons
to suspect that this matter is not made
of ordinary protons and neutrons and the
reason has to do with interact with Big
Bang nucleosynthesis you know we know we
have a very good fossil record for what
the universe looked like shortly after
the Big Bang I haven't made any
connections to the Big Bang here I
haven't had time but we have a very good
fossil record for what the universe
looked like right after the Big Bang and
that fossil record is the abundance of
elements around us the composition of
stars the composition of the
interstellar medium and all of that can
be very very well understood by
understanding simple particle physics
processes when the universe was hot and
small and if you look at those processes
you can infer the amount of Mad Dog of
baryonic will ordinary matter and the
amount of matter which you get from that
is sort of consistent with what we
observe today for luminous matter which
suggest therefore that the dark matter
is not ordinary so when the sky says to
me what do I think you know dark matter
is I don't know I mean it could be the
the most happiest thing it could be the
best thing to be is if dark matter is a
form of elementary particle which is not
like a proton or a neutron not that I
use the word baryonic that means that it
undergoes the strong interactions but a
form of dark matter that dark matter is
a nonbaryonic form of matter which is
somehow made
lah say if the LHC produces a new type
of particle which can then be identified
as the dark matter that'll be huge
because it'll make a wonderful
connection between cosmology and
particle physics and we would be very
very turned on by that but me I have my
own little pet theories for what
Technicolor
barrier Tecna baryons I have my own pet
theories but I don't have anything I
would really bet big money on yes oh if
the question is good is it possible that
you know dark matter is just a particle
like this but something which has a
different mass or something well one
thing is it can't be light because if
it's for example if it's like those
particle it's it's charged
well you there have been so many
particle accelerator experiments to date
in which you've collided together things
which through the electromagnetic
interaction would make charged particles
there are no unknown charged particles
which are being produced
electromagnetically assuming it's Charts
and it interacts in a normal way
electromagnetic light I don't care what
other property has if it weighed under
200 GV it would have already been made
at lap or some other accelerator so it
seems very very hard to imagine that
there are particles which look like
these which are light because we would
have made them in accelerator
experiments
it would have been produced so that
seems unlikely whether if could Dark
Matter be a very heavy non decaying
lepton maybe you know could it be some
super-heavy electron but then you have
to tell me why it's not decaying because
you see the tau decays to the mule and
the Mew
to the electron so when you say if it
was like these guys then they typically
decay down so you'd have to stabilize it
in some way so dark matter is a pretty
tricky business because it has to be a
form of matter which is not like
ordinary quarks it has to be stable and
it has to have avoided detection to date
so it's a very great mystery I mean it's
a huge and wonderful mystery and if the
LHC finds dark matter that'll be the
best thing imaginable but of course
you'd have to prove it's the same thing
as what's out there and people there are
direct dark matter detection experiments
on earth but obviously they haven't
found dark matter or I would have told
you about it well because they have very
very weak scattering that's right good
question well sometimes people stipulate
that the dark matter whatever very very
weak additional forces and then when you
make a dark matter model you have to
contrive it so that it just is on the
edge of being seen by the existing
experiments but has avoided detection to
date I'm and usually the that's not the
easiest thing to do yeah a lot of
questions glad they'd come right here
that's absolutely right well you see
you're absolutely right about that the
neutrinos being left-handed if a
particle is massless so you used to
think the neutrinos were massless we now
know they're not if a particle is
massless then it can it can never be
seen at rest so you can only you can
there it has no rest frame so as long as
it has no rest frame its shooting along
in a very high velocity and then you can
measure its angular momentum and see it
points opposite to the direction of
momentum but you're absolutely right if
a particle has a nonzero mass and it
looks left-handed in in let's say the
lab frame
if you get into a frame in which it's
going the other way it will flip to be
right-handed well we take care of that I
mean I can't really explain that but
yeah but an example of that is the
electron for example when when well for
example if a PI on which is a particle
decays into oh no that's not good
a PI plus a PI plus the caves into let's
say an e plus and a neutrino this is a
particle at the Kayson to this these
guys come out back-to-back so the
neutrino is left-handed and this
electron oh man I'm not saying this -
well this electron sort of a bad example
it wants to be left-handed but it can't
because the conservation of energy out
conservation of angular momentum I can't
do justice to this it's it's okay we
could I can't do justice to this fast
enough I mean I have it under control
I really do it's just not obvious it's
really okay we can deal with particles
having mass and still have parity
violation and if you get in the frame in
which they're going the other way they
flip their hand in there since all okay
it's all okay just can't deal with it
now well you have to any questions
someone else yeah by the what
oh well oh sure once we open up the
floodgates of alternative models then
the list gets endless right if I for
example if I say the most common thing
one of the things that people love to
talk about is supersymmetry now
supersymmetry is the symmetry which is
exists in almost every string theory and
string theory is very very popular so a
lot of people think that a lot of people
think that supersymmetry should be found
in nature
okay now supersymmetry is a symmetry
which tells you that you can have a that
for every fermionic state of Fermi oh
and there's a boson with the same mass
and for every boson state there's a
Fermi on with the same mass so if the
world was super symmetric then the
electron would have a boson ik meaning a
spin zero friend called I think thus
electron with the same mass and the muon
would have a boson ik friends this
dismiss um thing with the same mass and
everybody else would have the Higgs
would have a Higgs II know which would
be fermionic and there'll be all these
particles right and that there are
certain mathematical reasons why that
might be a very nice thing to have the
trouble is it ain't cell right there is
no boson ik partner of the election
there's no charge spin zero particle
that weighs half a million electron
volts we would have seen that that would
not have been able to avoid detection so
all of the supersymmetric partners of
these particles have to be somehow
another you have to explain why their
masses are not the masses of their
partners and why their masses are so
high that we would not have yet seen
those particles and in order to do that
you have to break supersymmetry so you
have to impose a symmetry and then you
have to violate it and the violation has
to be strong enough to shoot the masses
of those particles up so
but in in a supersymmetric version of
the standard model every particle here
has a counterpart the fermions have
bosanna counterparts the bosons have
fermionic counterparts and there's a
plethora of new particles and there are
a huge number of new parameters which
you can use to help fit the data so this
so the the supersymmetry is very popular
as a thing to look for one of the
reasons is because it is consistent
string theory predicts it the other
thing is it's very definite the other
thing is it has enough parameters that
you can make it agree with the
predictions of the standard model and
also there are some supersymmetric
candidates for dark matter and that's a
nice thing because if you have a super
symmetric Dark Matter candidate well you
know maybe you killed two birds with one
stone well well you kill one bird with
one stone I guess you get the dark
matter and then you get to find the
supersymmetric particle at the LHC so
that would be great I mean if they found
a supersymmetric particle at the LHC
which was the dark matter that would be
very compelling but there's a lot of
baggage that comes with that extension
of the standard model like it's another
particle for every particle which has
not yet been observed which i think is a
lot good do what the fossil record I met
the Big Bang yeah yes
you know is there evidence let's say in
like cosmic microwave background
radiation or something like that for
dark matter I believe not maybe speaking
out of turn but I believe the following
you know there is this cosmic microwave
background radiation and it's
anisotropic it originally people thought
it was you had to be the same everywhere
in the sky but it's turned out that has
variation in the sky and that variation
it can be accounted for by the
inflationary model of the universe and
by certain assumptions in elementary
particle physics and I believe that
there's a thing now called the Vennela
model which vanilla means just the
plainest model in which you assume a
certain amount of non baryonic dark
matter a certain amount of dark energy
we haven't talked about dark energy at
all and I believe that it's all
consistent with there being the even the
cut even the cosmic microwave background
radiation data is consistent with there
being a nonbaryonic dark matter
component to the matter density of the
universe so that hangs together I've
been not going into that because I want
to talk about the LHC you know yeah
well yeah these you are made of up and
down quarks and of electrons and you
know you don't see too many neutrinos
are going right through you right now
but because neutrinos are emitted from
the Sun and from supernovae and right
now they're out how many billions of
neutrinos going through you so there's
certainly neutrinos going through you
routinely and that you will and it's all
three types of neutrinos that go through
you so you're being constantly bombarded
by three generations of neutrinos so
those certainly pass through the earth
all the time but these charged particles
when they are made they decay rapidly so
these can only be seen in the following
environments in an accelerator in the
early universe or in a cosmic ray event
you know there are cosmic rays which
have extremely energetic particles which
hit the upper atmosphere and so the
origin of those cosmic rays is not
totally understood but when those cosmic
rays hit the upper atmosphere they
create showers of particles and they
create these guys who then rapidly decay
so these particles are not they're not
they're not again though I want to
emphasize they are not building blocks
of the world around you but from a
particle physics standpoint they are all
equally fundamental because again you
only make things out of stable particles
and the fact that it's stable makes
usually you make it but from my point of
view these are equally interesting I
don't care that I'm made of up quarks
the trama is interesting to me yeah
right
right I don't know I don't know why you
see those why questions I don't have
answers to why are there eight gluons
why is there a W plus minus and C why is
there a Higgs why are there three
generations why do these particles have
the masses those big y questions we
don't know the answer to
that's why particle physics is still
reaching C again maybe I should end soon
but the real frustration in particle
physics which is that there are these
Big Y questions like why three
generations why eight gluons why this is
a variety of particles why is it the
mixing angles what they are why you know
you could ask maybe why is parity
violated although I would ask why
shouldn't it be violated but okay fine
so there are all these why questions but
then when you take the detailed model
you turn the crank and you make
predictions
everything's perfect so that's puts in a
very tough spot then would be easier if
you had contradictions puts us in a
tough spot
but that's experimental that's not
really theoretical I don't have a deep I
don't have a profound reason for that I
just have experimental evidence that
there was in the fourth generation but
if you said to me Mathematica get the
data could you mathematically add to the
standard model another generation I
would have no problem oh just write it
down you get them name or whatever you
want I'm gonna math to people in the
room I'll just put them in there and
they'll be part of the standard model I
could do that in other words what would
be interesting is if you said to me no
if you put that into the theory you're
gonna get a mathematical contradiction
or you're gonna you know your theory is
gonna predict two equals seven oh you're
gonna predict you know the probability
of something happening is bigger than
one or something like that then you say
well can't can't have it but no I have
no problem
accommodating another generation I would
have no problem changing the masses of
these particles
well I mean well if I eliminated that
WNC I'd be eliminating a force of nature
I mean that's you know that would be
probably no right I thought you said no
if I eliminated WNC I'd be eliminating
the weak interaction well yeah the ninth
gluon probably is not consistent with
experiment I mean there there are some
structures which we do have but the
structures are not as constraining as we
would like yeah there would be hard to
have nine gluons but those are kind of
technicals sure Oh huge in other words
when when a neutron star explodes I
think half of its energy goes out in
neutrinos and and it's yeah when a
neutron I think I forget the number
because I'm not an astrophysicist but I
think hafnia when a neutron star
explodes half the energy comes out in
neutrinos and and neutrinos do sometimes
come in for example after supernova
1987a you know there was a supernova
explosion a huge amount of energy came
out from that in neutrinos and those
neutrinos passed through an underground
detector and were picked up so neutrinos
sometimes do interact we do see them we
saw the neutrinos emitted from a
supernova so you know neutrinos carry
huge amounts of energy in Astrophysical
environments no no neutrinos don't
account for the dark matter no oh I
meant the energy carried out it wasn't
the mass no when the supernova explodes
it's the the neutrinos only have a
little bit of mass when the neutrino
aquitted supernova explodes excuse me
the energy that comes out is the kinetic
energy of the neutrinos yeah yeah
things can be used oh oh he's asking
about the detection you know I don't
really know I mean if you look at the
LHC there's these massive you know
strings of wires and silicon detectors
and bubble and chambers and I don't know
I'm out of my depth there I don't really
know how those things work I just have a
g-wiz attitude
i no more know how you know i have no
more idea how the LHC works let me know
how my cell phone works
you know I yeah
but should we should we stop well it's
okay that's not the problem what I take
one more question of tilaka I think you
probably me to shut up shit god yes well
that's a good question yeah that's
called the question of confinement and
that I think you know there why don't
you get past well he's asking there is
kind of an understanding of that from
the strong interactions he's saying that
you know if you find objects like the
proton they have three quarks and if you
find an object like the pi plus it's
made of a quark and an antiquark and we
seem to only get those combinations but
that seems to be consistent with the
theory I would say the theory of the
strong interactions kind of explains
that I can't explain that now but I can
assure you that the theory of the strong
interactions explains it so that that is
probably understood I would say that's
understood by the theory of the strong
interactions we do have a theory of the
strong interactions and it takes care of
that okay okay well thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
