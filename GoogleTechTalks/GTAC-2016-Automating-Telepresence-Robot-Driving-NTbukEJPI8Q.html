conference so far we're going to keep
that rolling we have Tanya Jenkins who's
going to tell us about automating the
telepresence robot thank you hi everyone
oh wow I don't the thing is I don't have
this bear with me yes
great thank you good morning how's
everybody doing all right good
let me ask you something have you ever
had a project an automation project that
was so challenging that by the end by
the time you got to the end of it you
were so happy and it was so satisfying
and it really made a difference in your
career
well I'm Tanya Jenkins and for the next
30 minutes I'm going to tell you about
that how that project affected me this
is great
automated telepresence robotic driving
so what does it mean to be present in
the 21st century the idea of presence
involves hearing seeing and interacting
with your environment technology has
allowed us to redefine what it means to
actually be present before you had to be
face to face with someone now you can be
in different rooms and technology took
us to a place where we're in different
rooms and we could hear each other but
we couldn't see each other then
teleconferencing came along and what
could we do we could see each other and
we could hear each other but we still
couldn't interact with each other and
what did that mean we couldn't say you
know and who's in the room we couldn't
say I want to go outside we just had to
deal with proxy someone else would have
to do everything that we needed so I
think
we can all agree that everyone in this
room is present with respect to me right
but what about the people that are
streaming live on YouTube are they
present well they can see us they can
hear us but they can't interact in a
meaningful way and that really makes a
difference so what do you think are they
present well what about that guy is he
really present I mean he can see maybe
if it's on the back of his eyelids you
can hear yeah you know how it is when
you're asleep but he's affecting in his
environment in some way we agree he's
physically there so you can think about
that is he present what about this guy
is he present hi Brett
how you doing everybody back here Brett
so this is a beam telepresence system
and this is what I test so Brad's here
he's present he can see you you can see
him he can hear us
we can hear him is he present well if I
walk over here can Brad follow me Oh
what about if I go this way so this is
the difference between conferencing
teleconferencing and being there
Brad's present thank you buddy this is
for him oh I'm not loud enough
oh we're switching okay thank you it's
like you always have to be ready for
these things so Brad could be anywhere
where are you today
sorry Brad's in Palo Alto so Brad could
be anywhere he'd be in London he could
be in New York he can be in Tokyo he
could be in Paris and it doesn't matter
because he's here with us today
do you feel like you're here since
telepresence is action at a distance
Brad can be anywhere as I said all but
what makes him present is that he can
interact in the environment and that has
to do with the driving so that's why
driving is important in telepresence
thanks Brad so I'm just going to show
you a quick video and this is and bear
with me does that make it play I'm not
really sure how to make it play from
here but I can talk through it basically
this video is to show us
I just lost okay great thank you
that's not seems like Sam wants to be
here - sorry that's that's the video and
it's a quick marketing video and I'm not
trying to market it believe me I think
it markets itself when it's here but
what I really want to show you is that
the beam can be in any environment from
anywhere from corporate America to
manufacturing to arts here we go
great thank you to the arts so we have
docents in museums etc it can even be in
medical situations and one of the things
that's important is to understand that
each of those people we call these
pilots each of those pilots has their
own experience that they need they need
to be they need to be on a system that's
reactive and easy to navigate they want
to feel like they're walking if they're
going somewhere they want to feel like
they can move seamlessly and they don't
have to worry about driving the beam I'm
driving the beam I'm driving the beam
they want to just say oh there's Jim I
want to go see him
Oh Karen wait up for me and that's what
this is the amazing thing is that these
are all different environments and yet
the beam can move around in all of them
so what was my challenge in this my
challenge was to understand that each of
those people each of those pilots
whether it's a CEO or a doctor or a
nurse or a docent in in a museum all of
those people wanted to feel that ease
and that simplicity so I had to focus on
something and that was the driving so
great
see if I can okay great Oh we'll get
that back thank you
well anyway while we're doing that so
you can be anywhere and this is
important the doctor has a specialized
relationship with the team that the
doctors dealing with the CEO wants to
see the different people that they're
talking to and the manufacturer wants to
see what's on the floor so now that we
know a person can be present anywhere
how do you test that as I said I kind of
narrowed it down to the driving and that
experience and how do you automate
something like that well you have to
figure out what the differences are in
testing telepresence one of the things
that that really struck me when I
started using this system was that the
validation of the system goes beyond the
UI it goes from looking at what the beam
is doing at any given point tracking the
position and orientation of it and
understanding how that affects the the
pilot I had to look at the challenges of
manual versus automation like when the
previous presentation we talked about
percentages of coverage well I couldn't
even look at it from that perspective it
was how do you get that thing done
automation test control challenges how
do you get the thing to work how do you
get the thing to move by itself and also
do I need a dedicated test environment I
think so
so start with this challenge
tell the president's testing is more
than UI testing when you're a pilot and
you can see it the picture on the right
when you're a pilot this is what you see
you see what's in front of you about 105
degrees and you see what's below you and
that's really good because that's kind
of like walking right you walk you skim
ahead just to make sure you don't trip
over something or run into something but
you translate that to automation I mean
we have sophisticated systems now where
you can you know you have object
tracking recognition but that's kind of
not what we're talking about here
because all of those environments that I
spoke about the hospital the museum and
you really don't want to run into
something in a museum with this weighs
about a hundred pounds you have to
figure out how to map that to well what
am I seeing at any given point where am
i and what orientation am I in so this
is just a quick overview of the beam
telepresence system you have as I
mentioned a pilot which is what Brad is
and he's using a pilot application we
called our client application and
basically he is directly connected to
his beam but sometimes that requires
that if a lot of people are using beans
or network we run over to a relay and
that in and of itself introduces some
issues like latency that we'd have to
deal with in testing so what about the
challenges of manual versus automated as
I mentioned we had when I and when I
first went to suitable technologies
which does the beam there was one tester
and he was manual so you could imagine
you know how startup is you get there
and it's like great I'm gonna automate
and they're like well there's some
manual tests we have to do so you know
if you're like me immediately like how
can I automate it how can I automate
they had to desktop platforms the window
and Mac they also had just one being
device that one and one driving input
device so you could use your keyboard
your arrow keys and that's it and you
would drive around with that but of
course as we evolved we became bigger
and had more desktop platforms including
mobile Linux chrome we had three beam
devices this one is just this one
actually has lighter because there's so
many people around which I'll talk about
later but it's objects of avoidance
we also had
that did not have that and we have a
little one that is really for home use
consumer product so you can imagine
start multiplying that by the number of
times you actually rev the app or Rev
the beam software or rev the relays or
Rev anything in the infrastructure that
grew from a hundred tests and one guy to
one guy needing to run a thousand tests
it was not happy and so I started
thinking really deeply about how we
could automate the parts that he could
do you know everybody here you can
automate a UI that's that's really easy
in the sense of you know getting it to
click things etc but what you really
really really need is with with beam
testing is that it's not that simple
it's not just that UI it is everything
behind it all of it coming together and
making sure that the beam is where it's
supposed to be so you know he looked at
me and he's like help so I said I'll see
what I can do to help you automate these
tests so the test control challenges
I'll just run through these what do you
use for that how do you handle the
different controls now we have keyboard
we have mouse we have gamepad and each
of those has different permutations
within itself how do you how do you
connect that all up and get it to
systematically run he was happy if I
could just hook them all up to different
things and just run around and have the
buttons click he would have been happy
with that how do you track the beams
movement how do you know where it is
you're not in the same place where a
beam is brad's in Palo Alto how does he
know where the beam is aside from seeing
but again automation you don't have a
pilot and how do you retrieve whatever
information it is that you use to track
that device well again if you all are
like me you look really big first I'm
that person I like to think about oh
gosh what can I use what's the greatest
thing I can use so at the time when I
was contemplating all of this I actually
was taking a robotics course
and we were on the section about drones
my mind blew up I thought oh drones and
I was doing we were talking about slam
and using beacons etc I was like oh
great I just really really really need
to figure out how I can do that and have
beacons in the room and cameras and
drawers would slow down slow down
but the beacons was that was a really
good idea because the beam has two
cameras it has a forward facing camera
and a down facing camera and if you know
anything about how you use beacons with
drones you can have a beacon which is
just basically like a QR code let's just
make it that simple a QR code that if
you hover over it it can give you
whatever information you want so I
thought downward facing camera put
beacons all over the floor of a lab that
would be awesome and then the beam could
drive and it could know where it is at
any given point if I just take a you
know take a snap of that QR code but
then I realized wow laying out all of
that stuff on the floor and mounting
cameras and you know the the floor
becomes fragile you can't walk on it
it's only for the beam and what happens
when it rips up and yeah that was just
but it was really fun to think about so
option two I said let me go simple
because probably the solution is
somewhere in between those two places so
I thought how about just simply text on
a wall I could use OCR and again use the
forward facing camera drive some amount
of some known amount of distance and see
what I see if I see like you know put
left on one wall right on another wall
straight you know all those words if I
see the right word yeah I know I'm in
the right direction I know my
orientation is right but we're talking
about position and orientation not just
orientation and not just position so
that wasn't good enough because yeah I
just know where I'm facing but I
wouldn't know how close I am to my
target so what was the last last thing
so what would give me something that's
right position and orientation well as
you can see on the front of that beam
and as I mentioned lidar so that was my
thought and that
was actually the biggest challenge to
figure out what exactly it is to track
the babes position so in a nutshell let
me answer the test control challenges
that I talked about I use frog logic
squish our application is based in QT so
I used squish which has a QT layer and
hooks right in I use Python because
python is great there's so many modules
available with it
also it's just really flexible how do I
track the beams and movement or sorry
how to handle the driving controls well
I actually abstract it I took every
device and made a library for it it
would became an object and I could pass
that into the test script really easily
pass it in and the test didn't care what
it was running and I I knew and I passed
information out and all of a sudden that
was so much simpler I also wrote an API
for driving and abstracted the driving
controls based on the objects so it made
it very simple how did I track the beams
movement and positions as I mentioned it
was a lidar decided to install the light
or in the lab and then just figure out
how to take reading but I drove I made a
course and at each part of the course I
would then take measurements or actually
the script when I say I you know I'm
kind of connected to my script now it's
like my baby I think you guys understand
that this script would take the the you
know start up the lidar and take the
measurements and that would be get at at
every spot in the automated driving
course so how am I going to retrieve
this information once I had it well I
the script would remote log into a nook
that I had in the lab start up the lidar
and start taking the measurements
retrieving that info also I should
mention the beam knows where it is at
any given point not because of GPS but
it tracks its rotations of the wheels
and it has a motor board and we can get
information from that so I use that as a
sec
point of Confirmation so I have the lab
the measurements I know my expected
values it has the values that it wanted
and the cool thing or that it expected
the cool thing from that is that now I
was validating yet another part of the
beam I wasn't even thinking about that
but it really came out to be a good
thing in the end of this okay so what is
lidar lidar and I have it with the
different spellings because there are so
many different permutations of it but
it's a surveying method that measures
distance using laser light and it's
great at lumen illuminates the target so
basically it uses reflection and you
know speed of light it shoots a laser
hits an object gets the information back
about how far that light that beam of
light traveled so I did an animation to
kind of jazz things up to show you
actually how the lighter works so this
is a sample scan this is not actually
for my lab but this kind of gives you a
visualization the dark portions that the
bright pink that shows intensity so that
means that there's something there that
and the lighter is in the center of the
the cross and where you see the pink
that is actually things where the light
can go through so something that might
be opaque or translucent I'm sorry and
then the green is actually the vectors
for each shot of the laser and it's
scanning the whole time that we're that
it's running so it's spinning and
sending out the laser pulses so at the
end of those green spots you'll see you
may see the dark red that's actually
where the light was reflected the laser
light reflected back and that's where
you get the measurements so you set up
your labs so that any particular vector
it covers what you want the distance the
measurement that you want the distance
for so here is the dedicated test
automation equipment that I had
I have the beam of course and a dock
because you have to keep it charged the
Hoku your lighter and enough small
form-factor computer now one of the
things I experienced when I was trying
this out I was really excited and I put
the I put the beam in the room and lidar
and I couldn't tell the orientation and
I realized it was because it's the beam
is symmetric and we're looking at the
base not the top the base is symmetric
so I had to modify the base but of
course you don't want to make the base
heavier you don't want to change the
test very much you don't want to change
the test equipment because that would
skew your results so I you know I'm at a
robotics company and I have lots of
things available I had the lidar that
was you know part of what we had in our
equipment room we have all this great
stuff so I'm like what can I modify this
with I took a cup I taped it with
painters tape it actually worked
it made it asymmetric so I thought that
was a fun thing it's like you know party
cup on on the beam so here's a here's a
shot of the lab it's non-traditional
because usually when you have a lab it's
a software lab or it's a hardware lab
but this is actually a lab for the beams
so they're the only computer in there is
the nook which I mentioned earlier and
that's that's the actual room with the
beans so there were safety concerns I
had to have an isolated room as I
mentioned the beam weighs about a
hundred pounds so you really don't want
that to be running around without a
pilot who can say oh stop there's
someone in the way because we would be
running over everyone that walked by you
just don't want to take out the
employees until the products out at
least so the room considerations as I
mentioned isolation but this is not just
this is my lab but this is not just for
this testing I have to beam into the dr.
Beeman
that's what Brad's that's what we call
it I have to beam into a lab into the
being about 30 times in a couple of
tests I have I have loop tests and all
this and you could imagine sitting next
to the first time you're here you're
like oh great then you become trained to
the fact that someone's coming on and so
you start looking at a beam when you
hear the tell-tale noise and then people
start getting annoyed with you can you
take that somewhere else Brad do you
hear that if you were if you could hear
the sound that's Brad he's coming back
in now and you it's very audible so we
wanted to make sure that that was
isolated and that no one had you know
any problems that and it's also
interferes from the outside because when
I'm doing audio tests or something like
that I want to make sure that those
tests are that you know the value of
those tests are proper lighting natural
and man-made light man-made fluorescent
above and as you can see from the back
of the picture that's the that was the
light from outside the cool thing is
that this light actually affects lidar
so there's some great tests that we can
do it certain parts of the day so that's
it the flooring have to mention that so
that's just common corporate flooring
this it's important believe it or not
because you're talking about rolling
over a surface and if it's not the right
kind of surface you you actually if the
density is different than average you
will not get the right measurements so
here's another animation and believe me
you once you see the actual driving
course you'll understand why I did an
animation of it for you the beam starts
at the dock it drives to position B I
take a measurement or the script takes a
measurement there it turns to towards C
take a measurement there it turns back
to the center then turns the other way
take a measurement there drives back
backs up take measurements all those
points and then it's self Parks and
that's yet another feature it's a really
cool thing
it'll align itself on to the dock so
that it's always charging so just wanted
to make sure you kind of saw that so
when you see the actual thing it's this
is a little more exciting but it's cool
so data collection it's important
tracking when I'm tracking the position
and orientation of the bean it's
important to have the right type of data
collection so what did I have to collect
well as I mentioned earlier it would be
the position and orientation information
about the beam at any given point so in
that in the previous slide I showed you
at the different points I mentioned
where I take those measurements it's
important that you you do the same ones
I mean we all do test automation so I
don't really have to explain that in
that sense but it's important especially
from the distance perspective that you
go to the same point every time and you
let the lidar scan at that point so the
I took measurements and I haven't
expected distance traveled and that
information is correlated with the beams
information which is reported back
through a special client that we have
and also the motor board the the motor
board information my expected values and
also the lidar all of those are compared
and I have a margin of error and if it's
within the margin of error it passes so
here is actually the automated driving
course on the left you'll see that is
the view from the test beam the beam
goes into the room and does its thing
and I had to have you know a fake pilot
so I brought on my evil minion to lord
over the test scores could someone play
the video on the right for me or if I
can play it up here I didn't want to
touch anything thank you so this is
actually the video a video of the actual
course in my lab when the test is
running the interesting thing about this
what what did I gain from this I went
into this you know whole hog I wanted to
make sure that I could figure out
everything and understand what the
challenges were I thought I had
everything worked out we often do but I
was again expecting something to go
wrong because yeah that's how life is
and things go wrong
I learned that I loved doing this this
is crazy I love the fact that the I
could find something that would give me
the information I want and I could
cobble together a system that would
effectively test what I wasn't expecting
was that there were really small things
that normally a human pilot would see
and they would just say I'll move on but
on an automated test when you're saying
hey go forward for four seconds which
given the speed of the system you know
it should be six feet if there's a
glitch like latency which happens you
actually don't get the measurements you
want and when you come in the next day
and the test of running all of a sudden
everything's red everything failed oh so
I needed to add something for that and I
had put in all types of things I thought
about it beforehand well if it isn't off
the dock then that's fine I'll you know
I'll start the course again the latency
is what got me and so I had to take that
into account what I did is I've run the
test several times and I grabbed Network
information and I do an average I
checked the average I check how many
times it failed if then that works down
I know what the problem is if the
network was fine then there's something
else that's going wrong the other thing
was when the beam is docked sometimes
even when you do auto parking it will be
charging but it won't be exactly
straight and of course we know if you're
not what the the straight line will give
you the distance you expect but if it's
slightly skewed believe it or not if it
fell outside the margin of error so I
had to adjust the margin of error for
that it was really it was it was really
great
even solving those problems because
that's something I like to do so with
that I hope you enjoyed it I want to
thank you all for listening and dealing
with my am I talking into the clicker or
the microphone at any given point a big
thanks to Brad for taking out some time
to come
and work with me here and we'll say bye
to everybody
thanks and I know we're going into Q&amp;amp;A I
have one that people might be asking the
first one is hey there are beams at
Google can I get access to them if
you're a Google employee you can and you
can do go access beans or beans access
and you can jump on one of the many
beams that are on the campus so thank
you everyone I'm ready for questions ah
very good we actually have one in the
boulder office it's it's fun to play
with but yes I have to say Tanya I have
tested a lot of products in my career
this one looks like the funnest one that
I can imagine so many pranks I could
pool in the name of testing that would
be my dream job but yeah after this
we're gonna have a 30-minute break if
anyone needs to get started I break
early but we're we ran a little late on
Tanya's presentation so I want to give
some time for questions as well so we'll
be doing a few questions here and then
we'll go immediately into a into a break
oh no not your fault at all it's it's
day I go slow oh is this the wrong sorry
refresh
thank you is that the right one here
perfect thanks Diego all right first
question is actually a feature request
to not have the telepath run over people
so I mentioned that we have three
versions there's one version that is the
one that I use for this test because I
don't want to avoid objects it's a
closed lab and I don't want if I get
close to the wall that's fine because
that's a data point right if it's not if
it's against the wall and it should have
been in the middle I want to know about
that
Brad actually is on a being that has
lidar and that has accident avoidance or
object avoidance it will actually slow
down and not hit something and so
basically many most of the corporations
that buy them have lidar on them because
they have a lot of people running around
and they don't want anyone to get hurt
but the point is there's a pilot on
there and if you get run over by a beam
with a pilot they wanted to hit you so
yeah so so that is absolutely part of
the you know the options that you have
on the beam but again the person's
driving so they can see you and they can
see you basically with the same clarity
that most of us can see anyone else
great how about testing other surfaces
inclines non-smooth etc we have a whole
other place for that one of the cool
stories that came out I didn't see this
but this is really cool
someone was driving a beam not with a
lidar and we have basically a it's our I
guess production floor so it's like a
warehouse right and we're upstairs in
engineering and just you know like an
office and a person drove out the door
and the beam went down the steps
and it and then the person's on their
side saying can someone stand me up I'm
alright
they stood him up any drove away so that
thing is really really durable but we do
that's one surface we don't test that
often but we do we have wedges we have
all types of things that we test with
but I think one of the main things that
we do is we crowd so I started testing
within the company
everybody half of our employees are
probably more than half our remote to us
so they're beaming in from other
countries they're beaming in from you
know across the country this country and
they come to meetings on the beam I've
been in a meeting where there was one
person and our CEO likes to call it a
meet body okay um there was one meet
body and 12 beans and we had it we had
our you know we had our meeting and I
think that's that's an important thing
because everybody is in a different
place and we beam out and test different
surfaces in the real world we check in
with our customers etc any questions in
the room but I think we'll take one more
so hey very interesting and you saw the
picture so the liar actually you place
it at the level at which you want to
take those measurements so I have mine
lifted about this much off the floor
because that will just correspond with
hitting the front of the beam so no it
doesn't do that at least this one
doesn't do 3d because it just sends out
one laser you know vector at a time at
the level it's at and the it rotates on
the same surfing plane if you know what
I'm saying so the light comes this way
and the lidar is rotating shooting the
beams this way so it's not a 3d surface
on that plane but everything it hits
in that direction does that make sense
okay what what do you need for me
there's a hole in the floor so basically
the throw down no so you're saying about
where I mounted the light or yeah so I'm
Brad can you come over here I'm sorry
the rest of you probably can't see this
so this little knob on the front that
this is where the lidar is actually
mounted so the obstacle avoidance that
the beam does is actually right it
shoots out from here and spin so
anything at that level it can it can see
and avoid so he's looking down he can
see around himself and so it's really
forward and it's in front of you and if
you mount the light our sideways it'll
stand this way it really is just
oriented the way you want to put the
lidar thanks that answers the question
thank you I'm glad good and maybe we'll
do one more how much does all this cost
if you can give us a quick answer so
this particular version of the beam is
about twenty four thousand twenty
thousand and then the lidar is four
thousand but there's a solution there is
a beam that we sell on Amazon that's
smaller and it's two thousand I think
it's two thousand twenty-five hundred
dollars and that is shorter it has a
smaller screen it weighs less forty
pounds and that usually is for home use
just as not as a plug which is kind of
as an FYI people use it to visit their
family you know their families in
another place they put a beam in a room
oftentimes is in the kitchen which is
really interesting so they can eat
dinner together I don't know about you
guys but when my mom would cook I want
that food so I don't want to see you
eating it I can't have it so that's the
kind of thing that people would use
four and we found that actually a lot of
people use that in the small business
and so when they have you know they
don't have they're not big like Google
or Microsoft or places like that they
buy the smaller one but the other and I
said the one other version is twenty
thousand without the lighter but their
leases available okay now I'm a sales
person there
all right fantastic yep so thank you
everyone enjoy its gift on your hand and
bad and well now we'll take a short
break and started back up again at noon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
