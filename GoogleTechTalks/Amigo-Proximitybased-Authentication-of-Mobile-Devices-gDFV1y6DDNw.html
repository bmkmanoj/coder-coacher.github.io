de Lara from the University of Toronto
talking about proximity based
authentication for mobile devices thanks
al all right hi so today I'm going to
talk about a project whose aim is to
make it easy and secure for people to
interact with devices that just come
upon them over the course of of the day
now why would such a thing be
interesting well there are many possible
applications of of interests that could
benefit from secure auto composition of
devices to give you an example you can
imagine a person to checks in into a
hotel room and they would like to for
instance extend the capabilities of the
mobile phone by for instance pairing it
with let's say a large screen or some
input devices you can imagine people
running into each other and wanting to
exchange information some applications
or even simpler than that having a
hands-free and plugging it or are there
pairing it with your phone and other
applications such as actually using your
devices as electronic wallets to pay for
for stuff so underlying all these
applications is I guess a basic
requirement of establishing a secure
communication channel between the
devices that are going to interact so
different ways in which one could do
that typically one would use public
encryption to do that there are other
possibilities but just bear with me I'm
going to go through one possibility that
uses the diffie-hellman protocol which
make it would probably be very familiar
to you but we're not going to spend too
much time limit so just bear with me for
a second and then we'll see why the
existing techniques are not sufficient
and I'll then describe an approach that
we've taken to augment the existing
techniques so and this is in this case
we're assuming that the two principles
Alice and Bob that want to talk to each
other they have private keys in this
case a and B and they have to somehow
agree on a shared encryption key that
will be used to secure their
communications so this is a watered-down
version of diffie-hellman let's assume
that a takes the initiative and starts
the communication what a has to do is
come up with a random value on Jay and
then it produces the equivalent of a
public key by elevating Jay to the power
G to the power of a and sending that to
Bob now with those two Bob can actually
calculate the encryption key will call
that k by taking g topography and
elevating it by the power of beer his
private key so that la Alice can also
obtain the same key what she will have
to do is well send in this case G to the
power of B which is Bob's private key
and Allison can also calculate K so if
everything went out right k will be the
same with both Alice and Bob so what's
the problem well the problem is that in
a wireless environment it's actually
quite hard to figure out who your device
is actually talking to and there are two
specific attacks on the scheme that I
just described one of them is basically
a spoofing attack when Alice tries to
communicate with Bob we can assume that
there is malicious third party will call
it X and when a starts to communicate
with be well what X
who do is that it basically take be off
the air by you know transmitting assume
X personality effect spoof Bob's
identity after jamming Bob and from them
on basically a communication happens
between Alice and the attacker who is
impersonating Bob another possibility
actually more likely is that we will
have a man-in-the-middle attack where
Alice and Bob are still both working but
we have a third party that will actually
authenticate with both and we'll be able
to see all the communications which
going from from A to B without either of
them knowing in this particular case
what happens is that in reality Alice
authenticates with with the attack of X
and Bob does the same and at the end of
the day they each end up with an
encryption key because it turns out the
encryption key is not the same for for
Alice and Bob now the attacker knows
both so that any content that is sent by
Alice to Bob basically it decrypts it
and then encrypted web with the other
key so it goes completely undetected so
how are we going to fix this problem
well you know fixing this problem in the
general cases is not easy but for the
particular applications that we have in
mind where you're actually interacting
with devices that are nearby well we
think that we can actually take
advantage of the fact that interaction
is with devices that are co-located and
we can take advantage of that colocation
to find a good answer to this problem
now in the rest of this talk I'm going
to be assuming that the devices that
we're trying to pair are actually closer
between them than then the attacker the
attacker is going to be a little bit
farther away than the devices that we're
trying to build PS please
i signal from a distance the question is
why does it matter and whether the
attacker can use a high I guess a high
power signal that's exactly what I'm
assuming I'm assuming that you have an
attacker that may be actually kilometers
away and they have a very powerful
antenna and they're trying to basically
convince us that they are you know next
to us and that we should actually talk
to that but my assumption is that
actually in reality the device with let
em try to pair with you and the attacker
will actually there are two meters
separating us well the distance
separating us from the attacker will be
greater than two meters so the attacker
is actually not in between the two of us
that's the one assumption that I make
all right so this is not a new problem
and some people have proposed different
solutions to it against the simple
solution is just to at least forget of
the wireless part of it when it comes to
authenticating and actually carrying a
cable around so that you use to actually
set up a channel you agree on a key and
from then on you actually use wireless
this is highly impractical because my
guess is nobody's going to be carrying
cables around a more practical somehow
alternative is to try to use short-range
communication to set up the secure
channel and then probably the most
common alternative here is basically
bluetooth which is supposed to have a 10
meter range similar approaches have been
proposed with all the technology such as
infrared ultrasound and near-field
communication is getting a lot of
attention out of lately now the problem
with that is that as a member of the
audience mentioned there could be an
attacker that has a very powerful
antenna and it's actually located very
far away but nevertheless can actually
gives drop on our communication and can
actually inject traffic so you may be
asking yourselves you know about this
image over here that as it turns out is
a nice device called
the blue sniper rifle developed by the
flexus group and what it is it's it's
although it looks like a rifle it's
really not a rifle it's Bluetooth device
that has attached a really powerful
directional antenna and what this little
thing lets this guy do is basically pair
with Bluetooth devices up to a mile away
okay so it you know with this kind of
equipment you can actually extend the
Bluetooth range by two orders of
magnitude which means that communication
technology that you may perceive as
short range with if you have the right
hardware can actually be attacked from
very very far away now another
alternative is to involve actively
involve the user such that after they
let's say a diffie-hellman exchange the
user you know if the two devices have a
screen you know looks at the screen and
make sure that the two keys are actually
identical and does there is no many and
middle attack that in itself is not very
practical because mobile devices tend to
have small screens and you know users
tend to say yes to anything so you can
really work very well in taxing on the
user so what does that I'm going to
propose I'm gonna propose a completely
different approach to it we're what
we're going to do is we're going to fear
devices by deriving a secret but the
secret is going to be derived from the
radio environment itself okay not but
transmitting but actually by listening
to the radio environment so what this is
doing is basically recognizing well if
the devices are actually close by they
should be perceiving a similar
environment if let's say the two devices
can sense this environment well
hopefully we can find something that we
can build a secret a joint secret based
on that and we can then secure
communication based on that cigarette
yes
so this Mike
his most stronger
no now unfortunately this is not first
of all not assuming symmetric
cryptography assuming public key
cryptography it was up I guess I should
repeat the question there was a question
about whether the men in the middle
attack is an issue of symmetric key
cryptography it's not even when you have
public key cryptography the prom that
we're trying to solve is well when i get
a public key from someone how can i be
sure the vantage let's say you have a
phone mahesh a cell phone and i have a
phone i want to pair with mahesh and
basically i get a public key that tells
me that this is mahesh his phone and you
know this is the public key for it how
can i be sure that in fact mahesh was
the one that sent me that key and it
wasn't someone else spoofing the device
excuse me oh yes so there is no that's
right yes because the assumption is that
these two devices are unknown to each
other they're just you know meeting and
they're trying to communicate and there
is no other side channel yeah all right
so what we're going to do is in effect
we're going to use implicitly the fact
that we're communicating on the same
environment and that if we perceive some
commonality in it we're going to use
that as the source of of a secret and
we're going to listen on the environment
and basically on ambient radio sources
to try to derive that secret and in
effect what we're going to do is we're
going to assume that if you know the
environment you can prove to me that you
know the red environment looks so and so
that will be good enough to show that
you're actually physically present there
well what are the advantages to this
approach first of all it doesn't require
in the extra hardware I it basically
just uses the radio that's already
available on the device itself it
doesn't require user involvement to
verify that the authentication was
carried out properly and finally it's
not subject to obstructing because
you're actually not transmitting you are
just listening
other sources are transmitting and out
of that we are composing a sacred oops
alright so there are certain
requirements for this to actually work
or other assumptions one of the
assumptions has to do with actually all
of the Assumption have to do with
environment that we're listening to one
assumption has to do with the nature of
of the specific place where the I guess
the pairing is taking place and the
assumption is that there is temporal
variability okay we are assuming that
the radio environment on a given
location actually changes over short
periods of time if that was not the case
then it would basically trivial to
determine how the environment you know
looks at that particular occasion so
what we're seeing here is signal
strength from three radio sources time
is going in this direction this is a
signal strength and as you can see you
know over time the signal strength that
I perceive these radio sources to be
transmitting at goes up and down and
it's actually quite hard to predict
he'll variations will you know the
variations to there has to be spatial
variability in the sense that if Ana the
signal strength of different places of
the same environment should be
independent in some sense we're very
hard to correlate why is this important
well because if the two devices are
located in one part of the environment
and an attacker is let's say a few
meters away and they perceive exactly
this environment as as you know the
friendly devices being paired well the
attacker will be able to fool on the
other hand what we see is that in fact
the radio environment changes quite
drastically even as we move you know
very small amounts of distances so what
we're seeing here is again receiver
signal strength 43 Wi-Fi access points
and some pretty much moving I mean this
is basically a student moving through
the lab distances on the on the x axis
and what you can see is that the
signal strength moves up and down
drastically and it's it's not a pattern
that is easy to to predict either yes oh
they were oh so they were recorded
simultaneously but what you are seeing
here is that the variability I guess
while I'm fixed on a place I'm sorry
should repeat the question now it was a
question about whether variability was
because there is actually variability
even in the same spot or whether the
variability is because the I guess the
recorder is is moving what we see is
that if you stay put in a play in a
given location the variability is
typically in open down by five DBS so
look at the scales the our ability here
is much higher than five degrees so this
is not because basically one location is
because we're moving around and all
right and finally
Oh multipath so it's a multi-part effect
so all these measurements are taken
indoors actually when you do see these
things even outdoors what happens is
that there are different objects on
which the signal bounces the receiver
actually receives multiple copies of the
same of the same signal and even if I
move you know a few centimeters in any
direction the phase and which those
copies you know converge changes and
that determines whether you know the add
up together or they subtract and that's
why we see these huge differences in
signal strength okay in this particular
case we are measuring Wi-Fi signals for
Wi-Fi is enough to move about between 10
and 20 centimeters to see significant
differences in signal strength yes
I to neighbors cannibal meters away but
at least you receive
they apart from each other but this view
the second ostrander attitude
the question is if you have you're in
the middle of two neighbors whether the
other two neighbors will see similar
signal strengths it depends and actually
we're going to show you the results of
some experiments that shine some light
into that all right the final
requirement is that well the environment
that the two devices that we're trying
to pair should see should be similar and
the environment that an attacker that is
you know farther away observes should be
different so what we're seeing here is
the result of a very simple experiment
carried out with three laptops okay we
have two laptops at the two centimeters
away and then and another laptop that's
about ten meters away now what you are
seeing here on the x axis is time on the
y axis is a receiver signal strength and
every dot here is a packet now so here
we're basically showing the two devices
that are five centimeters away and
basically this is showing one of the
devices that appears on this graph plus
the one that is 10 meters away now when
there is a line between them or anything
any symbol other than the next that
means that the two devices captured the
same packet okay they received the same
packet in the back that was not
corrupted okay and two we see the
difference in signal strength at which
they received it so the point to to
consider is that the two devices are
five centimeters away first of all do
effectively capture a much higher
proportion of the packets than the
devices that are separated by about 10
meters and as you can see the
differences in signal strength here are
much smaller than the differences in
signal strength over there so what we
conclude is that the devices that are
close by see not an identical rating
environment we were not expecting that
that it's a more similar much more
single really environment than the
devices that are you know farther away
yes
yes they were
we're going to talk about that as well
hold on that question there's a question
about whether the devices that were
using we're using all the same network
card and the same antenna in fact in
this particular experiment yes they are
we have however experimented with
different antennas and obviously the
different antennas duper see differences
in signal strength but what we've seen
is that one can actually develop
normalization functions that let you
roughly bring them on all to do some
roughly the same levels that you can
actually compare them all right so this
is this is nice but how you actually
apply it in practice we think that there
are at least two ways in which one can
actually use this information about the
way the environment to the
authentication one approach is to take
existing public cryptography methods
such as diffie-hellman and i'll make
them with proximity based authentication
by developing a token one-time use only
talking that it ensures that the public
key that you got was actually you know
given to you by somebody that is really
near you another approach is to forget
about public cryptography all together
and to obtain an encryption key directly
from the radio environment itself okay
if you do that well you don't need
public in cryptography whether you can
do that in a more CPU efficient way it's
something we yet don't know so we
haven't done much with this approach yet
it's in a future work we have however
done significant work on developing an
authentication token and we've developed
a prototype we call amigo which takes a
diff ahem on exchange and add a
proximity based authentication token to
it and it works more or less as
following first you go through the
regular diffie-hellman exchange and once
you're done with it
what you do is you then check whether
there was a man-in-the-middle attack or
whether the person with whom you
authenticated is actually you know
located net next to your closely and so
the way it works is we monitor the radio
environment we obtain a token with
Estella talking of monitoring the radio
environment and then we exchange a
signature of our observation the two
devices get to compare the signature
they got from the other device with
their own observation and based on that
they determine whether the other devices
is nearby or not it works in the
following way after you done with the
diffie-hellman exchange the two devices
start listening to the radio environment
and they produce what we call a
signature basically signatures of the
packets what the signature is is a set
of packets that you captured plus the
signal strength in this particular case
we don't send the packet themselves
instead we actually what we send is a
hash of the packet plus its RRS i well
once a device gets a signature from you
know the other device what it will do is
first it actually has to align them
because the two devices might have you
know started sending sensing the moment
at slightly different times so we
basically look for the first packet that
we have in common once we are done with
aligning we actually break the signature
into smaller pieces because we want to
be able to analyze it's actually hard to
analyze the whole signature response we
analyze smaller parts of it we break
that into pieces we call instances we
feed the set of instances through a
classifier and I'm going to describe how
the classifier works in a minute and the
classifier tells us whether based on
comparing these two signatures we are
co-located or the device that we're
trying to attach to is actually far away
alright so that the input to the
classifier is a bunch of instances which
is basically hashes of packets plus
signal strength and the classifier
itself has two stages it's a two stage
boosted binary system classifier the
first stage basically filters out noisy
data and it looks at the purport the
proportion of packets that we have in
common and if there are too few packets
in common it basically marks that
particular instances invalid and we
don't take it into account anymore and
in practice what we've seen is that if
you set a threshold of seventy-five
percent it works pretty well well for
those packet that were not marked
invalid we then look at how difference
you know the instance that we got from
the other device is from the one that we
captured locally and we basically scored
the instance similarity and that score
is based on how close the signal
strengths are as well as how correlated
the changes in signal strengths are okay
see the two devices see that a given
radio source you know goes up and down
together really no likelihood they're
nearby once we have that score we assign
what we call a margin to each of this
basically margin Spurs the same to each
of the instances and once we have we
then I'm sorry go from a numerical score
to boolean one if the scores higher than
threshold we say that that's a boat a
positive vote for colocation if it's
lower it's in a negative vote for
colocation and what we do is we then
tally the votes and it's basically a
majority vote so if you know most of the
instances are confident that you're
close by we determine that you're close
by otherwise we say you're not all right
before I can actually show you
experimental results there is one or
issue that we have to tackle and that is
a possibility of a man in middle attack
attacking the authentication process
itself okay because I could have the
devices figure out the signatures and
then you know they send a signature to
the man the mail that basically just
related
between them and fools the whole system
so to prevent against that we develop a
commitment protocol that exposes the man
in the meal by forcing them to reveal
themselves by creating funny data at
work small as as as follows we take the
signature we break it into n blocks we
then generate an ounce and we send each
of the blocks in order but we don't just
send them like that we take a block and
we append to the block a hash of the
session key this is a diff assignment
session key a hash of the node ID and
then the block itself and then we take
that fulfilling and we encrypt it with
the nouns ok so in step 1 each of this
two devices actually has to produce the
first block and they won't send the
second block until they've received you
know the first block from the other guy
so let's see what will happen if after
DC Hellman turns out that we have a
man-in-the-middle attack well in the
first stage you know this device will
send this packet over here again it's
encrypted with the nouns in a that AAA
created and the problem that X has is
that well it has to give be a packet but
it can't decrypt this one over here
because it doesn't know the nouns
analysis only sent at the end of the
protocol after we've gone through all
the steps ok so what r XS alternatives
well it could just take a packet as it
is and forward it to Bob but then Bob
will detect that there is a
man-in-the-middle attack because once it
gets you know all the all the different
I guess packets blocks and announce is
made public well he will be able to
decrypt this thing and see that the
session key is k1 but Bob knows the
decision case actually k2 so they don't
match so it knows that something funky
went through the base is happening there
the hash of the identity is done so that
basically X doesn't you know mirror back
a packet and just relates it back to Bob
so just sending the package is not
viable the alternative that X has is
basically to construct a packet that
looks more like that by guessing what
the signature looks like and as I'm
going to show you in a minute that is
actually not feasible so in effect X has
to create you know random data and and
hope that it sticks yes the signature is
it's rather it's made of two things it's
a hash of the packet and its signal
strength
if you can guess what are the roughly
what are the packets that are received
by the other guy and at what signal
strength you can fool the system now
that's the interesting part okay so i'm
going to show you the results from a set
of experiments where we progressively
look and more sophisticated attackers
okay so for the simple debase case
considering a scenario where we have two
devices that i'm trying to pair the
devices are five centimeters away from
each other and there are four attackers
that are located at progressively larger
distances so there is an attacker that
is one meter away another that's three
five and ten meters away okay and
they're all monitoring the same rate
environment at the same time for
simplicity you know they're all using
the same Wi-Fi cards I'll talk about you
know all their experiments that use
different cards at the end of the talk
yes the question is where is the source
of packets the answers we don't know we
are listening at ambient sources so any
device that has a Wi-Fi card to it and
it's transmitting you know that's that's
a source and in fact we actually find
quite a few of those sources so in fact
I mean if these guys were to be
transmitting you know we would also
listen to their sources as well all
right anyway another two I guess plots
of victor is a specific experiment is
that all the bites are actually the same
height under each line of sight this
actually turns out to be the best
possible case for the attacker as you
will see if there is no line of sight
then it's actually harder for the
attacker alright so the device is a
monitoring the environment at the same
time we use this setting to collect two
traces one trace we use for actually
training our classifier and the other
trace we're actually going to use for
testing it so the results i'm going to
show you up from 2nd trace we collected
we collected it actually two months
later and in a different place of our
lab just to make sure that there was no
location specific you know normality
that will result in
you know give us runnings results to
give you an idea of how big the traces
are in about 10 minutes each of the
devices will sable to the tag between 30
and 50 thousand packets we detected
about 11 access points but the traces
themselves have many more Wi-Fi sources
because well I mean these are just the
access points but we actually have
clients that are using that you know
those access points and for our purposes
it really doesn't make a difference if
you know as long as you're transmitting
we can actually use that all right let's
look at results and I'm presenting
results in terms of false positives and
false negatives so first let's look at
the false negatives false negative is
basically a scenario where two devices
that are actually co-located failed to
authenticate okay and what we see here
is that that actually doesn't happen if
we wait for this time going this way you
know if you wait for as little as five
seconds you know they're false the rate
of false positive is basically drops to
zero okay so if you're close by will be
able to authenticate you now if we look
at the false positive rate which is
actually much more important this is the
rate at which we say that the device
that's actually not co-located you know
we it basically manages to fool us and
we conclude they are actually co-locate
and in this case we are looking at where
were the attackers are so we have an
attacker at 15 1 3 5 and 10 meters and
what we can see is that for you know
three five and ten meters you know if
you wait for five seconds we can very
reliably you know identify the attackers
ass attackers and we don't pair with
them on the other hand the guy that's
located just one meter away evidently
perceives an environment that is close
enough to the devices that are just sent
five centimeters away so that actually
fools us and we conclude that it's
actually co-located all right
so how can we improve this will look at
two ways of adding some local entropy
making the signal change or make it more
different you know for the I guess
co-located devices then then the
attacker just to give you a point of
reference the line of sight case is the
results i just described where we are
looking at the case of the attacker
that's it just one meter away you know
if the attacker is farther than that we
can reliably you know the tectum so
we're only interested in that attacker
and if we wait for five seconds in
eighty percent of cases that the
attacker will be able to fool us so we
look at the case where we have two
devices that are five centimeters away
we have drywall about t know three or
four inches of drywall a typical with of
you know cubicle wall and then we have
an attacker that's actually just sitting
next to the drywall in fact it's let's
say you know three four inches away but
there is drywall in the middle and what
we see is that drywall really doesn't
affect signal strength and this is not
surprising and this attacker even does
bet now if we use a different technique
and I call this the student in the
middle technique where we have the two
devices five centimeters away we put the
student in the middle and then basically
an attacker one meter away we see that
the rate at which the attacker can force
actually drops very significantly and
the reason for that is a poor human
beings are basically BAM some water we
absorb a lot of radio signals and
because of that environment that the two
devices the co-located devices see the
first quite a bit on the other hand if
you've put concrete wall then basically
even if it's just a 30 centimeter of
concrete the moment is so different that
basically an attacker cannot fool you
all right another in a simpler approach
to create local entropy is for devices
that are the devices of the trying to
met two pair well if those were to move
or something in their closed environment
what
that will actually affect the radio
environment in this particular case what
we're doing is we're looking at
basically putting her hand on top of the
antenna and moving it I mean moving your
hand on top of the antenna and what we
see is that that generates a lot of
local entropy and within five seconds we
are able to identify the attacker so
we're happy to conclude that hand waving
helps if you didn't know already all
right well the two devices are fairly
close to each other so we sort of moved
the hour hand you know next I mean on
top of the two antennas all right
okay so we also look at that slight
variation of this scenario where in this
case we're saying well you know maybe
the device that you're trying to attach
unknown flick 85 centimeters away I mean
there are many many cases when I want to
basically pair with the device that's
slightly farther away so in this case we
look at the scenario where the two
friendly devices are one meter away and
again we have an attacker that is
roughly two meters away from this advice
and trend meters away from that device
we're asking whether we can actually
detect that and the answer is yes if you
wait for us as long as you know as
little as five seconds you can actually
detect attackers as well as use
excessively and succeeding in pairing
all right let's look at more
sophisticated attackers because right
now I mean so far attackers have been
actually quite done so what a slightly
smarter attacker could do is to actually
survey the environment ahead of hand if
you know that the pairing is going to
take place in a specific location well
what you do is you show up at that
location early and you basically figure
out what radio sources you can hear and
what you know single strings and you
build the distribution of those signal
strengths because as we saw it changes
over time and then when the two devices
actually show up and tried to pair and
again we're assuming that they're
actually show up in exactly the place
where you were expecting them which may
not be that crazy but say one of the
devices is an ATM machine and then we
have a user you know coming next to it
now there are cases where we could be no
fairly we there's an expectation that
the pairing will happen in a specific
place so let's see what happens so when
the pairing actually occurs well as the
device that is farther away here's
packets well they're basically two
possibilities all you know when packets
are from a source that it knew because
it basically detected it when its survey
the environment so what it does it
basically replaces the RSI
the one that it hears from one from it
from the distribution now for packets
that come from an unknown source because
you know somebody else moved in and
started to transmit or whatever reason a
source that wasn't transmitting on time
of the survey the attacker has to
basically choose one of two options he
can discard that packet or he can
basically leave the RSSI unchanged or he
can guess and what we've seen is that
actually just living it and change is
the best for for the attacker so in this
case we're simulating an attack that I
mean we already know that actually the
attacker that is just one meter away and
this is we're not using hand waving here
so no tiger that's one meter away can
reliably communicate so in this case
were sim we're basically saying well you
know can an attacker that is three five
and ten meters away if they know the
distribution of RSS I can they monitor
the environment from let's say five
meters away and will they get enough
information with you know it would that
be enough to authenticate and what we
see is that for ten and five meters away
that I'm sorry three and ten meters away
that's actually not the case it's sort
of a look that it's kind of weird that
you know five meters away seize better
results and three meters away but I
guess that's you know has to do with the
multipath environment that we actually
tested this in but what we see is that
in the general case even if you're just
a few meters away the environment is
significantly different enough that you
actually see different packets okay this
has actually been reported before by
other groups as well but in any case we
see that in about twenty percent of the
cases you know this particular attacker
that's five meters away we'll be able to
fool us well if you use hand waving in
this particular case again it drops down
to zero in less than five seconds we
then look at the case where we have an
extremely powerful attacking this is
actually really not a feasible attack so
attack with the tacit has control of
every single value source in the
environment okay all transmissions
fold by the attacker not just that but
the attacker knows for sure which
packets are actually heard by the
victims and which aren't more so the
attacker has the actual distribution of
our side sigh a scared by the victim
okay so in reality this is an Oracle
okay so if we know exactly what packets
are here and what signal strength well
for sure we can fool I'm not showing the
result of you know that approach without
hand waving because obviously we're able
to fool them one hundred percent of the
time you know we know what packets we
know what's in your strength what's
interesting is that even for this attack
which is really highly infeasible in
practice something as simple as moving
your hand in front of the antenna
defeats attack very very quickly so
after 30 seconds or 40 seconds basically
this attack just fails yes
how much that decrease of the signal get
strong
are they independent of signals my
concern is more an attacker who
James the entire environment with a very
strong signals that they are one signal
from a known source is the only signal
right I guess the short answer is we
don't know yet but my guess is actually
that the precise opposite is likely to
happen the higher the single strength
the more changes in the environment have
a more significant effect on it very low
power signals tend to suffer much less
for changes in the multipath than very
high power signals but you know that's
just speculation all right so hopefully
in conclusions are you know showing you
that it's actually possible to use
knowledge of the very environment to
prove physical proximity there are
several advantages to this approach
first of all you don't need extra
hardware you can just use you know the
existing radio on your device as long as
the radio actually lets you you know
supports promiscuous mode something like
Bluetooth for instance won't work but
Eddie dot 1182 dot11 does work nicely it
doesn't require user involvement as far
as verifying the pairing as we said you
know for certain kind of attacks if you
want to make sure that you know certain
attackers fail you have to do a little
bit of hand waving so that was our
involvement and as we mentioned it's not
subject to its dropping just because
you're not transmitting so even if the
attacker has very sensitive antennas
they really can't do much with them and
I described very briefly against two
potential methods for implementing this
technique one by augmenting traditional
public photography wave fat and a
proximity-based talking and we just
suggest stereotypes that you can
actually derive an encryption key
straight from the bottom there is tons
of our future work this project has been
going on for actually less than a year
so if anything we think the Vic joe sort
of scratch the surface we think well
first of all we obviously have to deal
with system robustness one key aspect is
well dealing with different cards and
different antennas so far we've only run
some very preliminary experiments where
we looked at different antennas and what
we've seen is that you can actually
typically develop some kind of
normalization functions so if you think
of the signature that gets exchanged you
basically use a portion of the signature
to figure out correspondence between the
signal strength levels that the
different antennas are getting and there
is such a typically very selenium
correspondence there and once you know
that well basically you normalize the
rest of the signature and our
preliminary experiments show that it
works we need to characterize the
technique in other environments our
environment is actually quite bursty we
have 11 access points and well it's
basically a computer science lab
everyone has a laptop and they're
transmitting all the time one wonders
how well this technique will work when
there is just you know one lone access
point that is just sending beacons for
instance we don't know we think that
there is a lot of room for improvement
we plan to look at software radios so
far everything I've described so far is
using off-the-shelf hardware that gives
us access to our SSI information at the
packet level we don't have finer
granularity than that we would like to
so we plan to look at using software
radio structure will get access to
physical layer information that we think
we let us achieve higher granularity I
mean lower granularity I guess so that
you don't even have to hand wave at all
other techniques that would like to
explore is well you know why just focus
on one radio you can potentially assume
that the device has multiple radios
around it I mean
you could potentially sense with you
know multiple radio simultaneously and
hopefully that would increase your
accuracy as well and obviously we would
like to develop a technique that derives
an actual encryption key from the
environment itself so we can remove the
requirement for public key encryption
right the stuff that adjust well most of
the stuff i described here a pearson is
a on a paper that is some to appear on
ubicomp in September you know that's
against and information and the paper is
not yet available on my website but
actually if you go to my students
website my guess is you'll be able to to
find it there I should have said this
from the beginning and I'm sorry I
didn't but this work is actually in
collaboration with a lot of really
talented people Alex Rostovski is a PhD
student of mine he will be hitting the
job market this coming season other
people involved are adding scandal also
student of mine and Anthony LaMarca from
Intel research in in their CL lab and
it's been a pleasure so I'll take
questions
yes so I think it's very interesting I
think
that one of the keys is going to be
getting it so that the attacker has to
be closer
because I read our scene seems like a
meter while it sounds like lots of
pretty close attacker may be a
protagonist and array of sugar but I
mean if you were authenticated to a
computer in the podium it means I have a
device in the podium
that did me
so yes a bit what are the device that's
dedicated to 22 biggie attacker and
Mayor body seems easy in a lot of cases
of the am I can put it in the Apple
just pick it up
sure so there is a question about trying
to get accuracy that goes significantly
below a mere because you could have
against a dedicated attacker that just
puts an antenna that's really really
close sure but even I mean that the
problem with with that I guess the
answer is what kinds of applications yes
I think there are applications that need
to be much better than a meter I think
that there are some applications that
are probably more than enough you know
the demeanor is probably more more than
enough to give you just actually a very
simple example you know whenever you
check into hotel you typically using the
Wi-Fi how do you know that you're
actually using the Wi-Fi hotel as
opposed to somebody that has a van
outside and basically has a fishing
Wi-Fi which we know it's a problem in
general in that case in most cases you
know the attacker is actually much
farther away than a meter so even a
meter resolution or even a 10 liters of
solution for some applications is more
than enough we obviously want to achieve
finer resolution than a meter but you
know for some kinds of attacks it really
doesn't matter how fine the resolution
is it still won't work so for the case
of well I have an antenna that's really
between the two devices well again if
it's a 90 m that I'm trying to
authenticate with you know I can
basically have an antenna that's really
on top of the ATM itself so it doesn't
really matter how close you're trying to
get to the ATM you're actually just
laying yourself on top of the ATM so
there are certain you know there's
certain attacks for which this will not
work but we think that there are some
applications variation with will yes
as a function of time or consciousness
which you can have much
yeah so there is a question about what
is that this you know where is that
meter of granularity coming from is it
the classifier and I think answer to
that is yes it's partly the classifier
we think that if we spend more time
looking at features we can probably come
up with a better classifiers I think
that will definitely help a part of it
is also having to do with the fact that
the signal strength there is that we're
getting is actually an average of the
whole packet we really don't have any
control over what the cards decides to
tell us you know basically you know
we're not we don't have access to the
cards firmware this at this stage and
the card only reports signal strength at
the granularity of a packet that's why
we're interested actually looking at
software videos because we think that if
we can go below the granularity out of a
packet you know hopefully we can do
better now the other problem with using
of the Shelf cards I mean using all the
chef's cast it's great because
potentially it could you know you could
actually implement it on real hardware
but very problem with it is that
typically the card gives you access to
packets that we're actually capture
doesn't give you access to just noise ah
so we think that if again if you have a
software radio you can actually just
look at the noise itself you don't even
have to look at well foreign packets of
their capture so we hope that that will
give us finally find the granularity but
again these are all speculations at this
point
alright well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
