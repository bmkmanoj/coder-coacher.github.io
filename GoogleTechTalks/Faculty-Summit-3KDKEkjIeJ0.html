more people to arrive but in the
interest of time i'll i'll kick off now
um so i hope and think this is going to
be one of the particularly interesting
and hopefully memorable parts of this
this summit what we're going to be doing
is spending the next hour and a half are
discussing how we can broaden maintain
increase interest and applications for
computer science programs at a
university so what we'll be doing is
will spend the first part of the session
probably the next 20 minutes or so
reviewing the findings from the survey
that your completed as you'll see we had
a very very high response rate to that
which is itself is really really
exciting and and also it well as
exciting in one way because i'm pleased
that you know we've got some interesting
and good responses to it it's concerning
because i don't think you'd have
completed it if you didn't care about
this and weren't concerned about it so
it's good to know in a way that we all
share that the same concern because as i
think both nelson and alfred have
mentioned as an organization we're
concerned about this not just in
individual countries in a mere but
really across the whole region and also
we're concerned about themselves wearing
the world as well so as part of that
sort of talking about the fact that this
is an issue elsewhere in the world
Lenora bloom who i think many of you
will have met from Carnegie Mellon is
going to talk about the experiences what
what's happened in the US um and when
she and I were prepping for this meeting
or for this talk a couple of days ago
both of us were commenting on the fact
that what we don't want to come across
as if he the Google knows all the
answers all the guys in the US know all
the answers part of the problem is we
don't know all the answers collectively
we might know some of the answers and
some of the effect of things we can do
so what we really want is these you know
these comments over the next 45 minutes
or so to inspire debate and ideas and so
on but really what we want then is for
the second half of the sessions over the
last 45 minutes is to hear your
perspectives and your ideas on all of
this for my slides of this presentation
results from the survey we will be
distributing a hard copy shortly they
should be coming in the next sort of 10
20 minutes or so so you may want to keep
notes to go along but you will get a
hard copies of all of these slides and
what we'd really like to do is try and
end by agreeing some actions
so even if they're just a handful of
actions that we're agreeing at the end
of all of this that we could that we can
nurse of work try and work on across
borders on all of this so in terms of
the survey methodology as as any of you
who were registered before the 11th of
January will know around that weekend we
sent out a an online survey to to all
people who registered at that point
asking them about their experiences of
enrollment in computer science what
challenges you are facing what answers
you were finding what you thought the
issues were and so on and so forth and
we had as I mentioned earlier a huge
response rate eighty-seven percent of
universities who are represented this
event also completed the survey which is
it is really good one thing just to
emphasize though is that a lot of the
survey is opinion base we didn't make
that clear when we sent it out so it's a
little bit difficult to say that all of
this all of the findings particularly
necessarily scientific they are based on
your collective opinions but at Google
we are great believers in the wisdom of
crowds and I think we do see some two
distinct trends coming through here so
what were the key findings for all of
this interestingly given that Amir is a
bit of an artificial creation that's
configurated for the convenience of
businesses rather than any real
geographical cultural similarity there
are some definite similarities going
across all this very diverse group of
cultures and geographies that we that we
represent instantly they don't really
seem to be any outliers I should point
out by the way I cannot take credit for
the statistical analysis on this have a
fantastic kala call Heidi binder who's
based in Mountain View who spent a lot
of time poring over the numbers for this
and she tells me that no particular
countries or regions are skewed the data
one thing I should also mention is that
we did slightly cluster countries
together and you love notes on the
previous slide that we put them five
countries in Africa six in central
Eastern Europe for in Israel 04 from
Israel and then 29 from Western Europe
so given those you know the small
numbers particular five six and four
it's a little bit difficult to make any
judge any real trends from that but we
did just sort of cut them up like that
just to see if we could identify any any
any hints there
and the big big theme that comes through
is that every but all nearly everybody
seems to be facing challenges both with
the quantity of applications which I
don't think surprise to anyone but also
the quality of applications is of
concern to and the and we looked through
the data or highly look through the data
in a lot of detail to try and find any
correlation any causation and didn't
accept one point which I will highlight
later which is to do with the
representation of girls and courses but
the big big finding that comes out of
all of this the one that can sort of
bring us all together and we that
hopefully will be able to discuss them
some solutions to is that high school
seemed to hold the key everybody or many
many people mention that secondary
education needs to become more relevant
to CS and point-blank needs to improve
and at the same time there's a distinct
feeling that high school teachers are
not being particularly helpful and that
they're bringing a broadly negative
opinion are to the field of computer
science so that it seems that we need to
impress a group we need to influence the
influences and then there's this whole
area of positioning selling marketing CS
how have you choose did it to describe
it but marketing computer science both
to these teachers improving the image to
the teachers but also to the students as
well so um I should also warn you that
I'm going to be going through quite a
lot of information in a fairly short
time here so i will move fairly fast all
of these but you will get the data in
hard copy shortly so you don't need to
sort of a particular note of a
particular figures and so on but
interesting to note that the the decline
in bachelor's and master's applications
which seems to being a pretty common
theme over the last several years seems
to have leveled off thankfully but the
next slide I'll show the picture isn't
all great but also what you see from the
the graph in the bottom of the table in
the bottom right is that the that there
seems to be a potentially a decline in
the number of applications for the pH DS
which see which you know until now was
it seemed to be proving a little bit
more resilient than applications for
bachelors and masters so no definite
trends coming through there but it seems
to be heading in that kind of direction
looking to the future it ain't great
okay so not many people think that a
number of applications are going to
decrease so that's good news but you've
given the fact that it's been a quite a
distinctly declining market over the
last few years most people are saying
that actually they expect the number of
applications say broadly the same over
the next two to three years so given
that the number at the moment isn't
great that's that that is concerning in
itself fortunately there is a noticeable
minority who think that they will
increase but I think that clearly there
needs to be some attention there in
terms of the quality of applications
you'll see from the table in the bottom
right-hand corner but the African
universities are seem to be doing really
well in getting an increased quality of
applications so so that's good news but
then if you see in the top left hand
corner broadly across the whole region
just fifteen percent of of institutions
are feeling that applications are
improving equality so given the fact
also the market is shrinking we're
getting fewer good application or the
application simple will be the same in
quality again a little bit of a concern
um a Google we care deeply about number
of people study the number of women
studying computer science we you
probably noticed we have a very very
diverse workforce you may have heard
quite a number of different accesses
you've been sort of exposed to different
Googlers over the last few days we
really want our our software engineers
to represent our users so in terms of
nationality in terms of culture and also
in terms of gender as well so we do put
a lot of focus on trying to maintain an
increase the proportion of women who are
studying computer science and you'll see
oh it was interested discussing this at
dinner last night I was actually a
little bit surprised and slightly
cheered by the fact that it seems to be
sort of between 15 and 20 percent
depending on the program as a proportion
of women studying computer science what
I should emphasize though unfortunately
is that we when we when we compiled all
of this data we didn't wait it so you
may have a small program that has a high
proportion of women that would then skew
the data somewhat so I think we should
just sort of bet bear that in mind I'm
not sure if that's the reason for this
it just seems it seemed a little bit
higher than
so expected but if it is that fifteen to
twenty percent that's good news and also
what's interesting is there are slightly
more women or a high proportion of women
studying more advanced degrees so there
seems to be this challenge of getting
women into undergraduate once they're
into the undergraduate programs perhaps
they're a little bit more likely to
stick around into into further levels
and also good news again for the
Africans there's an increase in the
number of women taking applying for PhDs
there and also a slight a slight
increase in central Eastern Europe so
here's an interesting one what is
affecting application volume in a
positive manner well by far and away its
I don't know if you can read that but
it's the perceptions of career options
and I really do hoping we were actually
again discussing sat then last night
really hope that Google has a role to
play and all of that that sir you know
if we can you know if there's you know
if the fact that Google recruits
excellent computer scientists it will
encourage more students to consider
studying computer science then we would
love to get the word out about that
having said that what was interesting
also looking at the qualitative
responses to the survey was that we did
have quite a few people did make
comments about the the relative
perception that there's a lack of a
relative lack of career options for
computer scientists so some of might go
and study mathematics with the idea that
they can go into any range of careers
from accountancy to programming or
whatever else but there's definitely
perception that if you're going to go
and study computer science you're going
to be coding for the rest of your life
which obviously you know for Google is
something that you know we love people
who love to program but at the same time
there are a bunch of other career
options out there and we you know we
need to be getting that message out
there one thing you will notice i think
it's about how long it's about three
from the year three from the right just
under twenty percent of people think
that high school education is positively
impacting applications for computer
science so not particularly high one of
the lowest factors and when we go on to
the next table guess what the biggest
negative impact on applications for
computer science is the quality of high
school education and there's a and
what's also interesting here and are
probably not a surprise to most people
in the room
is that other disciplines are taking
people away from from computer science
and those are proving relatively more
attractive so whether it's because what
we didn't get to in detail on the survey
is whether that's because the other set
the other subjects and marketing
themselves better whether the high
school teachers are influencing it maybe
the carib perceptions of career options
are better and so on it's a little bit
are unclear and so just at one point
focus on a little bit here is the the
selection criteria for CS programs to be
honest though it wasn't surprised at all
that high school leaving results by far
and away the most important influence on
on receiving good following web
applications but to check this with us
he of the last night and she was happy
using this as an example queen mary's
university gave us quite interesting
example where the UK which is a highly
selective system where people that you
know generally the universities do put a
lot of that's not mine that's my
blackberry think of it that way so so
the so you know the UK is a system which
has a highly selective system very much
focused on on on a levels that the the
the secondary school leaving exam and
but the Queen Mary's have shifted a lot
of focus over the last couple of years
onto onto focusing on people's
motivation and their understanding of
science their their experience their
enthusiasm for it and so on obviously
it's not being that alone that has
caused this but what what they've seen
in the market that is declined overall
by about ten percent in terms of volume
of applications their volume of
applications and since 2005 is increased
by seventy percent so that that may be
one way one thing that we could think
about into our to stimulate interest in
a number of applications and a number of
successful applications um what are the
other academic disciplines that people
are going into rather than computer
science it's this isn't that informative
it's like it's basically saying that
people are going everywhere in a way
computer science is under siege from all
fronts if you feeling paranoid will be
the way that you put it but a more
positive way to look at it is that
really what we have to do is we can't
sort of focus on different
in computer science from E or from
mathematics or from any other any other
discipline it's really a case of doing a
positive positioning and ceylon computer
science so how can we increase pipeline
what do you think were the the best ways
to do that well perhaps unsurprisingly
given that it was an industry
organization google that was starting
the discussion you suggested the
industry partnerships a great way to do
this and you know that's why we're
having this discussion we want that
partnership as well so we're up for that
and interestingly input but thankfully
unsurprisingly the results three and
four we're talking about the importance
of high school relationships and
influencing high schools and so on which
really sort of bears up the the date of
the way I was mentioning a few minutes
ago and there's an interesting one here
and I think we might just so linger on
this this this slide just for a couple
of minutes I've sort of looked at this
in a half glass full and half glass half
empty way seventy-five percent of
respondents feel that parents are
neutral to very positive about computer
science fifty-five percent or just over
i think it's fifty-eight percent of
respondents think teachers are neutral
to very negative of course you can
always flip those around anyway but
there is still a definite gap there of
about twenty percent between the the
positive influences of teachers so
teachers really do seem to be holding
the key here and i and what we're going
to suggest is that you know and what
Laurel will be talking about is that
perhaps that's something that we can
work a chronic work on across borders
and something that is quite scalable
particularly given the fact that obvious
the teachers who are in this long-term
and if we can we can change their minds
and work with them now then that's going
to have a really long term impact as
well but the correlation the causation I
mentioned earlier is an interesting one
this one when Heidi and I were talking
about so I phone that she was
particularly excited about because as I
say she had spent hours now is poring
over this data and this was the one
really interesting finding what you came
up with um if a university feels
positive about the impact of high
schools on our on students perception
then more girls are likely to apply for
and be on the proton the programs at
those universities so if University X
feels that high schools teachers are a
good influence on on on T on pupils then
University X is going to have a high
proportion of girls studying computer
science at undergraduate so don't know
to know possibly because it's more there
are just you know there's higher volume
of applications all together and there's
just increase overall increase in
interest and perhaps you know you also
start to get the sort of domino effect
as it were when Lenora and I discusses
for a few months ago for that when we
met for the first time Lenore used a
really good term of the girls being the
Canaries in the mine you know the old
expression when the Canaries are taking
down the mines check for gas so it's the
girls who are dropping out first but the
concern is you know it'll be the boys
who follow along not long after them so
there's it's it's quite an interesting
one so for those universities who are
interested in in increasing the number
of women as a proportion of their
computer science students you know again
this could be quite could have quite a
good at quite a good impact on that to
influence the high school teachers
so lots of people said when we asked you
know what did you want to discuss during
the session you wanted to hear Google's
opinion on all of this what I should
stress here is that this is not an
official party line from google and sort
of something that's going on a press
release or something like that but these
are thoughts that just as a group we
have no various Googlers who care deeply
about all of this have been have been
discussing and over the last few months
and you won't be surprised to note you
know this is gathering a computer
scientist we're a company that's Ron
founded and run by computer scientists
we recruit excellent computer scientists
we we have a vested interest in seeing
computer science develop as a discipline
and maintain robust and interesting an
exciting discipline and vibrant
discipline to work in I'm thinking
practically we as Google you know we
operate as globally as possible wherever
we can and certainly pan regionally any
solutions that we want to help drive we
really need to if we're going to be as
effective as possible and give you guys
as much as possible and support you guys
as much as possible then we want as much
possible to do this on a on a pan
regional basis and obviously that's
going to be difficult because say Israel
is highly different from Uganda which is
highly different from France you know
there's you can be facing very different
specific issues in those markets but
also it's what's it's been interesting
about all of us there do seem to be some
common themes coming through and you
know we totally defer to the fact that
you know your students you know your
country's far better than we do so you
know we need your input here we want to
know what you think we can bring that
you can't and that what you think we can
bring that you can't bring as
universities and also the other
companies can't bring and you know tell
us what that is and we'll try and we'll
try our best to leverage that but if
we're going to maximize leverage if
we're going to operate at scale upon
regionally in the way that we've been
discussing what we you know what seems
to come from all of this is that we need
to do something a high school level that
is that has broad reach and that
particularly focuses on the image and
perceptions of computer science and
particularly among teachers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
