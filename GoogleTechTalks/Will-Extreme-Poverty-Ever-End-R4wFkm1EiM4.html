Google for nonprofits website and one of
our users was Kim who's the marketing
director for new room and we got to
talking after the user session and I had
just gone to to Kenya for vacation and
so we were talking about Kenya and she
was telling about some of the work that
neuro was doing and I started thinking a
lot about hey what could I do I saw a
lot of extreme poverty when I was in
Kenya and in doing some of my research
and kind of reading up on it I found
that extreme poverty is actually a
solvable problem a big problem but
solvable in our generation we've seen a
lot of economic progress in places like
India and Brazil and China and earn our
lifetimes so it seemed like it's a it's
you know a solvable problem and but I
didn't know what to do and then I got an
invitation from Kim to hear Jake speak
that he was going to be in the area and
he's me speaking and I went to hear him
speak and I was really inspired because
some of the things that he was talking
about is if you've seen some of the
posters that Neuros approach is scalable
and measurable and sustainable and those
things really resonated with me because
that's exactly how Google goes about
solving tough challenges so I've been
doing some work with newer and I'm
really excited to have Jake here to
toggle smart thank you Mary Ann so thank
you guys so much for coming out i know
you're all very busy and it's nice to be
at old moran it's very nice to be like
kind of inside of Oz you know like this
place is obviously very famous so it's
nice to have an introduction to to
Google corporate today we're going to
talk a little bit about extreme poverty
and like Mary Ann said the numbers can
be very daunting I'm sure you've all
heard the numbers you know one out of
six people in this world suffer from
extreme poverty they can't they don't
have enough to feed their kids every
night one out of six people can't find
clean drinking water for their families
little girls are walking five hours a
day just to get to a nearby water source
and they you know have they're
threatened by all kind of security risks
it could be raped along the way they
might not actually even get that water
by the time they bring home is probably
dirty it's going to make their family
sick anyway people living in extremely
horrible conditions
around the world without the ability to
make meaningful choices to actually
determine their own families futures it
can seem like a really daunting problem
it's huge and it's global and so a lot
of times we as individuals when you're
fit up against a problem like that a lot
of times what we want to do is we just
kind of want to throw our hands in the
air and say well I can't really do
anything this this challenge is way too
massive and I'm hoping one of the things
that you can walk away with from today's
message is that any of us can make a
difference each one of us in the fight
against extreme poverty can make a
difference you know Marianne is doing
what she can to make a difference in
helping spread the word about what
groups like us are doing I'm going to
tell you my story and I'm hoping that it
can inspire you to to get involved in
what we're in what we're doing or what
other good organizations are doing
around the world as an example of
someone who comes from a very different
background I do come from a very
different approach and a very different
background different experiences in the
fight against extreme poverty and so
what I'd like to do is first of all tell
you about my story how I got into this
work tell you about newest model how
it's designed how it's a very different
tactic in fighting extreme poverty to
and then tell a little bit about our
impact and our exciting progress as we
get ready now to expand now even to our
second country that sound okay to
everybody very good all right so I
founded this organization called nuru
new row means light or hope in Swahili
and what we seek to do is we work with
extremely poor individuals and families
in remote rural areas that's our focus
and we empower them with the ability to
make meaningful choices to lift their
own communities out of extreme poverty
not for a week not for a year but
permanently and then we as the Western
entity the Western staff and funding
exit the project leaving behind a
completely self-sustaining model that is
continuing the scale to eventually have
national level impact so my story I in
my old life I was a Marine Corps Special
Operations platoon commander so it's
very different than this kind of network
and but the experiences that I had in my
old job actually led me into this field
I was deployed with my guys kind of all
around the world we did two tours of
combat in Iraq other parts of the Middle
East parts of Southwest Asia and it was
my experiences my personal experiences
in combat to begin to allow me to see a
connection between the things that we
were fighting terrorism insurgency
instability kind of global conflict
situations and extreme poverty and today
I want to talk to you a little bit about
one of the most intense personal
experiences that caused me to have a
serious awakening and drive me into this
new field that I'm operating in right
now so I want to take you back a little
bit to 2003 and you guys do you guys
remember the the invasion remember when
we first went into Iraq okay so I was in
one of the Marine Corps units that was
in the front okay we were on the front
lines and I don't know if you remember
what the missions were at the time but
the army was making a big sweep to the
west to take the Baghdad International
Airport the Marine Corps job was to push
kind of straight up the gut to
eventually take Baghdad from southern
Iraq all the way into Baghdad and so you
know as we push north the Iraqi army was
retreating and they were they were going
to make a final kind of last stand in
Baghdad but instead of fighting army the
army Saddam was pushing his Special
Forces guys called Fedayeen south into
southern Iraq and they were going
village to village recruiting people and
to kind of set the stage for what was
happening at the time southern Iraq at
the time was one of the poorest places
in the world you know many of the things
that challenges I just told you about
families not being able to feed their
kids not being able to have clean water
couldn't send their kids to school there
were no schools you know not being able
to afford basic health care you know
kids were dying from malaria and
diarrhea easily preventable diseases so
the Fedayeen we're going hut two Hut in
these villages and they were telling
these he these mothers and fathers you
know your kids are starving right in
front of you will feed your kids and
we'll get them to school if you'll strap
this bond yourself and go blow yourself
up or pick up this weapon you've never
seen before and don't know how to use
and go fight these people he never even
heard of and what I found was we were
fighting these people by the hundreds
and thousands we weren't fighting
top notch special forces army
individuals we were fighting poor people
who had never seen a gun before and that
kind of sets the stage for for this this
awakening that I had in combat so as we
push through southern Iraq you know war
is as many of you know bore is a
horrible thing it is one of the most
terrible things that we can do to each
other as human beings there and then
there's a time and place for conflict
but you know things that happen things
happen in war you know stories get
written that you just can't unwrite and
as we were pushing north in the early
days the first major casualties happen
in a place called na surya you might
remember a battle called the Battle of
neisseria and as we entered into the
city we thought that it had been
surrendered by the 11th 11th infantry
division of the Iraqi army what we found
out that it was that it was a trick and
over 50 of our Marines lost their lives
in an ambush in a matter of 10 minutes
and what we thought was going to be
rushing through the city on our way to
Baghdad turn into a knock-down drag-out
fight we were able to fight our way
through the city and we set up a
defensive perimeter north of nos area
and we had to stop we had to wait and we
were all oriented north on this highway
called highway 7 it was our main avenue
of approach and I can tell you there's
nothing worse in combat than sitting and
waiting especially after you just got
ambushed and the reason we were waiting
is because we hadn't eaten in about a
day and a half or two days are and we
had to wait for our supply chains to
kind of catch up with us so as we're
sitting there waiting you know I'm
scared my guys are scared we're
terrified anybody tells you that they're
not scared in combat is crazy or lying
one of the two it was a very scary
situation so I I got up out of my whole
my fighting hole and I walked I wanted
to walk the line to check on my guys and
see if they were okay and as I'm walking
the lines I looked up saw a little white
car actually approaching our position
and it was racing toward toward our
little blockade there and as it was
coming I my guys three of my guys and we
took off running toward the car we
thought this car had been loaded with
explosives and they were going to blow
themselves up in our position so we're
running toward the car trying to get it
to stop
and it wasn't stopping and so I fired a
warning shot over the car finally it
stopped about 50 meters out and the
driver hopped out of the driver's side
started waving his arms frantically and
sprinting toward me so my conclusion at
that point was okay he strapped a bomb
to himself and now he's going to try to
blow himself up and so I'm desperately
trying to get this guy to get on the
ground stop by me i'm in Arabic trying
to get him to just just stop it and
where he was that before he got to our
position but he wasn't stopping so as I
raised my weapon up thinking I'm going
to have to take this guy out I looked
behind him and I saw a large black
military truck roll up behind his little
white car six guys in black jumped out
of that truck ran up to his car and
begin shooting into the car and the guy
stopped dead in his tracks started
screaming and turned around and started
sprinting back to the car and that's
when I realized what was happening this
man was one of those poor farmers who
had been who the Fedayeen were trying to
recruit he was trying to escape across
our lines with his family and when I
realized what was happening I yelled at
my guys and told him to take out the
Fedayeen as I was running I was
sprinting desperately trying to make it
to this car to save this guy's family
but by the time I got there it was um it
was too late his wife was in the
passenger side she was slumped over
she'd been shot in the face in the chest
and she was dead yeah little infant baby
girl in the back her arm had been blown
off and she was also shot in the face
she was dead and he was cradling his
little six-year-old daughter who had
been shot in the abdomen and she was
choking on her own blood and and this
guy was beside himself you know in a
matter of two seconds he lost everything
that he had in this world and everything
changed for me everything slowed down
the warm for the first time I put myself
in this guy's shoes and I thought to
myself you know I live in a world of
choices what school I want to go to what
job do I want to have what I want to
wear that day what what i want to eat
for breakfast what were this guy's
choices when he woke up this morning you
know he watched his kids starve to death
right in front of him he could pick up a
weapon he never seen before and go fight
people he never heard of
or he can make some desperate attempt to
escape with his family knowing the Fed
ain were in the hut right next door he
had no choices and I looked in this
guy's eyes and I never want to see that
look again in a person's eyes I looked
in that guy's eyes and I didn't know
what to do for the first time in the war
I didn't know what to do and I level my
weapon hang on my side I just began to
cry with this guy and then I got really
really angry and I thought to myself I
never want to see this again I never
want to see an individual who has no
choices just because of where they're
born this guy didn't do anything wrong
he was limited in his choices just
because of where he was born and that's
not fair you know some I mean there's no
technical language around that it's just
not fair it's not just and that was the
beginning of an awakening in me and a
journey into the life that I'm doing
right now I did another tour in combat
during counter-terrorist operation south
of Baghdad but I saw the same things
again and again and again a look of
absolute desperation in the eyes of
young men and women actually who would
strap a bomb themselves and come running
into our position and you know it wasn't
out of some kind of misplaced sense of
hatred for the West it was out of love
for that little five-year-old son a
three-year-old daughter home that we're
starving to death so I made one of the
toughest decisions I made that at that
point my life and I decided to leave my
guys and leave my career I was on a very
different paths in life an upper career
in in the Marine Corps and special
operations and decided to devote my life
to addressing the challenge where I felt
I could make even more of an impact in
the war on terror and global instability
which is by taking on the problem of
extreme poverty so I got out of the
Marine Corps and I was faced with this
question that i started with today with
you guys extreme poverty what the heck
do you do to fight extreme poverty it's
a massive problem there are thousands of
people trying to take this issue on and
have been trying to do it for four
decades now so where do you even start I
had an engineering degree from the Naval
Academy I wasn't a development economist
I wasn't a peace corps guy you know I
didn't know the science behind the field
so what I decided to do I was committed
you know when I made
decision to leave my old life you know
it was there was no turning back on that
decision I was a hundred and ten percent
committed to this and I was going to
figure it out and so I wanted to do it
differently though I didn't want to just
build something a non-profit an NGO that
was going to waste people's money I want
if I was going to take this path I
wanted to build something that could be
scalable that could be measurable and
that will be sustainable that could have
a global impact in extreme poverty in
taking on this challenge so I spent
about a year year and a half of my life
dedicated just to researching the
problem of extreme poverty who are some
other organizations out there what are
they doing what's working what's not
working and kind of why because as you
guys know I'm sure you can rattle off a
lot of the names of organizations right
now that you know about there's some
really good models out there that are
working in isolation so why not learn
from them so I really study the field
and I tried to understand okay looking
at this model what what is working let's
try to take that and embed it and use it
and what's not working let's tweak that
to make it a little bit better and I
begin to form some ideas in my head and
I decide you know I can i can start
something right now or I you know and
just and have kind of a kind of a
moderate impact or I could I could go to
learn the language of business to
understand how to build and scale a
global organization and so I decide to
go to business school and I applied to
Harvard and Stanford decided to go to
Stanford because of a real focus on
social innovation and entrepreneurship
and it was really amazing when I went to
Stanford over 30 of my classmates had a
very similar awakening that I had in
combat they heard my story they heard
the vision of what I wanted to do you
know I went to Stanford just to do this
just to build this entity to take on
extreme poverty and you know it was
great I mean they got involved in
helping me build out our metric system a
rigorous metric system to measure our
performance the end the efficacy of the
model a team built out our marketing and
branding strategy I had a team focusing
on a financial model building out the
business plan had a team doing
fundraising for me it was it was amazing
over six faculty members at the GSB at
Stanford got involved as well provided
seed funding mentorship kind of advice
along the way and I did kind of a
non-standard business school internship
between my first and second year I was
actually out in the bush in western
kenya
trying to figure this thing out about
how do we begin building something from
the bottom up and then by the time I
graduated you know I incorporated the
organization while I was at school my
second year so you're not be going to
class and trying to dash out a class
trying to make it the funder meetings to
see if I could raise money many of you
would probably have been entrepreneurs
as well and you know the challenges of
raising money to seat a new idea and by
the time I graduated we were fortunate
enough to have about 450,000 that we'd
raised so I could launch my project and
i graduated in june two thousand eight
hired the team that I've been recruiting
and then we launched our pilot project
in the second poorest area of Kenya
called the Korea district in southwest
Kenya in September we started with a
handful of farmers in that September of
2008 and now three years later we're
actually working with over 15,000 people
that were impacting right now and it's
been a crazy ride we've seen incredible
progress and I want to talk to you about
the model and what we're all about now
so that you can see how this is a very
different approach to tackling poverty
and before I want to show you video
actually because we're you know pictures
speak a lot louder than words I want to
show you some of the impact we've had
it's a little birthday video that we did
I celebrate our third-year but before I
do that I want you to understand that at
nuru I think one of the things that has
made us so successful is that we
understand we're very learning
organization and we're the first to tell
you we don't have it all figured out we
don't even have half of it figured out
right now we need to learn from
everybody out there we can learn from
you guys actually there's a lot of
Googlers that have helped us build what
we're doing right now and if you have
the attitude that you can admit your
mistakes understand enough to know what
you don't know and then go seek that
knowledge out you can really begin to
build something and rapidly adapt to
challenges as you face them in the field
and elsewhere okay so without further
ado let me show you this video and I'm
gonna talk to you little bit about what
we do if I do you happy birthday
Oh
I am NOT I am new miminum noon I am no I
am the phone came I was desperate I used
to bake around for food for my children
now that I am a farmer with the moon we
have enough food to eat and I can sell
the last pay for my children's school
fees I was getting two to three sacks of
mesbah akka and we were hungry but nuru
told me how to farm give me a loan of
seeds and fertilizer and now i'm getting
15 sacks pataca before no room my life
was there had i had enough but nom
harvesting 25 bags of maize bike i was
able to build a house of my own before
nor okay my brother and I will plant
maize and sometimes havas nothing but
now we are getting 18 sacks of meat per
acre and can feed our families with a
small loan from neuro I was able to open
this kiosk my business has been very
successful and now I'm able to pay
school fees for my children the phone or
can report I couldn't get even food to
eat but neuro has brought us like I wish
for them continue to end extreme poverty
here in Korea
happy birthday happy birthday happy
birthday not happy body babe that's
better than you happy birthday Muru
thank you okay so you saw a little
taster of some of the impact that we've
had in the last three years and actually
the time of the video was made there
were about 10,000 people that we were
working with and as of today there's
over 15,000 now we're growing really
quickly and its really it's we've seen
some exciting growth it's very exciting
for me so I could kind of wound up I
want to talk to you now a little bit
about what we actually do so what is new
how are we different you know how are we
different than every other organization
out there nuru like I said is a Swahili
word that means light or hope and we are
a holistic integrated development model
we take an integrated approach to
fighting poverty you know integrated
approaches just make a lot of sense you
know we focus on agriculture health
education water and sanitation economic
development it's five pronged approach
and it makes a lot of sense to try to
address the challenges in each one of
those areas but the problem is is that
there's a lot of other organizations
that try to do the same thing you know
they do they take a holistic or
integrated approach the problem with
that though is it's extremely difficult
to be to make that sustainable and to be
able to scale that and to date nobody's
actually been able to do that
effectively and that's where we come in
we think we've landed on a model now
that's going to be able to be not only
sustainable and scalable but sustainable
and scalable by the local leaders not by
Western individuals one of the key
innovations in our model is we go in and
we equip the poor we untap the potential
in the poor themselves actually to be
able to lift their own communities out
of extreme poverty permanently we exit
we embed revenue models into the project
businesses to make revenue streams that
actually sustain the project over time
after we leave and also fuel the project
to scale it to eventually have a
national national level impact that
scale up is done
through Kenya can you generated revenues
and also Kenya generated leaders it's
not Western individuals that are
beginning to scale this project
throughout Kenya it's the Kenyans and
that's a key innovation we found that
true sustainability lies in two major
factors financial sustainability and
leadership sustainability you know a lot
of a lot of organizations in the sector
they talk about sustainability and you
know everybody talks about it right and
your eyes glaze over and you're going to
get really bored but we actually take a
very focused approach in what we mean
when we say sustainability and we're
very serious about creating
sustainability in both those areas if
you just have revenues that are
generated to fund the expansion of the
project and you don't have the
leadership the local leadership to buy
into and scale it your projects going to
die one to two years after you exit also
if you have strong core of leadership
that has a vision for their country and
in the capability to be able to innovate
past challenges as they meet them but
they don't have the financial backing to
be able to do that the project will also
die so that's why you have this kind of
two-pronged approach and focusing on
sustainability so a little more
specifics about each of the five areas
that we work on you know we talk about
these five areas AG health water
education and economic development these
this five pronged approach is what we
call the impact framework that rests on
a firm foundation of our leadership
development program our leadership
development program is the true key to
our sustainability of our approach where
we're equipping local leaders with a
civic-minded service-minded attitudes
and principles of leadership to have a
vision for their country and then we're
also equipping them to be critical
thinking problem-solving innovators you
know we teach our local leaders about
design thinking to be able to develop
empathy for the users in the community
to be able to brainstorm rapid
prototyping to be able to testing an
iteration of those models and solutions
that they're creating to make them more
and more effective on their own not with
us you know one of the most important
lessons that I've learned in doing this
work is that the greatest solution to
extreme poverty the great solution to
poverty in general is lies within the
poor themselves it's nothing that we're
going to create they have incredible
potential these folks that I work with
are far more capable far more
forceful far more intelligent that I'll
ever be they have survived through
things and learned lessons in life that
can equip them to do amazing things and
once we see the poor as peers and not as
little children than that need to be
handheld along the way that's when true
innovation and lasting solutions can
begin to be built so I talked about an
integrated model a lot of times when
folks talk about organizations talk
about integrated models they're very
they're very infrastructure intensive
very capital intensive which makes them
very difficult to scale we take a
different approach instead of trying to
be experts in all five of those areas
that we talked about like I told you
before there's a lot of great
organizations already doing good work in
this five areas right I mean it has
anybody heard of organizations out there
doing good work probably otherwise you
probably be at this talk so instead what
we do is we have this kind of mantra
there's no room in this business for
egos we don't care who gets credit so we
have a research team that goes out there
defines the very best models already
working in those five areas and then we
just go learn from those organizations
we do internships externships with those
groups we do conferences with them we
get their training manuals we learn
their model inside now probably better
than they do and we take those ideas and
we pull them into our programs into our
nuru communities and we equip our local
leaders with those models and with those
ideas and then nuroo simply acts as a
general contractor of the best and most
scalable ideas from around the world
we're taking lessons learned best
practices from other organizations who
have already worked on it that does a
couple things for us it saves us a lot
of money saves us a lot of time okay and
it also prevents us from making mistake
after mistake after mistake this
reinventing of the wheel that this
sector is so challenged by so often so
as a couple examples I'll give you a
high-level snapshot of what we do in
each one of these five programs in
agriculture we're fighting chronic
hunger we seek to increase crop yields
to provide a stable supply of food for
the family so they can feed themselves
and some also creating some disposable
income to do that we actually use an
organization's model called one acre
fund one acre fund has put together a
groundbreaking model where it's very
simple you provide high-quality inputs
fertilizer and seed to people on loan we
don't do any handouts on loan you train
and equip them with the best practices
the best practices on how to use those
inputs and then you provide the
supervision to ensure that they're being
used properly just by doing that we've
been able to increase crop yields
between 150 and 200 percent in the
villages that we're working in this
dramatically changes the world for these
families you know not only they can you
feed their kids now but they also have
disposable income you're creating an
economic base in the community so the
next question is okay what do we do with
that income there's a lot of challenges
now but with when when families in
extreme poverty have income they begin
to do things with it that aren't
actually that forward-looking so what we
do is our economic development program
teaches those families how to save we
have savings clubs you know there's
you'll hear a lot has anybody heard of
microfinance okay so you'll hear a lot
of talk about microfinance microlending
there's a lot of valuable lessons to
learn from micro finance but
microfinance a micro lending and
isolation don't work okay it can
actually be damaging to the community
you get a big culture of things like
predatory lending you know you have a
lot of individuals taking loans out that
shouldn't be taking loans out it's funny
because for some reason here in Silicon
Valley you might have what 1% of the
population that are really entrepreneurs
and they can actually build something
and scale it for some reason in the
developing world we think that every
poor person is an entrepreneur if you
give them a loan they can change the
world that's just not true okay they're
just like us not everybody wants to be
an entrepreneur first of all and not
everybody has the capacity to be a good
entrepreneur second so instead we teach
these folks how to save first how to
save and plan for their family's future
in basic financial planning then we
provide basic banking services to the
remote rural poor that they never had
before so they don't have they're not
they're not scalped by big banking fees
and high interest rates of lot of the
mfis that they see out in these areas
once they have a good savings profile
then we begin to introduce access to
credit so they can take micro loans out
the ones that are capable and the ones
that have an interest in that they can
also begin take loans out to pay for
school fees for their kids to build
businesses to expand their
to create more crops and then more
income okay so that's kind of a record
economic development program we've
learned a lot in that field from groups
like the Grameen Bank like a group
called frontline SMS credit from Kiva
you a lot of you probably heard about
Kevin Jessica Jacqueline and so that's
kind of what we do on our economic
development piece once we they have a
stable kind of economic base that we
produce through agriculture and economic
development now they have disposable
income that they can use to pay for
services in healthcare water and
education so our health care model is a
very simple model we actually stole it
for what I mean we partner with them but
we took it from living goods &amp;amp; Partners
in Health you guys has anybody ever read
mountains beyond mountains about Paul
Farmer brilliant man okay so he started
Partners in Health we learned a lot
about them from them about community
health worker models living goods was
started by a guy here in the valley
called Chuck slaughter and they have a
really cool model where it's like an
almost like an Avon lady model where the
health workers go Hut to Hut and they
teach best practices in disease basic
disease prevention and treatment but
they also sell health and hygiene
products to the families that are going
to actually help them this does a couple
things now the families don't have to
walk two hours of the market to try to
find these products but number two
provides a revenue stream that actually
helps cover the cost of that committee
health workers salaries that's our
health care program and we target
under-five mortality our goal is to
decrease the under-five mortality rate
in a lot of these areas so that kids
aren't dying from stupid diseases
malaria is completely preventable so is
diarrhea we all get diarrhea here I mean
nobody want to talk about it but
everybody sorry or two but we know how
to fix it we know how to treat it right
they don't have access to those basic
things to be able to do it so there are
thousands of people dying from that
crazy disease okay in water and
sanitation that we act that is actually
our focus our focus is to decrease the
diarrhea rate waterborne illnesses
waterborne diseases are one of the
leading causes obviously of diarrhea and
they're there for deaths of under fives
so what we do in water and sanitation
we've learned from a lot of really good
organization is like water or water aid
and some other groups and what we've
learned is is that actually targeting
sanitation is very important
a lot of groups you know that they go
out and they drill a lot of wells okay
it's a by water called point of source
solutions the challenge with that is
when you drill wells is very expensive
okay so we talked about scaling our
models in a sustainable way generating
revenues to pay for that it's very
difficult to pay for 15,000 US dollars
every well that you sink for a
population of 200 people and then
scaling that to a country it's over four
million people right so in these remote
areas that becomes very challenging so
we had to think kind of outside the box
and think about okay instead of pointed
source let's talk about point of views
because some of the latest research
right now shows that little girls you
know they go they go to these wells
let's say you drill a well you got clean
source of water the little girls go they
collect that water then they carry it on
their heads with their hands on top of
the bucket like this and they have fecal
matter on their hands so they
contaminate the water on the way back to
their homes so by the time they get home
families are still getting sick and
people were wondering why so instead of
point of source solutions we actually
address point of views solutions simple
things like teaching people to boil
water basic water filters things called
water garden which is chlorination
products okay and more importantly we
teach people how to just do good hand
washing techniques so our water
sanitation program actually sells a
suite of what we call wash products
washes water and sanitation and hygiene
we have hand washing units and and clean
water storage units that we actually had
local leaders go through the design
thinking methodology to design a
practical low cost model that can be
sold in the local communities then we do
training to generate demand for that
product and these things it's amazing
these things are selling like hotcakes
and is driving the diarrhea rates down
okay very simple solutions and the
really cool thing is is that this is not
like big brains in the West bringing
these ideas and these are these ideas
are coming from the communities too
they're helping take the best research
and best practices from around the world
filtering it through their the lens of
experience and knowledge that they have
survived through to make sure that the
solutions are relevant so they can be
lasting in finally in education what we
do is we target our goal is to increase
child literacy there's there are a lot
of probs you guys know I mean education
is a
globally education is a mess here right
this is one of the most challenging
areas to make an impact our goal is to
increase child literacy to what's called
a standard to level here in the US B
grade 2 or 2nd grade right and the
reason we target that is because at that
level of reading kids begin to learn to
read read to learn or read to understand
and comprehend so that when they're in
their history and science class and and
in the writing class they can actually
ask the reading there but their
textbooks they can understand the
concepts and apply them so instead of
going out there and buildings bunch of
schools and focusing on training
government-sponsored teachers we don't
do that you know actually what the
developing world does not need more of
is a bunch of buildings you know if any
of you have traveled in the developing
world you'll go out to these remote
areas you'll see a lot of empty
buildings that are have you know great
nonprofit names on the side of them or
some you know some rich dude's name on
the side of it and these are from really
well meaning people and well-meaning
organizations but the challenge is it's
they don't need more buildings okay they
need more capacity building all right we
need to be able to work from the
structures that are already in place to
be able to increase the education
obviously the kit of the kids teaching
teachers different learning techniques
different teaching techniques okay so we
actually do it take a different approach
and also building a lot of schools is
not sustainable either it's the same
problem as the wells have right every
time you build a school costs a lot of
money so instead we work within the
existing public school system we go to
those schools and work with the head
teachers and the teachers to do really
great alternative education practices
that go against the standard education
practices taught in a lot of developing
countries you know you might have heard
of this practice called rote
memorization type of learning it's a you
guys in the US the equivalence kind of
the lecture method it's very non
participatory you know it's just the
teacher in the front kind of blah blah
blah blah blah and the kids recite
exactly what the teacher just said
there's no learning in that you can pass
the test that way but there's no
comprehension that way we actually teach
experiential learning participatory
learning through things like reading our
writing workshops creative learning
games that the kids can participate in
and by doing that where you
o'toole piloted by a group called away
so that's it can effectively measure the
increase in the children's literacy
we're having a lot of success with that
we also target out of school kids
because one of the challenges in these
areas there's a lot of kids in these
communities that just can't go to school
you know their parents can't afford to
pay for them to go yet so what we do is
we build a Learning Center a drop-in
center where these children can come we
build one per district okay so these
kids can come from the outlying areas
and experience actually the same
programs at the Learning Center staff by
new route Kenya staff so that's kind of
a summary of our programs and now I'll
talk to you a little bit briefly about
our impact and then I'll take any
questions so you guys might have okay so
it has been a very exciting time for us
you know we've seen this rapid growth
going from a handful of farmers to
15,000 people that were impacting now
and we've got you know we've got a big
vision we want to aggressively grow you
know with my background I want to do
this work and our team wants to do this
work in the worst toughest places in the
world we specifically selected remote
rural areas we don't do peri-urban we
don't do urban we focus on remote rural
areas and we want to be in failed States
and conflict zones so our target
countries are Somalia Yemen the Sudan
Afghanistan DRC those are our target
countries that's what I want to do this
work and that's where that we see the
greatest need to be right now but we
decided that we need to build this model
it's a very different approach and we
need to take it through proof of concept
in a relatively politically stable area
first that also demonstrates extreme
need I get this question all the time
this great question why did you pick
Kenya if you were in Iraq and saw this
connection right so that's why we need
to prove this model first take it
through proof of concept and then begin
to building into into more and more
volatile countries introducing more
volatility the model as we go once we
have that proof of concept you know our
our communities are no longer hungry our
communities have disposable income we're
seeing people going from mud huts they
are now building semi permanent homes
from brick and iron sheets I mean
there's amazing transformation kids kids
are going to school the schools are
crowded now right they're able to
actually they're there instead of the
kids being so afraid of learning now
they're they're participating in their
classes with their teachers the teachers
are coming to our new staff saying teach
us how to
teach like that you know we're seeing
hand-washing stations are showing up in
all the huts around the communities you
know people are using bed nets properly
for the first time in his bed nets that
they purchased not bed nets that we're
giving given that end up as wedding
veils or table cloths or curtains right
they're taught how to use these things
and malaria rates are going down as well
so it's some really exciting impact and
and we have a lot of hope for this model
and we have a bold vision for scaling it
to the big picture concept of where
we're going the new room model is
designed I told you it's self sustaining
once we hit a certain scale right our
unit of scale is 30,000 people and
Kennedy that looks like a district so
once we hit that scale the financial
models designed so that it is
self-sustaining and it's generating a
profit actually that will actually
enable us to fuel the expansion of the
district model to a second and third
district and then each of those
districts grow to scale impacting 30,000
and then they split off and start two
more projects but that's that's done by
revenues generated in Kenya and led by
Kenyans so what's to investors in the
West instead of dumping you know we've
dumped 2.3 trillion dollars into
sub-saharan Africa in last 50 years and
we don't have a whole heck of a lot to
show for it okay so instead of this
endless dumping of capital into the
developing world we're going to be able
to tell investors 2.5 to 3 million
dollars into this country we'll get it
we'll build it out to a sustainable
platform that will eventually impact all
of the communities in the remote rural
areas in kidney that's about four
million people so you're talking you
know you're talking less than a dollar
per person to have a permanent
sustainable impact empowering these
folks out of poverty and we're not doing
it they're doing it that's the key to
lasting sustainability so that's new
room I really appreciate you guys taking
the time to listen listen to me kind of
run my mouth a little bit here it's
really a privilege and honor to be able
to talk to you I love telling our story
I love spreading the word if you like
what you've heard today and refined and
interesting we would encourage a
dialogue with you guys if you have
questions I mean I'm on it I'm going to
be sticking around here Marion to go to
go to lunch Charles Malloy is also here
with me today
one of our staff members and we'd love
to answer questions that you have and
love to get you involved and you know
what when you walk away from today's
talk to I want you to realize that
there's a lot of other good
organizations out there as well if you
don't get involved with us and you don't
want to specifically maybe talk figure
out how you can involve us there's
there's a lot of other great work out
there I feel passionately that we're all
called to get into this fight against
extreme poverty you know I started my
talk by saying it's just not fair it's
not fair that these conditions exist and
you can do something about it so I would
encourage you as you walk away from this
fight you know you go back to your desk
just take 10 minutes take 10 minutes and
think about the gifts and talents that
you've been given you guys are really
talented bright people think about ways
that you can get into the fight against
extreme poverty if it's not with us
that's fine find another group that you
can get involved with because there's a
lot of ways to get into that fight okay
thanks so we've got time for a couple
questions so if you want to come on up
yeah thanks for a terrific talk and
things are doing oh I had one question
about your strategy for how you're going
to start and how you're going to expand
this it makes perfect sense what you
said about starting in some place like
Kenya and then looking at going to say
Somalia DRC or something do you have any
kind of indication of what kind of
reception the locals are likely to give
you they're not so much the people that
need it but the people who might you
know chase you away or shoot at you or
something yeah that's that's a great
question and you know with my background
doing when I had done in my in my former
life security challenges in developing
countries is kind of something that I
specialized in so we've actually we're
developing a lot of strategies about how
to work in very unstable very volatile
areas working with different clans
different tribes different militias
actually two and and trying to think
about creative incentives innovating
around creative incentives to ensure
that the work that's done in a seed
project does not get torn down by
rivaling tribes and one of the ways that
we do that in a very practical way is
the way that we scale as we grow we grow
immediately out from the communities
that we begin working in we don't do
what I call
village hopping you know a lot of groups
will have some success and they'll move
100 miles they'll plop another project
down there and scale from there so you
have little pockets that you grow from
around the around the country we
actually scale immediately out to the
communities around us and the reason
that we do that is because the new
villages are pulling us in it's a poll
effect they want they see the impact
right before their eyes and they want
their their families to be able to
benefit from the same stuff and so then
we take that model there and our leaders
are trained and equipped to be able to
take this model across tribes across
ethnicities to other people groups and
have a vision to do that in this kind of
servant leader type mindset is that your
question okay thanks I'm so um I was
looking at every listening to everything
you said in trying to imagine how how it
would translate to a card country I have
a particular interest in which is
Liberia and Liberia is you know good it
wasn't on your list of since they're
technically a post conflict zone but one
of the things the missing pieces which I
think you've just touched on a little
bit is that there is a lot of remaining
conflict still there so there is ethnic
conflict but there's also a massive
amount of land use conflict over whose
lambdas actually is right and since
you're building primarily from an
agricultural standpoint I'm going to
guess that in DRC and Sudan there's also
land use and ownership is a major issue
do you have have you started thinking
about how to tackle those issues we have
actually am but that's a great question
first of all let me say that I don't
know okay I don't have a perfect answer
I don't know as an excellent an
excellent way to start that's that's a
that's a that's a great question and
we're working hard to try to find an
answer for that we have some other
groups that we're working with that are
already doing work in DRC specifically
because DRC's are very interesting a
challenging area for that specific
problem there's a lot of land grabbing
this going on right now and we've got a
group there that's working on blocking
off ten hecht our farms and / working
with groups of farmers actually instead
of individual farmers groups of farmers
that will own that land together because
a lot of these societies our group of
oriented societies it's not really as
individualistic as it is here in the
West and
working with those groups to produce
high value products or high value crops
on those plots of land and then having
many of these kind of ten hecht are
plots within a given community to really
increase the size of the population that
and an ownership of that land there's
there's a lot of challenges when it
comes to governments to you know in
Ethiopia Ethiopian government owns all
of the land and technically they could
seize back any land that these farmers
begin working with so we're about to go
into Ethiopia as our second project for
launching that in March and some of the
challenges of land use and land
ownership are very important to us as we
begin to do this so we're studying a lot
of models of different approaches that
people are using there's some
interesting stuff going on in in India
as well but if you have any lessons
learned or things that you'd like to
help us out within that area I'd love to
listen to you and have a conversation at
this point I have more questions than
answers yeah i'll follow up or if you
hear anybody also that has answers to
please let me know yeah thank you thanks
for coming out I was thinking you know
if you increase crop yields it's really
great for the current generation ray
because you have a surplus but there's a
lot of growth in the population the next
generation is kind of back where you
started so I was wondering if you guys
do education and your health care plan
if you incorporate family planning into
that and yeah we approach that is mmm we
do so in our inner health care program
we focus on mostly on the diseases that
are killing the kids okay so in our area
the the three big leading causes of
death for under 5s is diarrhea malaria
and what's called RTI respiratory tract
infections so a lot of our interventions
really focus on that but we also do a
lot of maternal health and family
planning stuff as well because as you
just mentioned one of the biggest
challenges is as these communities grow
one of the biggest challenges for
fathers and single mothers and that
actually do own land is parsing that
land out to their children so there's
there's a lot of challenges of migrating
populations as well because you know
commit villages grow to capacity for
these these parcels of land and then
they have large tribal marketer
migrations to other areas that cause a
lot of times tribal conflict you know as
they begin to enter into a new air
area so there's a lot of interesting
work being done in the in teaching
farming practices and high value cash
crops that require very very small units
of land a lot of the farming work
agricultural work that has been done to
date has been done on anywhere from one
and a half to two hecht are plots of
land hectars about 2.4 acres the work
that we do actually focuses on land
sizes of about one and a half acres and
less and so we really try to take really
small plots of land and convert that
into a significant increase in capital
for the family you mentioned wanting
your approach to be driven by data and
measurements of how successful things
were um it's pretty easy to see how that
could work in agriculture how does it
work in some of the other domains you
mentioned that's a great question so we
have we have a team a monitoring and
evaluation team that focuses on best
practices in in monitoring and
evaluation in measurement and measuring
impact in the social sector and there
are there are best practices in
developing metrics we actually divided
our metric system into two big pieces
our first major metric area is what we
call poverty metrics and this is
measuring the efficacy of our model at a
meta level so it's understanding have we
create an enabling environment in this
community whereby people can make these
choices it focuses on 10 dimensions
total it's a we use a tool called the
impact multi-dimensional poverty
assessment tool that was developed by a
group called a fat in the at the UN and
the goal of that tool is actually to
measure this enabling environment in 10
dimensions we focus on 5 of those but
the other the other five are also
important and these are kind of proven
tested metrics that have undergone
rigorous kind of scrutiny and along the
way to ensure that they're they're
measuring what we need to measure and
then below that though we have another
level metrics we call program metrics
and each one of our interventions we
actually put this a little bit technical
so I'm sorry if I I'm boring everything
each one of our interventions we
actually put through logic models to
ensure that we are measuring outcome
metrics a lot of groups end up measuring
input metrics you know like how
people attended a meeting you know how
many how many people were trained how
many bed nets did we sell here okay are
things like that what we try to measure
to the best of our building our program
metrics our outcome metrics okay so how
many people are getting malaria what was
our increase in crop yield what's our
increase in household savings how many
people got diarrhea last month that
those kind of things and so we've
through the development and these are
not metrics that we just made up sure
these are these are again we do our best
to learn from other people so we took
best practices in in evaluating and
measuring efficacy of models and we kind
of built a composite metric system that
forms our program metric system and so
do you have results yet that you can
look at that and say yes this is working
this isn't there yeah so we have we have
results in egg and agriculture in
economic development we call it CED
Community Economic Development we don't
have those yet in health education and
water because we just collected our
baseline data so we want to give the
model enough time so that the evaluation
will actually make sense right you know
if we measure too quickly it's it's not
going to let show us anything so we're
looking in about six months to be in
collecting metric data again to to begin
seeing what the efficacy levels of our
models are and again these are
prototypes so these are these are models
that have worked in other areas of the
world that we are now implementing and
these are models that we can see
anecdotal evidence of success but it's
not data-driven yet so one of the
projects we have right now is we're
building out a pretty massive database
to be able to house all that data so we
can do solid kind of queries and
analysis that will inform operational
decisions in sign okay thanks thank you
so what steps do you have to take to
keep your people secure in Kenya and I
suppose you'll be going other places
they're less secure later ethiopie you
said until we oh yeah and how well do
they work I mean how well sorry how well
do they work what fraction of your
people get have various unpleasant
things that could happen to them right
right so um that's a great question and
we chose Kenya first and Kenya is a
relative i mentioned relative
politically stable but if I'm sure if
you know much about the rip current
history recent history of Kenya there
was a lot of violence actually in the
last elections and there were there were
over 300 300 people that were killed in
that violence and so there are things
that happen and even in even the most
stable countries we like to think about
we feel like extreme poverty is a real
driver of violence and conflict and we
like to think about all the countries
that we working on a failed state
spectrum some of those at the very top
like Somalia are completely in a failed
state situation others that are more
stable like Kenya or Tanzania it
wouldn't take that much actually to let
to to push the country into a failed
state situation so whether we're working
in a quote-unquote safe country or in
one of the failed states at this point
we need to think about security measures
so in Kenya for our expat staff we have
we've built a small little compound
where they are their house then they
have security there that protects their
their own persons as well as their kind
of property for folks that are operating
with us but in the community as well
this is a community-led community driven
product project we don't have outside
Kenyans coming in doing this so what
tends to happen because we have we
measure something called the penetration
rate in our communities how many what
percent of the population is actually
involved in our projects a lot
organization see between 10 and 15 we
see between 70 and 75 and that's really
important for security because if you
have a lot of the population in these
villages that are involved in your
project anything that threatens the
success of that project they will
protect themselves and we've seen some
great results from that we had some of
our staff get mugged and beat up we had
one of our farmers killed and the
community really rallied around that to
protect any further incursions from
happening so while there have been some
incidents the community themselves
actually protect and I'm assuming you're
talking about mostly local staff is that
protection of security issues yeah so
the community themselves have been
protecting and safeguarding them because
they don't want they don't want this
project to fail they feel like it's
their project it's theirs to own in its
there's the protector
that is your question um so first of all
I think that the sort of model of
identifying local leadership and having
the community drive itself is great and
can get answers a lot to this sort of
current polarizing debate around whether
eight is totally paternalistic or really
necessary so think it's a nice in
between but i was wondering given that
there's obviously different politics and
governance systems and security issues
that you're dealing with as well as like
vastly different cultural variances like
how do you actually identify that
leadership do those people come to you
do you work with Peace Corps people in
the area like how do you actually go
about starting a community that's a
great question our leadership
development program is I mentioned
before is the foundation everything we
do and that includes how we screen
identifying equip leaders from the very
start and I'll give you some I'll give
you some examples of how we do it
because it's a little more concrete okay
so when we first go into an area we
might call a leader meeting and you have
a lot of characters come to the leader
meeting right you have a lot of
self-proclaimed leaders that are there
to leverage whatever assets you have you
know people see Westerners come in and
they automatically there's funding
there's money there's whatever I want
whatever handout they have coming
especially in areas where there's been a
lot of international development work so
at that meeting we're very clear and our
local staff are very clear we actually
make an effort we learn the language
there because we feel like that's an
issue of respect so we we talk to the
people and also our local leaders or
translators are also talking to the
people and we tell them first of all
we're not here there's not gonna be any
handouts there's not going to be any
programs or services either we're here
to learn about your community and the
challenges that your community faces in
poverty and that's it we liked a couple
of you to help us out in trying to
understand and meet members of your
community but you're not going to be
paid it's a volunteer position and we'd
love to we'd love for some of you so to
come up and work with us and immediately
you lose like eighty percent of the
people in the room right so that leaves
probably twenty percent of the folks we
actually have three kind of levels of
screening for our leaders the first one
is this issue of the attitude of service
they have to have an attitude service
for the community and that's the first
level screen so we get that twenty
percent and we say hey guys can you take
us to the field and start introducing us
to some farmers so we go to the field
and talk to the farmers and we ask the
farmers you know not who are the leaders
in the community because later carries a
lot of baggage folks in these areas
leadership is a position to leverage for
your own gain and that's that's what
they're used to seeing their leaders so
instead we say hey are there any
individuals in this community who have
really helped you when times are tough
that you really look up to that has
helped your family get through really
bad times and has mobilized the
community together to push through a
rough spot in history so they point us
to those folks and then we go and
recruit them we recruit those
individuals to try to get them in the
door so we take that twenty percent in
this recruited kind of cadre of leaders
that the farmers have pointed us to and
they begin kind of a cadre of leaders
that we start working with these folks
now enter into a probation period and
the second level of screening is can
they show up on time can they can
demonstrate the work ethic that we need
for this job so can they show up on time
can they work long hours and long days
they're not paid there's paid a small
stipend essentially opportunity cost for
being away from their farms so they can
still feed their families but they're
not paid a salary so they it's a
six-month probation period where they're
they're really have to be dedicated to
be able to make it through that at the
end of that six months if they've proven
themselves now they enter into the final
stage of screening so we hire them as a
staff member we pay them a market-based
salary a truly market base salary based
on experience and knowledge level that
they would earn on the outside not in
another NGO you know NGO compensation
markets is crazy as the old adage about
the world vision bus driver who all
these doctors leave medical clinics to
go become world vision bus drivers
because they're paid so highly we
actually try to pay really market base
salaries actually slightly below market
to ensure incentives are proper so we
start paying these folks of salary and
then we actually evaluate them for
competent core competency in the program
area they're working in and this is done
through a rigorous performance
evaluation system like similar actually
to the one that you guys have here you
know you would see a McKenzie actually
we use your 360 feedback forms from
google actually as part of what we do
show you all of 360 feedback and as part
as part of what we do so that actually
is a very rigorous kind of
performance-based evaluation that and we
lose a lot of people along the way but
this helps ensure that we get the right
types of leaders in the positions that
were in and all along the process
they're receiving a ton of training
and capacity building equipping them to
be critical thinking problem-solving
innovators sorry I gotta go when we just
take out a little more question and then
wrap it up um thanks for the talk great
talk no no slides very good now I
appreciate that uh I guess my question
is a lot of charity evaluation systems
you know they'll say like is there a
funding gap you know like if you were
suddenly to receive a you know if Larry
shows up and gives you like a billion
dollars you know I what would you do
with you here yeah maybe I don't know is
he's learning the house what would you
do with that money or is is the funding
gap not the big issue is it like do you
need other kinds of resources like
talent you people to develop things for
you like one of the big challenges that
that you see sort of in the next you
know six months to a year yeah that's a
really great question and I'll tell you
that this sector the biggest thing that
we suffer for is from is lack of good
people okay we need the best and
brightest out there to apply their minds
and their thought processes to this
problem you know extreme poverty is the
greatest crisis of humanity for our time
and we as RJ our generation has the
ability to do something about that so
it's people human resources is the
greatest gap that we experience now
there's also clearly a funding gap the
challenge that organizations focus our
experience in the funding gap is if
Larry showed up today and said I'll give
you a billion dollars I can't use a
billion dollars but the reason for that
is we're not through proof of concept
yet we have three more years to get
through proof of concept when a model
that's scalable and sustainable reaches
proof of concept then it can take a
large amount of funding and begin
scaling rapidly around the globe as long
as you have a steady income stream a
revenue stream to be able to do the
financial capital be able to do that but
also a steady pipeline of solid
effective leaders who can lead that
expansion right I mean you guys at
Google here have grown an astronomical
rate and one of the challenges you've
had in that I'm sure it's people
problems right finding continuing to
find high quality people that can join
your ranks even with your great brand so
a young organization like us we have to
define a very effective brand so people
understand what we're doing and how
we're doing it and it's an attractive
there's a lot of
a clear value-added from what we're
doing and we need to be able to show
that when you come to nuru you're going
to be able to have global impact using
the resources and abilities in cape and
skill sets that you bring to the table
so though i'd say those are the two
biggest challenges human resources and
financial capital but once you get
through that proof of concept stage if
your organization is set and wired to be
scalable and sustainable you've done
your homework and you build a model to
be able to do that and your organization
has the capacity to do that then you can
really use that money and actually one
final thing I'll say on that is when one
of the things that folks in the social
sector or suffer from is this concept of
you need to build a company you know too
many organizations are structured so
they have this little project going in
Africa and there's nothing to support it
if you want to do this right you have to
build a company you have to have human
resources you have to have finance you
have to have marketing and branding team
you have to build a company a high value
high quality company to deliver a high
quality product and it takes good people
