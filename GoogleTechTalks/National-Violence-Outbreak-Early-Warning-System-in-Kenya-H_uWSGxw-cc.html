I'm going to get right into this into
talking about conflict early warning and
what an example from Kenya so I'll just
start off with with a little intro clip
all right so this is what I'm gonna be
talking about about how in the context
of Kenya the Kenyan government has sort
of come on board with using ICT for
conflict prevention conflict early
warning and just in in general just
using more of ICT we've used Google Maps
and the development of a conflict early
warning system so that's what I will be
talking about today just a quick example
about what has been done over there so
as as we as I showed you in the video
usually there is a disparity between the
collective and what the government has
been doing and in order to sort of see
what's been happening in the world and
the more prescriptive lens we need to be
able to look at how the government
engages with people so the traditional
governance structures that we've seen
has been sort of a top-down governance
the collective's lives have been have
been influenced by career politicians so
the whole idea of democracy that we have
seen in general were more from that
point of view and as a result of the
control of media by government etc they
were the ones who had the voice piece in
the vocal piece and then any sort of
disgruntled mess by the general public
has sort of been in no cohesive manner
being able to be shared to the
government so this is what traditional
governance has been like now as a result
we've seen sort of these revolutions
happening in different places so when we
look now into the direction in which
governance has been going we're looking
at collaborative governance
collaborative governance is sort of now
understanding that there is a medium in
which the larger public is able to
engaged with one medium using various
networking tools to be able to notify as
to what they are upset about or what
they think about certain policies etc so
it also decentralized it centralizes the
whole governance structure
it also gives empowerment and it's a
hybrid form of government
that a lot of countries are starting to
realize is the only way to go just with
the whole movement of Technology so now
you have a more cohesive way of trying
to bring your concerns to the government
and then the government has a need to
respond so the only way to go is by
embracing it so the introduction is the
embrace now that I'm talking about Kenya
we can see that my personal engagement
was actually done with the United
Nations Development Program which is
specifically now working with the
government of Kenya and this particular
unit was tasked with making an early
warning system it was formed after
post-election violence some of you might
have heard about the post-election
violence it happened in 2008 there was a
large number of people that were killed
a large number of IDPs as a result and
then the next sort of I'm setting a
backdrop here as I'm talking that first
unit was UNDP that I talked about the
second unit that I'm talking about here
is the National Steering Committee on
conflict management and peace building
this is a hybrid organization in Kenya
that engages with government as well as
civil society it's a very unique place
it's sort of acts as a bridge most of
the time civil society would complain
saying that we don't quite get to see
what the government is doing there's not
a lot of engagement directly happening
so how do you sort of reconcile that
different disparity so hence the
position of the National Steering
Committee they have something called
district peace committees which are sort
of all over the the country of Kenya
they are local chiefs they're volunteers
they're pastors etc and they are more
influential in the local area arena as
opposed to politicians so you're sort of
really coming down at the community
level as well as engaging with
government with such a structure
post-election violence in 2008 like I'd
mentioned before there was sort of
people many people said that it wasn't
something that they expected but there
were enough signs almost every election
election in Kenya has been violent there
was sort of an investigation done call
the wacky commission where they found
out that there was enough information
for us to prevent things that were
happening there is political ethnic
benefit so if you're president from your
particular ethnic group was elected then
you're you as a whole ethnicity who
would benefit as a result so that's sort
of just giving a little bit of a
foundation on what was happening there
during that time now crowd sourcing
tools that were used during the
post-election violence they were
blogging
Oh Facebook and uh Shahidi for those of
us who are unaware of for Shahidi
Shahidi is a crowdsourcing tool that
uses mapping technology etc to be able
to see where SMS text messages are
coming from we'll be able to log on to a
site to be able to see how that actually
works in just a little bit and Facebook
and Twitter as well they were some of
the things that were used the media was
another arena that was used for during
the conflict as some means to prevent
you could see some of the media
newspapers during that time save our
beloved country etc so they could be
used for positive messages now the
traditional concept this is what I'm
going to be really going right into is
of conflict early warning see EWS is
what we're gonna be calling from now a
lot of conflict early warning was
disorganized information sourcing there
was a huge gap between knowledge knowing
that there is an early warning
information coming in and the early
response which took a long time before
it they actually brought them together
and then there's a lack of cohesive
response strategy so for example even if
you didn't know you would go and try to
firefight and prevent something but it
wouldn't be the same because there's
other people doing the same thing from
some other side so you just have sort of
this disorganized feel of conflict early
warning this was before the integrated
conflict early warning system prevention
has turned into firefighting because of
the lack of cohesion you'll have one guy
thinking he's doing something very
unique by putting out a fire and then
another guy thinking the same thing
and as a result again lack of cohesion
in the response strategies for the
system now what this system incorporated
was three major areas the national
sourcing the media sourcing and the
crowd sourcing these were the three main
tools that were used for the conflict
early warning system traditionally
conflict early warning systems either
had the national sourcing which involved
intelligence which involved the peace
monitors on the ground internal security
etc that was one type of early warning
or the other kind which was completely
crowdsourcing was just relied on people
which if you think about it is kind of
like a blog it's just a whole a whole
bunch of people who might write a lot of
things but the implementation factor of
such such crowdsourcing was lacking
because it wasn't connected to these
other levels such as the national
structure sourcing now the media
sourcing which is extremely critical in
terms of accountability of conflicts
around the world is sort of just making
use of a structure that is already there
we have reporters that are in different
parts of the field they their job is to
go out there and report on things that
are happening on the field why do we
need to send someone there to find out
what's happening when you're already
getting information there so hence
bringing those three together to form a
very sort of accurate conflict early
warning system was very key so a
conceptual idea how do you bring this
together and why do we need to bring
this together so first I'm gonna touch
quickly on this whole idea of crowd
sourcing which OSHA Heidi has been very
much a part of and you can see sort of
the rationale being that most conflicts
happen wherever there are people and
people have many ways to say things and
some of the means that they use are SMS
technology you've got computers internet
and you know this they have a potential
to bring about something called smart
mobs which is what we've been seeing
happen lately so these smart mobs are
basically the collective they behave in
an intelligent way and they can increase
exponentially sort of like the
the way we looked in the video earlier
with the one cell phone kind of
replicating and it's messaging going all
through different places then social
coordination so and self-organizing so
you can have masses coming together
without necessarily a governmental way
to say let's all come here for such a
protest or something like that these
were some of the tools that were used
most recently in various places like
Egypt etc I think we're all familiar
with these here's sort of the rationale
for crowdsourcing to link on to SMS if
you look here at the trend back from the
year 2000 the blue there talks about how
looks at the developed nations and the
cellphone usage there and now you look
at the developing nations up into 2010
you'll see that the majority of the cell
phone subscriptions that are happening
worldwide are there hence you can see
sort of the trend in which cell phone
technology has been going again here
this is another global ICT development
2000 to 2010 we're looking here at
mobile cellular subscriptions going up
another reason why crowdsourcing is
dependent on SMS technology in mobile
cellular technology here social
networking this is just a quick map off
Facebook linkages across the world well
most of the relationships tend to sort
of focus on and you can see the big
blackout in China which has a repressed
sort of place where the whole social
networking experience has been sort of
subdued as a result of governmental
interference but you can just sort of
see the linkages there and as a result
see how important it is to incorporate
those into various structures of
governance so here is sort of where how
conflict early warning has sort of
changed first in generation conflict
early warning systems they used to be a
top-down state centric kind of early
warning system where you have people
like intelligence etc reporting for
early warning things that are happening
a lot of conflict zones nowadays
have the first and second and second
early warning systems perhaps some of
them have the third-generation which is
managed by NGOs this is kind of like low
Shahidi
which is more crowdsourcing etc but the
Ford generation is sort of a hybrid its
a mix between open-source software that
means things that are available to play
a like Facebook Twitter etc and the OSHA
Headey platform as well as SMS to make a
more comprehensive early warning system
so this is sort of the direction that
you know we're trying to lobby
governments etc so this is just an
example from Kenya and this is what they
have decided to go for in Kenya a 4G
system media sourcing various forms of
media the rationale for media sourcing
it's already reporters on the field
Google Alerts
a very important tool in terms of
conflict early warning you'd be
surprised to know how much is unknown to
even local countries which Google can
probably bring into the use of Google
Maps for just visualizing data from
different places how it is changing the
conflict is changing what kind of
services are available in what area how
to respond as a result of using these
maps etc a newspaper radio TV pretty
self-explanatory national sourcing this
is the part that this system is very
uniquely focused on because what it is
is it's very prescriptive to the country
so as I'm going to go through this if
you do have questions on this you can
quickly perhaps just raise your hand and
ask but I would prefer we take questions
at the end
national information sources are piece
reports UN security reports and internal
security reports this is generally how
the national sourcing of reporting comes
in so what happens is these reporting
structures take a lot of time you have
somebody sitting out in the field
who would fill out a report and then
you'll have someone else receiving the
report and it takes time to read it and
sort of make it into sort of
comprehensive bill data that you can
then respond on so in Kenya
Kenya is governed by this area called
not governed but rather has egad which
is Intergovernmental authority on
development which is sort of overseeing
these seven countries in terms of
conflict prevention etc they have a
system called C Warren which is conflict
early warning and early response and its
mandate includes Kenya as well as well
as six other countries but sometimes the
information gap that I hadn't mentioned
before between early warning and early
response could take up to three weeks by
which time it's too late you already
have loss of lives etc that have
happened and the person who usually
collects this data is overloaded with
information and has to sort of make it
into a manageable piece lack of
information gathering network framework
as a result of all this disorganization
that we're seeing so what we had was
those open source reports where people
on the field were just filling out
information in two pieces of paper to
now an indicator based multiple-choice
report this is a way in which reports
are instantaneously graphed they're
customized to the location of reporting
they have a low bandwidth interface so
an indicator what is an indicator an
indicator is sort of instead of having
you fill out and spend a lot of time
filling out things I will just have a
statement and you can choose how to
answer to it whether you strongly agree
to this statement strongly disagree this
statement agree to a statement or if you
don't know the answer this statement and
what what the system will do is based on
your answer it quantifies your response
to seeing the severity of such such an
indicator whether you if you say
strongly agree and the indicator is
marked as something that is really
potentially volatile I would be able to
respond to it a lot quicker so usually
each template has about 50 indicator
questions that people can respond to at
which point they will then be able to
respond immediately to such a thing
qualitative information - quantitative
information so this is just some of the
lingo that I might be using is an
indicators of status statement which the
user response to based on observation
and a template is a group of indicators
and a cluster is a group of templates
okay so we won't be getting into that
too much right now but just because of
time but that's sort of the structure
now the reason that we have to tailor
these indicators to different areas is
that you can't have one size that fits
all the conflicts that are in Kenya are
complex in nature you have some places
which have pastoralists kind of complex
rural or urban so the same suit cannot
fit the other two areas here the
development of customized indicators so
these were developed by myself and some
other people we'd go down into the
communities and we'd look at what the
problems were within that area and come
up with what these statements are gonna
be like so in Kenya we would go up north
to closer to the Turkana region
sometimes we would bring them over to
Nairobi and we'd be asking them as to
what it is that they that they need in
their area that would respond to some of
the problems that are there and they
were finally agreed upon using the Delfy
method which is a group understanding a
certain statement is better than just
one person deciding that this is the way
to go
so again just showing this difference we
have governmental structures saying one
thing and then the separation of the
people saying the other thing but the
idea of the system is to break that
barrier down
so now conflict early warning three
tools just sort of springing this home
here is you got the national sourcing
Meteor sourcing and crowd sourcing but
you still have it in a disorganized box
but what this interface does is you
start to increase your radius of
coverage - from national sourcing which
was just in some places media sourcing
with some places but now you have the
crowd sourcing which incorporates pretty
much every other radio and this is what
the system does it or gets all this
information into the conflict early
warning system platform and then
disseminates it into the different areas
based on location priority etc this is
the Situation Room at the National
Steering Committee which was designed
after the software had been put in place
the Situation Room is equipped with
eight computers and has a way to Skype
with field monitors on the ground we can
use the places mostly the hub for
analysis of these reports that are
coming in either whether it's SMS or
whether it's the monitors on the ground
etc the media updates and then we can
visualize the conflict trends and make
decisions in a more cohesive manner you
can see some more pictures here at the
Situation Room in Kenya and this is
where the analyst sit etc the three
interfaces that we have using for the
conflict early warning system one is a
public interface this is where the
crowdsourcing aspect of the whole system
takes place the it's very open its
interactive to everybody the field
interface is a low bandwidth interface
that the reporters use when they are
logging into the system they log into
the system and a low bandwidth interface
if they have slower internet connections
in the remote parts of Kenya they can
log in and it's a very simple interface
just submit their report by filling out
strongly agree disagree etc to the
reports and then the NSC interface which
is sort of the admin view of the whole
thing so those are the three main
interfaces now this is the main
interface now I'm gonna ask Derek if we
do have time to go through these
interfaces then I can do so but if not I
can take questions as well
okay we'll take a look all right so this
is the public interface right here it's
called Imani Kenya at 108 Imani being
peace and 108 being the shortcode that
we acquired through the communications
council of Kenya it's a free shortcode
kind of like Crimestoppers you have a
number but you know anyone can SMS an
SMS technology in Kenya is in many ways
quite superior and here we're just
seeing sort of the public you know any
picking up keywords in Kenya etc and
then on the right you have a column
where we can sort of update on things
that are happening at the National
Steering Committee now this site is on
the web it's it's online but it's not
live it's not alive because it hasn't
been advertised until this 108 code is
gonna be gotten which is supposed to be
in about two to three weeks as soon as
that's gotten they will start an
advertising campaign by which time
people will be responding to the reports
that are coming in over here how the
public can use their voice to report
they can use it either through SMS email
Twitter or just submit a report right
here so they can submit a report just in
this form down here you can see that if
they want to keep their report private
they can just put a certain code before
they're the things that they have to
write and it's kept private otherwise it
appears on the left here and everyone
will be able to see what's been coming
in and you know the idea of having
something verified or not just gives
more credibility to the information so
that you know that anyone can write
anything over there and then we have
some minor encryption just down on the
bottom here for submitting your report
an interactive map just shows as my
sms's are coming in from the field I'll
be able to look into what categories
they are distributed in
so right here we're looking at just this
is samples obviously because it's not
live you can see where the two messages
have come from what part and I can view
the two reports zoom in zoom out what
those two reports are I can filter it
based on what type of categories I have
chosen to put in for the system of
crowdsourcing so if I'm using for sexual
assault theft property loss etc they
automatically get filtered as I
immediately send the SMS in yes yeah
yeah right so this is the public
interface right so as I just go down
here quickly and I'll show you what the
rest of this page is so it's just
another report now the integration comes
here this is where I as someone in the
situation room would log in and be able
to look at how this data is coming in
all right so now this is at the National
Steering Committee I log in alright so
this is sort of a little bit of usage
here this is just showing where my
location at the situation room I was as
a user I was positioned in this place in
the beginning so it just shows my info
right here and then if I were to go into
manage SMS I can just say click on view
SMS so this is again an admin view which
is much more complex I can see where the
reports have been coming in so if the
report has been sent by the public it
comes up on the left as a sender being
public and it just shows me the message
etc and where the location all the
tagging zzyx all of that now you see the
thing on the right which is the coding
so some of the problems that we've
noticed is with platforms similar to a
shahida is that you have multiple
messages coming in from different places
so for example if there's a fire here on
the google campus you have 20 people
calling 9-1-1 which if you were to
display that on a map could give and in
not a very accurate way to represent one
fire it
sort of gives the idea that there might
be many fires happening here so what it
does is a conversation is added within
that sort of just like Gmail does it is
like you had this conversation just kind
of going back and forth and hence you
have that code on the right and then you
can see the keywords over there that was
picked out from that SMS that was coming
in and then as a monitor if I'm a
monitor on the field I'm actually
assigned an SMS code which you can see
here view your SMS code is number one so
for example if I am in in Nairobi but
I'm actually supposed to be based out of
another part of Kenya and I get
intelligence that something is happening
on the field where I'm supposed to be
based at I can send an SMS code from my
phone with that with one and then hash
and then whatever the SMS is and I'd be
able to sort of notify the Situation
Room that it's me who is reporting hence
increasing credibility a little bit more
of the information coming in because the
problem with crowdsourcing and depending
completely on crowdsourcing is that if
you rely completely on sort of the group
there is a possibility of manipulation
of information where which has happened
before that we have noticed so in order
to sort of help with the reliability on
that you have these monitors so if for
example five people here say there's a
fire we're like okay
immediately the closest one who's there
check it out and be on the standby to
respond instead of just responding
because sometimes you do respond by the
fire somewhere else actually and that's
the manipulation of information that we
can possibly see so this is the SMS part
if you see here there is something
called an auto to an altar tag time or
add an SMS tag so I can choose and
customize completely what kind of tags
these sms's are coming under they can be
silly words they could be Spanish words
French words whatever it is that you're
using lingo just local colloquial etc to
be able to pick out the right words to
go in there the right filters and
folders the auto tag time what it is is
if you're a sender just going back and
forth with
with the situation room just trying to
find out more information it keeps it
all into that one folder without
actually displaying it on the map and
hence just showing a better
visualization more accurate
visualization on a map so that is sort
of the SMS part now if they they are
submitting reports via the web like on
that website you would see it coming
over here you can see it says here that
would be the number that shows it up
here it'll be here public and you can
see what kind whether it's SMS etc so
yeah so all of this is shown in the
public sphere I can actually view SMS on
map here can you mute yeah okay so you
can you have the ability there are so
there's three levels of access within
the system you have an administrator and
you do have a super admin the super
admin is the one who totally deletes
that and the reason for that is just
because you don't want to have too much
ability to be able to just delete what
you don't feel right and stuff like that
so I can select a DPC location and view
things that are coming in by that DPC is
that sort of answer your part about the
public sourcing and the crowdsourcing
aspect of
it was important to integrate
crowdsourcing media yeah and kind of
national intelligence so I'm curious
where that integration happens right is
it just that all those different reports
come into the same interface you can see
them in the same place or ready for
later okay so there there are two
aspects to that one is they are on the
same interface yes and you search based
on your keywords so for example if
there's something happening in this
place you can sort of get a whole search
result which in some way is kind of an
integration of sourcing but the other
part which is very critical is regarding
on the human element which is in the
situation room where they are actually
people there who are supposedly trained
in conflict management that know what is
happening where and they're locals and
they are sitting there you know suppose
you know that's the plan is that they're
having it there now we do have people
who are sitting there and are doing this
and we have seen that it has been
successful so but you know the
crowdsourcing part obviously hasn't been
lost but in terms of the other part
we're able to see SMS is coming in from
a piece monitor saying that something is
happening on the ground here there is a
trade a right or a ritual that's
happening which means there's going to
be an attack in the morning so we can
send the security forces to sort of
quell whatever violence might be
happening there yeah very good and in
fact I'm gonna get to that as soon as I
get I'll go through the couple a couple
of these and I'll get to that right away
so here I'm just gonna show you here how
I'm managing the users that are that
have been associated with the system
reporting so here I'm having for example
different reporters from different parts
of the field there you can see what part
and level of access they have what kind
of template they're using and what kind
of indicators etc and you have all their
contact information etc all
together in one place I have a feeling
that this resolution is causing that
that interference their managed
locations I can view and edit locations
let's see that so this is again where
based on how they have reported on the
field and how they have answered your
questions they've been assigned colors
so you can see what area has been sort
of more volatile than the others based
on the reports and you can just be able
to see who's reporting how many reports
you have done and sort of those kinds of
things so these are this is part of the
National structure sourcing and then if
I were to go quickly here onto the media
reports I can the media reports are put
in physically by a person on the ground
who's going through newspapers all the
other media because not everything is
electronically available there in Kenya
so hence they're doing both they're sort
of consolidating all the electronic
media as well as the others and putting
it if they find YouTube clips or if they
find news clips etc they can attach it
to that media article so hence you're
developing a sort of archive into into
place for the media aspect of it so you
can see here that's also based on
keywords etc you'd be able to look now
going again in terms of the integration
I can view places by location so if I
were to view for example just Nairobi I
can see all the different reports in a
consolidated way to be able to see
what's happening on the ground in that
particular area so now that's that's
this and then here's just a search the
report now now if I were to go back to
the PowerPoint here so here's a tool
coverage now this it's what's important
to hear is that in in terms of
sovereignty issues okay this is kind of
where the whole international community
always grapples with questions about how
far can you extend your access into
sovereign governments first of all you
need to be able to convince them that
it's something that that can be embraced
it's not something to fight against okay
that's the first sort of the first step
so if they if they choose to fight
against it it's it's just it's not it's
kind of not doing any good in terms of
bringing it which is why it's considered
collaborative more so than it is just
direct democracy or any sort of thing so
that's the first thing and then the
second thing is I'll just I'll actually
go to this slide here what are the
underlying ideas of such a system the
decentralization of authority okay
because that text message that you saw
earlier which was go to Ed's ax or black
that was sort of that one of the first
big things that we saw with the text
message that happened in the Philippines
that caused a revolution there just a
few words but you know we were able to
sort of bring the collective together
the centralization of information now
that I think is key into the whole idea
of repressive regime if it's all located
in their office right perhaps the
alternative would be some sort of cloud
where you'd be putting this information
or perhaps in into another area but this
is the negotiation that is always going
to be a back-and-forth to my little
experience it is possible to say and
convince that it is in their best
interest to have it backed up in some
other way it's it seems that they
haven't been saying oh no we don't want
that they first show concern to it but
then after you mentioned that the good
reasons to have something like it I mean
it's up to the negotiations and it's
very case-by-case basis I know I think
you might have another question I'm just
going to go through these other things
and then we'll go back right to your
questions there accountability of
leadership now the thing is that as a
result of this early warning system
information is coming in we're not it's
not just them who have access to this
information at the end of every week a
whole an HTML link is sent to civil
society on the ground giving a whole
list of what's happening in different
places kind of a little security report
now civil society I mean if we have to
give some benefit of the doubt there at
least if it's not for the government
you're opening up a whole platform which
has strictly in the past been a closed
system too
much more open accountable system and
sort of relying on the capacity of the
collective to be able to do that but
here what you're doing is you're also
encouraging governments to take it on
instead of fighting it at first I think
that's in some way the direction in
which you know this example from Kenya
has been I don't know if that's a little
bit I mean we can talk after as well so
all right some of the lessons learned
from this is the early response to an
early warning it's called an auto
response what this system does is as a
result of these indicators the way they
answer so for example if I'm on the
field and I spill out my situation
report and I have a whole bunch of
indicators what has been happening in
the past I sent it out and it's sort of
sent to Limbo and I wait for three weeks
and I don't know what to do I'm gonna be
sitting down on the ground waiting
what's what's gonna happen so I have
sort of now prescriptively based on the
indicators and how they have answered
been able to direct them immediately as
to what to do okay so on the ground you
have these Chiefs or whatever they are
on the ground they're able to now click
Submit on their form and be able to say
okay go to the local this and talk to
this go to this talk to this go to this
so you've now sort of what was once a
wide gap between early warning and early
response you brought it a lot closer
with a very little bit of an overlap but
I don't think it'll ever be completely
overlapped but that's the way the
reality of the thing is because it's so
prescriptive and based on how the
conflict is but you have brought it a
lot closer to a usual traditional early
warning system so that's very critical
Riano success Liana was a platform that
was developed just an SMS very simple
black-and-white kind of system for the
referendum in Kenya and 2010 you would
have someone SMS we'd call the person
who SMS to find out it took about five
minutes of back-and-forth this one does
it pretty much instantaneously because
you're getting it and you'd be able to
categorize it and stuff like that the
second one is participant fitori early
warning which is key people power cannot
be ignored as part of a larger structure
so you would see that governments in
general even though they are
centralized they realized that a lot of
they're just even examples from North
Africa and Middle East right now
eventually if things aren't kind of
taken care of business in the interim
it's going to explode and the pilot
testing the local monitors on the ground
what they really appreciated about the
system was the huge importance of that
auto response feature so those were some
of the lessons that we learned during
this time new developments February 2011
I mean we've seen the Egypt's revolution
etc what's happening in Libya right now
Hillary Clinton announced the State
Department's looking into spending 20 to
30 million to promote the voice of the
people now I think like we can always
say that we they'll block Google they
block facebook but what we've seen is
that as a result of these blocking
there's like ten million ten other
software's are coming out to which you
can sort of get around those things and
you know we are relying on the people to
be able to find them and hence get
information out and perhaps that would
be the next challenge in which we really
we have to be looking at is to see what
happens when you know we've decided to
sort of stop what's happening in terms
of the internet space in our own country
that's kind of the next step in which
we're thinking so if you have questions
now is the time I really had to rush
this because we made in a one-hour
presentation into half an hour I'm
hoping it's good for time yeah so thank
you very much I'll be happy to take a
couple questions there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
