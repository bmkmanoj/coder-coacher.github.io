authors at Google team and tech talks at
Google team are pleased to welcome Fred
weary who will be top speaking to us on
the middle east and its current
political climate Fred weary is a senior
policy analyst at the RAND Corporation
his research focuses on Persian Gulf
security Iran and the u.s. policy in the
Middle East he spent 10 years as an
active duty US air force officer
focusing on Middle East affairs has had
professional assignments throughout the
Middle East and since 2009 he's been an
adjunct professor at Georgetown
University School of Foreign Service we
welcome Fred wary thank you thank you so
much for the for the kind introduction
and also for the invitation to be here
today my topic is the Middle East and
specifically the the upheaval that's
afflicting the region today the the Arab
revolutions of 2011 the great arab
revolt as they're called we still don't
really know the name of what's happening
it's so momentous some have called it
that the Twitter revolution it's still
unfolding really before our very eyes so
much so that some of my Iran colleagues
have sort of joked that when we're doing
media interviews on the Middle East you
need to keep CNN aren't in the
background just so you don't get scooped
and I think we were talking in the
elevator that it's unfolding so quickly
that by the end of our conversation
today could be a new place altogether I
think no one was really more surprised
about this upheaval then the the regimes
in the region the government's in the
region the Middle East has long been
thought of as sort of an exception to
the rest of the world that the while the
rest of the world was undergoing
democratization political change
increased plural is a pluralism you saw
the Middle East really in a state of
stagnation so a lot of our assumptions
about this region have been have been
quickly overturned by by what has
happened and the regimes in the region
really didn't even know what hit them
they barely felt the ground getting warm
beneath them before they were sitting on
top of a tall
and we'll get into that that surprise I
wanted to divide my talk into into
really four parts first some sort of
broad brush observations about what
really happened and why this is so
significant I've been studying the
region since 1992 when I went to Cairo
as an exchange student to study at the
American University in Cairo and this is
this is really the most momentous
transformative time in the region
certainly since I've been studying and
arguably in the last 50 years so I want
to try to capture that then we'll go
into why they started why do these
revolts happen what are the root causes
why did they spread to some regions and
not to others why did some countries
escape unscathed the implications for
the United States where we caught off
guard how well do we respond to this
what does it mean for our interests in
the region in the Middle East and this
incredibly important part of the world
and finally I want to conclude with a
balance sheet and I want to look at
who's coming out on top the winners and
losers and we're going to talk about the
islamic republic of iran al Qaeda the
stability of Saudi Arabia the larger
issues in the region that matter to the
United States let's talk about why these
these revolutions are so significant we
really have to grapple with with what's
happened and the fact that observers and
analysts are still trying to assign a
name for these revolutions this is not
really new if you go back throughout
history any time there's a revolution it
really represents a break from the
status quo it imparts a new vocabulary
into political discourse that is often
very unfamiliar and it's often in
hindsight that we see okay this
revolution was democratic this
revolution was Islamic but that
formation often takes a very long time
and we can see that in the revolutions
of 1789 1848 1979 in Iran the 1989 with
the the
follow the Soviet Union so what we're
looking at here is a very protracted
process that this could take a very long
time and it's important to remember also
in revolutions that the initial Victor
the people that often are drive the
revolution that spark it are not always
the ones that come out on top
revolutions have a way of being hijacked
by people that were not initially
involved in it or were marginal players
I think the the Arab revolutions of 2011
have really demolished or changed three
long-standing assumptions about this
this region the first is what we can
call the the Arab exception and this is
what I was referring to earlier that if
you look at all the regions in the world
that somehow the Arab world is immune to
the forces of political change that were
happening elsewhere it's specifically
democratization you saw with the wave of
uprisings that was transforming Eastern
Europe in the late 80s and 90s the push
for democratization in Latin America
even in Africa democratization was
taking hold for some reason the Arab
world seemed to be immune to that there
were a lot of explanations for that some
of them rooted in social science some of
them quite frankly very stereotypical
and racist some were saying there's
something about Arab culture that makes
them immune to democratization perhaps
it's the religion of Islam in the way
it's practiced that that is is really an
obstacle to democratization the oil
curse the fact that this this region has
so much oil that that impedes
pluralistic forms of government and
perhaps colonialization that that the
fact that these authoritarian regimes
have persisted is because this region
was under the thumb of European powers
and a corollary to that is that the u.s.
is now the power in the region and
because we're propping up these despotic
regimes there's been no political change
in the region that's all ended if it's
not ended its been challenged in such a
way that things will never never be the
same again the second issue is is the
second change is what I can call the
sort of Faustian bargain
that the people in the region endured
for so long and this is particularly in
these in these oil-rich countries the
idea that they would surrender their
personal liberties surrender a voice in
governance in exchange for stability and
economic growth for a variety of reasons
that I'll get into that that has changed
much of it has to do with the influx of
social media and technology but it also
has to do with sort of the perfect storm
conditions of economic stagnation the
decline and the ability of these regimes
to meet the expectations of their people
so that has changed and nothing can go
back to the way it was and third is that
the cachet or the idea of
democratization is back in fashion in
the Middle East it's important to
remember that after 2001 after the 911
attacks the United States really began a
push to get the regimes in the Arab
world to clean up their affairs to
democratize to reform there was this
notion that political reform was the
antidote to terrorism the so-called
drain the swamp idea that we cared about
what happened in Egypt and Saudi Arabia
because it spawned terrorism that
affected us so there was this big push
to get reform going the problem in the
region was that that was seen as being
imposed from the outside and
democratization really has to come from
the bottom up it has to come from the
grassroots it has to be incremental the
other problem with with democratization
and opinion polls really really support
this and I was doing fieldwork in the
region is that people associated it with
the US invasion of Iraq that this was a
case of a democracy forcibly imposed on
another country prematurely and that
this led to the cycle of sectarian
violence in the civil war that afflicted
Iraq that is all changed now because
people took matters into their own hands
this was truly orchestrated from the
ground up by everyday Egyptians
Tunisians
there's certainly there was assistance
from the outside we know that the United
States had NGOs that were that were
equipping and training many of these
activists in networking and
communication certainly the role of
social media played an important role
but ultimately people took things into
their into their own hand let's talk
about why why its spread what what
really caused these were revolts first
of all I think we need to temper some of
our assumptions about technology and
social media and i'll say this freely to
this this audience it's often called the
Twitter revolution the Facebook
revolution Twitter didn't make the
revolution people did I think these
technologies are enablers their
amplifiers but they're not the drivers
of the revolution we can talk about this
later what are the real structural roots
of what was happening in a lot of these
countries and we'll get into some
economics here you had this witch's brew
this perfect storm of three conditions a
low GDP economic stagnation a low median
age in other words a very youthful
population that had rising expectations
that in many cases was increasingly
educated and high unemployment in tandem
that with this you had rising food
prices falling wages increased
urbanization in the old system of the
regime's being able to meet the
expectations of their people was failing
now it's often these revolutions have
often been thought of as sort of a wave
that the the Arab world is experiencing
a cohesive wave of democratization
certainly there's communication between
the the activists in these countries we
know this from Tunisia and Egypt but we
really have to take a look at these
what's happening country by country each
country is very different and this
really I think helps explain why it
spread to some countries and not to
others specifically we need to look at
this concept of legitimacy how do people
see the ruler that they're ruled over
not necessarily as he is he democratic
does he respond to their voice but is he
respected
does he have the respect of key segments
of the population tribes the military is
he able to perhaps by that respect has
his tribe intermarried with other tribes
we find this in places like Morocco
Jordan and Saudi Arabia which by no
means are our populace democratic places
but they've emerged relatively unscathed
from these revolts because of this idea
of that that the ruler is legitimate
that is not the case in places like
obviously Libya Tunisia Bahrain where
you have a monarchy that scene is
incredibly illegitimate and corrupt and
ruling over a majority Shia population
so again we need to look at this at a
case-by-case basis if you look at what
happened in each country and how it
started and spread there were certain
population segments that allied
themselves with the with the protesters
and this really impacted the extent of
the of the revolts in Tunisia it started
out in the capital it quickly spread to
rural areas there was a strong labor
dimension the military stood aside which
was the key decisive factor in this in
this revolt but the military is not
really playing a decisive role in Egypt
this was a student-led youth revolt but
it was also very broad-based and
communal it was very disciplined which
is another key factor here the Egyptians
did not respond to the provocations of
the regime for them to use violence and
the decisive factor here was the
military the military had its own
identity the military said our interests
are better served by a lying ourselves
with with the student protesters on the
other spectrum we have what appeared to
be not simply rebellions but civil wars
going on and here we're talking about
Yemen and Libya Yemen has always been
bordering on a failed state the
oppositionists are sort of a shaky
constellation of secessionist from the
South Houthi rebellions in the north
al-qaeda tribes Libya what we're seeing
is a real fragmentation of the country
between the East and the West so the
challenges of each country of
of rebuilding and recovering from from
these rebellions will be different in
places like Egypt there's a strong
tradition of civil society people are
are acquainted with how to organize
themselves and debate issues there are
opposition movements so the transition I
think will be will be if not easier it
will be more more stable in Libya we're
going to be starting from the ground up
Libya was ruled over by Qaddafi for 42
years there was no civil society there
were no institutions people just simply
don't have the the ability to organize
themselves let's talk about real briefly
about us US policy did we see this
coming US intelligence analysts have
often been faulted for for failing to
predict these momentous changes in the
region going all the way back to the
fall of the Shah in 79 I think it's a
bit unfair it's holding them to a really
high standard because the actual
participants in these dramatic events
didn't even realize it was happening
until they were caught up to into it
things happen on an hourly basis I was
in Libya right up before the revolt
started up until the 17th and it was
very difficult to get a sense of what
was happening because the people
themselves were not even organizing it
was so spontaneous the regime certainly
didn't didn't think it would happen the
key catalyst in a lot of these revolts
why they spread is that there's some
galvanizing event and sometimes this is
an overreaction by the regime the regime
security forces go in they respond
harshly they kill protesters and
suddenly that becomes a rallying cry cry
and the the real face of the regime is
unmasked and the regime loses legitimacy
very quickly and population segments
quickly join the rebellion obviously in
Tunisia the very poignant tragic story
of the fruit seller who set himself on
fire became the catalyzing event in
Egypt there was the death of a very
popular blogger at the hands of security
forces in Libya was a massacre of
protesters in Benghazi in the city of
Benghazi on the fifteenth of februari
the arrest of a lawyer that quickly
sparked this this rebellion in in
Bahrain on the seventeenth of februari
the regime went in and killed seven
protesters in Pearl square and that
really galvanized the revolt another key
decisive factor that we often have a
scent have difficulty getting a sense of
is the loyalty of the militaries in
these countries for obvious reasons
militaries in these countries have a
vested interest in keeping their cards
close to their chests they obviously
want to present the appearance that they
are loyal to the regime but beneath the
surface they have their own grievances
and when the military changes sides it
happens very very quickly we saw that
obviously in Egypt and we saw segments
of the military defect in in in Libya
let's talk about winners and losers in
these in these revolts who's coming out
on top and what does it mean obviously
when this first started there was there
was a lot of euphoria in the press that
this was the shaking off of despotism in
the region that this was a wave of
democratization we need to we need to be
careful about this for the reasons that
i mentioned that revolutions tend to be
very protracted and bloody there's a
tendency for groups to hijack them
there's also a tendency for backsliding
that they can they can backslide that
authoritarianism kankan rear its ugly
head again we're seeing some some
discomforting hints of that in these in
these currents of current revolutions
obviously in egypt the role the military
is a key concern the military has a
vested interest in in preventing real
market liberalization in a private
economy they've got their own own
interests at stake the Islamists the
Muslim Brotherhood that took part in the
Egyptian revolutions are certainly no
Jeffersonian Democrats will get into
them later uh but there's a real concern
that that their weight could carry the
day and that these more secular liberal
voices could could fall by the wayside
and finally any time you shake up
system like Gaddafi's Libya which I've
been there and it was a very very stable
place no crime there was very little you
know violence of any sort sectarian
ethnic tribal I mean he kept a lid on
what was happening there any time you
take that lid off in some of these
countries you've opened open to a
potential Pandora's box so you're
looking at the possibility of real civil
war and war lataz warlordism in places
like Yemen and Libya what about the
regional winners in this in this revolt
I mean we've shaken up the region is
shaken itself these Arab states are
changing at a remarkable pace but the
real elephant in the room the real
country that is preoccupied us because
of its quest for for nuclear weapons and
it's and its influence in the region is
the Islamic Republic of Iran and many
people many observers are arguing that
the Arab revolts represent a victory for
Iran why because the long-standing
pillars that we've depended on in the
region to balance a row and like Mubarak
Egypt are being shaken and the argument
is that is these these regimes become
more pluralistic as they are as their
people get more of a voice Iran will
have more openings to influence the
political growth of these countries
their political direction we see this
certainly in Bahrain in the island
kingdom of bahrain which is ruled over
by a Sunni monarchy but is seventy
percent Shia Iran is often thought to
have influence over the Shia but in many
cases is exaggerated but the issue of
Iran getting greater influence is a real
danger in this country if the current
crackdown continues which could
radicalize a lot of the the Shia
opposition I'm going to argue for a
different interpretation that Iran is
actually coming out not looking that
good
after these these these Arab revolts why
is that if you look at what Iran has
long been selling in the region the real
appeal of Iran it's a negative form of
influence Iran has always been looked at
with a degree of admiration by Arab
public's because it's standing up to the
west because it's supporting the
Palestinians but what any Arab really
want to live under the Iranian style of
rule under the Islamic Republic's
political system it's simply not an
appealing model and it's not an
appealing model especially today to the
youth who gathered in Tucker your square
in Egypt who put their lives at risk for
democratization while Iran is cracking
down on its own population there's a
great deal of hypocrisy here while I Ron
is suppressing its own democratic
uprising as Admiral Mullen said the only
hand that Iran has had had in these Arab
uprisings is the one that it is used to
keep its own population down so i think
the the true nature of the islamic
republic is really being exposed in this
in these uprisings what about saudi
arabia this is a country that matters to
us enormously for a variety of reasons
oil it's been a long-standing pillow of
our strategy in the Cold War and now
against the Islamic Republic of Iran
people have been making predictions and
prophecies about the fall of the Al Saud
for a long time this is a very aging
gÃ©rant RC ruled over by by by an aging
King remarkably this regime has been
able to stay in power why is that
because partly of the oil wealth they've
been able to buy off the Senate in the
wake of these uprisings you saw King
Abdullah earmark about 35 million
dollars to dispense to the population to
try to to try to buy off dissent the
other strategy that the else I would
have been using is to keep the
opposition divided to play off different
factions against the other to really
present the royal family the Al Saud as
blue that's holding the country together
in other words you may not really like
the regime the rule but what's worse is
going to be far far what follows us
could be far far worse so right now
we're seeing we're seeing the outside
weather this but that's not to say that
there's some very disconcerting signs
under the under the surface the other
the other player in these in this drama
is the Islamists certainly the Muslim
Brotherhood in Egypt will they come out
on top I think in the new government's
that form in the region there will be an
Islamist dimension and the US has to get
used to this the US has to get ready to
live with this obviously in politics
Islamism may be an illiberal force a
force that is is in some instances
opposed to to American values Islamists
when they come to power in the Middle
East may ask for some distancing of
cooperation with the United States on
the arab-israeli issue on
counterterrorism especially on
counterterrorism because many of these
Islamists were jailed by the very same
security services that has helped the
United States against Al Qaeda that said
I think what happens and this is this is
a real debate among political scientist
but it's it's a political phenomena that
Islamists when they're in opposition
tend to be very radical extremists
maximalist in their demands but once
they come into Parliament once they come
into power it has a moderating effect
because politics is about cutting deals
and making compromises so we may see
more pragmatism in moderation when
Islamists are included in governments in
the region the counter however is is is
perhaps more dangerous than including
them if they're not included in
government if we return to the old style
of repression this could become fertile
recruiting ground for al-qaeda it could
become a pool of radicalization this
leads me to my my conclusion about what
the what the revolutions are doing to
al-qaeda
obviously there's an argument that
anytime there's a shake-up in this
region of high that can step in and
exploit things but I think in terms of
the the larger narrative that that
al-qaeda has been selling in the region
these revolts have dealt a devastating
blow and you've actually seen this in
the silence the initial silence that
al-qaeda had right after the revolts
they were really caught off guard they
didn't know how to how to respond to the
revolt revolts what are the two main
arguments that al-qaeda has been using
in the region that it's selling the
first is that the only way to overthrow
regimes in the Arab world is by jihad by
force and the second is that the United
States is really propping up these
regimes and that the United States will
never relinquish its support for these
regimes both those arguments have been
demolished in these revolutions People
Power has shown its true true potential
and the US has sided with the forces of
a popular change in the region the
greatest risk and this is this is true
of any revolution when they when they
occur and when they consolidate there's
a period of vulnerability expectations
have have risen and I think the real
risk is if these new regimes that come
to the fore are unable to meet the
demands of their people if certain
segments are excluded particularly on
the economic front if there's if there's
stagnation ziff people's lives are not
visibly improved there could be
backsliding there could be a window for
for radicalization the key argument here
and I'll close with this is the need for
what I can call strategic patience both
from the US and by the people in the
region that this will be a long process
for these revolutions to play out this
could be a problem because the very
youthful energy that propelled these
revolutions in the first place in Egypt
does not always make for for the virtue
of patience so with that I'll close and
open it up to
any questions so thank you we have
questions okay i'm going to Fred you can
just stay there and all gasp this round
Thanks ok so I have two things one is
could you talk about the relation to
Israel like where is how Israel fits
into this and the relation I mean it's
probably too early because these
revolutions are still going on but
that's one thing and then the second one
is that I want to challenge a little bit
what you said about that the perception
that the US has been propping up these
regimes has been demolished because um
well maybe they I mean I think they've
been trying to prop them up but they
just didn't succeed and Obama just you
know you could see him wavering on how
does he what how does he respond for
example why the Egypt revolution was
going on very close ally and first was
very reluctant you know what's arguing
to sort of have mubarak you know very
slowly ease him out of power instead of
you know completely siding with the
protesters immediately and so I could I
mean I myself see it as yeah they've
been trying to prop it prop them up they
just didn't succeed and I think it
really depends on now on how will you
know the perception of the u.s. in the
region how will they continue to act and
also obviously they're still I would
yeah I guess propping up Saudi Arabia
right soldier and and the other big
argument of al Qaeda is the presence of
US troops on the air Peninsula and so on
which is also still going on now there's
a very good points i mean starting with
the the first issue of israel i mean
again this is this is this is the great
unknown obviously there are there are
voices of concern and alarm in Israel
because mubarak was such a reliable
partner in keeping the cold piece and
that the Muslim Brotherhood has been so
vociferous in opposing Israel has these
sort of
moral and ideological links with with
Hamas so this is this is a concern for
you know for Israel that said I do think
you you could see more continuity I mean
certainly you could see some some
tension some chilling of relations
between you know Egypt and you know
states like Jordan but the the other
argument is that many of the youth that
are that are taking to the streets in
these in these protests have been fed
this diet by their regimes that all
their problems are because of Israel and
that's that's a standard propaganda ploy
in in the region is it Zionist plot you
see it right now in Syria it's a Zionist
plot you see it even in Saudi Arabia
it's a Zionist plot I they see right
through that and they're fed about fed
up with that so presumably if there's
more public voice in the in the
government there could be a more you
know moderate and pragmatic view toward
toward Israel and that this could
actually be be a good thing in terms of
moving real genuine peace forward
because you know democritus democracies
have this propensity to be friendlier
toward their their neighbors the the
issue of you know the is the u.s. still
committed to the old system certainly I
mean there's there's grounds for
al-qaeda to teach or to accuse the US of
hypocrisy the issue of Saudi Arabia's is
a key a key issue I mean I'm frankly
very concerned about the United States
role in Bahrain where there's there's
this repression going on and the u.s. is
is sort of gently chastising the Al
Khalifa but is not coming out forcibly
he's a huge military base obviously and
this is this goes to the the balance of
the interest and priorities that the
administration is confronted with in
this region and that's that's not
surprising I mean to demand consistency
in world politics is a bit naive I mean
everything is case-by-case but certainly
does that give an argument al Qaeda sure
but you know US policy in the Middle
East has always been dominated by
trade-offs in which which enemy are we
willing to deal with at this time at the
expensive of another interests I think
it's just it's simply a matter of you
know how how we frame this in public
diplomacy I think our intervention in
Libya and the fact that there was this
this Arab consensus for the initial
humanitarian intervention that that I
think played out very well you know in
the in the Arab Street and then also you
know the the Arab public opinion is also
watching the the public opinion of the
United States and what you see in polls
in the United States of Americans is
that by and large many Americans see
these these changes in the region as
being a good thing for the people in the
region and then also for the United
States this is kind of a two-part
question I guess the first is that in
your opinion when it came to invading
Iraq do you feel that there were
actually legitimate there was sufficient
evidence to speak to weapons of mass
destruction or was that really more just
all politicized and sensationalized to
give justification for that invasion and
then the second part is when it comes to
these interventions or invasions doesn't
the military like any logical project
look toward an exit strategy and an end
and even though it may be very difficult
to effectively predict a date and time
yet have at least in that discussion
there be some kind of a timeline for an
exit and at what point does it just seem
to be more a political decision when it
becomes you know the people in the
united states have less of an appetite
to be involved in a particular region
that you then see the government begin
to make movement to take us occupation
out and how much of it is it truly you
know the foreign policy of our country
to try to implement democracy within a
region okay
innocent some very good points the the
issue of Iraq I believe that the the
leadership of our country believed
believed the intelligence that they saw
believe that Saddam Hussein was
developing or in possession of weapons
of mass destruction and you have to
remember the the great fear and this was
still in the shadow of 911 the great
fear is that there would be this perfect
storm of a rogue state a state that was
hostile to us giving weapons of mass
destruction to a terrorist group like
al-qaeda and and this may seem you know
far-fetched in hindsight now that we
know there was nothing there but I
genuinely believe that the the
intelligence was was the driver and that
the leadership thought they were acting
in the best interest of the country and
there was not this spin there was not a
post facto justification of that
certainly were there were there other
sort of unspoken motives for the
invasion I think so yeah the idea that
by overturning the Saddam regime you
could plant the seed of a democratic
regime in the region that would that
would spur changes elsewhere in the
region obviously that that did not
happen the the issue of military
interventions and timelines certainly
when militaries go into countries for a
variety of reasons whether it's to you
know for humanitarian reasons whether
it's of to combat a hostile regime there
are stated military objectives the
military has to know that it's its
forces are accomplishing the mission
there are there are benchmarks how do we
know we're succeeding those benchmarks
are not telegraphed often to the public
for a variety of reasons and and also if
you assign an actual exit date we're
going to leave by this strategy by this
by this date you've you've empowered
your adversary because the adversary
simply has to wait you out and this this
is a real issue now certainly does does
public opinion play play a role here
absolutely i mean the the
commander-in-chief is is an elected
official he responds to public opinion
ah and and there is a precedent where
we've gone in for a specific reason the
mission has expanded beyond the mandate
there's been more casualties you know
that were initially expected and then
the public that simply doesn't have have
the appetite for that and certainly our
adversaries in in their strategy jaques
thinking they know that that if you
inflict casualties on our American
troops that's their Achilles heel
because the American public doesn't want
to see its sons and daughters being
killed it's what's called the so-called
somalia somali example where the image
of US soldiers being dragged through the
streets of somalia prompted the u.s. to
pull out because precisely of that of
that casualty dimension I think it also
depends on how the goals are
communicated to the public by our
leadership and that this is this is in
our national interest to do this talking
about Libya I don't think that this is
perhaps been done as effectively as
possible the the initial impulse to go
in was humanitarian under the under the
legitimacy of this UN resolution to
prevent the slaughter of Benghazi but
have we really established what we're
looking for and how far we're willing to
commit military forces to achieve that
goal I don't I don't think that's been
clear sir ok I got a question Pongo easy
a question for beef from DC go ahead
okay Oh Soho question on the VC here we
can hear it go ahead where you I oh we
had in mountain view okay what's your
question okay yeah so there are
countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan
that or not I said there are not doing
any better than countries like Egypt so
why do you think the revolution has not
spread beyond the borders I was reading
an article somewhere that's that said
that the best true love country right
now the country moose a party right now
is Iran probably so why do you think the
the revolution is not spread beyond our
borders into Afghanistan Pakistan and
all those countries right well this this
really speaks to the the nature of the
the Arab world I think because you know
the you know Arabs as a people share a
common consciousness a common history a
common language and throughout the
history of this region when there's an
event that happens in one country it
tends to spread or infect as it were
other countries in the in the in the
Arab world there's sort of an echo
effect because the Arabs speak the same
language because of the role of media
and conveying these ideas and conveying
these images you know so so could these
revolutions have an impact beyond the
the Arab world absolutely i mean i think
there were reports that the government
of Zimbabwe was concerned about its
citizen watching watching the the
tunisian uprisings china has taken steps
to sort of clamp down on media in the
wake of these uprisings the issue of
Afghanistan and Pakistan I mean you
could argue this is this is already
going on in these countries I mean that
you know how much how much more
revolution can you seem you're seeing
insurgencies in these countries already
so they're not really you know ripe for
a rebellion against you know despotic
authoritarian regime because in the
cases of Afghanistan there really isn't
one there's there's a government that's
barely holding on to power in the case
of Pakistan I think I mean you are
seeing that in certain in certain areas
but again I really want to emphasize
that this the nature of arabism as an
idea and its role in spreading spreading
events is very important to understand
this region yeah two-part question on
the first would be on people maybe these
are a little more detailed would you
speak to the referendum in Egypt and why
despite the organizers of the revolution
having
you know opinions against it and
encouraging people to vote against that
is still passed by over seventy percent
and I'm sure that the Muslim Brotherhood
support of it had something to do with
that and then secondly could you speak
to the emergence of the Salafi movement
in Egypt as a kind of distinct but still
Islamist voice and how that may or may
not play out in Egyptian politics yeah I
know the the issue of Salafism is
something that was has been growing in
Egypt for quite a while and in fact
really across the region um why is that
again one one explanation is is you know
Saudi funding that a lot of it is
attributed to Saudi influence the Saudis
are going around and proselytizing
funding Salafi you know charities and
places like Jordan Lebanon Egypt the
flip side of that is is a lot of people
have become you know youth that would
normally be drawn be drawn to the Muslim
Brotherhood or other Islamists trains
are disenchanted with those those
currents and they find something very
appealing about salafism it offers a
sort of structure and a hierarchy that
they find appealing my sense is that you
know as a real political player in in
Egypt the Salafi movement is is I think
still in a nascent phase I mean Salafi
is by nature if you look at their actual
doctrine they they tend to abhor
political participation and and you look
at places like Saudi Arabia those that
do participate in politics now they've
got to be very careful and how they
justify that doctrinally and many of
them are are you know are criticized for
that so question about economics so for
Egypt one thing that you briefly
mentioned and something I've been
thinking about is I guess I didn't
really realize how much control the
Egyptian military has over the economy
and so I guess my question is will
economics will fixing a gyp tanned sort
of like making greater prosperity for
all greater political participation and
so on what's how much of that is
involved in sort of making a better more
equitable system with
economy and how much and what does the
military have to do with that no I mean
this is the key issue the military is
going to have to surrender some of its
its prerogative some of its its
interests you know much of much of the
wealth was was embodied in the in the
persona and the figure of Hosni Mubarak
and and his own patronage system and
that's that's the real target of the ire
of the people the military you know I
think the United States has a great deal
of leverage over the US military I think
foreign aid can be used as an incentive
to to liberalize the market and
encourage private economy but this is
the real I mean this is absolutely it
and and some people are saying what's
going to happen is the the military will
will push for you know political reform
is sort of a distraction that they want
to keep things focused on politics while
keeping keeping a very iron thumb on the
the economy so
OBC question can you hear us yeah go
ahead thank you very much for the
insightful talk so one of the things
that does mean now that I've been
thinking about is the comparison between
Egypt and Pakistan there are lots of
similarities like both countries have a
weak civil society military with
significant investment in in economics
and you know that's going to be affected
by emerging democracy things like that
so and yet I mean decidedly Pakistan is
kind of a mixed bag when it comes to how
it has fared as a democracy so what do
you think is going to happen in Egypt do
you think is your chance of petrobras
has better prospects than Pakistan maybe
you know given very similar
circumstances right right I think I
think some key differentiating factors
is the the homogeneity of society in
Egypt in that you don't have these these
rural areas like you do in Pakistan the
balouch you don't have these aggrieved
population segments tribal areas that
are just so so beyond the pale the
government and so resentful of their
marginalization Egypt is largely an
urban society much of this revolt
happened in the urban areas there is a
tradition going back to you know the 50s
and 60s and perhaps even earlier of
political organization and political
maturity and you have you had a
tradition of a parliament you had a
constitution and and I think what is so
remarkable about this this revolt and
what does bode well for a successful
democratic transition is the cooperation
that you saw among these different
different population segments you know
secularists Islamist students workers on
this this is genuinely a popular
you know a popular uprising I just don't
think you're seeing that sort of
coordination in Pakistan and you know
the fact that the the Egyptians have
we're able to organize themselves I
think you know does does is grounds for
a degree of optimism so so you mentioned
the sort of period of vulnerability that
all do these areas are going to be going
through obviously there's going to be an
opportunity or you know sort of
temptation for the US and the West in
general to help shape how that plays out
but at the same time as you talked about
a lot of a sort of anti us or anti-west
narrative in that region is about us
sort of controlling governments propping
up governments so how do you see sort of
navigating that balance of assisting
versus being perceived as controlling
absolutely no that's that's a great
point maybe it's the it's the kiss of
death for any you know politician in the
region especially a you know a figure
that comes into office and opposition
figure to be branded as a as a u.s.
puppet or to have the the stench of the
u.s. arnhem and so we want to be very
careful about the type of support that
we we inject into this into this
unfolding drama the key way to do this
and this goes back to my earlier point
about the assistance that was done
before this all started is through non
official channels NGOs so groups like
ndi IRI groups that that are involved in
you know training citizens and how to be
good Democrats and the skills of voting
of political participation I mean when I
was going through the region in places
like you know Egypt Lebanon Saudi Arabia
they all spoke approvingly of these
programs that were they always efficient
where there was there you know
bureaucratic problems certainly but but
this was this was seen as a genuine you
know gesture by the United States to
help the region from the ground up
simply picking a leader or picking an
opposition figure trying to pick a
winner in this drama in backing him I
think that would be that would be a real
mistake and I think that's why we're
being so
careful right now with the Libyan
opposition because we just don't know
who they are and there's a lot of guys
standing up saying you'll pick me I you
know support me we just don't know if
they have the real credibility of the
people and we learned this lesson in the
in the invasion of Iraq with the Iraqi
National Council that a lot of times in
these countries you know when there's a
change of regime you have exiles who
have contacts with the West in the u.s.
they come in but they don't enjoy the
credibility of the people because
they've been out of power for so long so
we have to tread very carefully in your
point is absolutely right okay let's
take two more questions there's one back
here and then we'll go forward sure when
it comes to the Middle East when we talk
about vital to us interest can you
explain what that means to us as a
country because it just seems that yeah
I mean we with the Iraq and then in all
of our the military interventions or
even the US government interventions but
we are endeavouring to promote democracy
but yet what is the benefit that we as
American citizens or that the country
gets in the broader sense it seems like
we have to pay the expense of these
military interventions and then we don't
get any break in the price of oil coming
to us so I just try to reconcile how we
find and we say that certain things are
vital to our US interest in the Middle
East when it comes down to oil in which
we ultimately seem to get no benefit
from sure sure I mean again going back
through history the the the vital
interest of the US in this part of the
world was preserving the status quo and
seeing regimes remain as they are this
was true during the Cold War when we
wanted to use this region as a buffer to
prevent the Soviets from coming in to
protect oil supplies it was true it's
true when we talk about our struggle
with the Islamic Republic of Iran we see
these status quo regimes as as being
pillars the the issue now is that our
definition of national interest
is rapidly changing the first blow to
what I think was was really 911 where
the devil's bargain that we made with a
lot of these regimes about you know our
national interest being tied to their
stability and there you know existence
as authoritarian regimes that came under
fire because you know the terrorists
were spawned from Saudi Arabia in this
climate of repression and so suddenly we
changed it our definition and it is in
our interest to to promote political
change in the region and greater
democratization al biet in a very
measured and calibrated manner so it's
it's it's stable you know I think I
think in terms of your point about about
military interventions I mean I think I
think the US has been correctly chase
and by the Iraq experience that it is
not in our national interest to go about
remaking the world in our image or to
even go about slaying monsters there's
plenty of despotic regimes out there and
politics is the art of of you know
learning to deal with them applying
other non-military pressures to change
them and certainly I think the the
current administration recognizes that
because our troops are stretched so thin
in Afghanistan and Iraq and because of
the tremendous damage that the Iraq war
caused to our credibility and moral
legitimacy in the Middle East and this
is I can't emphasize this enough going
around the region during the height of
the Iraq war 2006 2008 enormous so we've
we've you know we've recognized that
that we can't be doing that the issue of
Libya was was sort of a different case
and it may represent a different model
sort of pragmatic idealism that we went
in under a genuine humanitarian impulse
that there was a multilateral framework
for doing that the United Nations NATO
and we did that now we're stepping back
so we're not we're not getting into the
sort of quicksand that you talk about
with these with these military
interventions that suck up our resource
so I think we've we've learned in our
definition of national interest is is
becoming a more sophisticated one yeah
um well so the the easy form is who's
ndi and IRI that you mentioned but more
broadly in terms of sort of retail level
NGOs that are effectively engaging to
not to make more American these places
but to make the Middle East develop in a
good way right I'm who's effective
because I mean I've seen us aid projects
that are kind of overblown and bombed
out and kind of pathetic looking and
I've seen I talked to people in Morocco
who just be glowingly of the Peace Corps
so you know there's there's a way of
doing it well and there's a way of not
who who who does do this well
specifically where technologists like us
could be involved yeah absolutely no
it'sit's you know the first of all
national it's National Democratic
Institute international public institute
the the issue of governments trying to
do what private sector by nature does
better is always a problem and
bureaucracy simply are ill-equipped to
do certain task and you're absolutely
right i think many of these these
large-scale you know projects in
afghanistan we know this from from
studies of you know where did the money
go was it completed on time and they're
looking at it the larger the project the
more grandiose and the ambition the more
likely it will fail so the argument is
smaller's better more local is better
empowering these local local ngos
training them to do the job the job for
you you know I absolutely think there's
there's a role for for private sector
here you know the the the real complaint
that I heard from from a lot of
reformist and activists in the region
was the tremendous bureaucracy that they
had to deal with from from the United
States government in these in these
programs
and the lag time this the the prada long
elongated process that was taking place
you know so absolutely i mean greater
exchanges between the technology sector
you know as we saw with with Syria with
you know in Jordan you're seeing this I
think this is absolutely the way the way
to go and I think I think the current
administration recognizes that all right
with that thank you very much bread for
coming and sharing your expertise thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
