and I'm going to be talking about
whatever yup software engineer made snow
about security and where you can learn
it this talk will be made available on
Google video on our public website so
please do not ask me any Google specific
questions I'd be happy to take those
after the talk let's see so i guess i'm
just going to get things underway thank
you so much for turning turning up
bright and early at 10 am-11 question
that I sometimes ask myself when I look
at press releases from time to time is
whether or not the sky is falling you
know major major tech websites like Sina
dedicate an entire section of their
website to to threats and
vulnerabilities and they're filled with
new articles every single day I thought
what I might do is talk about a couple
of incidents that have occurred
relatively recently in March of this
year a company by the name of TJX which
owns a number of retail department
stores including TJ maxx marshalls they
made that they basically publicly
acknowledged that they were hacked late
last year the the hack consisted of a
number of cyber criminals parking their
cars outside the retail department
stores and what they would do is they
would collect data packets that were
going by on the wireless network it
turns out that some of these department
stores used use Wi-Fi to transmit
information from their point of sale to
their back-end servers and the
encryption was done with WEP the wired
equivalency protocol privacy protocol
rather which has been known to be
insecure to the security community since
2001 or 2002 in any case the the bad
guys kept these cars parked out there
for four significant amounts of time and
they were able to aggregate over 40
million credit card numbers some of the
credit card numbers date back to
transactions that were made in in in
2002 so that's pretty darn pretty darn
bad for the community as a whole there's
an FC FTC investigation that's taking
place there are about 300 banks that
have gotten together to file a
class-action lawsuit against TJX so
that's one example of a recent hack
about two years ago there was also a
hack against a company called card
systems card systems is a credit card or
rather was a credit card payment
processor you know when you when you
swipe a credit card at a point of sale
terminal that credit card number goes to
an acquiring bank and issuing bank and a
number of other processors on the
backend in order to authenticate the
number card systems was one of the
credit card payment processors they had
they had a database which had about 43
million credit card numbers in it
unencrypted and somebody at the company
had set up a website which allowed
people to enter information into into
web forms and so what the attackers did
is they took advantage of an attack
called sequel injection in which they
entered you know not names and email
addresses into these forms but they
entered sequel commands and with just
the right tweaks they were able to get
the database to execute those commands
so while there were 43 million credit
card numbers unencrypted in the database
they were able to acquire 263,000 of
them what they did is they install the
script on the backend database that
would every day email them a couple
thousand and this went on for about six
months before card systems noticed
needless to say card systems is out of
business their assets were acquired by
another company I believe it with
cybersource the idea of course is they
wouldn't want to acquire all the
liability that came along with this
attack so they just acquired the
company's assets and even though 2005
seems like a long time ago on internet
timescales sequel injection attacks
still happen there
often so if you were to just enter the
keywords SQL injection into news google
com you'll see of pages and pages of of
SQL injection related attacks now I've
chosen a couple data points to talk
about here but but the problem is is is
really bad overall if you go to this
website privacy rights org and go to
this Earl they've kept the chronology of
data theft incidents that have occurred
over the past two years in the year two
thousand six there were over 300
incidents alone so pretty much you know
every business day there's some some new
incident and over the past couple years
there's / 153 million customer records
that have been compromised so given all
of this I hope you can understand why
why I kind of feel well you know the sky
might be falling and if it isn't falling
it's probably going to happen soon if we
don't do something about it I mentioned
sequel injection how does sequel
injection work well you can imagine a
traditional web site architecture where
you have web browsers contacting a web
server that web server is connected to a
database on the backend and you might
want to do something as simple as
authenticate your users with the
username and password to do so when the
web server receives a username and
password from a user it issues a sequel
query to a database saying please give
me the password that corresponds to the
username that the user entered and then
it can check whether or not the user
indeed enter the correct password or not
of course an attacker doesn't need to
enter a traditional username and
password an attacker might enter the
username quote semicolon drop table
users semicolon hyphen hyphen and enter
something for the password of course
when that username gets substituted into
the variable that would be reserved for
the username it would expand out to the
following the quote would terminate the
username the semicolon would terminate
the first part of the SQL statement that
that hopefully would not return any
results but then the rest of the
username would make up the remainder of
an SQL statement which could end up
killing the user table in the database
and resulting in a denial of service
attack against the users of this service
the hyphen hyphen is there to just
comment out the apostrophe the final '
that's put in by the application so that
the database doesn't say hey this is an
error I won't execute it at all so this
is an example of a sequel injection
attack you might ask well the sequel
injection getting better is it getting
worse let's see so I I pulled some data
off of the security focus vulnerability
database and I've graphed the number of
vulnerabilities that have occurred in
the first half of the year for 2004-2005
2006 and 2007 and on the y axis we have
the number of reported such
vulnerabilities we can see that up until
the first half of 2006 there is a pretty
apparent increase in the first half of
2007 the number did seem to come down a
bit it's unclear to me as to whether or
not that's statistically significant and
also all of these vulnerability
databases have different different data
sets and are reported by different
researchers against different types of
software products we'll see more of that
in any case that's a little bit about
sequel injection by the way if anybody
has any questions at any point feel free
to just raise your hand and interrupt me
and I'll do my best to answer your
question so pulling back a second sequel
injection is just one type of software
threat that that can occur it's a
specific kind of attack that that can be
more generalized in general sequel
injection is a subset of what are called
command injection attacks and very often
command injection attacks are targeted
at providing data to an application and
tickling the application just right so
that that data gets interpreted as
control information
these command injection attacks can
occur usually due to application
programmers either not validating input
or not escaping output appropriately
other similar types of attacks that
occur are cross-site scripting in which
somebody can provide an HTML snippet or
a JavaScript snippet to a website that
website will echo will store and or echo
that injected HTML or JavaScript to
another user and that may result in
stealing the user's cookies a phishing
attack or worse so so that's a
cross-site scripting for those of you
that haven't heard of it and buffer
overflows is a is also a command
injection type of attack I assume
everyone's heard of a buffer overflows
raise your hand if you have yes
wonderful okay so a buffer overflow
attack it is a command injection attack
in some buffer overflow attacks the
attacker sends shellcode into into a
server modifies the modifies the return
address so that the doctor shell code
gets executed and basically you know
injects a command which gives them a
command shell in other buffer overflow
attacks you can you know send an
appropriate return address so that you
can run code of your choice that's
already on the server so you don't
always need to inject the commands you
can just tell it to run the commands of
your choice that already on the server
so so that's a little bit about some
common command injection attacks that
can be that can result due to bad input
validation I I took a look at from the
same database this security focus
vulnerability database kind of pulled
back and try to understand at a high
level what are you know what kinds of
attacks are getting worse what kinds of
attacks are we doing better against
before I start talking about this
information I just want to
put out a disclaimer the the
categorization here might not be perfect
and in some cases of vulnerability might
fit under one of these categories and in
other cases might fit under another but
at a high level if we look at all input
validation bugs in the first half of
2006 versus 2007 we can see that there
are about the same on the other hand the
number of security vulnerabilities due
to design errors is going up there's
many type of design errors that you can
make when building an application a
common one might be there might be some
way to get around your code so that the
the user doesn't have to authenticate
and that would be an example of a design
problem another example of the design
problem is if you just look at the
design of TCP in the original design it
was possible to send in TCP syn packets
the server would of course allocate
descriptors for potential client
connections with each of them and end up
maxing the server out of those
descriptors resulting in a denial of
service attack so that's an example of
the Dahl's attack that resulted from a
protocol design error those seem to be
up in the first half of this year
attacks due to boundary condition
problems buffer overflows can be fit in
that category and actually in this in
this some set of data buffer overflows
war categories under boundary conditions
as opposed to input validation basically
because when a buffer overflow attack
occurs it's usually because the
programmer forgot to check the size of
the input or forgot to check exactly how
the data in the string is being indexed
and you can index on on either direction
to try to to try to tickle the server
into doing funny things attacks due to
boundary conditions are up attacks due
to exception that exception handling are
also up an example of an attack due to
bad exception handling I was auditing a
application a couple of years ago prior
to coming to Google and it was a web
application
it had this interesting bug where well
what the server would do is it would
send you back a cookie once who
authenticated and if you simply didn't
send back the cookie to the server what
would happen is the application for some
reason needed to sign some session ID to
to continue processing so what it would
do is if you didn't provide it with a
session ID it would decide to go ahead
and use the session ID of the last user
that logged in so all I had to do is
kind of sit around and wait till the
administrator logged in and then send a
request which didn't have a cookie and I
would get the administrators cookie
which would give me all the
administrators privileges so so such tax
fall into the category of that exception
handling and we can see those are also
up in the first half of 2007 access
validation issues it's it's it's hard to
tell whether or not there's actually
been a real increase so that's a kind of
high level where we are in the first
half of this year based on the stats
from the security focus vulnerability
database so I took those categories and
I kind of drill down and looked at the
the top specific vulnerabilities as
opposed to the categories and came up
with the following chart on the x-axis I
have the different vulnerabilities
sequel injection cross-site scripting
denial of service and buffer overflows
and on the y-axis I have the number of
reports make the database for those for
those the orange bar is the number of
vulnerabilities in the first half of
2006 the purple bar is the number of
vulnerabilities in the first half of
2007 and we can see the the slight
decrease in sequel injection which we're
not quite sure is statistically
significant based on the information in
this particular vulnerability database
it looks like cross-site scripting is
down and it looks like denial of service
and buffer overflows are up so so that's
what we learned from from this
particular vulnerability database but
what we'll see is that not all
vulnerability databases necessarily
agree so I pulled out some statistics
from the miter vulnerability database
and and started initially just looked at
a report there was a very nice report
online I'll provide the link i'll
provide you a pointer to the link by the
end of the talk but they did some very
nice work where they looked at the
number of security vulnerabilities in
products put out by OS vendors and what
we see from from this graph between 2001
and 2006 is that the number of buffer
overflows being reported is still
increasing significantly so even though
buffer flows have been known to the
security community for the past 25 or 30
years the number of such vulnerabilities
that we're detecting is still increasing
and then there's a number of other
vulnerabilities that we see if we if we
look at mightor's data for across all
software products as opposed to just
those put out by software vendors they
report that up until two thousand six
cross-site scripting is increasing PHP
included tax or increasing sequel
injection attacks as marked by the
upside down triangles is also increasing
and then there's other tax due to buffer
overflows and now service that are also
increasing although exactly I mean
looking at the data overall it seems to
disagree with just the types of
vulnerabilities that OS vendors are
having to deal with so given all this
data what are the real takeaways well
you know it really depends upon what
kind of software you're looking at
depending upon what kind of software
looking at what the threats are you're
going to see different kinds of ulnar
abilities be more prevalent but overall
the number of detected vulnerabilities
is increasing and I don't know if this
is just because we're spending more time
looking for vulnerabilities or whether
people are actually writing more bugs
into the code well there are some
discrepancies with regards to which
exact types of ulnar abilities are being
detected the most the big four seem to
be the same regardless of which
vulnerability database you look at
across
scripting sequels cross-site scripting
command injection memory conduct
corruption and denial of service seemed
to top the list and by the way when I
when I when I lay out these broad
categories I've grouped kind of sub
attacks into into into the categories so
cross-site scripting cross-site request
forgery cross-site scripting clusion
they all fit into cross-site scripting
sequel injection PHP includes I group
them under injection if you look at the
data in this way then what you'll see is
that you know these these four end up
being pretty prevalent with also which
vulnerability database you look at so
given that these are the vulnerabilities
that we're seeing let's ask the question
what does every engineer need to know
about security well you might categorize
it as follows I'd say that every
engineer every software engineer should
know about secure design so in the same
way that we learn about object oriented
techniques to help us achieve
reusability and extensibility it's
important for all of us to understand
secure design principles like the
principle of least privilege fail-safe
stance how to secure the weakest link
etc so that regardless of what
vulnerabilities were seeing on a
particular day or in a particular year
when we're designing new software will
be able to figure out what the
appropriate threats and appropriate
defenses need to be regardless of what's
happening at any given point in time so
secure design I think is an important
piece of what every engineer does need
to know about security aside from secure
design it's important to be familiar
with the large variety of technical
flaws that can result in attacks so it's
important for companies that build web
software to be very familiar and very
proactive at dealing with cross-site
scripting attacks across our request
forgery cross-site scripting clusion etc
these each of these technical flaws can
be used to accomplish a different set of
attacks so so you can use cross-site
scripting to bypass authentication
can use cross-site scripting to do data
theft you can use it to steal cookies
for instance on so so these are kind of
like the causes and these are the
effects and the causes are I've
mentioned most of these but I haven't
mentioned a couple so so I mentioned
injection directory traversal you can
tickle web servers by accessing URLs if
you throw in the right set of characters
you know dot slash is etc you can
basically try to break out of the web
servers document root and access other
files on the file system or even
potentially access other files in the
web servers document root that you're
not supposed to be able to access race
conditions race conditions can result in
security vulnerabilities a common
example is time of czech vs time-of-use
types of vulnerabilities the way these
types of attacks occur is at some point
the software checks whether or not
you're authorized to access a particular
resource they say a file that file could
be a symbolic link to something and if
you if there's too much time that
expires between the time that the
authorization is checked and the time
that the resources used what could
happen is the resource can change
underneath so the attacker could get the
symbolic link to point to something else
that that's an example where where race
condition can result in a problem memory
corruption buffer overflows integer
overflows all fit under that category so
if you know in and these are these
vulnerabilities can can lead to a wide
variety of cat attack that every
engineer should be familiar with so the
question is where do you go to learn all
this stuff well initially you might
think oh you could just go to the
universities and when you come out of
school you might you might be educated
about such things so to see whether or
not that's the case I top I typed a
couple keywords into Google I said Topsy
s programs and the following webpage at
US news and world report came up now
there's a lot of good computer science
programs out there
I wouldn't just necessarily take us
news's word for it but I thought it
might be good to just look at the
curriculum in a couple of these
universities so I'm not picking on any
use for the University in particular in
fact what all illustrate is that some of
the the issues here are applicable to
pretty much all the universities that
teach computer science so I looked at
CMU's webpage in their curriculum my
hope is that they just forgot to update
their webpage but what I found is that
in order to get a bachelor's degree in
computer science you have to take this
set of courses so you have to take some
programming courses you have to become
proficient in CN UNIX you have to know
data structures and algorithms and those
are the the setup required courses so it
doesn't seem that learning security is
required to become a good computer
scientist let's see at at this
particular University one thing that was
a little disappointing is that security
was not even listed as an elective as
one of the electives after you take this
set of courses so that's things at CMU
and MIT MIT is a great school Ron Rivest
together with Samir nadelmann developed
the RSA encryption algorithm out of MIT
on so they produced a lot of great
technology they had the following
objectives for their undergraduate
program objective to states that
students will develop a professional
understanding of electrical engineering
and computer science so that they are
prepared for immediate employment and so
to an extent it's important to know
about security when people graduate
because they join companies they end up
writing code that code gets released on
the internet and sometimes there are
their code ends up being talked about
and press releases when when the code
gets hacked so so I think it is
important to focus on security if in
fact the goal is to prepare students
for immediate employment another goal is
students will develop an understanding
of the importance of the social business
technical and human context in which a
process or product being designed will
work as we know security vulnerabilities
very often not only occur just due to
technical vulnerabilities but due to
problems in a software development
process you know Bruce Schneier is often
quoted with regards to security being a
process and not a product and so anyhow
this is the objectives that that MIT
laid out I looked at their curriculum
and if you want to get a bachelor's
degree in computer science from MIT you
can specialize in one of the following
three concentrations you can decide
specialize in AI computer systems in
architecture or theoretical computer
science for each of these concentrations
there was a particular required header
course and then a bunch of electives
which is which is kind of nice because
students get a lot of flexibility in
what they decide to take I looked for
where security fit into this curriculum
and where it fit in is it seemed that
for the computer systems and
architecture engineering specialization
in the header courts in the last two
weeks of the course there were four
papers that students were required to
read about security which I thought was
great there they learn about buffer
overruns they learn about why crypto
systems fail great paper by Ross
Anderson focusing on some of the non
technical reasons that security fails
the focus is on the warm propagation
type issues and it focus is on our our
own ken Thompson's reflections on
crossing trust so so so I was glad to
see security being covered as part of
the required curriculum at MIT but I I
think that one might ask the question do
we need to provide more preparation than
just these four papers in order to
prepare students for immediate
employment
let's see another kind of caveat that I
just wanted to mention is you know I'm
kind of looking at the undergraduate
programs but these schools have
quote-unquote the top graduate programs
in computer science the reason the
reason I looked at these particular
undergraduate programs was because I
wasn't able to find a listing of kind of
the top undergraduate programs in
computer science so this was kind of the
next best thing so anyhow that's um
that's what we see at the if they
university is what's my point here I
think the point is summarized very well
by doctors V Khalil who who provided
this quote on the inside of a book that
I recently published it says it has been
too long that security has not been part
of the required coursework for bachelor
degree computer science candidates and
we are seeing some of the effects
software security vulnerabilities
plaguing electronic commerce resulting
in data identity and monetary theft as
evidence regularly in the press I think
it would be great to have more focus on
security in preparing our undergraduate
simply because a lot of the folks that
graduate of these programs end up making
up the the army of software engineers
that are powering some of the most
important businesses on the world so so
where else can we go to learn more about
security I'll talk about some courses
some certification programs and books
and some websites and organizations
where one can go to learn more I have to
mention a front of call of course that
this list is by no means comprehensive
if you know of other good resources
please feel free to drop me an email
just type my last name into Google
entered the suwannee and Google and my
email address should come up I'm more
than happy to incorporate other courses
certifications programs books and
websites that you recommend so what
exists in in the way of security course
is pretty much every major university
website that I was able to go to listed
upper division courses and cryptography
which i think is which i think is a
great cryptic
cryptography ends up being a very
important component of building security
systems it usually ends up you know not
being the biggest component but but
nevertheless a very important component
so that you could achieve certain
security goals there's also a number of
security courses that are focused on
system security so for instance CS 155
taught by Dan Bonet at Stanford is an
example of that UC Berkeley has made CS
161 available these types of courses are
great there is a more comprehensive list
of these types of courses at at all be
rubens website I encourage you to check
it out google also offers some courses
in the area of security and there's more
to come in that area please contact mike
we a sec if you're interested so that's
one place you can go to learn more about
security another option is various
certification programs so I'll talk
about some certification programs that
currently exist and try to talk a little
bit about the pros and the cons because
security information is not covered as
deeply as it could be in undergraduate
curricula very certification programs
that popped up one is offered by
Stanford these courses so the
certificate program is made up of a
number of courses it can be taken online
or on campus take them on campus it's
kind of you know one week very intensive
focus towards professionals they
actually have an offering coming up from
july twenty three to twenty seventh in
the interest of full disclosure I helped
provide some guest lecturers for this
program it require it requires you to
take three core courses and then some
electives and in addition to the to the
lectures in the core courses and
electives some of the days are focused
on hands-on labs where you actually
spend time attacking a test system
that's been set up so you actually do
cross-site scripting across site request
forgery sequel injection attacks so that
you can get really really get into the
mind of the bad guy and then you spend
some time building the defenses if if
one week is kind of too much of them
come in
there is a more foundational certificate
also available if you're interested in
this or actually in any of the course
offerings talk to Stephanie Chang yet
ngd you should be happy to help you get
signed up as an employee at Google part
of your benefits involves you know it
involves covering courses at and I think
all of these avenues that I'll describe
so just talking a little bit more about
the certificate program at Stanford it's
very very focused on software security
so the core courses involve how to use
crypto correctly how to write secure
code how to design security protocols
correctly and then there's a number of
electives relevant to web companies
there's a course on securing web
applications they also offer a yearly
emerging threats and defenses so if you
want to kind of keep up you know our
phishing attacks getting worse you know
what are the new threats that are coming
up the emerging threats and defenses can
be repeated year to year so that's a
little bit about the Stanford program
there's a number of other certification
programs there's a certification program
called the cissp it stands for certified
information security professional it's
offered by an organization called is C
squared so far as I can tell is C
squared exists solely for the purpose of
offering this certification and creating
an ecosystem and networking
opportunities around the certification
to get a cissp well actually so before I
mentioned getting one the cissp seems to
do a good job in preparing people for
administrative security jobs and jobs in
the government that are related to
security it consists of passing a long
multiple-choice test and it's as
compared to the Stanford program it's
much more broad so whereas the Stanford
programs they focused on software
security the cissp covers a wide variety
of domains not only involving
application security but involving
telecom and network security involving
physical security involving you know
legal
issues regulations etc so it's a it's a
much broader program a third security
certification program that is in the
process of actually just being created
right now is called the GS SP the GS s P
stands for giac secure software
programmer giac itself expands out to
global information assurance
certification this GSP certification is
fairly new on the block it's offered by
sands so Sands has been around for a
while sands is a very well-known
security training institute they've done
a lot of good work and network security
forensics Incident Response etc the
certification while the certification is
new its offered by an organization
that's been around for a while and the
goal of this particular certification is
to provide a secure programming
assessment so too it is a multiple
choice test and it asks you a whole
bunch of questions about finding
vulnerabilities in particular code
samples or whatnot the first offering of
this will be in august two thousand
seven so that's a little bit about some
security certification programs there's
a number of books that i think are are
useful in helping engineers learn more
about security one that i highly highly
recommend is ross anderson security
engineering one of the great things
about this book is that it is available
for free at this Earl and it covers you
know not software security specifically
but it looks at security as an
engineering discipline and talks about
in addition talking about technologies
for authentication access control etc
what it what it does is it covers lots
of different domains so it talks about
security in the banking industry it
talks about security in nuclear command
and control systems and it pulls out
lots of interesting examples and case
studies so for instance in the in the in
the case of a defense Ross provides this
the this really fun example in which
there were two countries that were at
war with each other
um one of big planes the you know Jets
fighters and you know one of the
country's wanted to you know you don't
wanted to attack the other but couldn't
get past their iff systems that identify
friends or Foe systems so what they did
what this country did is they provoke
the other country to attack them they
sent a couple of their fighter jets
their fighter jets were broadcasting iff
Friend or Foe signals what they did is
they took those signals and they just
they instrumented their own fighter jets
to echo those signals so their own
fighter jets were able to pass right
through the other country's defenses at
the exact same time that they were being
attacked and they were able to
successfully achieve their of cheater
goal so that's an example of some of the
things that you'll see in in Ross's book
another very good security book is on
Gary McCoy's and John Villegas building
secure software some people refer to
this as the classic text in the area of
software security it it talks about
software related vulnerabilities like
buffer overflows it talks about some of
the challenges and achieving security
both an open source software and closed
or software environments it it was
really one of the first efforts
initiatives to write down any and all
information related to software security
at the time this was about two thousand
one and a lot of the information in the
book is still very very relevant so I
recommend it Gary Bakura has gone on to
help co-author a number of other books
he published a book to get together with
a together with another co-author
Haugland on exploiting software and that
kind of takes the the hat of the
attacker more into account so it
basically teaches you to to attack and
exploit existing software whereas
building secure software focuses more on
the defenses Gary's also published a
book called software security that book
focuses on risk management it focuses on
architecture for security it focuses on
how to
corporate things like static analysis
tools in your software development
process and so those are some other very
good resources another security book
that came out recently won by yours
truly came out in February of this year
entitled foundations of security what
every programmer needs to know this i
co-authored together with christophe
kern who's who's a Googler on the
security team here and and neither case
of on this this book focuses on secure
design principles in the first third of
the book the kind of you know what what
principles do you need to know so that
you can fight vulnerabilities yourself
should new situations come up the second
third of the book focuses entirely on
web application security it focuses on
you know how to construct a tax how to
construct defenses and then the last
third of the book rounds it out with an
introduction to cryptography the goal
being to enable you and army with enough
information about crypto so that you can
have a good fluent reasonable
conversation / debate with with security
professionals when designing and
developing and deploying products so if
you're if you're if you're interested in
this book you can actually pick up a
copy from be 46 and ra or be 46 284 i
also have a couple copies out here up
front which you're welcome to let's see
if you are interested in getting
involved in helping to teach security
courses to to your team or to other
organizations that you work with there's
a set of free slides that are available
at learn security com all the fleece
fruit slaw is basically correspond to
the book chapters chapter by chapter so
that we can help get information out as
soon as possible without everyone
happened to spend a lot of time on on
course development of course people are
feel or welcome to tweak the materials
as per their needs a fourth book that's
actually coming out is hacking exposed
web two point oh this focuses
on attacking web two point O type
products so if you're in the business of
building you know next-generation web
interfaces next-generation web tools in
general this would be a great book rich
Cannings our own rich cannings from the
security team here at Google is a is a
co-author on this book it's available
for pre-order on amazon let's see the
final security book that I want to
mention is the secure programming
cookbook for to c and c++ by viega and
Messer this book is it's pretty thick
and the thing that I liked about it is
hat it had a lot of examples about how
to use cryptographic libraries correctly
it contained information on how to call
yes openssl API is just right writing
crypto code and code that uses crypto
can be very very tricky you just get one
parameter off and all your security is
blown so so it was very good for that it
also had pointers to input validation
libraries and just a lot of other good
code if you know so i highly recommend
it if you if you work here at Google
please contact your security team you
know prior to trying to apply anything
out of this book we have some additional
tools to help so so that's a number of
security books that are available on the
market where you can go to learn more
about security there's a number of
websites and organizations I'm just
going to touch on a couple one is the
owa SP the open web application service
project I'm sorry the open web
application security project one of the
interesting things about this
organization is that they are globally
distributed they have local chapters
pretty much in every major city and so
if you're looking to learn more about
security I'd recommend getting involved
with your local chapter they typically
meet once every couple months they
usually have a talk by somebody where
you can learn more let's see the ows p
also publishes their very famous for
publishing a top ten list of
vulnerabilities I'm going to show you
some of those in just a second
to other organizations that I'll briefly
touch upon and to other websites all
touch upon is the security focus website
and code google com so the ows p i
mentioned that they issue these a top
ten vulnerability lists what i thought
might be fun is to look at the top 10
vulnerability list that they put out in
2004 and compare it to the top 10
vulnerability list that they just put
out this year 2007 in from the list in
2004 they said you know number one
vulnerability unvalidated input followed
by broken axis control etc what we'll
see is that over over over the course of
three years some of these
vulnerabilities have disappeared for
various reasons some of them have become
more significant and some new ones have
been added so if we look at unvalidated
input unvalidated input is kind of very
broad in general right cross-site
scripting can happen due to unvalidated
input buffer overflows can happen due to
unvalidated put injection flaws can
occur due to invalidate it input and so
i have to admit i was a little bit
confused when i was looking at this and
i didn't completely understand exactly
how the categorization work but it looks
like because unvalidated input was too
broad in general category it looks like
it was dropped in favor of more specific
vulnerabilities which i think is a good
thing broken access control was number
two in 2004 but that's now gone at the
same time there's there's uh there's
things like failure to restrict URL
access so this is people trying to they
just put out URLs and they assume
because they didn't publish or link to
it by anybody else are from anybody else
that it won't be found that's an example
of broken access control but my feeling
is that this is a broad category that
was substituted with something more
specific later on let's see a buffer
overflow surprisingly are gone from
their list moving over to 2007 which is
a little bit surprising again I think
this is dependent upon what kind of
software you're developing I'm not quite
sure who their target audience is but if
you're working on an operating system
we're working on system software i think
buffer overflows
still a big issue it was the number of
buffer overflows and checked you were
still rising let's see what else okay so
application to service again broad
category replaced something more
specific insecure configuration
management is gone from their list my
feeling is that they may have decided to
focus more on software security
vulnerabilities there's still lots of
security vulnerabilities that can arise
due to you know having the wrong
configuration parameter set and so again
just because they eliminated this from
their list I wouldn't I wouldn't throw
it away I just don't think it's a it's a
you know it's a the kind of thing where
you have to change code to fix it having
correct configuration is still very
important so let's see what are some of
the new things that popped up on the
list motions filed execution cross-site
request forgery is a new big one this is
what can occur when say somebody already
has a browser open and is authenticated
into some service and then they get
lured to an evil site that evil site can
include a URL you know to the other side
like transfer funds and because the
users already logged in what will happen
is the web browser will issue the
request and automatically send the users
cookie to that site so cross-site you
know and actually do the funds transfer
even though the user didn't necessarily
explicitly authorize it so I look out
for cross-site request forgery very
significant anyhow so this is the kind
of top ten list a totally ASP puts out
there my hope is that over time you know
these lists will be constructed more and
more scientifically based on data and
vulnerability databases that we're
seeing I mentioned the security focus
website it's the the home of the
original bug track mailing list they
have a wide variety of articles
vulnerability reports they have a number
of focus areas
you know operating systems intrusion
detection Incident Response viruses and
malware pen testing firewalls i
encourage you to to check it out it's a
kind of thing where you can you can
bookmark the site and read articles read
about the new security threats of the
day finally the last website that I want
to mention is code google com code
google com pushed out a sub section of
the site / edu that focuses on providing
information to educators whether they be
at university is whether they be
accompanies free materials that are
available for use just last week we
pushed out a sample course on web
security authored by yours truly with
the help of Maggie Johnson thanks to her
for helping make this reality it
provides a set of lectures powerpoints
that people can just use out of the box
as well as programming assignments to
give people real experience I think with
security you can you can learn about all
this theory you can read about
vulnerabilities but until you actually
attack some code yourself until you
actually defend your code against some
attacks you know it for me it didn't
really sink in until I went through that
process so so this is available the the
example that's posted for instance
provides two kids and students of all
kinds with a 100 line web server that
that they can do a Doss attack against
and then fix it we are looking for
additional contributors for for this
website so if you're interested please
come talk to me afterwards let's see to
summarize I encourage everyone to learn
more about securely to an extent if we
if we do our job right then every
engineer will become a software security
practitioner I think we'll always need
some security engineering specialists if
you will but my hope is that we can make
most security engineers obsolete and
have everyone worried about security as
part of their jobs all of the different
URLs and resources that i mentioned is
available at learning security com just
click on the resources tab on the site
and it will bring up a list of all the
URLs
I mentioned and of course if you have
any questions or you'd like to get more
involved in security education efforts
please feel free to drop me a note so
either at my email address or on my
website I'd be happy to take any
questions
