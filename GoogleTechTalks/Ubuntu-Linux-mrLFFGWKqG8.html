thank you all for coming today it is my
pleasure to introduce Mark Shuttleworth
a man who needs no introduction the
founder of the Ubuntu Linux project and
he has graciously offered to come in and
give us a little bit of a talk on the
project so here's mark
thank you very much Leslie thank you
again for everything that you've done to
make our landing over here and our crazy
operation that goes smoothly it's it's
this is an absolutely phenomenal
environment for us to be hosts hosting a
distro summit because we can kind of get
everybody together in the middle and
then we can have all of these breakout
sessions which is kind of the way we get
organized so I can talk about I can talk
about a bunch of different things take a
bunch of different angles so the first
thing I guess I should should should ask
is what what kind of angle are you guys
interested in are you interested more in
the technical side of how we organize
ourselves and how we plan the distro and
build a distro and what what all of that
infrastructure looks like you interested
more in the social side how we how our
community is structured can you give me
some sort of indication is some
indication to whatever you want me to
take what angle on it okay okay so I'll
do like a general overview but if they
have any questions or anything at any
stage the big picture vision is doing
two and a half years ago seemed kind of
impossible a team taking Linux all of
the in all of its gory sort of details
and pulling it together in a way that
that feels elegant and right in in a
desktop kind of environment and that
kind of core idea drives everything we
do to the extent that we go into servers
as well we want to bring that same kind
of feel to to everything we do to the
extent that the project is is is is sort
of mushrooming and turning into from a
single Australian to a family of
distributions we try always to bring
that same kind of ethos to to the
project it's very much something that
for people to use it's something that we
we hope exceptional technical people
will be excited by but primarily we want
it to be something that those
exceptional people will be excited to
give to their friends give to their
family give to their grandparents and
and and sort of use it deliver that love
with it so I think of it as delivering
the promise of free software win when
Richard Stallman and others kind of
articulated this free software idea it
became a technical phenomenon but I
think it goes much further than that
and what we really want to do is deliver
what I think is the real promise of of
free software and that is fundamentally
new economics and a new kind of culture
a new way of producing software and so
with the bun to the the economics are
fundamentally different where this is
not red hat or Novell we don't assert
any kind of proprietary control over the
binary bits that we produce we encourage
people to take those and do what they
want with them and we encourage them to
take the sauce bits and do what they
want with them too so that drives a lot
of our lot that drives a lot of our
thinking we don't include anything in
the distro which which would sort of
interfere with that so we are free
software applications only by default we
do compromise on the hardware side so we
do include some proprietary drivers to
enable Wi-Fi graphics and another aspect
of the hardware but we keep the platform
something that can be widely distributed
and redistributed free of charge and and
preserve the right to change it as well
that free platform includes things that
other Linux distros we charge you for
which is security updates patches
notifications of change change items
security fixes and so on and then on top
of that we layer a sort of a commercial
service offering of commercial support
and professional services so to what is
a large and rapidly growing base of
users and then from a cultural point of
view we go to a lot of a lot of to great
lengths to to make this a community
driven project so the the ultimate
deciding body in Ubuntu is a community
body called the community council and
then there's there's a technical group
and then there are other sort of social
governance structures that look after
other aspects of our broader community
and canonical which is the company that
really underwrites a lot of Ubuntu
development although more and more there
are other companies contributing as well
but canonical doesn't and I hope in the
long run can mark canonical will take
only a modest stake effectively in each
of those structures of governance there
are people in every significant
structure of governance who don't work
for for canonical and I see that as
healthy and and and we really encourage
that another thing is that that the
platform is very transparent partly
because we all work from home or most of
us work from home we're kind of forced
to use public forums for all of the
discussions and conversations and that
has some slightly weird consequences as
a company we realized that in the whole
of last year I think we had about one
hour when we had the company in a room
with the doors closed and I mean the
company is in every employee and and
that was it there's very very little
time and opportunity as a company that
is that is kind of excluded from which
the Ubuntu community are are excluded
next week we have an all-hands company
conference down in downtown San Fran and
that'll be the longest time that we've
actually tried to get everybody together
in in one place so that really I think
has helped with with it with the
development of the of the community
because people feel that they can
actually get in and see the sausage
getting made right it's ugly like
building a distro is a messy messy nasty
process right there are there are ugly
compromises that you want to fix in the
next release
but we're very strict about our release
schedules so things that you know
decisions get made very quickly but they
get made openly and and in almost every
decision there is there's community
input so what should people get from
from a bun to genuine freedom and
flexibility zero licensing fees were
absolutely committed to doing this
without introducing any kind of
licensing fees certification ultimately
we hope that our going to will be just
as widely certified and supported both
by ISPs and by the hardware crowd as as
read Hatton eval in any other commercial
OS so all those other things that that
you would expect from a from a robust
commercial platform but with
collaboration really being at the center
at the center pieces here at this at
this meeting is phenomenal we have
representatives of I can count at least
six major tech companies that have come
through here they all have things that
they want to get done things they want
to see happen in a bun - and that's a
trend that we're encouraging and that's
starting to snowball it's a forum really
where people come together and say well
geez for my ideal OS I would like to
have this this this and this and I can
contribute these pieces and let me see
if there's if there's interest in the
community and from canonical and
elsewhere in in seeing that same stuff
happen and so to the extent that we can
reduce the duplication of effort
and so on and then that's a good thing
this is what we try to offer users and
this the sort of guiding philosophy
started really it was one of the major
reasons why we chose ganor Mazar as our
initial platform although they're now
versions of ubuntu disco born - and
xubuntu that support the other major
desktop environments but simplicity ease
of use sort of a commitment to making
things feel like they just work in a
very smooth rounded kind of way that is
sort of our guiding a guiding vision we
spend a lot of time for example looking
through the forums to see what people
are trying to fix in their systems right
how to's that's the throw up queries
that people throw up how do I get this
done how do I get that done and that
that guides our expecting as to what we
need to do in the next release - to make
it a more polished system that really
more sort of expresses what people want
out of their platform we have this very
very strict six monthly release schedule
which i think until once you came along
nobody thought could be done but now
pretty much everybody else is doing it
as well and that's really helped by
Genomes commitment to that and we're
trying to because we have the whole
distro coming out now and this sort of
six monthly pulse we're trying to
encourage other upstreams to adopt the
same sort of view of life and one of the
interesting insights there is that we
realized that is sitting at setting a
feature based release schedule was very
tricky because 99% of the features in
the platform and other things we control
so so we just recognized that our job
was to sort of impose a broader
community process on the polishing and
shaping of these regular releases and up
streams will feed us what they will and
we our job is just to integrate that the
best the best of the state-of-the-art
and and then push that out the door in a
form that people can use and depend on
we we took a an unusual decision early
on to ship by default only one
application for each major use case so
one of the one of the amazing things
about free software is there are you
know there's 10 IRC or instant messaging
clients and there's three or four
browsers all of which are very good
there's a couple of ways to do
spreadsheets
in in the free software world and we we
recognize that all of those important so
we make them available through our
network repositories with varying levels
of sort of support and accessibility but
we try to ship just one primary platform
and one of the major reasons to do that
is so that users can more easily help
each other I've seen conversations where
you've got two Linux users talking to
each other saying I'm trying to get my
browser to do this and takes a while
before they realize they're talking
about completely different browsers and
so we try to eliminate that kind of
effect by
by giving people just a sort of very
clear obvious way to get something
typical done but we don't we don't we
learn very quickly that we needed to
make the rest of that enormous universe
of free software available as well so we
we have all of the repositories
everything that you would find in Debian
and a bunch of other packages that
haven't yet made it into Debian those
are all accessible and available in
Ubuntu and we have a huge community
that's grown up phenomenal community
that's grown up just effectively tending
to - all of that stuff and then
community really is sort of at the
essence of it from from a user
perspective users we encourage end-users
actually to get involved in the
community at any number of different
levels and that's that's been very
successful there's also a business side
to that
so we have a series of partnership
programs focus for us now is is
pre-installation and the sort of the
OEMs and system builders that's not
that's not a huge interest here in the
states or in Europe because the
economics don't really work out it
doesn't really work out for delt offer
you know end-users in customers consumer
customers in the u.s. Linux on the
desktop just because their margins are
so tight that one guy who thinks he was
getting a cheaper windows deal and ends
up getting at the next deal and gets
confused and starts you know complaining
and filing support requests that guy
blows away the margins on ten other
computers so it it just doesn't work out
but in many other parts of the world it
is starting to be as you know
economically interesting for people to
offer computers with Linux pre-installed
so our job is to go and find those
places and make sure that those guys get
a computer that's that's so functional
out of the box that they're not tempted
to go in and install a pirated copy of
Windows and and and replace there
they're very excellent Linux with that
this is kind of an overview of the
things that canonical does we have a
global support team led by Jeff where's
Jeff yes somewhere in the house out of
at a Montreal and so that operation is
growing there they now offer 24 by 7
support for Ubuntu on servers out of out
of Montreal and we have we have a sort
of a management product under
development for the ideas that you'll be
able to keep track of multiple machines
possibly for multiple customers that you
manage they're all running Ubuntu and so
you can do all this sort of naggy our
style web-based management and
monitoring that you'd like we do quite a
bit of work with people who want to take
a bun to and then make it different it's
being free software they could do that
for themselves but in many cases that I
choose to work with us just because they
think we might be able to do it more
cost-effectively because we know right
out of the box how best to go about
getting something done and also because
sometimes they want those changes to
have a good chance of landing in the
core distro itself and if we do a thing
we're more likely to like the way that
it was done and and bring it in and in
these are what I think are most
important relationships which is with
the free software community it's
it's I think there's an enormous
temptation as a distro to think that
that you're the most important cog in
this free software sort of machine but
the reality is the distros best base job
is to kind of get out of the way and
make it possible for the guys who write
Apache or the guys who write Firefox of
the guys who write OpenOffice to have
their stuff land on the user's desktop
in the way that they think it actually
should best be used so to the extent
that to the extent that we can we try to
maintain the best possible line of
communication with with upstream side
it's I can't tell you how many times
I've sort of been working with distros
and you see destroy maintainer you know
sort of fobbing off the guys who
actually write the software because the
destroy maintain it does have this kind
of unique ability just to push that
software out to the user and we want to
sort of see things slightly differently
so I think with the first distro really
to say we would ship the latest version
and not try and make huge amounts of
changes to to those versions to the
extent that we do make changes then
those patches are more immediately
accessible and useful to upstreams so
upstreams hate receiving wonderful huge
patches that do amazing things based on
a version that's 18 months old because
they never to be then can't integrate
that directly into their into their
trunk and we try and try and stay as
close to to the code that upstream is
looking at everyday as possible we also
try and work well with other distros the
obvious one is Debian Debian is you know
we say Debian is our rock that's a
contentious relationship and and I
suspect it always will be a contentious
relationship just because Debian is an
enormous organization of sort of very
strong individuals so all of whom have a
complete spectrum of opinions but we do
find that that that we've learned how to
how to make the changes that we make
available to Debian maintainer so that
if they want to collaborate it's easy
for them to collaborate and we try and
we try and do that we publish every time
we upload a package that has changed we
both publish those changes on the web
and email the changes to to the to the
Debian package management system and we
find that
some percentage of maintainer x' take
those and integrate them some engage of
good conversations with us as to what
the patch is about others drop it on the
floor and you know complain that we're
spamming them and we just sort of learn
how to turn it off for those guys and
I'd like to extend that further I think
there's this really good work that
happens in all of the distress right I'd
like to figure out how we could work
more closely with Gen 2 just because
they have you know they they solve
certain kinds of problems and they
attract certain kinds of people and they
do there's some aspects of that
distribution that I think are really
good and so I'd like us to be able to
have a very effective conversation with
them for the things that we you know
that we we have in common same goes for
Red Hat same goes for Sousa and
potentially also for the bsds so I see
this whole sort of free software
ecosystem as as something that we need
to figure out in each case how to
collaborate with effectively okay so
this collaboration problem is one that
we we think about a lot and we realized
early on that for our purposes we're
going to need to NIH a bunch of
infrastructure and so we decided NIH it
in a way that it would it would be
useful for other people as well and so
that's what a launchpad donate is all
about it's our bug tracker it's our
translation infrastructure it's our it
runs this meeting so it tells us what
we're trying to do in a particular I
shouldn't wave this around it's
launching if I do is a prize for whoever
it hits um so Launchpad is is is how we
know what we're going to do or what
we're doing at any at any given time and
we've written it in such a way that that
other projects can use it as well and so
that makes it then correspondingly
easier for us to to work with them it
doesn't necessarily assume the projects
are using it so for example there's a
bug tracker in Launchpad that knows that
tada we're not the only people in the
world shipping Apache and notice that
there there isn't a bug tracker out
there which is where Apache tracks its
bugs and allows us to say okay we found
a bug in Apache and yes Apache upstream
already knows about that and that's the
corresponding bug number and so then we
can kind of decide if we want to do
anything about that but if we don't want
to do anything about that at least what
will happen is if Apache says hey we did
something about this bug we get notified
and so that makes I'll
as easier and hopefully it also makes
Apaches like that life easier over time
will it will extend that so that the
integration with Apaches bugtracker gets
better and better so if we you know if
we want to communicate directly with
them we can do so sort of in an
efficient kind of way so bugs
translations feature planning revision
control for me one of the problems we
have is you know we'll know that there's
a patch or there was a there was a there
was a there's a there's a there's a
commit somewhere in an upstreams
tree that fixes a particular issue and
so we want to go find that tree and then
and then grip through the logs to to
find the relevant point and then pull
the code and stick that in a package but
all of our developers then have to learn
where all the different CVS trees or SVN
trees of all those different groups are
so we launch pad also glyph that lets us
take a sort of a single view of all of
those up streams and have a single like
alias for each for each UPS tree and
then over time we'll we'll improve that
yeah yeah we do at the moment so it's
all important export of profiles and so
that's that's easy for them to do if
they're using if they're using launchpad
to do their translation which more and
more up streams are and they instantly
see if and a bunch of community member
translates a particular string in a
particular language in a particular way
and the next second somebody else you
know loads their their profile and
they've got the same string and they'll
see that translation or won't be
automatically shoved in they wouldn't
want that but it's then immediately
accessible to them they can say well I
just want that and and so that's a nice
collaboration point of collaboration we
want to take that further we want to get
it so that if you have the if you have
the ability to translate in a bun to
your a buncha translator and an upstream
translator then you can just translate
once and have those translations pushed
off automatically we we should be able
to get it so that we can export those
translations our translations through
the revision control as well so that up
streams developers can basically just
merge the translations straight from
from launchpad so over time we're sort
of getting that better and better but at
the moment the state of the art is if
it's been translated anywhere then you
you know everybody who also has to
translate that same thing benefits
so there are that's also that's also a
platform for some commercial services
that we offer there are lots of people
out there now who work with free
software but they work in a slightly
proprietary way they they have their own
internal view of a piece of free
software but they want to keep track of
what's going on in that community and
more often than not nowadays especially
they're getting smart to the fact that
it's not good to hold indefinitely right
there are things that are strategic and
you want to keep internal but more more
often than not that's a rolling window
and you want to push code out and
they're learning that you know if you if
you throw a ball out six months or a
year later with very nicely written
document that this is a whole bunch of
bug numbers that you fixed in that tar
ball then you're just gonna end up
fixing those bugs again because people
again can't integrate that so over time
launch pad allows us to offer services
to those companies saying yeah we can
keep track for you of of the upstream
bugs that you are fixing and make it so
that it's easy for you to publish your
patches in a way that's most relevant to
to upstream we also a Bunter has also
sort of expanded into a family of
collaborating distress Kubuntu edge
you're going to exude one to newborn two
and then others like waddle onyx
Mullenix in pekin topics and and the
idea is that these these guys are all
connected but only as much as they want
to be so it could burn to energy one two
and and one two all share a hell of a
lot they're exactly the same core
exactly the same kernel exactly the same
everything up to the desk desk top layer
but then they're different at that point
so we actually can do all of that
collaboration in the same archive and
our goal is over time to be able to
collaborate and there's kind of a hard
line at that point between them and the
next guy is gwad Linux and Moe Linux
because they're managing their own
archives and we don't have any direct
connection to them but over time we want
to make it so that we can do more subtle
collaboration even with with with with
other distros that are they're managing
their own archives they have different
kernels and different patches to
different pieces of the infrastructure
and we're really interested in the
differences right the differences are
what are interesting it's the bits that
they've decided as worth investing and
so we want to be able to easily study it
bring it into the in
into the core distro or share our
changes with them and Launchpad should
let us get all of that done this is we
have this phenomenal community and the
reason I think it's worked out so well
is that there's basically something for
all sorts we encourage the people to get
involved no matter what their particular
interests and we have a standardized
kind of way of recognizing the fact that
people are making a contribution it
doesn't matter what kind of contribution
they're making we we find a way to
standardize way to recognize that if
you're putting in your own time and your
expertise and and you're doing good work
and you're doing it in in a way that is
sort of that that that fits with the
spirit of Ubuntu then we recognize that
in the form of a bunting membership and
and that's true for for people who come
from all sorts of different backgrounds
and a couple of the structures from a
development and technical point of view
that are that are most interesting we
have a technical board and that group is
responsible now for mapping out the the
feature roadmap of the distro for
deciding and arbitrating between
alternative implementation decisions
where we've got sort of contentious
proposals when we're doing something
sort of fundamentally new in a one -
usually those proposals will come to the
technical board taking board will
discuss its taking award is also
responsible for signing off on who gets
to be a core developer who gets to
upload to what we call main which is the
core group and is that another group so
then there's the core developer
equipment group and then there's the
then there's what we call the masters
the universe those guys maintain
actually the bulk of the distro and so
that's a that's it that's all of the
stuff that's basically not installed by
default but there's a huge demand for it
because the longtail tends to dictate
that and everybody out there wants to
use most people want to use a core
subset but then they have their own
particular personal interests and it's a
hella it's a huge amount of work to keep
those that that long tail of application
aligned with what's going on at the core
because we have this great team focused
on the court they're able to make
transitions very quickly so we always
adopt the latest version of GCC we can
do that faster then then then Debian
traditionally has faster than other
distros traditionally have because we're
very focused on this tight core but then
you can imagine there's version lag
between that core and the external
environment in terms of C++ ABI is
Python versions dependencies and so on
and so the mo to basically take care of
all of that they also do quite a lot of
new package development when new
packages are being developed before
they've landed in daily and often
they'll land in universe through the
through the MOTU and so that's a place
where a lot of learning and development
gets done important work gets done we
have a distributed like advocacy
framework called loco teams local
community teams and they get very
organized they do they do local events
they they do a tremendous amount of
education and advocacy for us now the
team just put out a gfed which went out
just a couple of weeks ago and there are
a couple of sort of highlights in there
we've been doing some work with the with
the ltsp group so Jim Jim around there
just over there and so we ltsp I think
is really important it's important
forward for two quite distinct sorts of
groups for us one is in our education
environments ltsp is probably the most
acosta cost-effective way cost effective
ways to get desktops into schools and so
for us we started focusing quite heavily
on ltsp as we worked as we worked in an
educational kind of environment it's
also one of the most effective ways to
to change the economics of desktop
management in corporates so so it's
important for us for that reason okay so
we started working to ltsp guys about a
year ago and maybe even longer and it
very quickly became apparent to us that
anyone who deploys ltsp has this
interesting situation where they're
effectively managing to distros you've
got the distro on your server and then
separately you have the sort of binary
blob which gets shipped out from the
server on over network during doing the
thin-client boot process and that binary
blob if you look into it is basically a
little distro it's got a kernel owned
it's got X and it's got
core supporting libraries and bits and
pieces and the issue then is then if you
have security issues for example with X
you end up patching 2 X servers and you
have to use two different pieces of
infrastructure to keep track of that and
so working with the LTS P guys we
figured out it might be possible to
effectively reuse the distro bits but in
an in a thin client kind of way and so
that work has been ongoing Oliver and
and math Zimmerman and other guys kind
of got that going and now more and more
the LTS P community is starting to rally
around that and so that engineering is
going to be the core of the next major
release of LTS P LTS p5 and an edgy kind
of had a sneak preview of that so that's
I think good stuff then we had some we
run of one of one of our guys took on
the brave task of rewriting process 1
and so we were all a bit nervous the day
that landed in the art in the archive
but it went very smoothly so we're Scott
Scott in one of those sessions so
upstart which is our new replacement for
in it basically is designed for a hot
plug world in it most via net and and
the other things that are traditionally
used really are designed for
environments with with platform
aesthetic right you you traditional days
you compiled your OS for your hardware
and then you weren't really changing
your hardware that much because you
couldn't move it and now everything's
mobile or ultra mobile so and and and
hot plugging right we've got Bluetooth
we've got USB we've got PCI hot plug we
live in a hot plug kind of world and so
upstart is is designed to to bring the
system up in a dynamic kind of way it
looks at the hardware events it looks at
hardware initialization it looks at
higher level events in the system and
allows us to do dependency based system
initialization it allows us to
parallelize a lot of things right allows
us to say okay whoops I think we've got
Network let's bring up Apache it allows
us to say are there I see you've got an
HP printer plugged in I'll bring up the
print that the HP printer management
daemon that kind of thing traditionally
the the system initialization process
has been very linear
and because of being cautious about race
conditions and things like that so it's
been very very inefficient if you look
at boot charts a very low CPU
utilization for big chunks of of of the
initialization system initialization
process so so that was very very cool
work and and will get extended in in the
next release to do even more dynamic
stuff interestingly Apple did the same
thing Apple rewrote in it they did
something called launch D so it'll be
interesting to see and that's free
software though it hasn't been ported I
don't think it has been ported to Linux
yet it's it's ported to some of the VSDs
so if interesting to see whether the
distros in epitope ting launch D or
upstart more widely the next release is
what's being planned here we do this we
have a six months release cycle and
about a week and a half after the
preview after the last release we all
come from four corners of the earth plus
community plus other companies and we
map out what the next five months of
work is going to be like and what kind
of features we want to get into the
distro so feisty fawn is due in April
2007 and some of the things that I think
are approved for for learning in that
are and number one will be desktop
effects by default so I'm sure many of
you guys have seen compass and Matassa T
sorry compass and barrel and the the
desktop effects that those platforms
enable xjl we've decided we're going to
go with something called AI GL x which
is not X GL but it's a it's an
alternative approach that's it's more
palatable to the X or all guys and we
will be turning that on by default for
systems which have the required hardware
which have all of the necessary
infrastructure so a slightly
controversial thing about that is that
we will be will we've always shipped the
binary drivers for for 89 Nvidia cards
we may end up turning those on and
actually using them by default to to
make this functionality work right out
of the box
smooth network roaming so we want to get
it to the point where when you walk into
the office the system knows that that's
the printer to use and that this is the
network configuration that's the time
server that's where the proxy is and so
on and when you sort of walk out of the
office and you go over to Starbucks it
knows how to use the tea
while network over there and so it's
familiar with all of these different
networks you can figure them once and
it's very organically and very smoothly
lets you roam between those networks in
a nice efficient way if you look in the
forum's you'll find that that's
something that everybody spends or a lot
of people spend time doing is trying to
make multimedia work well and there are
great constraints on what we can ship by
default patent grounds to the whole
world but there are big chunks of the
world where those patents don't apply or
they were never filed or patents like
that aren't respected or aren't sorry
not on respected aren't legal sensible
parts of the world and so for people
from sensible parts of the world we'll
make it very easy for them to to get
that functionality switched on by
default telepathy there's a there's a
big push actually being driven by by
companies like Nokia and we have guys
from Nokia here to to use Linux in
communications type products and so what
becomes really important in is knowing
who you can communicate and how you can
communicate with them and so telepathy
is a is a is a bit of infrastructure
which makes that kind of thing possible
keeps track of all the people that you
know and where they are at and and
allows you to establish channels of
communication to them so you get really
interesting functionality that you can
start to be able to turn on right I used
to think that the stuff was all about
just knowing whether it's instant
message or VoIP call someone that it was
a there was a demo yesterday where guys
was showing showing off audio editing
type software and they said when the
telepathy stuff lands it'll be easy for
them so this audio editing stuff is
designed to basically be like mixing
like a mixing decks disc if you're
producing a podcast for example you can
take your your one recording and then
you can you can mix in some music and
all that kind of stuff
it's very nice rig gnomish very very
slick very cool and they said when their
celebrity stuff lands basically you'll
be able to add a musical instrument
which is actually a phone call a sub
phone call and so so you'll start your
podcasting and at the relevant time
it'll actually phone out of a sip it'll
call the guy and you'll be able to
record their conversation and mix it in
just because to the system right that
that that line of communication is just
an audio stream and it's can be can be
handled in a very sort of smooth and
elegant kind of way so I think there are
things that we can be able to
demonstrate on the free software desktop
which perhaps people haven't sort of
conceived of yet in in the proprietary
world and there's this there's this
pattern that I have observed that when
free software gets to a point of parity
with the proprietary alternative
innovation explodes now there's always
innovation in in the free software world
but it's kind of dominated by the desire
to reach parity until you hit that point
and then suddenly you you sort of
everybody sticks their head over the
parapet and it's just blue sky from
there so Firefox was a classic example
when it got to when it got to a point of
parity and they added the extension
mechanism innovation just blossomed
because any guy who had a an interesting
idea or twist on the whole browser idea
could now stand on the shoulders of
giants start with him a platform which
which you know was at parity and then
add his interesting twist and so I think
that's that's a that's a that's a
pattern that we will see you with a
desktop at large as the desktop at large
reaches this this point of parity will
just see tremendous innovation printing
is getting a lot of attention it should
be possible with with feisty to
plug-and-play most printers there's a
lot of work being done at the free
standards group the LSP the group that
basically sets the LSB standards to make
printing very smooth and to make that
just rock and then also we're starting
to get to the point now where we're
where there's a lot of demand for formal
training and certification so in the
feisty form sort of cycle I would expect
there to be authorized training
materials a lot of authorized training
materials becoming available and
training centers and so on so that
ecosystems starting to grow so the
people can get trained up and certified
and then don't matter for this so that's
what we're about and I must say it's
absolutely incredible for everybody to
be here everyone keeps saying what a
what a great venue this is a second
second distro meeting was legendary for
its for its bad food and everybody keeps
contrasting this with this experience of
that one I think that's something of an
unfair comparison
it's this is certainly the most
extraordinary vironment we've we've ever
been in for this kind of session so any
questions any anything you guys are
curious about or want to answer yeah in
Africa it's very popular this Africa's
way behind on the technology adoption
curve in some ways interestingly enough
for example cell phones are just
exploding in Africa something like one
in nine Africans now has a cell phone
which was unthinkable when they set the
the sort of poverty alleviation targets
10-15 years ago they said okay if we can
get to one in a hundred people in Africa
have have a telephone by 2005 then we'll
be very happy and they just completely
blew that away because of cell phones so
to the extent that Linux is is is
popular in Africa upon tears very
popular I've heard of big installations
in Nigeria and Uganda in particular I
think some some localization work in
Kenya but Africa is a bit of a
disappointment in terms of in terms of
free software adoption it just it hasn't
it when I go to free software sort of
events in in Africa there's this a lot
of enthusiasm but they aren't and really
kind of got the momentum yet I went to
in Beijing I was for the AG release
party I was in Beijing and they were 450
people showed up it was kind of daunting
it was unbelievable I've never seen
anything like that so okay where it's
hugely popular Eastern Europe China
Brazil and in some other countries
yeah I'd like to be and they'll
definitely take patches so it's you're
absolutely right in that that there's
been this this sort of winter of
discontent in the in the in the X
environment I see every indication that
that's broken down now with with extra
dog basically becoming a new vibrant hub
for this kind of development what we
don't have yet is a really compelling
drive for investment in desktop
technologies I would I would love to be
doing more R&amp;amp;D in the desktop
environment but my kind of my commitment
underwriter boom to goes as far as
making sure that we can have a project
that we can grow then we can demonstrate
its viability once it reaches its own
sort of critical mass and sustainability
then I think we could be a focus for
that investment I would like other
people you know to be driving that
investment but at this stage I don't see
any company really pouring resources
into the the desktop and and GUI kinds
of of layers most of the real heavy
investment is being done as you
understand on that on the server side
yeah
yeah okay but the question is is how can
we improve the experience to somebody
who wants to instead of running Sid from
Debian basically instead of staying at
head who wants to and fixing little
things as they come back who wants to go
from one version of Ubuntu to the next
version of Ubuntu to the next version of
Ubuntu so we do actually formally
support the upgrade process we have a
couple of issues with that the first is
we have a lot of people who try to do
that upgrade just by changing this so
they have set up sources that list and
then doing the upgrade and that on its
own won't work because while the
packages package will get upgraded
within their versions you won't get the
same effect as as literally shifting all
the policy type decisions so for example
when we move from having OpenOffice 1 as
the default of an office to an office to
if you just did an apt sources thing
what you ended up with is both
OpenOffice 1 and OpenOffice 2 because
that a package management level the
system doesn't know the policy decision
that was basically taken to replace open
off as one with OpenOffice 2 so we've
written an infrastructure called the
Update Manager and the upgrade sort of
assistant which will pop up and tell you
there is a new release available and if
you want to go with that release it not
only upgrades the packages but it also
replaces chunks of the system based on
the policy decisions that we took during
that release cycle and that that works
pretty well unless people have gone in
and configured their system and so
that's why it's kind of an that's that's
why that's why it's really important for
us to go and study the forum's because
it gives us both an idea of the things
we need to put into the next release and
also the things we should try and
anticipate in the upgrade system so for
example guys who do
who based on on on dapper had added AI
GLX and compiz and all of that kind of
stuff that was a very hard upgrade for
them to go from that to edgy and so we
starting to get better and better at
sort of detecting those situations and
trying to deal with them also we only
support a core subset right there's only
I don't know thousand four hundred
thousand five hundred packages that are
in the core subset the whips that we
support and we do a lot of testing of of
the upgrade owners and as people to the
extent that people pull in from that
long tail of packages it it gets more
difficult for us for us to do so what
really helps of course is bug reports
and and testing and one of the one of
the challenges for us is that people
like the releases so much that they say
oh I'll I'll just wait until it releases
out and then I'll upgrade and that's a
bit late for us to get bug reports at
that point so if you if you give us just
five good bug reports for edgy - feisty
then we will appreciate greatly and do a
good job for you in a chair yeah yes
maybe Novell shoulda thought of that huh
um so we don't know the terms of the
deal yet you asked the question ran away
that's okay and we don't know the terms
of the deal yet so it's unclear I
understand that Microsoft Novell are
frantically rewriting the terms of the
deal as they figure out what a minefield
they've walked into I hope somebody
loses a foot but until we actually fully
sort of know know the terms of the deal
we you know we can't sort of really
comment I will say that that I think
this is probably only the first move by
Microsoft to really start actively
countering what they see is an emerging
threat free software has had a huge
impact on the software industry if you
look below that sort of top five
companies most of the news mostly
headlines are taken up by the top five
software companies
globally and now we're starting to see
free software really starting to impact
Oracle Microsoft both making major
announcements in the last two weeks on
mano we're going to ship it so its
energy it'll be on feisty that's that's
like one of the top top issues I will
say that the the situation is improving
dramatically on the server side of
things you be you'd be pretty crazy to
try and sell server kit these days and
not have a good Linux support story
right so so on that side of things I
think we're in good shape
and what really drove that was market
share when when when two things happen
companies started to see that those
companies which had a reputation for
doing Linux well we're selling kit based
on that and those companies which which
didn't have a reputation for that you
know started to just find that their
sales calls were that much more
difficult and so they all started to do
the right thing there the the consumer
market is incredible it's hard to
imagine another industry which is both
physical and so competitive right I mean
physical goods generally tend to have a
fair amount of margin built into them
but the PC industry is just ruthless and
and tough so that works that's a
disadvantage to us because if it's kind
of you know cost everyone knows they got
to write Windows drivers and they budget
for that and the cost of Linux drivers
is kind of an added overhead they they
they don't like to have to do that the
flip side to that is that because it's
so competitive once once everybody's got
their prices down to basically exactly
the same level then then small
differences can make the difference
between winning and losing a deal so for
example if Dell started to say to their
laptop surprise of suppliers this modem
chip of yours right is 25 cents or buck
a buck 50 I don't know what it cost for
a moment modem chip but this computer of
yours is is exactly the same price and
he's got Linux drivers so I'm going with
him the moment we have that kind of
effect going then I think you'll start
to see much more pervasive support that
on the Linux side we have to we've got
some hard problems to solve you know
this is actually not just up to the
hardware vendors to write support for
Linux Linux is not
the the kernel guys don't I think
appreciate the the the harsh reality of
trying to support an OS over time in a
changing hardware world right because
they're all living at the tip to them
hardware support is only getting better
but has somebody who ships at a platform
we're living you know potentially three
months but also potentially a year and a
half behind tip and now there's a new
piece of now there's a new piece of
hardware only need to get device drivers
integrated and in this regard Windows
and some of the other UNIX is even are
much better than us that than Linux
because they think they're kernels are
amenable to that they encourage they
make it straightforward to know how you
write a device driver that will just
work on a variety of versions of the
kernel where is the the kernel guys the
Linux kernel guys tend to just say well
you know it's not hard you just take the
source you compile it and it goes and
ends you know that's that's that's great
but not for not much for a situation so
it's kind of a two-pronged thing one is
convince all the hardware manufacturers
they need to write drivers and two is
convince the linux guys they need to
create a more manageable framework for
hardware companies to to do that here's
an interesting thought for you there's
this massive convergence between the PC
world and the ultra mobile world right
the the cell phone type type markets and
many of those platforms are now starting
to run Linux so to the extent that you
want to provide a chip that's going to
go into a smartphone and potentially
into a laptop right if 2030 percent of
your laptop or your your smartphone OS
this platform is Linux then suddenly
there's a dramatically increased
incentive to do the right thing over
there so we're seeing a lot of companies
like Texas Instruments which used to be
very dismissive of Linux very distant
from it suddenly finding that a large
chunk of that core market cares a lot
about Linux and so it reaches a point
where a big company starts to say okay
we just we have a Linux division and we
send them the products and they produce
the drivers and that's true we don't try
and anticipate in advance which driver
we get which platforms we're going to
need to support this is just our core
set of supported platforms we're
starting to see that effect kick in
which is great
yeah I would not have expected to go to
Beijing and have 500 kids standing there
and asking detailed questions about
Ubuntu and how we put it all together on
the and the build process I would not
have expected to have a meeting with the
Chinese government minister who says yes
we're building a reference platform for
China and it's a bun two with a
different name on it right I would I
would I would not have expected I'd not
have expected us to be here right when
when we spend we started we didn't know
if the world would care right about the
things that we that we that they would
care about but we felt strongly enough
about them to try so it's it's it's kind
of surprising to see you guys you might
have heard of this thing called Google
Trends check out check out a bunch on
that and that's been surprising so
that's awesome so as long as I feel that
that the world is moving to free
software and that that a bunch who is
going to be an important part of that
then it's a great privilege for me to be
part of it and to continue to underwrite
it yeah
well do you guys know any companies that
do proprietary web services and use a
lot of Linux sir
so so there are there are some
interesting questions there right and a
lot of those questions are at the heart
of the gplv3 discussion what is what is
how far should those freedoms go how far
those freedoms b-b-b etosha far should
be compulsory to participate if you if
you if you derive from from from these
platforms is that is that really what
you're asking yeah
my view on that is that the gplv2
whether it was deliberate or accidental
ended up being an extraordinarily well
balanced document right it it it's
interesting when people are not in a
position of great power they sometimes
tend to think you know more more
rationally about about how things should
be and one of the reasons South Africa
has done incredibly well over the last
1012 years is that the government we
have today spend 50 years in a position
of no power planning what government
should look like and they did really
well in building that so I think so I
think the gplv2
really struck a very very nice balance
I think the v3 process is important
there are the world does change right
you can't just just just sort of assume
that that a document that was good 20
years ago is going to stay good now I
trust the people who driving that
process I think the efforts if have done
very well by all of us I think if in
Midland and software freedom Law Center
I think they they're trying to do a very
open process let's be real there's a lot
of very well-paid lawyers from all sides
taking a very active hand in the process
and I hope that ultimately what they
produce is something that that we can
all live with i alternate lee though i
think guys like Glynnis Torvalds and
others will look at it and say you know
thumbs up or thumbs down and it won't do
it won't be bad for the world if people
look at it and say you know thumbs down
we don't we don't we don't need that
perhaps though the Microsoft Novell move
will catalyze people's interests in
bringing DRM and patent issues and
potentially also web services kind of
into the mix more aggressively I think
there is a fundamental difference
between the software you expect somebody
to run on their platform and the
software that you run as a service so
Launchpad is proprietary and I take a
bullet for that every time I talk about
it at a free software conference right
that I absolutely think that this
there's nothing wrong with the approach
we were doing there we contribute a lot
to the pieces of that infrastructure
which we share with everybody else and
so I think that's fine by us
big wofully answer no real clarity there
here yeah yep so I think we can both
agree that there is a nice event to
build upon it he was designed to be that
way you know prodigy back wouldn't works
Paris was doing that try to create a
course of distribution based on that
and you have much more success during a
bunch of endings done well I'm so
everything before I want to I wonder if
that is just because you pick the right
moment to do that when things really
cool well it's not the book is not a
commercial distribution so so for
example I think Carell and others had a
lot of people have taken a dip in and
try to create something that was kind of
proprietary and commercial out of it and
I think those efforts are sort of doomed
to failure because it's very hard if as
much as I say our relationship with the
Venus contentious it's one of those
situations where we agree on 99.9
percent of the time and then shot in
public about the other 1% right and so
at least the collaboration is you know
it's it's possible to build personal
collaboration relationships there
because our guys all think in the same
sort of ways and care about the same
sort of things as the Debian guys you
know I think we call those autoimmune
diseases I don't know I I hope
ultimately that that relation you know
that both the bun to and Debian are
greatly strengthened over the next the
next couple of years I think a bun to
benefits tremendously from Davey and I
know that there are some people within
Debian who think that Davian benefits
tremendously from a bun - all right well
