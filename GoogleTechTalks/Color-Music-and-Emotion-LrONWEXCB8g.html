a grad student at Berkeley he was one of
the leaders of the cognitive science
program and so that's where I learned a
lot you know I was confused you know you
read things like JJ Gibson and he just
seemed too mystical but then I read
Steve stuff and it all started to make
sense but and now I think he's you know
so he did that for triangles that point
and and how they grouped together and
now he seems to be pushing the envelope
even farther and they're gonna explain
color music and emotion
take it away very recent research just
the last years but before I talk about
color music and emotion I want to give
an update the talk that I gave I know is
probably maybe three years ago or more
and Google actually was kind enough to
give me some money to support our
research on color preference so at the
time I gave that talk I was able to tell
you a lot about you know what colors
people liked they tend to like cool
colors particularly blue they tend not
to like dark yellow or that is to say
greenish brown colors but we didn't know
why and one of the things that we
learned in part with the support from
Google is we now know a lot about why
people like the colors they do at least
in aggregate this is not necessarily
each individual person yet but the basic
the basic theory we thought the
ecological balance theory is that people
liked colors to the extent that they
liked the objects that are those colors
so the reason people like blues is
because they like clear sky and clean
water and the reason they don't like
those I call that color ducky-poo this
dark yellow is because it looks like poo
and and we're able to show this in a
pretty elegant and a convincing manner
you can count for 80% of the variance in
group data on color preferences from the
perspective of the way that we've tested
this theory if you want to find out more
about it
there's a paper by Palmer and Schloss in
Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences in 2010 and there's also a
video for the visual learners there's a
video that's available if you just
google Palmer color Stanford video it's
a lecture I gave attempt Terry Winograd
group the first half of that talk will
sort of explain that stuff but today
what I'm going to be talking about is
color music and emotion that in this
particular image I've used because maybe
some of you at least will recognize it
I don't know whether it was part of the
blue arts project or not but this is a
pain to dry and dim ski and Kandace tea
was a sin estate so that when he heard
music
II saw colors and he used those colors
to paint and and so forth and there's a
number of other artists who have had
similar kinds of synesthetic experiences
and this project actually kind of began
with the question by an undergraduate
about synesthesia one of the study
synesthesia in this color seminar that I
that I teach or taught at Berkeley but
we couldn't do that because we don't
have any statistics in the class and I
was using everybody in the class as
subjects for the experiment so so well
what about let's let's look at the
relationship between color and music in
just normal everyday people that was the
genesis of this project so what I'm
gonna do today is tell you first about
these associations between color and
music first in an initial experiment
that we did where we used orchestral
classical music by Bach Mozart and
Brahms then I'm going to tell you about
a further extension of that study where
we got serious about controlling our
stimulated that's what we call them in
psychology by using single line piano
melodies then I'm going to talk about
some ways in which we tested this idea
that it's actually a motion that
mediate the relationship between colors
and music and then finally I'm going to
talk about some thats related in the
sense that it's also about colors and
music but here it's really about
individual differences it's about
something that we might call aesthetic
style and the name we give to this
dimension where people vary in terms of
aesthetics ah a style called preference
for harmony and I'll explain you know
where that came from and so first I want
to talk about the initial experiment and
the basic question is well are there
systemic relationships between color and
music and if so why do we have them and
the claim that was made by Arnheim the
famous psychologist art was that there
are such relationships and are mediated
by emotion but he didn't provide any
evidence for that or say anything about
how it might happen and that's sort of
what we're going for those are the
interesting theoretical questions so
first to say a few words about the
colors that we study this is part of the
color experiment that I talked to you
about three years ago we used color as
37 colors selected from the natural
color system which has the sort of
standard dimensions of color appearance
there is hue which are the things that
we would call the basic colors including
two dimensions of red green and blue
yellow there's also the dimension of
saturation how vivid the color is where
all the desaturated colors are along the
central axis and they become more vivid
as they go out to the edge and finally
brightness which is the vertical height
of the color within this space with
black at the bottom white top and
various shades of gray in between then
the way that we selected our 37 colors
was we used eight different hues the so
called unique hues red green blue and
yellow and then also the maybe is better
if I actually sit down because I'm
blocking people's
those are the unique hues and then the
angle bisectors of those unique hues
orange purple of cyan and chartreuse you
all know what cyan is chartreuse is
yellow green and then we sampled those
eight hues at four different we called
cuts through the color space which are
combinations of saturation and
brightness levels so we have a light cut
which is sort of what you might call the
pastel colors a saturated cut which are
the ones that are most vivid a muted cut
which have the same overall brightness
as the saturated colors but are less
saturated and finally the dark colors
and you'll see that the lights that your
light muted and dark colors are all
pretty much the same in terms of their
overall overall saturation the only ones
that have higher saturation are the
saturated sample +5 rays at
corresponding levels in between and that
gives us a total of 37 colors that we've
been studying and you'll see how this
comes up in the experiments in just a
second
yeah these don't look quite the way they
should but of course you guys know about
that right I have no control over this
projector Russians have no control I
have limited control over but this shows
where those colors lie in the C lab
color space now one of the things that
we did with these colors in the initial
experiment was to get show people each
wear color and have them make a rating
in terms of what the emotional content
or emotional Association of those colors
were and we did this for a whole lot of
different terms and a subset of those
terms are the ones that I'm going to be
using today because they seem to apply
both to potentially to music and color
so we've got angry calm sad happy dreary
lively weak and strong and what we're
showing here is the actual data points
for the red orange yellow chartreuse
green cyan blue and purple in these four
different cuts so these are the 32
chromatic colors and of course the dark
red is the
his color followed by saturated red and
so forth and then science and blues of
the least angry color etc etc so we've
got a mapping of what the emotional
associations of these things are and we
picked these particular eight to pursue
in this study so the first thing the
first task we had people do was they
listened to 18 different classical music
selections and they chose in order the
five best colors to go with that music
that's all we told them and then later
on we play the same selections of music
and say okay now pick the five best
worst colors in order that go least well
with the music and for each of three
composers Bach Mozart and Brahms we had
this little 2x3 design we had slow
medium and fast music and we had some in
a major month and some minor mode and
the Bach pieces were from brandenburg
concerto the mozart from the late
symphonies and the bronx and the four
symphonies and if I can I will play a
few of these so you get the idea if you
can hear they hope you can you hear that
so that's Bach fast oh yeah that's right
so I tried to fix this this morning I
couldn't it's you know it's Microsoft
product so that's the major fast here's
uh quite as many of these would be
familiar to you but for contrast so
here's box slow major
so a big difference in speed and here's
slow minor
okay now a couple or so folks are fast
major still pretty lively there's a big
difference between fast Brahms and fast
Mozart prison saw right so that's a lot
slower but it's really fast for wrong
okay so you get an idea and you can you
can think about you know doing the task
so suppose you're hearing this and your
task is to pick the five colors in order
to go best with this music saturated
yellow and bright warm colors and so
forth anyway so that's what they did
that was their first task you know I can
go back and then they did two other
tasks which are a little bit more
straightforward as I told you this is
the data I showed you before that we had
each person see each one of these colors
individually saying that particular
color there and say how happy is that
color how sad how lively how dreary how
strong the whole week and so forth they
made a rating actually put a slider
there was a slider at the bottom from
you know very happy to vary not happy
and so forth so we get data for each
color in terms of what its emotional
associations are and the same thing with
the with the music so they would hear
that piece say this one and they say how
happy it is have sad it is blah blah
blah blah blah okay then we computed
these these color equal color music
associations between the colors and the
music and the way that we did it was
remember they do it for the best colors
and the worst colors and basically we
just take this weighted average of for a
given dimension say brightness how
bright are the colors that they pick to
go well with it and we weight them more
the first one they pick versus the
second person consistent and we do the
same thing for the for the ones that are
most inconsistent and we just subtract
that too right so if it was that piece
and you pick bright colors then you'd
have a large number here minus a
negative number here which gives you a
very large number relative to you know
other ones that you might pick so it's a
way of integrating those two sets of of
choices that they make and then we
looked here and we're plotting than what
the saturation is of the colors that
people pick to go with the slow medium
and fast tempo and the major minor mode
and this is just average across Bach
Mozart and Brahms
okay now what you find is these are huge
effects I mean that as the music gets
faster the colors get more saturated and
if music is month major as opposed to
minor the colors are still more
saturated and similarly for length
versus dark the faster the music is the
lighter the colors are and the more
major it is lighter they are there's not
much going on for red versus green but
in blue versus yellow again the colors
that they pick to go with the faster
music and the more major music is our
yellower than the colors that they pick
to go with the slower and more minor
music and all of these things are sort
of wildly significant well that's
interesting they're larger systemic
relationships between color and music we
didn't really know whether we were gonna
get anything to come out there but it
did and in some sense the thing that was
most remarkable that this study is that
we then went back and we looked at
people's ratings for each piece of music
how say happy vs. sad is this piece of
music okay they made a rating on this
thing we also had to make a rating of
how happy versus sad the colors are that
went with the music the stuff the colors
that they pick to go with the music so
we can actually look at the correlation
between the happy sadness of music and
the happy sadness of the colors they
pick to go with the music with me and
what we found was remarkably the
correlation between
the happy sadness of music and the happy
sadness for the colors is 0.97 and
similarly for strong versus weak 0.96
lively 3.99 calm angry 0.89 so this is
like the flaky espera meant
I think I've ever heard anybody do you
play people these uncontrolled musicals
excerpts you show them this array of
3237 colors you have them pick the ones
that go best the ones that pick the code
that would go worst moreover and then
you asked them about how emotional what
kind of emotions they had these things
have and you get correlations like this
I spent many sleepless nights wondering
if there wasn't something in the
experimental design that ensured that
this was going to come out this way but
there isn't so what this meant to us was
that going just meant that we believed
that emotion is mediating this
relationship between color and music the
same people do the color music
associations as did the emotional yes in
very different parts of it this was a
group of 48 subjects that we had come in
and do about 32 different tasks over a
period of several weeks they didn't do
those things on the same day and I think
they did the color music stuff first and
then they did the I remember where they
did the colouring notion of the music
emotion stuff second or third but yes
they all did it's the same very same
subjects no no this was actually a
sample of paint subjects some were
undergraduates but actually we were
there half man half women half highly
trained in color we actually had
painters graphic designers interior
decorators in the sort of sophisticated
group based on how much training they
had in art and color and things like
that so it's actually it's actually a
two by two with twelve subjects in each
so it's not but it doesn't really matter
because the other data somebody other
other date I'll show you I think are
from my graduates it's same thing okay
so this is what we think is happening
you listen to the music you have some
emotional ring I think you have some
emotional
reaction to it you might just say well
you just have emotional associations to
the music or whatever and then you pick
the colors that go with that music then
that emotion
well how might this happen we've got
some more data from this from this
experiment that we can use to shed some
light on this
so for each pair of colors we have their
ratings of how it loads on to each of
these eight emotional terms right how
happy sad lively dreary blah blah blah
so for each pair of colors we can
correlate the ratings that that people
gave to them in terms of those emotional
dimensions and then we can use those
correlations as the input to a
multidimensional scaling program
multi-dimensional scaling is yeah okay
so and we come out with the really nice
this is a this is a color space but it's
not a color space based on color
appearance it's a color space that's
based on color emotions if you will and
you get a good fit with two dimensions
which apparently seem to be more or less
happy versus sad colors and and weak
versus strong colors so the saturated
colors tend to be over here and the
desaturate colors over here and the sort
of warmer colors up here are the cooler
colors down there then you can do the
very same thing oh this is so you can
predict 84% of the variance in terms of
how happy versus sad the colors are in
terms of how saturated versus desaturate
that they are and how light versus dark
they are this is just a multiple
regression analysis 84% that's pretty
darn good not quite so good at
predicting strong versus weak only sixty
percent of the variance that's still a
little more of a correlation of 0.8 but
saturated colors and dark colors tend to
be stronger and D saturated and lighter
colors tend to be weaker now you can do
the same thing with the music because of
course we have the same data for each of
the selections of music they've rated
each piece of music in terms of how
happy sad lively dreary strong weak blah
blah blah and you can then correlate
those each pair and you can do a music
emotion space and so this gives you the
key here so let's see yellow is fast
and open this major so here are the fast
major pieces up here they are strong and
happy relatively speaking and hero the
solid ones are slow
the blue ones rather slow and so these
are the these are the slow minor ones
down here so the two dimensions seem to
be pretty much the same happy sad strong
weak I mean it says know what your brain
is doing is mapping the the music into
this emotion space which is the same
space that into which colors get mapped
and you can actually kind of read off of
these two things who just sort of
superimpose them music the colors that
are most similar to that are in this
emotion space and that seems to be what
they pick this is just more multiple
regressions and so at the end of this
experiment we've got a very robust
mapping between colors and we've got a
hypothesis that is actually mediated by
people's emotions in a mind-blowing ly
tightly coupled way so this isn't the
next thing Ronna logically we did but
sort of conceptually this is data that
we just recently collected and we wanted
to get some control over these things I
mean the music that we used was real
music I mean these were commercially
available recordings the best I could
find but there's all kinds of variation
in terms of how loud and soft things we
study tempo and mode major versus minor
you know maybe it's not really major
versus minor and tempo that matters
maybe it's a lot of these other things
so we wanted to go to another kind of
music that was much more well controlled
so we ended up using Mozart solo piano
music but there's only it's only a
melody it's only a one note thing played
always on the piano in every case so
yeah so what did what are some of the
things that we control by doing this
dynamics there's no loud versus soft
this was actually synthesized piano so
there was no no variation of dynamics
there's no difference in orchestration
or
tonal color Tambor or harmonic mode
there's no there's no harmony in it but
what we did very were on these four
piano I'm going to switch out of here
this won't work either these four we
pick theme and variation melodies by
Mozart where he actually because we
wanted slow versus fast
not just in terms of what the overall
tempo is but also in terms of the note
rate and a theme and variation what they
usually do often do is there's a slow
version and there's a fast version where
they interpolate notes in between I'll
give you an example that so here's one
of the I'll just do one of the major in
one of the minor and it goes a lot it's
not just that that bit but and here's
one of the minor ones this is a
different
now for each of these we have them in
both major and minor mode so we actually
wrote a minor version of the major ones
that major version of the minor ones but
these are the two I believe am I right
about this that the first two were the
ones that these were the ones that
Mozart wrote in major and we transpose
these were the ones that we make mozart
wrote in minor because we wanted to have
both of those things we never looked at
that yet but these are these are like I
said very new data so how what did we
vary let's play this one again okay so
now here's the minor version of the same
thing okay here's what we're change the
tempo this is just speeding it up okay
we also changed pitch height that is
well higher and lower octaves I think
this is lower
and here's note density so this is the
variation now the BTS famously as it was
before but now there's two notes for
every one that you had before and that's
what this diagram supposed to be showing
you over here this is the variation is
that these extra notes on between and
that the rate at which the notes come at
you are the same when you got the
variation playing slowly and when you've
got the original melody playing fast
because we speeded up by a factor of two
so that way we can find out whether it's
actually the tempo that matters or the
no density or just the note rate okay
and turns out to be the note rate that
matters all right back to the slides
what did we find so we've got more
control over more variables and you
might be that everything goes away.we we
computed those same those same indices
except this time we only had people pick
the best three colors instead of the
best five colors you can actually get
most of the variants with just two
colors and of course one colors best of
all but you don't lose much of anything
and looking at three colors so what do
we find
well here's the yellow versus blueness
yellow of the top blue at the bottom the
yellow blueness of the colors they pick
to go with the slow medium and fast this
is in terms of the note rate and you can
see that increases as a function of no
grades and it also creates increases
more yellow colors for major and also
more yellow colors for the notes in the
higher register okay
and this shows you down here to the
multiple regression so you can account
for 74% of the yellow balloon us of the
colors that they pick to go with a given
piece of music just by looking at how
fast it is whether it's major minor and
whether it's in the upper or lower
register and similarly for light dark
different pattern here but same features
right major versus minor higher and
faster but much bigger differences
between them in terms of how light
versus dark the colors are the thing to
go with them
saturation again here there's a
different layer in mine are in a
difference between faster and slower but
there's no difference in the saturation
of the colors that they picked based
whether it's the higher lower register
so we're actually getting very sort of
well-articulated results in this
incredibly flakey task in terms of
what's the nature of the mapping between
colors and music where certain
dimensions show up in certain kinds of
color dimension certain musical
dimensions show up and down in others
and reg mean basically this kind of
nothing much going on there again like
before so so we're getting a replication
in which we're showing now that it's not
all of those other things it really is
the speed and particular the note rate
that matters and whether it's in major
or minor mode also matters for some
color dimensions whether it's a higher
or lower register but not for all color
dimensions so we've replicated our
result with much better controlled
stimuli and and now we can go back and
look at those correlations because we
can do the same thing we did before
because we got people to make ratings
for each color and each musical piece
and I think this was done Thomas wasn't
yeah so we rated they had them have a
rate you know each of the pieces of
music in terms of its emotional content
that we correlated them and then we got
this multi-dimensional scaling which is
ridiculously ridiculously regular so you
can see what we've got over here we've
got the minor stuff or the Blues the
major ones or the Reds
okay and then this other dimension is a
combination of speed slow versus fast
and also a low versus high register so
minor slow low - low high minor medium
below and there's two of these and then
there there's the high registers and so
forth very very regular systematic
mapping and we do the same kind of thing
with the colors and we get another
emotionals
multi-dimensional scaling of the colors
in terms of their emotion so this dark
colors are over here White's colors are
over here I enlarged desaturated ones
down here saturated ones up here and
these also map on to strong weak and
happy sad
same two emotional dimensions that we
got before so it is certain in a
conceptual sense it's a full complete
replication of what we did before with
very better much better controlled and
very different kinds of stimulate what
about those correlations okay so here
well you know the happy sadness of the
musical melodies and the happy sadness
of the colors people pick to go with
them and once again very high
correlations not quite as high but 19.8
now strong versus weak is down to only
only 63% of the variance but that makes
a lot of sense because I think a lot of
us strong weak kinds of emotional
content of music is going to be carried
by dynamics how loud is it how soft is
it and we've taken we've stripped all
that stuff out also probably tonal color
so one of the things eventually we want
to get to is to strike to sort of add
some of those things back in one of my
collaborators the future on this stuff
is Dan Levitan who's a music cognition
guy up at Toronto and he's actually got
data
we're gonna go has had McGill I'm sorry
yes where he has a piano playing full
piano pieces with emotional expression
and then they can morph out the dynamics
and and so forth and show that you get
less emotion so we can add them back in
in some sense and say well when you add
them back in just then that pump up the
correlation between strong weak and so
forth so that might hold for the note
rate versus the beat mm-hmm right so if
you play more expensively you can
emphasize the beat more yeah now we
don't know I have to say we don't know
at this point what people's perception
of the beat is we're going by what's
written so and when you start doing the
variations where the notes start coming
in faster rate it may be that people
start to think that it's a faster tempo
so you haven't done that yet as I say
this is very new data okay so so this
sort of view still seems to hold up that
we think people are evaluating the
emotional content of the music and
they're mapping it
the to the colors but of course this is
all correlational data maybe that's not
what it is maybe it's the other way
around maybe there's some you know other
other way of thinking about it but our
thinking was we could actually test the
theory that is that it's actually
mediated by emotion because that implies
that you could do the very same thing
with anything else that's got emotional
content that's got the same these
dimensions happy sad strong weak angry
so what we decided to do was to look at
color face associations and color
gesture associations because the faces I
mean there it was the same face and just
different emotional configurations no
this is just that okay yeah so that's
what gonna do yeah okay so these are the
faces view one male face one female face
these guys are the neutral ones then
there is a happy one the sad one the
angry one of the male and female and
then there was a morphed one in between
those we call 50% but it's not actually
didn't tell people say do a 50% smiling
um do the happy thing and then they
morph between that and the neutral and
the deal is that our subjects will be
looking at will each one of these faces
and then they'll be picking the colors
that go best with that face and they get
the same thing they get the face again
later and the ones that go worst with it
so we do the same set of tasks this is
the color face so it's the Asian task
get away the emotional content of the
colors the emotional content of the
faces we do the same analyses that we
did before I think I'm probably not
going to go through this in any detail
oops
but just show you actually there are
bars of a so you can see these things
are wildly significant people pick
lighter colors to go with the happier
faces and darker colors to go to the sad
and particularly the angry faces
saturation they pick highly saturated
colors for the happy faces and D
saturated colors for the sad
and cetera et cetera very robust
differences what we're really interested
in here is if we go then back and do the
correlations do we find the same kinds
of correlations okay so we're looking
now at the happy sadness of the face
versus the happy sadness I'm sorry the
angry calmness of the face versus the
angry colonists of the colors that
people pick to go with them the
correlations 0.93 and happy sad as 0.97
and we call this point 91 same thing so
I don't see how this could not be
mediated by emotion given that you do
get essentially the same result in the
sense when you're doing it with faces
that only differ in the emotional
content of the expression so we did one
more just to be well with gestures so
this was actually doing expressions
neutral angry happily sad and so forth
and we ask people to do the same task
pick the five best three best probably
in the three worst and again we get very
systematic differences just to go kind
of through it this is the color gesture
Association for how light versus dark
the colors are so the happy gestures get
light colors picked for it whereas the
angry disgusted and sad ones get dark
and so forth the high saturation for
happy more yellow for happy and so forth
but not everything not everything varies
but very sort of selectively selective
things vary and that varies quite
systematically and this is not with huge
numbers of subjects either you can do
this we can do these experiments with
like 15 to 20 subjects and get sensible
results and here then these emotional
correlations happy versus sad angry
disgusted all of them above 0.9 except
for calm they're just not too surprising
given it hasn't been a whole lot quite
as much content to it so I think that
this pretty much nails down the one
thing we haven't done yet
it implies that you don't have any
colors so far we've only don't done
things with colors we should be able to
Matt have people play the music for the
people and have them pick the face that
goes with the music right or the
gestures music any pair of dimensions I
mean in so the general acclaim the
general claim which I firmly believe is
that any pair of cross modal domains
that have common emotional content can
be mapped into each other in very
regular ways at least within you know us
culture problems but we'll get I mean I
wish I had dated yeah but actually
asking probably for some more money for
guys to help us extend this give this
stuff but but I want to I want to talk
about this last thing which is this
preference for harmony individual
differences in terms of preference for
harmony we started out with color and
then and has morphed into music and a
bunch of other things
the initial experiments in addition to
study people's preferences for
individual colors carriage sloths and I
did experiments looking at how much
people like pairs of colors there's a
there's a paper out in attention
perception and performance about this
this past year so we've got for each
subject they would like this pair of
colors but we've also got them to make
references of what we called harmony and
we said okay also rate how harmonious
these colors are and and of course
support this harmony mean we say well
how well do these colors go together now
we did tell them one more thing we said
it doesn't necessarily mean the same
thing as how much you like them it's
like in music and music everyone would
agree that Mozart or almost everyone
would agree that Mozart is more
harmonious than Stravinsky some people
like Mozart some people like to convince
key people get it I mean they seem to
understand that because they don't
necessarily give us the same range for
harmony as they do for color and we're
going to see
there was a very systematic in
particularly I think surprising ways so
when we did these this particular
experiment for color pairs this is what
the data looked like for just for the
color parents when their people are
reading how much they like the color
pairs okay so this corresponds to the
color of the little square in the center
the figural color and this color
corresponds the different curves color
correspond to the color of the ground on
the ground this is averaged over those
cuts but one of the things that you
notice right off the bat is a very
complex data in some sense but there's a
very strong regularity in that people
like the blue figures to be on blue
grounds and the chartreuse figures to be
on short Roose Browns more than the
other ones there's this gradient along
the hue dimension away from the same hue
but they like the colors that have the
same hues best okay very strong you can
actually account for what does it say
it's about 62% on this one so these are
the day data for people's ratings of how
harmonious the color pairs are and
notice you get exactly the same thing
but it's like it's been amplified right
the data are very much more systematic
across individuals for how harmonious
the colors are then therefore how much
they like the colors which is what you
would expect
it's like saying most people believe
that Mozart is more harmonious than
Stravinsky but some people like both
start some people like to divinsky
there's more agreement in terms of these
ratings of harmony and that's just
pointing out what it showed you before
and the correlation between the harmony
data and the preference data is 0.79
that's very very very high okay and you
might think that means what everybody
likes how I use colors but that's not
true we didn't believe that this just
shows you what the data look like for
this is 992 this is plotting the average
harmony rating for each of these color
combinations against the average
preference ratings you can see the
correlation that and you
also see what really matters they like
the cool colors the blues and purples
and things are up here the reds and
oranges are down here they're less
harmonious they're also less preferred
and the higher contrast things tend to
be higher up so these guys are not
terribly different colors but there's
nice contrast there these are more
preferred colors but there's less
contrast there anyway that's that's sort
of the interesting thing and the work
that I've been doing with well Griscom
who's gonna raise his hand now yes is
looking at this across different domains
and across different people the idea
being it turns out I mean you know I'm a
gestalt psychologists and I had already
when I started doing this work on
aesthetics and color and so forth I've
already done a bunch of work on people's
perception of complexity and shapes and
a bunch of different things all of which
it seemed like well everybody has
preferences and almost everything and
then on all these different domains
there is this other dimension which was
sort of how simple how regular how
harmonious how well do things go
together just related to some of my
interest in grouping that that Peter
mentioned before so we wanted to look
and see whether this preference for
harmony as we call it held up across
individuals because of course we can do
for each of the Vigilant what I showed
you before look at the correlation
between their rating of each of the 992
colored pairs in terms of how much they
liked it versus how harmonious they
think it is and when you do that then
you find out that there's a huge range
of preference for harmony across
individuals this is the number of people
whose correlations fell in each of these
bins interestingly even the person the
one person that the highest correlation
is has a lower correlation than the
giftee what's happening here is that
there's basically at least in terms of
this talk there's kind of two components
to the preference stuff one of which is
based on something that sort of
everybody shares which is there
you know reaction harmony and then
there's a lot of other idiosyncratic
things that happen that sort of reduce
that correlation when you average across
people you're averaging it out those
idiosyncratic variations and the signal
that remains is really the one that's
driven primarily by how harmonious the
colors are this just shows you a few
just Ramona's car color combinations and
a few harmonious was so actually Karen
and I looked at this variation trying to
understand it and the thing that sort of
came out as being most relevant and most
robust was a relationship between
people's preference for harmony and the
amount of training that they'd had in
color theory because we remember this is
a group thing this particular group
included a bunch of painters and graphic
artists and interior designers and so
forth and so we broke it down in terms
of this sort of five-point scale in
terms of the amount of formal color
training and you get this curvilinear
relationship where people have virtually
no training have only a very weak
preference for harmony people have a
moderate amount actually have a pretty
substantial preference for harmony but
the people who have the most training
actually have a much reduced preference
for harming them notice there's
different numbers of subjects but it
gives you the idea that there's maybe a
relationship between this preference for
harmony measurement and the amount of
training people have in a given field
but the real question I don't have time
at me real question is whether this is a
sort of stable trait of a person traits
may be the wrong word a stable aspect of
a person something that we might call
the part of their aesthetic style where
if you say like harmonious colors maybe
you like Mozart better than Stravinsky
maybe you like simple regular figures
and these are these are the four
different domains and
thanks slide in addition to asking about
how much you like different colored
musicians or positions they actually you
can ask about this other dimension which
we're calling a harmony generically cuz
it sounds nice and you actually call it
harmony and color and you call it
harmony and music in this these patterns
you typically call a figural goodness
that's a translation of German word
thought psychologist news that's related
to simplicity and in spatial composition
I'll show you the tasks that we use and
we call goodness-of-fit that's those are
the words that we use to get people to
rate these other dimensions and so those
are the four domains so with the very
same set of subjects we have them do
color harmony tasks as well as a color
preference task with pairs of colors
spatial fit the spatial fit task is
there's a single dock inside of a
rectangle it could be at any one of 35
different positions we asked them to say
in addition to how much you like the
position of that dog within the frame
how well does it fit within the frame
okay and the reason for this is because
we're also doing work research on
spatial composition of images and we
find a lot of interesting regularities
there it seems to be related to this
kind of measure we also use these dot
patterns that were developed by a guy
named Michael Gartner ones that have low
low figural goodness that is are
asymmetrical versus ones that are
symmetrical and also musical harmony so
there are 14 different piano clips
this is not quite as loud you hear it
it doesn't come simpler than that that's
like a kid's exercise right hello oh
well you have to hear this so this is
the other end of the scale oh it's
shurberg and it sounds absolutely here
it is but for some reason it's not not
so hard
okay so and what we've got looks we've
got over here on the right-hand side
then is so the we've done here is the
average correlation and then the range
of correlations the average correlation
for these these were undergraduates
between the harmonious nough so the
color pairs and how much they liked them
with twenty nine six very high but the
range was from point four two point nine
four for these dots within the frame the
overall correlations 0.94 but the range
was from 0.09 two point eight three
still all positive these are all
positive here for the figure of goodness
we actually find a lower correlation and
we find that some of you go negative
some people actually like systematically
the less harmonious ones and for the
musical harmony correlation of point
nine seven again all them are positive
but there's this substantial range and
the question is are these things
systematic across domains are the people
who like the most harmonious color
combinations the one who like the more
harmonious kinds of music so what will
and I did then was to compute for each
of these pairs of domains and difference
between their preference and harmony
ratings in that domain and then look at
how how well those correlated across
pairs so this is the color task versus
the frame task of hanging the
correlation is point four color versus
shape it's point five five color versus
music its 0.65 it's crazy high I mean
for a task like this this is in some
ways even crazier than the experiments
that I told you before it to get a
correlation that that's high when
typically individual difference
correlations you know they tend to get
excited when it's about 0.3 right so
they these are all positive and all of
our significant
point a one or ledbetter level except
for the seems to be something systematic
about this and moreover it does seem to
be modulated by people's the kind of
training that people get so in this
experiment subjects that were drawn from
three different majors psychology music
and art and then we looked at this is
the average correlation the average
preference for harmony correlation for
the different subjects of what you see
is that for the psychology subjects its
highest for the psychology subjects in
each domain
I remember preference for harmony is
something that's going to tend to
decrease well it's got this curvilinear
relationship but so you don't know
exactly where people are but from this
data but the people who are sort of an
expert in a given domain should have
lower preference for harmony and that's
exactly what you find so the art
students have lowest preference for
harmony among the three groups in all
three of these different tasks that are
related to sort of visual aesthetics and
the music students have the lowest
preference for harmony and music and in
each case the quality sort of artistic
group in the other domain is
intermediate between the two so there's
the art students the music and
psychology or music psychology on music
psychology and here is music art
psychology so we don't know quite why
there's clearly training effects we
don't know exactly why we're getting
this pattern it might be that there's
just sort of self so much the people who
tend to go into the arts in general tend
to have an aesthetic sky where they tend
to like things that are less harmonious
more interesting and so forth it might
be that or it might be that they get a
certain amount or more
cross-disciplinary
interaction and they actually you know
are more likely to go to an art museum
if you're a musician or more likely to
go to a concert if you're a visual
artist or something like that we we
can't really parcel that stuff out yet
but we're working on models to try to
understand the the underlying structure
of these data in terms
of different factors there seems to be
clear evidence that there's a general
factor of preference for harmony that
that goes through these things it
actually explains a very old data by a
guy named eysenck who claimed that there
was a general factor that he called good
taste and really what that amounts to is
somebody who has good taste is somebody
who likes the harmonious stuff because
when you haven't across everybody that's
the signal that comes out right and that
obviously it's not the world's greatest
conclusion but in any case so just this
morning right before I can I just
thought I should write down a few of the
kinds of directions that we're going
with this one of them obviously is we're
going to look across cultural studies of
music and we actually have some data
from Mexico on the classical music but
the other thing we want to do which is
much more interesting is to try to look
at cultural socially specific music so
you have a lot of music and and mariachi
bands in Mexico and brass bands in
Serbia and so forth we have
collaborations in the color project with
all of those places also Japanese
collaborators and so forth so we have a
kind of naturally set up thing where we
can look at some of these things both
with classical music and with these
other kinds of music one thing I
mentioned during the talk we've got you
know you strip it down to just a single
line of piano music and you can find
certain you can find these relationships
between music we want to sort of start
adding some of those things back in and
back in dynamics and harmonic mode to go
back toward and also tonal color look at
difference between the same thing being
played on piano versus cello versus
clarinet ends and so forth we want to
look at other kinds of visual domains so
we in particular in my mind I mean one
of the sort of images is like Fantasia
right you take music and you want to
create a visual display that
seems to be the go with this music that
and and we've already looked at some of
the things that influence that and we're
doing other things we've done stuff with
line shape already we're doing some
stuff with textures and so forth and we
want to get into motion if we can and
that's a dot dot dot there's all kinds
of other stuff there as well an
extension to color combinations this is
something that will is working on so if
you look at not single colors which is
what we've looked at so far but
combinations of colors pairs or Mondrian
of different color things and what about
how does that map want to say consonants
dissonance in music so if you've got an
interval that's a major second versus a
minor third versus a major fifth or
whatever do you get the kinds of
expected relationships between color and
musicals of structure there and and so
forth and this this thing that started
out is one little class project has now
exploded into this you know
multinational collaboration with other
people doing color and music and so
finally I just want to say thank you to
everybody that's been working in the
music project and to our sponsors which
I have to say before NSF and Google
we're interested in this thing our
actual main sponsor for the initial
subject for the initial studies was
Amy's natural folks who made our
subjects with coupons for frozen pizzas
from they're pretty darn good and I will
be forever indebted to them for having
funded the early stages of this project
all you do salts are very fascinating
but the thing that that I found most
interesting which you haven't really
talked about is the fact that you've got
this correlation in yellow blue space
but you don't have it in red and green
space and the only reason I come up with
for why that might be is because the
blue yellow portion of our visual system
evolved first and might be somehow
evolutionary related to the emotions as
well and I was learning what kind of
experiment you could possibly run to get
at so this thing this is the question is
why are those associations between
colors and emotions there and you
mentioned yeah there could be some
biologically these things sort of
hardwired into our system because yellow
is an older piece of the visual system
than the red green piece I tend not to
believe that I tend toward much more
ecological explanations when I started
out I talked about this color preference
work we've done where we looked at you
know yellow red green in terms of you
know early visual connections and stuff
like that and that does not account for
the data nearly as well as these
associations people have between objects
and colors and now they're it makes
there's a really appealing ecological
story there that what you want in
preferences as you want a steering
mechanism for an organism you want the
Preferences that the organism has to
lead them toward good stuff and away
from bad stuff so in taste for example
we like sweet fatty tasting things which
tend to have a lot of calories in them
and are therefore good for you know
surviving and reproducing and and we
tend not to like bitter and sour things
which are more likely to be toxic or
poisonous so the taste system presumably
is evolved because of these correlations
between certain kinds of tastes and
what's good for you and certain kinds of
tastes a little bad for you and that
comes out in the color the color data
that's the way we test it it turns out
that the blue stuff
the cool colors stuff when you ask
people of the list all the objects that
are that color and then you have another
subjects comment you just read how much
do you like clear sky you don't show
many pictures you know there's nothing
colored about it you know that actually
predicts almost all of the variants in
the group data so I think that an
ecological explanation is more likely to
be the case that it probably has
something to do with yellow the Sun
being yellow and the Sun is warm and so
I like that it's a warm thing I don't
think that it's probably an angry I
agree for example I showed you the data
for angry it's really a sort of general
generalization grading away from one
color away from from red so I think it's
really related to ecological salience of
somebody's face being read and and blood
and things like that that's related to
anger not to you know early versus late
biological systems that's my hypothesis
we don't yet have a terribly compelling
evidence for it but the question is
really important that why do we have
these associations between emotions and
and colors it's not so much specifically
just about blue versus yellow shows up
and using in red versus green doesn't
because there's other kinds of emotional
stuff that does show up for red versus
green like anger they're not emotional
colors it's just that they're not
emotions that seem to show up that much
in trying to understand the significance
of emotion here so in your talk you have
shown that emotion is a good subspace
come out post facto like empirical
evidence or do you have a hunch that
emotion in space we had we had to have
had a hunch because we did the
experiment with the same subjects we
designed this huge study with 32
different tasks you not only had them
picking the you the colors that went but
the music we also had them rating
music in terms of he's emotional domains
so yes we had we had a hunch I'm not my
guess is that most hunches I guess my
guess is that it came from introspection
and intuition about what might be going
on to choose that the Subspace for color
and I mean why emotion it could be
something yeah yeah I think it wasn't be
trying all possibilities and this is why
what showed up is because that seems to
be the driving factor when we did the
task and and seemed to be something
systematic in the data there were
previous versions like I said that
actual first experiment was a tweak and
a much better done version of a class
project that was done in my color
seminar before we actually knew how to
analyze the data and things like that
you could already could see that there
seemed to be something systematic about
the colorism and the music in terms of
emotion but yeah so it's a combination
of the two yeah be interesting if you
could go back in time for years and do
these experiments and I suspect your
graphs might change in the interesting
ways like in my 70s when people
preferred the poot colors like the
oranges and the brown
okay so there's lots of interesting
there's a lot of interesting things to
say about that
the larger question is you know how much
does the culture influence our
preference is and how much isn't any we
don't know the answer about culture for
for the color music associations
actually having data yet we do know
something about cultural influences and
historical influences on on color
preferences so culturally speaking I
can't really explain this very well
without having given the talk about
color preferences because there's a
particular way that we we compute these
numbers based on people's ratings of how
much they like all of these objects all
these colored objects but you can do the
same procedure in the US
get do that procedure we call it the
wave the weighted effect of valence
estimate you can do the wave in America
and you can get American preferences you
can do the wave in Japan and get
Japanese preferences and then the
prediction is that the American wave
should correlate higher with the
American preferences than the Japanese
preferences and Japanese wave should
correlate higher with the Japanese
preferences with the American
preferences and that's true we actually
even have data showing the similar kind
of thing in terms of individual
differences if you take a whole bunch of
people and you do a hierarchical
clustering and you look at your because
the data on this is very noisy at Indian
individual level if you get the two
largest groups of subjects that have
been clustered based on liking similar
kinds of colors and then you do this
wave procedure you find the same thing
that the wave for group 1 predicts group
once data better than grave twos and
vice-versa so so there are variations
and they do seem to be across cultures
and across individuals and at least in
the case of color preferences they do
seem to be consistent with this
ecological story I'm telling because no
I mean I may love broccoli you may hate
broccoli you might like dislike all
green vegetables well the prediction is
that then you know your preference for
green is going to be lower than it would
be otherwise you know there were a you
prime that you know had the same other
things but liked all the green
vegetables that persons would like me
better than you do I can't do that
experiment but but various related
things that we can do it have started to
do and do seem to be panning out
historically we're doing an experiment
we haven't gotten the full set of data
yet but we're looking at the same
people's color preferences four times
during the year summer fall winter
spring not here
where there is a difference and we are
getting systematic differences now we
have analyzed two data yet so I can't
say exactly what they are but but the
most interesting I think and story about
historical things this is there's
actually a historian French historian
who's done an analysis of the color blue
historically from you know ancient times
to the present and the interesting thing
that he discovered is that in ancient
Rome that blue was the least favorite
color I mean if you look at our data for
US Britain Mexico Japan Serbia and India
blue is the favorite color in all of it
okay and you think well you know
everybody look how could how could you
have a culture in which blue is not the
favorite color right and here it is it's
a least favorite color according to its
uses in the culture and bla bla bla bla
bla
well it turns out the probable reason is
that the two main enemies of ancient
Rome were the cells and the north and
somebody in the east both of whom had
for which blue is a favorite color the
cells even painted their faces and
bodies blue when they went into battle
or Salonika so it's a matter of it's
still an ecological story it's like you
know I hate the cell - the cells love
blue
therefore I hate blue we've actually
studied that very issue in color
preferences with not the cells in the
and romans but with Stanford and
Berkeley and what we showed is that
Berkeley students like blue and gold
better on average than Stanford students
do and Stanford students my friend white
better on average than Berkeley students
do and four pairs of colors blue and
yellow or yellow and blue and red white
and so forth the differences are
astronomical and moreover we show that
the there's a strong positive
correlation around 0.5 between a
person's self rated school spirit and
how much more they like their own
school of colors than the other schools
colors so there's their the the objects
that are in the mix for determining how
much you like colors are not just
physical objects but there are social
objects as well and the idea is that if
you positively invested in a social
institution that strongly associated
with a particular color in case of
Google it's a lot of colors primary
colors in particular and so forth then
you're gonna tend to like those colors
more so you can you tease apart the
liking versus just familiarity that's a
lot tougher yeah in some of the cases I
mean like it turns out there's also a
symmetries in terms of spatial
organization so people like yellow
against blue and that does not seem to
be well it doesn't seem to be driven by
the Berkeley you know preference thing
because we find the same data and other
cultures but we do think it's
ecologically driven in other words we're
doing experiment I think it's actually
because of the Sun against the blue sky
I think it's a generalization of that
people don't know that that's what's
doing it if you actually instead of
making a square on a square if you make
it a circle on a rectangle where it
looks like a picture of a Sun that you
get a bigger effect then and a bunch of
other things like that so we're
interested in these things and there are
trends that take place in cultures some
of them are sort of determined by
perpetuating it's not the right word is
self-fulfilling prophecies there are
companies there are companies that do
that prophesy what the colors that are
gonna be you know in fashion what do
they do when they come up with these
colors karinch lost my collaborator work
for one they come up with these pallets
of colors that are gonna be the next big
thing and then they sell them to the
industry but there certainly are these
trends you know avocado used to be a big
thing back in the 70
kitchen and avocado and and it went away
for a while but it's back now and wasabi
I mean it's a brighter green but it's
still yellow green which is the least
preferred cue least preferred color
because it that belongs to these sort of
fecal colors yucky food that I the dark
yellows and oranges but yeah so there
are these sort of historical trends some
of which are driven by these industries
others of which may be other things I
don't know we're gonna do a study in
Germany where we got endurance have this
interesting flag with black and yellow
and red in it and in a town that's right
next to a u.s. army base where I think
the relationship between the town and
the army base is not so great army guys
really they should like those young
fellows those are the compass of all of
their uniforms so we're gonna look at
the people's preferences for colors as a
function of whether they live in the
town or in the army and they're
self-rated you know spirit for the army
or attitude toward the US and things
like that
music is performed in the funny way or
it's performed with really really
irritating mistress you know swing
pieces of metal so as a temporal thing
so you force it
and we haven't looked I mean I shouldn't
say we have a look we have looked and
haven't found systemic relationships
three people's preferences for the
colors and their preferences for the
music and what real hard at that but
it's clearly something that we can do
but I think when you start getting into
stuff like irritating this things like
that that you might find preferences
starting to map over we haven't found it
yet and there it's much more complicated
because where's people's preferences or
listen to some of the early early early
instruments recordings I think the one
example you gave personally reader plane
clip of music and talked about which
colors you thought would go with it as
an example I was was gonna the first
thing that I heard were the horns and
you picked the color of the horns you
said it's bright yellow and I'm thinking
out of all the ones on the thing that
make me think of what a trumpet looks
like I have no idea if this is yeah
everything seems to matter and you've
got all sorts of associations in your
head and it might be that something like
that actually comes through now it's
also true that that forms in particular
tend to have a bright sound red and
yellow is the brightest you and and so
forth
I don't know we'd have to you have to
look and see I mean clarinets or black I
didn't see a lot of colors up there I
don't I guess I was trying to ask do you
think that the correlation between like
so maybe trumpets look at that color and
sound brighter and are used for loud and
vibrant and have a happy feel does that
contribute to yellow being a happy color
does it is it coincidence like what
you're well we have our XA we have done
some sort of pilot data trying to get
people to
to do this ecological valent kind of
thing with colors so instead of having
them they one of the things that they do
is they see a color and they say oh the
names of all the things that are they
can think of that are that color
description size right right banana
noonday Sun urine no no no and then we
have people rate their preference for
those things in the preference version
of the wave we have tried asking people
then to make ratings of each of those
objects in terms of how happy versus sad
is it how lively dreary you know these
kinds of emotional reactions sort of
things and it doesn't do nearly as well
but the data when you look at the
emotion data there's a lot of them that
seem to be so strongly driven by
particular by particular associations
like the thing angry so it's dark and
saturated red it falls off we're the
lighter and more muted Reds and it falls
off as a function of difference from red
remember this is a circular dimension so
purple as a reddish quality actually
wraps around right so you can really
account for almost all of the variants
of this just in terms of the distance
between this one very very salient
example like you know blood which Co
determines the face that gets red when
you're angry and you know the result of
anger and things like that and a lot of
these other ones are similar to that
column with blue and courageous also
with red and so forth so I have a
feeling that there is a story to be told
that's based on associations but it's
probably primarily driven by a few very
salient examples that's my guess
I'm a friend who has so so I wonder is
this what happens when you start looking
at that we have and are those others
effects which seem far more arbitrary to
me in fact currently so we've actually
done this task not with numbers but with
alphanumeric characters we include
numbers right other studies that
actually look at comparing different
synesthetes and whether or not they have
the same associations and it looks to be
pretty idiosyncratic but there are
statistical regularities is davia david
eagleman yes even eagle huge database on
the computer if you like google
synesthesia we did a similar experiment
to the ones that I told you about where
we show people the out single
alphanumeric characters and have them
pick the three colors that go best with
that that letter and so forth and there
are non-random relationships between the
beta they tend to be like I said there's
an you think about in terms of an
idiosyncratic component and some sort of
more systematic component so there is a
statistical Tennessee minimum among
those things for example for B to be
preferentially blue or G to be
preferentially green because the word
begins with and those sorts of things
seem to come out to some degree in the
normal population as well I mean if you
want to if you send me an S at gmail.com
I can send you the poster that's about
that they're not hugely compelling data
but there are relationships there let me
stop now and feed these guys some lunch
and
rescued my whole joint if you want okay
