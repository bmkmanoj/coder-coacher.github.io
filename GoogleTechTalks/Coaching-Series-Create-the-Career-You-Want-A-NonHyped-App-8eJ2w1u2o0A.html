that in our society we grow up with this
paradigm that you go to school and you
do well so you go to more school and do
a little bit better and keep on going
and then you graduate from somewhere and
you're done and your parents are happy
because you've been launched and
everything else will take care of itself
and coaching is based on the idea that
learning doesn't really stop that there
are different points in your life where
the need to learn and to figure things
out presents itself again and since
there are limited types of formal
arrangements or the ones that do exist
are extremely costly and time intensive
like a ph.d program for example or a
three-month training coaching tries to
step in and as it's understand now
coaching is what I would call an inquiry
based method of awareness taking action
and being accountable so good coaches
ask a lot of questions as opposed to
giving advice presumably good coaches
have enough professional credibility
that we can ask the right questions and
when Google was figuring out who they
would bring into their coaching program
they went through a lot of people and
wanted to get a certain level of
professional credibility so that that's
what this is all about and what I do a
lot of is career coaching and executive
coaching and that simply means working
with people on their careers and one
thing I've learned is that nearly
everybody in the world is obsessed with
their careers so when I started coaching
a few years ago I had some questions for
myself it was somewhat of a departure
from the other things I'd done there was
a part of me that sought and received a
certain amount of validation through
institutions and education and so forth
I'd have a number of different careers
before I was in the Foreign Service I
was an attorney I went to business
school etc they've satisfied those parts
of me but then I went into coaching and
I remember when I started this wondering
could I really call myself a coach and
so was it enough for me what I feel a
little bit weird and one summer I
experimented during the month of July
with each day having a different sort of
story about myself all of which were
true but which brought out different
details and so I'd stressed different
elements of my background that I thought
might be important but ultimately when I
just said well I'm a career coach and
basically I work with people
on their careers and where they want to
go all of a sudden everybody was
interested you know everyone talked to
me in airplanes across the world it
doesn't really matter where you go
careers are meaningful because careers
are how we spend a large part of our
lives and it's how we show up as human
beings and we might not want to define
ourselves through careers but the fact
is is that there's nothing else that we
do for so many hours a day that
accompanies us through the rest of the
life so that's why career coaching can
actually be a very rich way of
exploration and the other thing I would
say about it is that generally speaking
there aren't that many clear paradigms
about how to run your career you may
have a certain amount of information or
opinions by your parents my guess is
that it's has very limited value and
you're out in the world and trying to
figure things out so that's where this
comes in and I constructed today's topic
for some very specific reasons so the
first part is create the career you want
the reasons why I said create the career
you want is that careers are
fundamentally individual they are not
collective so everybody knows that
people who come to Google have a certain
set of attributes achievements in
certain realms and you have that in
common but ultimately your experience is
unique in its individual so if you take
any sort of work setting when people
love their jobs they tend to love them
for somewhat different reasons and when
they hate their jobs they tend to hate
them for different reasons
so creating a career you want is a lot
about getting to what motivates you as
an individual and figuring out how it's
going to work the other aspect of this
is that you're probably better off
trying to make it happen yourself or
having a vision of how it's going to
happen rather than sort of expecting it
to land at your feet that sometimes
happens some people really luck out they
end up in a job they like they might
have great supervisors they may have a
very clear sense of what they're all
about and other people that doesn't
really happen that way and it's somewhat
randomly distributed so the more you
sort of find a way to take ownership of
it the better off you are so that's a
creative part and I'm going to introduce
in a few moments before
basic principle aside I would would want
you to have to manage this process the
second aspect an on hyped part so I
don't even though my comparative
advantage as a coach is to have a
certain type of knowledge that other
people don't have so that companies like
Google hire me and maintain my senator
living in a place like New York even
though that's true in fact there aren't
really any huge secrets about how
careers develop so nothing in this hour
or so is going to dramatically change
your life it might give you a few ideas
to work with but Career Development is
really all about the practice the theory
is easy you can absorb it in in ten
minutes but it's a practice that is more
complicated that takes time and that
ultimately reaps the rewards
so the non-high part is I will share
with you what I have learned over the
past couple decades both in my own
career in working with people from a lot
of different industries ranging from
tech to law to hedge funds to banking to
journalism to nonprofit and so forth but
ultimately it's not going to be it might
be somewhat insightful but don't expect
to be a huge secret cache of information
because that's not really how it works
and the final thing is for thoughtful
professionals so not everybody is really
all that thought all about their career
included smart people not everybody
really cares that much about their
career some people are happy to just do
their job and move forward or sort of do
what other people think is appropriate
such as their parents or cult
colleagues but the real element of being
thoughtful is to be open minded to have
what Buddhists would call a beginner's
mind and the closest the most important
manifestation of that is to consider the
possibilities that who you are now may
not be everything you're capable of that
the things you think you should like may
not actually be the things that you like
and that there may be whole aspects of
work or life that you haven't really
thought of that actually can be quite
exciting and that's where the
thoughtfulness part comes in it's it's
just being open to alternatives and when
you work at a place at Google it's a
little bit of a double-edged sword
because it
great and famous and give a nice
cafeteria and you know it's cool and
everything but it also lends people to
think that you're in Nirvana and you may
be in Nirvana or you might be a couple
levels below it but ultimately your own
satisfaction is going to come from
matching your own interests to your
career as opposed to just stepping in
something so that's just sort of the
warm-up and normally when I do workshops
I make them quite interactive so there
are lots of exercises whether people
expect it or not and lots of interaction
and I'm going to tone that down today
because I don't want to scare anybody
and also this is my first opportunity to
have the millions on YouTube see me and
I don't think they'll like that much
just walking watching a roomful of
people talking but I am going to depart
for about 90 seconds here because to be
thinking about it and I want each of you
to sort of turn to somebody near you say
hi and and talk about how you would like
to grow in the next year or two
it's how you'd like to grow right so
take 90 seconds and those of you on
YouTube just be patient we'll get back
to the main event would anybody care to
share anything they talked about how
they would like to grow how many of you
weren't sure about to say for that okay
how many of you had a definite idea how
many of you had a few hypotheses okay so
about evenly split and the reason I
asked that question is that that's what
it really is about it's how you want to
grow and how you want to allow your
career to reflect that and the more you
can articulate hypotheses about it
whether or not you believe that you
really want them where they'll come true
the more likely you are to be able to
make it happen and take stewardship with
your career so I heard two four basic
principles and I'll tell you what they
are and then I'm going to tell you a bit
more about each one of them and we might
do a couple of not so interactive but
still helpful exercises to flesh out
what I mean so I would say there are
four aspects that are key to
really creating the career you want over
a long period of time and none of these
actually has a whole lot to do with
doing your actual job but they're the
underpinnings of having a meaningful
career and I'll explain each of them in
turn
the first one is values values is a lot
about what do you like and what are you
like and matching that to your job
second one is vision vision is what do I
want to create and oftentimes we might
not be sure of what this is third one is
relationships so relationships are all
about whom do I want to learn from whom
do I want to learn from and the fourth
one is experiments and that is how do I
figure it all out because the first
three are somewhat inert by themselves
they're not actually going to tell you
what the ultimate equation is for you
but it's experimentation that sort of
brings it all together so I'll talk
about each of these in turn and we'll do
a little bit of work with them so values
values is something coaches talk about a
lot and values in a coaching sense does
not mean ethics it doesn't mean morals
it doesn't have anything to do with what
you should do it's just what you
actually like in your life things that
you find appealing so some examples of
values might be creativity teamwork
autonomy financial rewards working with
others working alone working on complex
problems writing editing what-have-you
there's really a very long list and if
you happen to get my recently published
book the creative lawyer applicable to
almost any professional you can find
some examples but values are really all
the things that essentially make life
worth living so challenge children
communication physical fitness health
winning success mastery international
travel whatever there's a huge number of
them
I use and virtually any coach would say
that if you are happy in your life and
work if you feel relatively fulfilled
awake alive it's probably because you're
living a life and have a job where
you're able to manifest those values so
if creativity is important to you're
able to be creative if having time alone
is important to you you are not in the
middle of a trading floor with everybody
messing with you all day long and by
contrast if you've spent a lot of time
feeling frustrated angry trapped boxed
in you're probably not living in sync
with your values there's something about
who you are as an individual that can't
be expressed so a lot of coaching really
focuses on how do you create the
conditions where you can be more
yourself in whatever you choose to do
and it may be creating that mix within
the job that's what I would do with my
clients and executive coaching type
things it may be finding opportunities
outside your job to manifest these and
it may also be sometimes changing jobs
or careers towards something that is
much more appealing to you the thing
about values to keep in mind is that
they really do differ by individuals and
different individuals feel different
values in the same thing so let's take a
place like Google let's say you're an
engineer and you're on a project team
and you love your life and job my hunch
is that people will actually love
different aspects about it so some
people might like the creativity of
devising new solutions and mastering the
information universe for the next 50
years other people might like working in
a really nice office that's conveniently
located to their Tribeca apartment just
a few subway hops and has a nice salary
you know nothing wrong with it other
people might like the excitement of
being part of something new
others might have a boss that they
really like others might like the
solitude of not being bugged by a boss
so there are really different aspects of
it for different people
similarly you can express values in
different aspects of your life so let's
say that let's say the part of you
really wants to make a significant
contribution
to the world as a whole there are
different ways that that different
individuals might do this so one person
might view making a contribution as
participating in the development of new
products at Google because it's having a
large effect on the rest of the world
other people might choose to do
something within Google creating an
employee collection for Darfur or some
similar cause others might do something
completely outside of Google to show
that they want to make a contribution so
they might become involved in let's say
one of the campaign's of a political
candidate these are the same value but
individuals who will have different ways
of expressing them so in a nutshell a
lot of what coaching does is try to
connect first identify what your values
are and then find specific ways of
manifesting them and again we don't want
to be too reductive so it's easy to fall
into the temptation of thinking that it
all has to happen in the job sometimes
it happens in the way that you do your
job and sometimes it occurs outside of
the job in your own life so then the
question comes up well how do I actually
know what my values are and as I said
before these are almost the the
underpinnings of what you do and it's
really not that hard there are a lot of
different exercises you can do you can
kind of get any sort of coaching book
and it will lead some through but it's
really sort of asking yourself questions
of what is it I like about the things
that I like when I'm really the most me
what types of things that I'm doing to
put another way when do I really like
being me so I have a little quiz that
can can help you discover some of these
so I'm going to ask you about ten
questions and you can either write this
down or answer them mentally don't so
much worry about the questions it's more
the answers that are sticking up again
all right so question one what parts of
the newspaper do you read
first or for the younger kids what
bookmarks you have on your computer
trying to keep in touch number two what
are three books you've read in the last
year three books you've read the last
year
number three as a child what did you do
in your free time as a child what did
you do in your free time number four
what's a life you haven't lived so
you're here but what else could you have
been or still want to be number five
what types of activities energize you
what gets you excited number six what do
you like to be in charge of so it could
be a project an activity something
outside of work and one of my favorite
questions what famous people intrigue
you and why so if you look at the
answers to questions like this you
typically get a sense of what is really
significant to you and when you look at
your own job and think about the things
that really are enjoyable to you you can
extract more information about what your
core values are and the more you
understand what your core values are the
more you can create the conditions for
satisfaction so I think I'll leave it at
that and move on to the next category so
vision so vision is something everybody
talks about but in sort of weird ways so
I personally think that Americans are
very ambivalent about vision it's
considered ok if you want to do
something very businessí or athletic or
very specific and it's also ok when
you're a child people are always asking
you what you want to be when you grow up
but then when you grow up you're assumed
to have sort of solve the problem and
people are no longer so interested in
what you might want to be and sometimes
are somewhat threatened by the process
the vision is still really powerful
because when you create a vision of
something that you really want if
something that you want to create it
helps
to motivate you so it's one thing to
come into work every day plot ahead keep
working and move ahead gradually it's
another to have some sense of where you
want to be at two years or five years or
ten years down the line and these may be
professional endeavors
it could be starting a company it could
be getting rich it could be seeing the
world it could also be things like
having a child or making some
contribution to community whatever turns
you on vision is a little bit like a
muscle so the more you exercise it the
more likely you are to achieve these
things and in some ways it doesn't
actually matter if you achieve the
particular vision that you create so
much as giving you an opportunity to
focus your energy get other people
involved in what your interests are and
kind of keep moving forward so we won't
go into a lot of detail here but
typically one way that we could explore
creating vision is coming up with vision
statements so a vision statement is
basically a couple sentences or a
paragraph that describes you a sort of
alternative future version of you they
may be either highly related to where
you are now or even quite quite
different and sort of elaborating on
that and I will typically have clients
write these in the present tense but set
five or ten years in the future and the
idea isn't so much to focus on what's
realistic so much as to focus on what's
exciting so the first step I would say
for anybody is you just come up with
sort of a short list of things that are
intriguing to you whether or not that
makes sense
so a couple of examples are where might
you want to be in five or ten years VP
of engineering in a start-up Pilates
teacher elected official entrepreneur
living in Shanghai could be anything
don't worry so much about how realistic
they are and the next step is you create
a longer vision statement so I'll give
you two alternative examples here and
you'll notice as I as I say the
use that there's a lot of detail they
may not be hugely realistic but they
talk about what you're doing what it
feels like the types of experiences you
have so the first one is a sort of
googly one of my own invention set in
the future you don't have a set do you
guys have a location in Austin Texas oh
you do okay okay well so I'm a manager
engineer this is a future I'm a manager
of engineering at Google I recently
moved back to Austin Texas my hometown
to help build up our massive new newer
facility over the last several years
I've managed to develop both my
technical abilities as well as my
managerial skills I'm pretty good at
management people love working on my
team and I mentor several younger
engineers who are interested in
developing more people's skills on the
weekends I spend time at my eco cabin on
Lake Travis where I have developed my
own brand of heirloom tomatoes so
there's a work aspect there's a personal
aspect and it's fun and it's
forward-looking and you'll also notice
that within it is a sense of your
competency development so your
competences are really your skills your
knowledge certain traits and this is
actually part of vision and professional
development is sort of having a sense of
where you are now but also where you
want to be so you could be an individual
contributor now with little management
experience and you might get a hankering
for what management might be like and so
you're projecting it into the future
I'll give you a second example this is
sort of equally possible albeit not
seemingly directly related to what
anybody here is doing I'm a social
entrepreneur I run an innovative cool
organization that helps poor people in
developing countries move ahead in their
lives although the work is based
overseas mostly in southern Africa I
still live in the US my job is to do
strategy fundraising and operations I
use my Google management training to
give the organization efficient and
compliant with regulations I frequently
visit our projects overseas the work
involves lots of kids and teenagers so
there's lots of positive energy which I
love so again it's very much a
combination of the professional
direction but also what's personally
motivating and think about vision is
that first of all it's actually easier
to come up with several vision
statements than just one when you just
get to one people start getting a little
weird about it and thinking of reasons
why you can't really come true and is
what I really want I'm not actually sure
when you come up to four or five it
stimulates your creativity a lot more
the second thing is that once you
actually start daring to talk about it
with other people you find that you get
useful feedback not everybody will be
totally supportive but typically get a
lot of ideas so if you use the
relocating to Austin Lake Travis eco
cabin one you may end up getting
transferred it could also be that
somebody says oh you know there's
another company that's just starting up
in Austin that's looking for a VP of
engineering and you should talk to my
friend who's doing it or I happen to
have an eco cabin in Vermont and I'm
going to the annual corn festival and
come along with me so there are a lot of
different ways that the the kernels of
passion within your vision statement
might end up being developed in in other
areas so that's part two which is vision
part three is relationships and Miriam
and I I specifically use the word
relationships because the word
networking needs a serious rebranding
people are not so crazy about that word
and and for valid reasons so we're going
to talk about relationships so
relationships are a key part of work and
moving ahead and life satisfaction and
it sort of seems obvious but it's not
always so obvious particularly when
you're in kind of a brainy profession
and when you're largely motivate when
you're rewarded for your thinking
abilities and your abilities to be
almost in a technocrat as opposed to
managing or working on teams and this is
one thing that I actually think that
engineers and management consultants and
lawyers and bankers all tend to have in
common
along with academics is that people with
these backgrounds have grown up
being rewarded for using their brains
and getting the right answer and being
smart and accomplishing specific tasks
and so they tend to rest a lot of their
sense of self and their capabilities in
those abilities and then underestimate
the value that other people have in
launching their careers and having an
effect in fact people are deeply
connected to everything that we do and
the good way of thinking about it is
just reflect for a moment on one or two
people who had a critical effect in your
being here those sort of but for people
who you would not be here but for them
um but I could think of two for myself
number one the reason I'm here is that I
had a client who now works at Google who
passed my name on to somebody else who
then decided to look at my background
interview me so if I didn't know that
person I wouldn't be here and by the
same token it's possible that if he
didn't know me he wouldn't be here
either so there was a mutually positive
relationship there a second example is
mr. denike I'm mr. Ben like you're
watching me mr. Dyk was my high school
Speech and Debate coach at Valencia high
school in Placentia California and the
reason one of the reasons I can speak
here and not be totally freaked out and
have some level of basic comfort
enjoyment is that when I was in high
school I did a probably five or six
hundred practice speeches as part of
being in this competitive world and mr.
tonight my teacher would sort of listen
to every one of those speeches as well
as Drive me in my debate partner up and
down California and to Nevada and Utah
to these distant tournaments in his
Buick so those relationships have built
my career to a certain degree and so
have a thousand others and the same is
true of a lot of what you guys do
behind every individual success there
are other people relationships of course
have another huge effect in that
information and opportunities trans tend
to be transfer transferred through
personal networks so there there's a
sort of weird saying that's a little bit
true but not entirely true and that's
it's not what you know it's who you know
um that's overstated rarely will that
actually help you unless you're in an
extremely nepotistic culture but the
element of truth is that it's hard to
evaluate people if you haven't been
given an opportunity to first be seen as
an individual and further that even
though we imagine that we live in a sort
of meritocratic world where information
travels seamlessly by computer in fact
lots of decisions are made very
subjectively and so opportunities tend
to come through my friend as opposed to
some general email casting call and one
thing to remember about this is that the
types of people who are really needed
for your career development and sort of
life development it's not the most
obvious thing in the world there there's
a lot of research about how networks of
people affect people's success and
happiness on the job and there's a
distinction that can be made between
what are called strong ties and weak
ties and this has been researched over
the past few decades so strong ties are
people you know quite well so they're
family friends roommates close
co-workers basically where there's easy
exchange you could call or email them it
wouldn't be that big of a deal weak ties
are everybody else that you know so they
could be people that you don't really
know that well I mean after today I'm
conceivably a weak tie since you've seen
me but may not know me as well as people
that you used to know but have fallen
out of touch with or didn't know that
well to the at at the very beginning so
people you interview before former
co-workers people went to school with
your parents friends and so forth and
there's actually a lot of research about
which is more valuable and in fact weak
ties are more valuable than strong ties
as far as long-term career development
and also happiness and when people are
looking for jobs typically people who
rely on their weak ties actually have
more offers higher salary and have
greater job satisfaction than people who
rely on their strong ties
um just curious how could this be true
what's the reason for this yes we're
correct at its prime there are more but
it they are different and they have
different information than you do
strong ties often have the same
information that you do so there's less
diversity in the set you would have
thought over here it's okay dude yes
excellent point so strong ties are too
emotionally connected the way I would
put it is strong ties may have a vested
interest in who you are
so strong ties can actually constrain
you in certain circumstances because
they have an idea of who who you are and
they may express loving doubts about
interests you have or relationships you
have because they have a different idea
of who you are and I'm sort of a good
example so I my mother is a college
professor she teaches accounting and she
has sort of looked on in wonder she sees
this
I don't think she's that technically
competent so I'm for you to say this uh
she has sort of looked on in mounting
horror for about the last 15 years at
the career choices I've made because I
did a jd/mba Stanford which she thought
was great and then went work for this
firm called Davis Polk and Ward well
which is very well known among law firms
and then I sort of left and I hung out
for a bit I did a startup which had a
horrible bloody death and then I went to
coaching about six years ago which is
actually what I've done the longest and
which has been the most satisfying my
mother for a long time did not quite get
what I was doing or chose not to get it
so well into my career as a coach when I
had clients and people liked me and you
know I felt that was really adding
something I would periodically get these
phone messages from her they would say
something like hello Michael this is
your mother I'm calling to tell you that
I was on a flight yesterday and I went
through O'Hare Airport and I talked to
this man who's really nice and he works
for some big company
and I don't think he's a lawyer but I'm
sure they have a legal department and
even though it's not New York Chicago is
a good City so I got his card and I
think you should call him and I was like
I kind of have this business already and
that sort of thing continued for a while
and and by contrast around the same time
I went to this coach training in Santa
Barbara California which along with San
Francisco is like the epicenter of all
the coaches in the world and this
particular one is called the Hudson
Institute and I really liked it and that
the primary demographic were people in
their mid to late 40s and 50s who had
already had another career before and
kind of wanted to do a second career and
as soon as I got there it was like a
love fest people came running up to me
and embracing me and whenever I'd say
something in the group they were like
mmm you know good comment and sort of
hugging me like Michael Melcher this is
your path I see it you know the other
stuff that's good but this is what
you're meant to be and I I just can't
wait to see what happens and and that
was what I really needed at that point
in my life I needed somebody who could
see that part in me and these people who
I didn't really know managed to connect
with the kind of energy that was
important to me and a vision I had in
ways that people that were close to me
couldn't necessarily do that and I will
tell you that the more successful you
are the more critical it is to meet
people there outside of your normal
realm and who understand you either as
who you are apart from your career or
understand elements of you that other
people may not see so enough set on on
that I just alright so we're going to
move to the final thing final idea which
is experimentation so we talked about
values vision those are how you get a
sense of what's right for you what might
be right either in terms of how you like
to live or what you want to create
ultimately relationships are another way
both of making it happen as well as
getting really valuable information
about the world final was
experimentation and experimentation is
how you figure it out and a lot of what
I found in over the last number of years
let me backtrack a second so I wrote
this book I had it the idea for a long
time and I've been reading self-help and
career stuff basically my whole life
since high school it was sort of my
thing and I've read a lot of this stuff
and one shortcoming that a lot of these
books have is that they kind of give you
the elements but then they stop it's not
really clear what happens then and they
sort of have this idea that if you just
believe in yourself enough and have a
strong enough vision that's enough and I
actually don't think that's really true
and if somebody were to say Michael
Melcher do you believe that
fundamentally the most important thing
is to believe in yourself I would say no
I don't think that's actually the most
important thing it's it's nice it's a
it's an important thing to have but by
itself it's not really going to do the
job because life is just too complex and
that's where experiments come in so an
experiment is simply anything that
allows you to test a different reality
it's like putting on an outfit before
you buy it it's a way to inhabit a role
and either within your work life or
outside of it there are a lot of
different ways that you can experiment
so anything you do in your 20 percent
time see how into your culture I am that
may qualify as an experiment working
with a completely different manager or
somebody from a different background
either demographically or in terms of
Education out bring your best experiment
taking on a project that's way outside
of your normal comfort zone is a good
experiment reading a book can be an
experiment going to a speech going to a
conference taking a trip these are all
different types of experiments and the
value is they give you different data
once you have the data you can see how
it feels how you show up doing those
activities and and what sort of response
you get from the outside world
volunteering can be an experiment
writing an article doing a business plan
it's what it really is is it's more than
just thinking and one error that brainy
people with good education make is that
they think too much thinking
is drastically overrated when it comes
to careers I'm just going to tell you it
won't it won't really help you it'll
give you a little bit of insight but it
will also keep you paralyzed and it will
detach you from the process movement in
your life and career is really all about
action small specific discrete actions
so in general you should I would
recommend you take the baby step as
opposed to waiting for the big win or
the big goal now this is a little bit
counterintuitive because we've actually
grown up thinking of success as
something that happens when you get a
clear sense of what your goals are and
then go for them because it kind of
worked for a good chunk of your life but
it doesn't keep on working as you get
into the Messier reality of what jobs
are really like and what you are really
like as it grown up and what you were
like now so I have a little a little
thought exercise for you on on creating
experiments okay
I'm going to be two scenarios and you're
going to think of some good ones so
although Jose is an engineer at Google
and writes great code he thinks his
writing talent does not suck actually he
loves writing is quite good at it and
wonders if that is something he should
do with his life so what experiments
could Jose do to test this yes excellent
idea right on the Google Blog right low
investment in time but maybe get some
real data that way what else could he do
Yeah right a article for a low
circulation magazine that's interesting
correct right because he's exploring
what is writing mean does it mean
writing a novel who knows it's a way of
checking it out yes take a course of
course it's a great there many courses
in New York filled with bankers and
lawyers and perhaps Google employees
what else it's something outside of New
York
that's something a little crazy or
different where you go to a conference
you could try to go to writers colony he
could he could apply for a film school
without necessarily going but just going
through the process can give you a lot
of data what about something that seems
very mundane but might actually help
them you write a journal mm-hmm
kind of get to know his voice how about
something mundane related to work that
might give him data too close to home I
would imagine yes be a technical writer
and there might be technical writing
applications within what he's doing so
when I was in business school there were
a lot of very quantal and I was okay but
by comparison with them a little less
confident so I know is I would always
volunteer to do the write up on any of
our projects which is kind of a wimpy
way of going through business school and
and a good experiment would have been
like I'll do the stochastic modeling or
whatever I want to do that meant but
it's really stretching beyond your
comfort zone and finding little ways to
test things because people hold
themselves back because they get wrapped
up in making a huge jump when there
might actually be something that would
help them test I'll give you another
example another test Jill is an engineer
and is an individual contributor at
Google she is interested in management
but is not sure how much you would like
it plus there is no obvious immediate
promotion available to manage in
position so what are some experiments
jill can do to test this interest yes I
like that are they available for really
that's can I get one
it'll be like mr. Kramer's intern okay
what's another experiment yes I'm sorry
yes you could teach a class and its
deadly here let me tell you now yeah it
takes last what else right so those are
ways that that you can get a sort of
feeling of what management might mean to
her without it being really high stakes
in terms of a huge time sink but it
would still be valuable information yeah
right and there at there's actually
their number of nonprofits that now
specifically exist in New York and San
Francisco to try to draw in professional
talent and so just seeing what that is
like so those are all examples of
experiments and what I would leave ways
on that point is that people kind of get
this idea what they typically do though
is they give up too early so they'll get
one or two data points and at that point
that task is to really refine it so
let's say you take a writing course and
it's kind of lame and you're really
tired whenever you go and you don't
really have any ideas for memoirs which
is the subject of it now you have the
choice of deciding that I don't want to
be a writer at all or perhaps what
you've really decided is I don't like
this particular style and there might be
other methods of doing it so the more
you try to get meaningful information
while keeping your investment minimal is
how you get a lot of data and this is
actually what keeps you fresh going
forward so those are basically the four
planks that I wanted to share with you
and I'll just close with a little quote
from an excellent book that I would
recommend to all of you if you are
interested in this subject the book is
called working identity and it's about
what career development and career
change really look like over time
primarily for professional people it's
aimed a bit more at people I would say
early 30s to late 40s early 50s but it's
an excellent book and it's by a woman
named at Armenia Ibarra IB ARRA and she
has a quote we learned who we are in
practice not theory by testing reality
not by looking inside we discover the
true possibilities by doing trying out
new activities reaching out to new
groups finding new role models and
reworking our story as we tell it to
those around us so with that in mind I'm
available for questions and in the
meantime I thank you for making this
experiment of coming and seeing my
inaugural Tech Talk thank you
