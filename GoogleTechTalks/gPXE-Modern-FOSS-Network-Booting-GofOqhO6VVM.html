software engineering intern and I'm
pleased to introduce today Marty Conner
Michael Brown and Peter enman three
people who I've had the pleasure of
working with for the past couple of
weeks
they created G pixie which is the state
of the art and open source Network
booting and today they brought a bunch
of awesome demos as you can see to show
us and some stories of their experiences
as google Summer of Code mentors so
thank you very much for coming to speak
for us all right I am Marty Conner ether
boot project leader this is Michael
Brown Michael is our lead developer and
this is HPA
most people already know he is them but
this is H Peter and man and what do you
call yourself these days like I I'm here
and asked the creator of the syslinux
project which includes the video the
pixie Linux Network booting stack as the
madam
jo Linux kernel engineer at the company
called our pal yeah so um we want we
want to introduce G pixie how many how
many folks here have already heard of G
pixie cool all the people in the front
of the room uh-huh
what are you people in the back of the
room doing here yeah all right for those
who have not heard of G pixie how many
people have heard of ether boot Wow okay
so more people have heard of ether boot
okay I want to introduce the creator of
ether boot who happens to work at Google
Marcus Marcus visca in 1995 was
interested in Network booting because he
didn't have enough money to boot to
computers but he figured that if he like
rewired his power supply and then did
this little hack with Network booting
he'd be able to boot two computers for
the price of one is that fair to say
there you go so they're in started the
long Odyssey from 1995 to the present of
the ether booth project Marquez was the
first project leader and his big
motivation for reporting ether boot was
that he didn't want to write his network
drivers in assembly language I want to
write them and see so he created the
capability of writing C network drivers
which was a big deal all right
fast-forward a little bit a couple years
later a fella named Ken yeah became
project leader and Ken was project
leader for like ten years
and under his leadership ether boot grew
and grew and grew and in popularity now
how many people know about pixie if I
said pixie how many people would just
say oh I know what that is okay for
those that don't know when you start up
your computer and it says boot from land
that's pixie it is the part of the BIOS
that it's a bias expansion component
that allows you to boot from land
where's Peter okay I should tell you
this there are three of us here today
the fourth person who couldn't make it
is Don Becker who wrote most of the
Linux Network drivers up through the
year 2000 Don had to go back to Maryland
he couldn't be with us he was he was
with us at Linux world but what you do
have here is probably several of the
people in the world who know the most
about Network booting it's a peculiarly
small community of people who are really
interested in this but for some of us
it's a coolest thing we ever saw and
we've got some demos to show you now a
little background what year was Pixy
Linux Pixy Linux
hang on yeah okay yeah so pixie Linux
was created came out in 99 when Chris
DiBona who is also now at Google dropped
the server in my lap that says hey make
this thing Network boot which I had
foolishly not express interest in doing
I also grabbed the whole of this
specification called you know the pre
the Intel pre execution environment
specification which was an attempt at at
taking this hideous situation that we
were in that every OS x every nic needed
a different hardware component a a
aftermarket rom in order to be able to
net food unfortunately the PXE
specification is to say it's awful would
be like flaming awfulness it's it has
certain deficiencies its suboptimal
suboptimal like really really suboptimal
like assigning the same opcode for two
operations awful yeah yeah so it's not
implementable it's actually
unimplemented over several of the
reasons to but that would um the on top
of that was that the early
implementations were just incredibly
buggy and when i say incredibly buggy it
was you know there was this long list of
errata that like oh in this version 0.99
j or whatever it was we fixed the you
know we fixed the bug that we send it to
the raw that we send packets the wrong
gateway yeah it was it was like pretty
it was pretty amazingly broken yeah but
it was the best that we had in
particular having ace when you come when
it comes to booting the the sad
situation is that I had
even an awful standard is better than
having no standard at all
and so ice one of the limitations of the
pets PhD specification imposed was that
the boot program couldn't be more than
32 kilobytes long this turnout to know
what no one actually implemented this
limit but at this point I had seen just
about everything before I even started
so I was like okay I'm gonna play I'm
gonna play really good this really tied
to my chest I had written a small
bootloader called syslinux for that was
intended to be used on floppies and
therefore was small already so it seemed
like a good point to start and it had a
pretty decent feature set people liked
it so I'm like okay well you know rather
than starting over and doing it all from
scratch I might as well just do it start
it from there and you know so that
that's how pixie Linux came came to be
and it's gotten rather popular uh yeah
like pretty much it's what everybody
uses to boot to network boot on Linux
okay this is supposed to be interactive
please if there's anything you want to
know if there's anything that's unclear
if you have any any question at any
level of technical specificity ask it
you pretty much have like somewhere
between Marcus and and Peter and Michael
and myself you you we probably can
answer it how many of you guys are from
the BIOS group where the BIOS guys okay
so you're comfortable with expansion
roms evil expansion roms that do all
kinds of like really naughty stuff evil
evil evil alright so yeah so don't you
know do speak up
alright let me tell you about the
timeline here the user boot project
started in 1994 95 or so i 1.0 came out
and
yeah as like August 95 we were first
pixie was second we were very proud that
we were first and the ether book project
back then sort of did its own thing it
worked something like this we would take
a kernel and we would run it through we
would wrap it we wrap it using something
called make n bi what's n bi network
boot image there you go
this is a really cool idea because what
it does is it allows ether boots Network
loader to be incredibly simple so the
basic the basic pattern is like this
ether boot does a DHCP request gets back
the usual stuff plus a file name the
file name is important the file name is
used by TFTP to load the NBI file and
did it and on also the NB I would take a
kernel and and an it Rd back then and
away you go pick C word Peter go pick C
had a different approach the pixie folks
the pixie folks didn't didn't define it
that way you wanna you wanna you want to
do the pixie side or you want me to I
can go real fast huh go fast okay I'll
play me when you get it play play me
when I get it wrong it's you know it's
really fun to get flamed by by I like
the x86 maintainer the kernel you know
because you know he wouldn't bother
unless it was like worthwhile leveling
okay so on the pixie side I pixie was
theoretically supposed to fit in 32 K
but nobody paid the attention
what pixie did was it loaded something
called a second stage loader which was
MVP which was called a network boot
program or MVP so what happened was
picks
okay how many people know how option
roms work in the BIOS couple all right
let me tell you let me tell you a little
story about the BIOS okay from time
immemorial the BIOS is started up and
peered at a certain space in memory
looking for friends it's a lonely by us
it's looking looking for looking for
people to join those things are option
roms you'll notice when you're when your
computer starts up and you have an
adapter Guzzi card and you've got some
fancy DGA card and you'll see these
things going by announcing the
copyrights of the companies and
sometimes saying hit ctrl s or hit
control a could oh those are option roms
typically Larry they're living in the
BIOS on the flash on the motherboard or
they're living on an Ethernet card or on
a scuzzy card we implemented one long
story short there's a rule there's a way
to do them they start with five five AAA
they land on even boundaries in memory
and if you yeah sort of and if they and
if you put your your ROM on a card in
the right format it will get loaded so
that's essentially what we did all right
how bad did I do then good enough good
enough okay all right so ether booth and
pixie could both be put on a little ROM
chip on an Ethernet card when either
booth started up it did its DHCP it got
the file name it TFTP did into memory
and it executed done finito by okay
pixie on the other hand had another idea
what they did was they did DHCP so far
so good they got the file name alright
now here's where here's where it's
different the file name was not assumed
to be something that was immediately
what you wanted it was a thing to get
you what you wanted so it was a second
stage bootloader so that it loaded the
the MVP the NBP
thank you in b.p or the second stage
loader which then was smart enough to
load what you really wanted in this case
you wanted a kernel let's say you want
any kernel and in an it Ram FS and the
NBP would be would do the loading ok the
either boot method of doing this saved a
step it was but it but at the cost of
having to wrap your kernel and you're
hit Rd some people like this some people
still use this to this day the problem
is that Intel came out in 97 97 with the
wired for management or wfm wfn as
opposed to WTF ya wfm was wired for
management and in an appendix in the
intel wired for management specification
was the PX e or pre-boot execution
environment the pre-boot execution
environment defined the pixi way of
Network booting now we need to boot
project had been merrily chugging along
booting all sorts of things we've been
in booting super computer clusters we've
been booting you know ltsp things we've
been very happy about life but it became
very clear that the industry as a whole
was moving toward this alright I got to
step over here to my friend Marcus all
right Marcus do I need to get real
technical real fast are we ok alright ok
I just want to make sure he's my
technical audience here because like I
don't want to bore you with this history
stuff but it's important you understand
why we created the first open-source
pixie we created it because as much as
we loved ether boot and some of us loved
it a lot we decided that since the
entire industry had gone this way that
if we didn't implement this as an
open-source thing
we were going to become less and less
interesting over time
in the meantime an almost daily question
on the on the syslinux mailing list and
an IRC channel is what do I do with this
system that has a broken PXE stack and
rom because this was more than an
occasional question shall we say so what
we did was we implemented PXE in first
and ether but-- so what we did here was
we gave the option of people instead of
loading directly loading at NDI files of
actually loading pixie boot loaders so
we actually kind of as a first step this
was kind of when I wandered into ether
boot in about 1999 with all these crazy
all this crazy talk this crazy talk of
like you know implementing pixie and you
know it's about it's about as popular as
like you know talking callbacks to a
core boot hacker you know what I'm
saying so how many coreboot hackers are
there I know there we go I knew he was
out there all right
core boot is a replacement for the BIOS
for the normal PC BIOS for those who
aren't so unaware and there's a certain
amount of shall we say disagreement
about the value of core boot by in the
modern booting boot booting thing but
we're coming around we're coming around
don't rush the audience all right all
right
so 1999 I joined the ether boot project
started writing device drivers talking
this crazy talk then I then about 2000 I
created a website that sort of disrupted
the normal flow of the world called ROM
Oh
maduk dotnet up until then in order to
use ether boot what you had to do is to
download a tarball
CD to the source directory type make and
you know seems simple enough
well it wasn't simple enough so what I
did is I created a website Rama Matic
net matter-of-fact
just for fun let us go to Rama Matic net
and I'll show you
pardon the Fedora core six all right
okay.what rumble Matic dotnet is is a
bootrom vending machine I used to sit on
the either boot either boot users
mailing list all day long and people
would say I can't want to use ether
booth but I am on a Windows machine I
can't download it what's this make thing
so basically I wrote my first PHP
program so I'm so ashamed
it looks like Lisp I mean it's like
really really ugly PHP I I don't even
want to talk about but what it did was
it suddenly allowed anybody that wanted
to to build a boot ROM and was the you
know for the first two million bootrom
sure so this ran off of a DSL line off
of a machine in my basement you saw it
the little I built it myself kind of a
like and so we served up millions of
free boot roms for either boot it's
working great ok now we are going to
demo we are going to demo here's what
happened we kept on sorted I kept on
sort of pushing on the pixie side and
the ether boot people sort of kept
pushing on the ether boot side and then
one day we were a we forked because it
was clear that they didn't want chip
pixie in ether boot and we felt that we
had to have pixie because like it was
everywhere you know it just seemed like
you know the thing to do so how long did
we for like you have pixie before we
fooled right we had well we had we had
ether boot plus pixie but we wanted more
it was like it was like a couple months
yeah
this might have been only a few weeks
okay so what happened is three of us
went over created G pixie org and
started you know do our evil deeds and
then the project leader for ether boot
quit and so at that point we move back
over and I became the project leader
Michael became the lead developer and
our partner in crime here HPA yeah got
his Oh God is the open source Pixy stack
the thing you always wanted so we have
we have embraced the pixie standard we
have embraced it so much that it we've
added certain things embrace and extend
grace and extend what is our favorite
thing that we have added tcp yes we like
to see where's nickel nickel stand up
okay
come up here come on come on up come on
out nickel hey Mari muddy
yes tree you should do milk solution
first really what's that oh okay Marcus
get over here all right okay this is fun
come on it's alright look no one's gonna
be crazier than me your guys are gonna
look horrible
okay so Marcus put a small HTTP stack in
ether boo
and it was sort of just yeah but they
can hear you okay oh yeah there you go
this work okay it was more or less a
proof-of-concept I figured booting over
to TCP and ultimately over
HTTP would be a lot more useful but I'm
working at Google I didn't actually have
enough time to fully commit to the
project anymore that was one of the
reasons but I was very happy that that
Marty had step is the project lead and
he strong-armed me to to show up at
Linux Expo and and be at the booth for a
while and while I was there he hinted at
maybe maybe this idea about HTTP
building would be really good and since
you're here anyway you're not working
today
why didn't you implement it and I
remembered enough of TCP that I could
implement most of it but I didn't
actually have any of my books there so I
got it to this stage that I could boot
over HTTP but I definitely still had a
whole bunch of shortcomings on it the
one thing that I was very proud of is
that I fit it into I think less than two
kilobytes a full TCP stack including a
an HTTP client and I think it lived like
that for for probably a year or so yeah
okay so what yeah so people looked at it
a few times it was like well this is
really cool
but it cleared it wasn't production
quality at that time and so so that's
when did you tell him about the part
where I like like locked your laptop to
the table at Linux World Expo and
refused to give you the key until like
it booted well I like the part better
were halfway through the project I had
issues with with the drivers and
supposedly that was a way to debug it in
in QAM EMU but this was all really new
in queue and you kept crashing on it and
everything and so it finally turned out
that the only person who was known to
ever have seen this actually work is
Michael and he was in the UK at the time
so we called him on my cell phone which
usually involved running out of the the
conference which didn't have reception
it's like okay I type this in it doesn't
work what do I do now
but yeah ultimately we got it to work
and yeah yeah later I think this was the
foundation for the for the new and fully
implemented TCP stack that then got
implemented as the Google of code
project
all right all right okay
enter enter and Nichols Syrah
we got involved with the google Summer
of Code because as a volunteer project
you know more hackers is usually better
and so we were really grateful to Google
we started in the second year we're now
this is now what our third year of
participation and we were very fortunate
actually Michael you should you should
come up come on come on over because
Michael was actually Nichols mentor hard
mentor mmm torment are there you are
there you are okay so I have a row you
oh you already have it hold on it okay
so I we had we had IRC degree of IRC oh
yeah we had Agassi
and we have a lot of fun with google
Summer of Code I got to tell you google
Summer of Code has really changed our
project because when you got like people
spread out all over the world and all
these different time zones so what was
your project so I was helping Michael
build TCP stack that went into G pixie
so we basically had to we used to use a
micro IP way you know yeah we'd only
just started with that so we had the UDP
IP stack which I guess you did yeah you
will care or something people before my
time had done and then we needed TCP in
order to support I scuzzy which somebody
was prepared to give us money for this
is how many features get out it that's
how they do actually III crowbarred you
IP in there yeah and then your project
was rewrite the tcp/ip static uses the
API so seem but you know reread what
what was inside
we had to basically take take the RFC's
and strip about anything that was not
necessary and try to fit this you know
this TCP stack into like a couple of
kilobytes and that was that was
interesting so interesting you know you
know what I really loved is you know you
gotta understand the technical side is
fun you know you're just sitting there
reading all these debugging commands
going by trying to figure out you know
arguing about you know can we afford is
that worth 200 bytes is that worth to
other advice you know your data strut
your doing you know your data structures
you know what is that what is that that
field but but you also get the personal
side so we'd be like I get messages from
from Nikhil like this um I'm really
sorry but I'm stuck over at my brother's
house there are riots right now and so I
cannot leave uh it was also monsoon
season so there's like waist-deep water
running so if I you know if I get cut
off you know it's it's because the Power
has gone out again what's actually yeah
this was one somewhere I was in Bombay I
was sitting in Bombay and doing a listen
though this was when there was a bomb
blast and in Bombay and basically we
couldn't get from where I was to to my
place so yeah it was interesting someone
it was a fun server
but he kept hacking but he kept hacking
he kept hacking through floods through
riots and you know it is the stories
were really good it's like somebody
smeared something on somebody's wife
statue and now there's a general strike
almost about us la yeah and so yeah it's
like yeah you get a real global
education through the google Summer of
Code it's cat Allman here first cat okay
okay she sneaks it I want to introduce
her cuz Chris DiBona
and Leslie Hawthorne and cat Allman and
the folks in the AH SPO open the open
source project office are totally
awesome
they've we've really enjoyed working
with them on google Summer of Code so
wait wait a minute wait a minute I'm not
done embarrassing you hold on hold on
one moment
so we
like nickel for for the first like you
know sort of extended robust version of
tcp/ip and there was some ipv6 stuff in
there too I remember that was I think
the real cool the the real goal of the
summer was should implement ipv6 support
but we only got for us
well we got some ipv6 support but it
wasn't yeah well I mean three months for
ipv4 you know Thank You NIC Elizabeth
alright so um let's see where were you
in our story yes oh yeah sorry
okay so it worked the project it lasted
three months we took over you know we
were the law givers you know and you
know HPA had been like instigating for a
open source tcp our open source pixie
stack and we were like okay yeah we
think that's a good idea too and so I
think we should do a demo of like sort
of network booting using G pixie but
let's do something you want to the HTTP
thing Michael which one open LTS P over
HTTP okay what this Tim I was going to
show you is Network booting a
workstation as an X terminal using HTTP
instead of TFTP and the reason that we
did this is because as Peter will tell
you a lot of people wanted to be able to
boot using a protocol other than TFTP
for various reasons all right Michael is
doing right now is just modifying our
DHCP decom file so that we can choose
our demo we got like a whole bunch of
demos that we can do and so we're
basically just restarting DHCP D and
what you'll see is basically this
incredibly fast boot
at the wrong KBM channel okay
yeah I think we I think we missed the
incredibly fast food all right
usual bye ah stop now this is G Pixy
it's going to do a DHCP request and boom
if you watch Linux boot you know what
this is but basically this has all been
done over HTTP now this is a really big
deal because doing things over HTTP
all of a sudden frees you from the
subnet so you should you should be
excited and terrified at what you see
here because imagine people being able
to like stick in a USB key and hit reset
and then boot their machines off of some
arbitrary URL pretty cool idea eh so um
this is just a normal X desktop but we
wanted more we wanted so much more you
want to do the the illicit operating
system over a oe how many people know
what a oh we protocol is Gani ah there
we go
ATA over ethernet is this very
lightweight protocol which is basically
just an Ethernet header and an AO ATA
packet and it's sort of subnet bound but
it's really really efficient what you're
going to see here is something that
basically we are the only thing that
does it much to the chagrin of some some
large multinational companies but
what we're doing now is we are loading
this machine here is our AoE target
machine so we're loading Windows XP
using AOL we protocol we are literally
reading the boot block off of the target
machine and running the NT loader and
starting up Windows don't worry in a
minute we will cleanse we will cleanse
your palate by doing the same thing with
Ubuntu give them that we're googled you
want to actually be a bit more specific
about how we do this okay you be more
specific you're the man
okay so I don't think you introduced the
test machine yet oh yeah let's see how
to introduce the test fish so hopefully
this is not gonna kill the power if I do
now you got it here is our test machine
with no discs in and de 1,000 cars
flashed with three pixie and firmware
sitting right there so for an AoE or ice
cozy boot we do the DHCP part of food as
normal for pixie clients so send
something out get a reply from the DHCP
server which tells us what to boot off
the network normally that's going to be
a file name now we've already extended
pixie to the point where that file name
can be a URL so if it starts with HTTP
colon slash slash we don't do a TFTP
download we go and grab that from a web
server we also look at the route path
field and if that tells us we're doing a
nice cozy or an AoE boot we don't do any
kind of file download at all we hook in
13 for the BIOS which is the BIOS disk
interrupt dating back to on
1980-something yes and 1981 sandy very
first PC and the BIOS at that point
thinks that there is an extra disk
present so if you use in 13 to read
Drive hex 8 0 which is the first hard
disk we've intercepted that we took
convert that twice because he calls or
AoE calls going over the network and as
far as the BIOS is concerned there's
just one additional disk in system so
this means immediately that you can fire
up something like ms-dos which continues
to use in 13 all the way through because
it never knew anything other than biles
disk drivers never had a native driver
it also means you can load anything that
expects to have a disk boot sector so
something like grub or Lila or NT loader
any of that stuff will function
immediately and you'll be able to boot
from a disk image as though the physical
disk is attached at some point you have
to hand over to the operating system so
when we boot up XP m13 happens through
NT load NT loader drags in the kernel
registry any drivers it feels like and
then we get out of the way the XP native
driver for the card comes up and there's
a tiny handover table telling it what to
go and boot from and then eventually it
comes up and we will see as far as
Windows is concerned it has one disk
attached which is there I'll do it
right-click properties on that
yeah and yeah yeah there it is not
helpful
yep there's our AoE disc now this is
kind of cool because this is this is how
an open-source project kind of works the
major corporation that's interested in
AoE is called core aid they make most of
the AoE hardware they make these really
fancy racks and by the way core aid
sells racks that run plan 9 so if there
any plan nine folks in here this is one
of the major uses of plan 9 query its
hardware now there was a fellow in the
Netherlands who wrote the Windows driver
for AoE Michael wrote the AoE booting
support and created the mechanism for
handing off between our driver and the
native Windows driver because up into a
certain point we're doing all of the all
of the disk i/o and then at some point
or another windows loads its AoE driver
and it at that point has to find the it
has to find the right volume to mount
and how does it do that Michael okay so
you're quite limited in terms of ways
you can hand over to the operating
system because we're in quite uncharted
territory with the bars that you've got
no memory protection really set up and
the only sensible thing you can do is
drop a table in base memory which is
what IBM decided to do for ice cozy and
we stole that idea for AoE so we drop a
table in base memory which windows can
scan for and that contains basically
something to identify the network card
so the MAC address or PCI bus device
function something which will tie you
down and say yes you need to bring up
this card and another piece of
information saying this is the disk you
need to attach to for AoE that's just a
24-bit number and that's it that's all
the information you need
oh yeah we all right okay there's got to
be there's got to be one question out
there anything please ask us anything
question yes yes yes please okay so um
it looks like you have a great system
for booting a machine using G pixie if
you have like a kind of a master slave
configuration yet you have like a master
serving up G pixie images um how does
that skilled a thousands of machines
like say that you just have a whole
cluster or maybe many clusters and you
want to boot them all with G pixie and
you turn them all on at once what's
gonna happen to that poor head node okay
well actually doing what G picks is
going to scale a lot better than with
them with the standard pixie because
Stan a pixie uses TFTP which is subject
to the TFTP to something called the TFTP
capture effect which is uh you know TFTP
is a very simple protocol it generally
uses a simple exponential back-off
algorithm and an lockstep scheduling if
the TFTP server isn't very careful and
very few of them are including the one I
wrote you are subject to the situation
where the node that gets through the the
din will basically always get what it's
asked for because they will always beat
the node that fell back with TCP you
have a much better chain the TCP back
off behavior is much better and TCP
stacks are much better tuned so you're
much more likely to actually to get you
know obviously if you can't hear if your
links can't handle all this stuff then
yeah you're in and you're just going to
be slow but your should be slow as
opposed to falling over ah
there's there's also the multicast so
even standard TFT standard pixie
supports some disgusting Frankenstein
hack at Monte Casa TFTP yeah
we support several other multicast
protocol so we support RFC compliant
multicast TFTP unlike because of course
intel had to create a whole different
version of multicast TFTP than it then
is in the RFC for multicast TFTP and
they're there a version is particularly
brain-damaged
that being said our multi casting is one
of those things that sound really good
in theory and tends to suck in practice
first of all it will actually buy you
that much because as soon as you get
through the initial booting phase you
have per client specific traffic in the
end anyway and you're down you're back
down to unicasting as far as servicing a
lot of clients from a server or a
cluster of servers um I am NOT going to
stand at a talk in this particular
company and pretend I know anything
about it but one of the cool things is
it's a good question we don't really
have a few thousand servers to test it
but we would like to and we know people
who have yeah yeah with ether boot from
GPX II so cluster works built a cluster
for Los Alamos National Labs which I
think was 500 node yeah for which Eric
Biederman don't have anybody knows him
decided that the existing multicast
protocols were just not what there were
two kinds to your network yeah so he
came up with this thing called slam
escape path it see the simple scalable
local area multicast is what he called
it now about a month ago I was working
for statoil in Norway where they're
trying to use cluster works and we hit a
bit of a problem because they were using
on the client side a fairly slow driver
on the gigabit network so and we were
getting packet loss rates of about
eighty percent
yeah now I never previously used slam so
I looked at the protocol design and it
works like this the client comes up
sends out a list of blocks it hasn't yet
received for the file which at the start
of days the entire file the server then
transmits that as fast as it possibly
can onto the wire the client picks out
whichever packets it can possibly keep
up with and then sends a list a and I
missed this 80% of them please resend so
this is really really bad if your node
doesn't have checksum offload which pixi
clients don't have and your server is a
nice high powered machine with checksum
upload on the card and can stream a
gigabit line rate or 10 gig line rate
and your clients really die under those
circumstances but fortunately the
protocol is so ill-defined that you can
modify the client behavior to turn this
into multicast TFTP now the other thing
that HTTP gives you I made a little
table while we were while we were at
Shannon actually put 4 for the reference
the biggest cluster I've ever heard
being net booted was one was 16384 nodes
booted from one server howdy so um I I
was told that it took was 30 minutes to
boot it's actually not bad yeah it's the
beat that given how often this cluster
was rebooted that wasn't considered a
problem so just to give you a little a
little bit of idea of what we did with G
pixie we implemented pixie and it is our
goal to make G pixie work with all the
standard things pixie works with what
are some of the standard things that
pixie works with that we we have managed
to be compatible with Michael we've
tested it with most of the N BPS that we
can find on the market so pixie linux
obviously works because pixie works
rocks yeah
as Microsoft removed installation
services works as does WDS which is what
remote installation services became
there's some deployment products from
people like Altiris and ardent they all
work there's some more obscure things
like BP batch which works as long as you
enable one tiny hack which says ignore
the fact that they ask you to TFTP from
port 4 and assume it means support 16
all right but yeah there's also get the
source go to there there's also I
believe one of the problems ok so I
previously mentioned that the pixie
protocol as defined is is actually
unimplemented for several reasons so
when you implement the pixie you
basically have to decide what part of
the spec to ignore the G picks of people
actually you know have actually done a
they actually lets you choose at compile
time which particular part with what
particular hacks to apply not all
combinations necessarily work if you
pull the get tree at any one time but
they're all at least they're officially
they're the default configuration uh
enables the use of protected mode so
that the code can go into protective
mode so that it doesn't have the same
size limitations which is important when
you want to have all the protocols in
there that version didn't work with an
old version I believe was net bsd that
went into the six year one of the bsts
decides to call the pixie stack in va6
mode and gets really upset if you then
try to switch the cpu into protective
mode yeah there is also a but I think
they've fixed that I could be wrong it's
basically impossible under some
circumstances to write a pixie stack
that will work in va6 mode because say
you're driving InfiniBand HCA is your
boot card that requires eight makes of
memory as a scratch space for the firm
line so if you'll start to 164 case
Egmond yeah you can't really service
that yeah
I'm kind of wondering a
who can really use a cheap pixie if I
just take an off-the-shelf motherboard
with integrated Ethernet there a way to
use it I am so glad you asked that you
knew didn't you
okay well before we get to that well I
can answer that go for it okay so the
problem with integrated Ethernet is that
every BIOS there isn't a standard
version for integrating option roms into
the BIOS
fortunately bias vendors have are
increasingly coming to terms with the
fact that they have to with the fact
that they have to deal with with mod
with modular biases and so a lot of them
now have flashing tools where you can
flash a specific component to the BIOS
that being said if you can't do that
there is pixie chain loading ctrl + ctrl
+ ctrl + click ctrl + 3 times yeah
alright it's just bigger yeah pixie
chain loading is where instead of we
have the the pixie model of pixie starts
off loads a second stage boot loader or
an NBP now as perverted as it as it may
seem what if that second-stage boot
loader that it loads was actually g
pixie then you wouldn't have to reflash
your network card because pixie would
start up low G pixie we would
immediately kill the old pixie off
leaving no trace and then you would have
all of the features of G pixie however
um even this was a little too complex
for a lot of people so we have in
recently the group of us worked on this
nifty little thing called G pixie Linux
which is G pixie and pixie Linux turn
into one image called G Pixy Linux to
zero and
it is a drop-in replacement for Pixy
Linux 0.0 is a pixie convention for the
bootstrap file the this image can do
everything that Pixy Linux can with one
minor exception which is the ability to
change load another NVP and that's a bug
and we'll fix it yeah but it can do so
you know once you have gone through the
you know and loaded this image which is
about 47 kilobytes over over TFTP
everything else you can do over HTTP or
whatever you want all right the other
thing that I believe we haven't
explicitly mentioned but was a feature
from pretty much day one in ether boot
is that your your ether boot orgy pixie
image doesn't actually have to live in
ROM you can build it differently so that
it run looks like a boot loader and or
like a kernel and can be booted from a
regular boot loader you can put it on a
floppy you can put it on a hard drive
you can put it on a USB stick there's
even a feature to compile it into a DOS
binary which at some point people really
liked when Windows was still popular you
could just run it as a DOS program so so
there are still plenty of people that
that use that option and for a lot of
deployments that makes perfect sense and
you don't actually have to flush it into
physical hardware yet also there's one
more option which is that II you know
let's say that you have a nifty new
board with you know 10 with a gigabit or
10 gigabits interface you can go out and
buy an old you know 10 or 100 megabit
card with you know a flash for a socket
and put G pixie on that and use that car
that's nothing but a carrier for the
wrong this is actually like in theory
you could have a dedicated board that
just had a rom socket it's actually
cheaper to buy a cheap video by Nick so
G pixie these three protocols HTTP I
scuzzy FTP protocols that require TCP
where was what drove us to embed a
tcp/ip stack now the current tcp/ip
stack is about 4.2 kilobytes of code
you're just 69 pretty small for what it
does
it handles it's a pretty highly robust
stack and it handles quite a few quite a
few situations let us let us do a demo
yeah what do you think Michael we're
gonna do the the pixie knife demo okay
this is a really cool demo and assuming
that my we haven't checked the external
coming to yeah I'm using a wireless
bridge to sort of bridge the guest
network to a wired network so that we
can be behind a firewall here but I
think it was working a minute ago this
has got a boot from Peters server where
is your server
oh it's it's down to Santa Clara but
it's sitting in a coal oh yeah this is
this is all pull over HTTP you know
across over the Internet this is this is
possible partly because partly because
of this deep of the interface between G
pixie and pixie Linux all of this is
standard pixie Linux I actually grabbed
a friend of Mines a pixie Linux net set
up and just Shane and just put it on an
HTTP server and and and and change the
URL but the current version of gee pixie
has this feature that you can embed what
it would do what's called an embedded
script which is basically you can think
of it as a it's a compiled in
override from what the for what the DHCP
server tells it you can use it for doing
static IPS but you can also do with in
this case
what I did was overrode the boot file
name yeah
so imagine that you're somewhere and you
don't have your tools with you but you
have G pick C on a USB key or you know
something and you basically boot it up
and there it would have gone to local
boot
you basically boot it up and you want to
drive you want to like I'll Drive yeah I
watch a demo
you basically just boot it up and you
have all of the tools at your command so
this is just some arbitrary server we
test G pixies HTTP booting all the time
by just booting machines off of anywhere
you know like like I boot from Cambridge
England I'm in Boston I'll just boot off
of Michael's server in Cambridge so what
we've really done here is we have
virtualized booting so that you don't
really think about you know everything
else is virtualized the file systems
virtualized so why not virtualize
everything from the first boot and
that's our that's our concept pixie was
stuck here at TFTP TFTP is a really
horrible protocol for getting any speed
at all
let's do TFTP say oh then no that's all
it is over YouTube okay sorry ok ok ok
shall we do the - yeah we'll do you guys
do it
ok this is you want to do the font I'll
be the client
wait you're hiding beyond hey buddy
you're gonna be the package you have to
all be bouncing go ahead right ok
our cue I want file boot block zero
I don't want that anymore error
I want boot this file boot block 0 AK
block 1 AK block 2 block 2 AK block 3 AK
bulk for Underland AK that's it yeah
there you have TF TV ok now you wanna do
HTTP well we'll do TCP it's doing HTTP
over it's all ok annoying alright
alright
syn synack windows sighs didn't say an
ACK I'm dropping your connection then
see like window data data data data
packet it did it don't act pin there you
go
so the idea of HTTP is not just that it
is a reliable protocol but also that
it's window so you know I can sit here
and go back you can just act as he goes
on it's the difference between X modem
and Z modem and so that is one of the
reasons why you like it
the other reason is that all of the
layer 3 appliances all the load
balancers all those cool boxes that
people have to pay or for part 2 Flav
for layer 3 is IP right yeah okay sorry
layer 4 then all right all the layer 4
stuff can help you so essentially it can
look and it can it can load balanced it
can prioritize your traffic it can do
all the things that you want what help
with TFTP is often blocked at switches
and routers but HTTP yeah in fact one of
the main request source of requests for
I mean I've been getting this for years
that pics video pixel and accusers want
HTTP a lot of them it isn't actually due
to any of the problems with TFTP it's
actually due to the fact that well they
know how to do customizations in Apache
you have this huge infrastructure for
delivering HTTP content and you know
they want to be able to generate
configuration files dynamically and do
all this kind of stuff and like they
already know how to do it on HTTP they
don't want to have to deal with a
completely different infrastructure for
TFTP machine wakes up it does it's DHCP
conversation and during that DHCP
conversation it informs it in so forms
the server of some things then it has an
HTTP conversation during that
conversation it talks not to a static
file it talks to a CGI in talking to
that CGI it specifies the kernel and the
modules and everything that it needs so
it does not have to load down the world
it only loads down it tells the CGI give
me the RTL 81 39 driver give me the
particular USB driver you don't see this
happening yeah you had a question
um yeah is there any kind of
authentication on this or with like the
DNS spoofing somebody just take over
your boot oh yeah yeah oh yeah so there
is a thin occasion is no no no no no
this is that no we have it's something
that is going to happen at some point we
have a TLS layer so we can do SSL v3 and
TLS we one at the moment it's an
incomplete implementation it won't
actually verify the certificate will
convince the server that it can speak
HTTP but but any answer you in answer to
the question right now what we have is
danger Will Robinson
but we know what we don't have we're not
crazy we're just basically
the creating capability and then
creating more capability so as people
ask for stuff and particularly where
clients come to us you might say well
how do you guys how do open-source guys
actually like do all this stuff well
quite often now the G Pixies grown up it
does all this stuff people contact us
and they say well that's all great but
can you make it do this and we'll say
sure but that's going to be a lot of
work we'll have to get some funding for
that and so that's kind of how we do it
the HTTP support is pretty good and
pretty robust the HTTP support needs
some work
yeah it was a proof-of-concept demo for
an OEM that shall remain unnamed it's
really yes they want Onix adding this
okay not this bit here yeah yeah so this
is what you were talking about a couple
of minutes ago where assembly got a
laser pointer okay I'll just point your
the finger you see the line saying
booted from that's basically what the
DHCP server handed out except in the
DHCP config file it said that so we have
in particular this bit here which is
basically variable expansion so you see
UUID calls and then expanded variable
which on the client side we have some
fun red button over here on the client
side so that's where we had dollar open
brace UUID that's been expanded by G
pixie to the UUID has ripped out from SM
vials and D so for the MAC address there
don't ask me why there's an extra colon
I'm going to debug that this afternoon
so that went off to this PHP script
which then generates this now this
example is actually just hard-coded but
the principle is you could take any
information you want about the booting
client in the DHCP request the web
server running some kind of CGI can then
generate a boot script for you saying
ëi gotta load kernel from here user
space in it around this components and
as few kernel modules and then read the
whole set and when it comes up those
modules will be present in the file
system at that point
in fact it's even it's it's it's also
possible use you know since pixie Linux
and depicts in our work you can actually
do a lot of you can do the equivalent
client side as well there is an 8 there
is an API in the sis Linux distribution
that to act to actually go to to take to
not to probe your hardware to request
things from the server and make you and
and make this all automatic and you any
will stitch together and then it ran the
fest for you on the fly and and boot it
um you bring up the Ubuntu over I scuzzy
demo yeah if your pathology TV works
oh you got you got gdb ok great alright
let's just do the gene how many people
here use gdb cool alright one of our one
of our Summer of Code students this year
Stefan has Josh key his project was gdb
debugging for G pixie because sometimes
you just want to like interrupt it and
get in with gdb and like take a look
around you know while while G pixie is
running so Stefan was really amazing
it's like google Summer of Code started
like on a Monday and like on Wednesday
his journal entry was implemented
initial initial gdb support was serial
mode and like you know we had expected
that to be done by like six weeks
you know like mid term and he didn't
slow down he went on and entered in an
implemented gdb over UDP and a whole
bunch of other stuff all right so what
are we gonna see just give me a sec
okay so client is actually displaying
just here at the moment I don't think we
can get split screens on the projector
so this is not going to be doing much
but this is showing you G pixie at boot
time so we haven't loaded the OS yet
we're just dropped into the G pixie
shell my laptop is running gdb and I'm
connecting via serial cable to here so
I'm going to start and client listening
for connection and then drop in and it's
worked well thank God we had issues with
this earlier okay so we have no
operating system running but we do have
a gdb stub living in there it's about 1
or 2 K I think yeah I'm just running
over the serial port and this means that
we can do everything like set
breakpoints run it through drops us in
there you can single step through the
code it's quite slow when you run over
serial running over UDP which we also
support is faster but since what I'm
going to show you is debugging the
network card driver yeah that's not
going to work here which I do it or if
you've got two network cards in there
you can do that because our stack
supports multiple cards and IP routing
and so on so that's viable okay so this
is now step through to the point where
we're in the driver's pol routine which
can kill off the breakpoint I've got and
say we have a bug which hits received
packets and only happens at a certain
length so I go down to the heart of poly
this is your code it Mike oh let's drop
down to there and set a breakpoint at
that point
Claire needs to be de buzzer wrong until
we hit it so this point in the code we
can try inspecting variables we find
that quite a few of them are optimized
out because we've run with incredibly
aggressive optimization settings in
order to get the ROM size keep their
arms as low as our aggressive set
optimization settings are sufficiently
aggressive that GCC decided at one point
that our men copy routing didn't exist
it could be optimized away entirely
don't turn on F strict aliasing unless
you've thought through the consequences
tell you see we had a network problem
which materializes halfway through an
operating system boot and happens we
know when packets are over a certain
length so I could say make this
breakpoint conditional on the packet
length being over a certain size and
just run this thing through and the
client at this point I don't know you
can see the screen but that's drawback
to the prompt so there's not a lot
happening but you know this is still
running as normal if I now set this
through to go and actually boot or
something this is where oh yeah DHCP net
zero yeah that's it yeah so I can grab
my P address for DHCP we haven't gotten
into the debugger because we haven't had
a packet over 512 bytes if we quickly
reconfigure this which is where it gets
interesting around for you quickly to
add you in fact that will do okay let's
switch that so I'm going to switch this
back to doing something like a nice cozy
boot where it's definitely going to end
up doing large packet sizes and let's
hit the client again this turned out to
be incredibly useful for debugging some
some stuff before this you know we had
to debug with Prentiss and just pretty
primitive primitive debugging but by
getting this and this was a Summer of
Code project we put it out there on our
and our list of Summer of Code projects
somebody volunteered for it and you know
we got really we got four really great
students this year and I'll tell you
about some of the other things that they
provided
okay so I've let this go through and
start it's boot as normal it's going to
attempt a nice cozy boot of Windows
Server 2003 but it will run very very
slowly but what should happen is the
first time we get a proper TCP data
packet one is over 512 bytes isn't it
ring points it's great and it work
yeah we've only tested this once before
by the way yeah yeah so it's quite handy
to be able to go in and just dump stuff
so for example let's take a look and see
what the length of this packet actually
was 635 years okay and Eve on the right
hand side I scroll down just a little
bit further you can work out from there
where the packets actually going to be
so I can just example dump this out by
doing
sweet and there's the package so this is
the packet being read out of memory on
the client system it looks as though gdb
is falling over no it's just going
slowly but you can see that the you can
see the MAC address yeah you can see the
first six bytes I'll correct because
that is the MAC address of this car
that's the MAC address of the e1000
current so it is quite handy to be able
to dive in and do some debugging us a
little bit more sophisticated than
printf so we're really grateful to
google Summer of Code
alright so that was Stefan's project we
had three other projects one was Michael
Decker who did Network drivers he did
first he did the e for a 100 driver he
ported that into the J the native API
then we had Daniel Burcham who
implemented the comm 32 interface of
syslinux this is basically a way to run
so this is a more deep integration of G
pixie and and pixie Linux than what we
have done what we've done in the past
this is actually running a deep system
the Sissel Enix modules directly on top
of G pixie so but an experimental and
probably will be that way for a while
but it's it's kind of the long-term
future of this project and the final
student we had was Balaji Rao
no relation but his project was to add
USB support to G pixie so with his with
his code you can plug in a USB to
Ethernet adapter into a machine and run
G pixie and G pixie will run over you
over USB adapters so we are really
thrilled we've done really well with
Google Summer of Code and it's been a
great blessing for us I want to get into
I scuzzy going on 20 minutes left
Oh does it go yep okay yep yeah we
the large economy-size talk alright um I
scuzzy how many people are familiar with
I scuzzy I scuzzy people all right think
scuzzy over tcp/ip okay with all that
portends it's routable it's you know
it's windowed it's it's fast its it is
RFC it's hideously complicated its
hideously complicated that we
implemented it in full K and we
implemented it in 4k yes it's amazing
what you what you can do when you're
that's about one byte for every page of
the I guess if occasionally it's about a
by for every three pages let's be fair
yes all right what I scuzzy allows you
to do is to treat a remote disc as a
local disc so why does this become
interesting because some operating
systems stubbornly refuse to be
networked booted they just don't want to
do it for some reason that one for
example so essentially what we have done
is we have implemented a way to boot
operating systems off of disks that
aren't physically attached to them now
modern operating systems actually allow
you to install the operating system onto
a nice cozy target a nice cozy target
think of it as like a large server array
with lots and lots of disks on it and
your client was at 30 to 60 port number
yeah okay TCP port number 30 to 60 is
the I scuzzy port and we can we can
network boot various operating systems
and we that were booted a we should
network you know Linux don't want people
to think that you know we sit around all
day long booting Windows but we get lots
of requests for booting Windows so we
can do that too
but things there are so many other ways
you can boot Linux yeah there are so
many other ways that you can boot Linux
that it's kind of like not as exciting
to people because everybody does that
but we're a boot loader we boot what we
given if we didn't we wouldn't be a
bootloader so this is where I scuzzy
becomes a really interesting protocol um
did you want photo Orson ah you know
let's do it let's do it let's do the
Ubuntu lazybone to here or a bun too so
let's do let's do the a bun too I scuzzy
but you know this is this is where we're
open-source projects
sort of like where you find out whether
whether you really believe in what
you're doing because when we first
implemented I scuzzy booting support
Microsoft sent lawyers after us because
they claimed that the low memory table
that we were using something called the
IBF T I scuzzy boot firmware table it's
a little table in memory where you dump
the information about where you're
booting where where the native Windows
driver is supposed to continue the boot
from when you hand off they actually
claimed that that was proprietary and
that like we were we were not allowed to
implement that as it turned out IBM was
their partner in this and IBM published
their specification and so eventually
after consultation with the software
freedom Law Center we were able to
implement our code based on the IBM
specification which is just slightly
more complete than the Microsoft
specification and life was good again
but this is the adventures that you have
an open-source where you want to do
something because you can you want to do
something that seems perfectly normal
and natural and sometimes you have to
look at things that seem like they're
really out-of-band to the problem in
order to get the problem right so oh you
did it yeah well there we are okay
same same process here instead of
loading the NT loader off of the boot
block we loaded grub off the boot block
grub had the illusion that it's in 13
calls were being serviced by some discs
but hahaha it was us and then about
halfway through the booting process
the native Linux driver did its thing
and blah blah blah
you get the idea all right um any
questions
wow we must be good
yeah this question the question was do
we have do we have images for memory
sticks do we have memories for ISOs or
do we have images for ISOs do we have
memories for floppy disks do we have
images for you just about name it why
yes we do so if you're using a hey
Michael do a QEMU boot just to show that
we can do it a lot of people are into
these virtual machines what we're into
our latest sort of kick is booting
virtual machines from virtual disks so
firing up QEMU and booting it from a
server in England you know just because
you can what this does is it not only
virtualizes the Machine and whatever
storage it is but it virtualizes the
boot source so you can imagine like you
know booting from someplace
give me a sure way your spoon not mine
- don't gesture oh okay GSM noise
yeah GSN noise sorry about that okay Tom
what you doing Michael um keep talking
cuz my laptop crashed two minutes ago
had to reboot it oh okay
what Michaels going to do is to create a
disk image for QEMU so essentially what
QM you will think is it will think it's
booting off of a floppy but the floppy
will actually be a G pixie what we call
a P disk or a padded disk image q mu
wants one point four megabyte images it
just does you know you can't give it a
40 K floppy image or it gets upset with
you and what it's going to do is
essentially boot off that startup G
pixie and presumably food off of
something interesting I'm gonna beat
this one here unless you've got any
better ideas oh go for it
is that machine up do we know that's my
laptop oh okay
that machine is up
keep talking okay sorry you shouldn't
give me another warning you wanted me to
do this okay let me tell you about some
of the other things that we can do in
terms of booting we work with box we
work with QAM you
what's his KVM thing Peter KVM yeah it's
a hardware accelerated version of qmu
it's probably the easiest way to
describe it okay so we work with a whole
bunch of emulators we work with VMware
so you can test booting various
operating systems in VMware using using
G pick C and it's actually quite cute
tell me - do you want to do one of the
Hey look there we go so what is it that
we are booting I'll tell you if it works
yes it doesn't um it's just the same
demo you saw earlier with an HTTP boot
but this time done in VM we do lots of
the development in VMs because before we
had gdb it was impossible to actually
debug on real Hardware in any meaningful
way other than using printf resident EMU
can't be single step through things
particularly in box box is a great VM
for debugging because you can single set
the CPU through any kind of contortion
you want so if for example you're trying
to debug your mode transition code going
from real to protected mode you can do
that in box you can single step through
it and see everything is happening
whereas you try doing that any other way
and you're stuck this is really cool
because virtual machines are so
ubiquitous now that it seems like having
virtual boot sources makes that a great
amount of sense so it's almost time to
wrap up and with the last ten minutes
all questions are fair game if any if it
comes to mind and while you're thinking
about it I'll sort of give you a summary
of the ether boot project
I swung up the ether boot project
webpage because we didn't make any
PowerPoint slides or you know impress
slides we we this project has been going
on for 13 years mostly because some of
us think that Network booting is about
the coolest thing we ever saw and so we
keep trying to find new and cool ways to
do it
if you think of anything that we aren't
doing that you think would be cool to
see do let us know because you know
these long winter nights we find
ourselves desiring to hack on on kind of
neat and weird stuff we thank you we
boot let's go the how-to guides this is
one of my favorite parts of the project
as project leader one of the things I do
a lot is to try and get more people
involved in an ether boot and one of the
ways to do that is to realize that not
everybody is going to be a world-class
kernel or hardware hacker but a lot of
people come in who have figured out neat
applications of the technology we turned
our entire web page into a wiki and what
we do is that people come on and they
have a problem and we help them we'll
ask them if they wouldn't mind creating
a page or editing a page on the wiki or
if something didn't seem like it was
clear and we had to you know we work
with them for like an hour to helping
them debug something we just asked them
to like add something to the wiki and it
works really well we've gotten some
really neat things like installing it
you know server it's it's like Windows
Server 2008 hey why don't we let me boot
one of those we got a few minutes
you know I boot so we got we got Vista
and Windows Server 2008 to boot under G
pixie but there's such pigs they load
slow slowly that they make a really kind
of an annoyingly slow demo even on a
Gigabit card but we can show them to you
anyway just just
so you can see what they do any
questions about the project or Network
booting in general G must be good this
is scary Michael and then - anything to
add um no no I'm kind of curious to know
what uses if any people are putting G
pixie - here given that we've had
patches contributed I'm assuming you're
actually using it I think it tells but
then they'd have to kill us
yeah where's Andrew Andrew yeah so I
knew we were like hanging out on IRC one
day and like we started getting these
patches from like Andrew shrine friend
we started getting his patches from
Andrew Shran you know and so like you
know who's this Andrew strand guy and he
just kept saying them and they were they
know it was cool code you know I was
like yeah it seems like a useful thing
and so you know we got to talking and
you know I finally was it was an intern
here and he's the one who made most of
the arrangements to set this talk up so
I want to thank Andrew Shran for like
going through the the maze of like forms
and websites and things like this table
required a thing and like you know
getting you know every little piece of
everything required stuff and we're
really grateful for you for doing that
nickel we want to thank you for for
tcp-ip
two years ago and for more Michael magic
we had a suite of sang where we just say
mmm because Michael writes code when you
watch Michael write code online it's
weird because it comes out looking like
it's done even when it's not yeah this
just like comes out perfectly formatted
and logical
I want to thank Marcus go chica for like
not only like letting me like crash at
your place but also for starting to
ether boot project and I thank Peter Ann
van for Pixy Linux
and for helping us to see the one true
way of get as we were leaving CVS we had
momentary illusions that that we should
just move it all into SPN and Peter said
why would you do that do you know and so
we ended up and get and it's been great
you know it took a little while to get
up to speed were you there the first
year we were using get oh okay okay the
first year get was a little weird a
bunch of CBS knew be you know CBS you
know but but Peter was there and he
helped us and of course on I think
Michael Brown because Michael Brown is
an amazing hacker and if we I often tell
people that being in the eater boot
project or being in a very small open
source project you're kind of looking at
the core of the ether boot project you
know the and and the founder you know 13
years ago it's a lot like being in a
rock and roll band it's kind of like if
any of us isn't online or if any of us
isn't there or if any of us are bummed
out because you know something's not
going right you feel it in the project
and you know that also works the other
way when we're all hacking together when
we're all in the channel you've been
there and everybody is like sort of like
you know it's like 2:00 a.m. and we're
like debugging something and we finally
get it to work it's such a rush so I
just want you to know you know I'm kind
of like the lead singer I'm like the
frontman but you know I know that we
have the best guitarist in the world yes
and I know that like this guy is scary
yes there's nothing there's nothing
scarier than having your code go up on a
large screen you know with that with HPA
you know you're having your ethernet
drivers you know up on the screen but
thank you all for coming we really
enjoyed being here and ether boot org
Rama Matic net and we ain't done yet
