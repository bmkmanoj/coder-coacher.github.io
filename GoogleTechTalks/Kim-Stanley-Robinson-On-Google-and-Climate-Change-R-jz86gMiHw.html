source programs office and it is my
extreme pleasure today to introduce Kim
Stanley Robinson he is both a Hugo and a
never award-winning science-fiction
author who presents us with a rather
challenging view of the near future in
his latest trilogy about climate change
he's here today to talk to us about
climate change in google and i would ask
you all to welcome Kim Stanley Robinson
Thank You Kat thanks for the
introduction and thanks for having me I
am indeed gun and talk about Google and
climate change and it's a good time to
be talking about it because it's a busy
week in the world of climate change we
have the conference going on down in
valley right now to try to set up the
successor to the Kyoto treaty and the
Nobel Prize a little while ago and
really an ongoing flood of scientific
reports on the situation everything from
the bottom of the ocean to the top of
the atmosphere is being gauged to try to
figure out what's going on and what we
can predict or not predict it's also
true that with this Senate energy bill
the energy bill out of Congress is
passed in the house but it's stalled in
the Senate there's only 53 votes so that
a 60-vote override a veto cannot happen
and the objections at this point are to
a 15-percent renewable energy
requirement by the year twenty 20 and a
21 billion dollar tax on the oil
industry both of which are not
acceptable to the people opposed to the
bill so it is styled at this moment and
on the floor of the House of
Representatives a representative from
Georgia brought a chunk of coal into the
house and put it on the table and said
what's going to become of this if we
pass this bill so this is the world that
we live in right now and so
the one that everything I'd like to add
about this week is that Senator John
Warner had voted against a weaker
version of this bill just a couple of
years ago and yet he is a co-sponsor of
the bill this year and people asked him
what had changed his mind and this was
his answer and I want us to remember
this thought because it's an important
phrase it's a John Warner has managed to
encapsulate the reason why we might be
interested in climate change right now
and what we're going to end up doing
about it now you get so many messages
out of the media and I wanted to
highlight what I call the disconnect in
the the gross discrepancy between
certain messages the IPCC and many other
scientists are calling for like eighty
percent reduction in carbon emissions by
the year 2050 some call for ninety
percent we have a chance of reaching 450
parts per million of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere that would probably raise
the average temperatures by about 2
degrees Celsius if we get up to 560
parts per million than we've probably
had three degrees Celsius rise in
average temperatures and at that point
the planet is cooked so to speak
irreversible change and and a tremendous
damage and so at the same time new oil
fields like the gigantic one discovered
off the coast of Brazil have been
discovered to great joy and fanfare and
one coal plant a week is being built in
China and elsewhere in the world coal
plants are still being built that are
emitting carbon into the atmosphere and
many people are beginning to call for
climate adaptation rather than climate
mitigation with the idea that this is a
train that we cannot stop that we're on
and so there are this gigantic diversion
divergence in our in our attitudes
towards the situation coming out of
essentially the same culture in the same
body of information and this is always
fascinated me as a novelist how can we
be looking at the same picture and as
human beings come up with such red
divergent interpretations of what's
going on to the point of being in
grotesque conflict with each other and
the answer really I think and this is
something that we're going to be
discussing for the entire rest of the
talk is ideology and I wanted to share
with you Alto sirs definition because I
think it's particularly useful one
because of what it does is it takes
ideologies out of the realm of a
pejorative where you would say well
you're being ideological but I'm being
correct and this is a very common usage
of the word but what I want to emphasize
here is that we all have an ideology and
not only that but its necessary because
reality is too big and too overwhelming
for us to be able to comprehend it
without various kinds of filters and
interpretive devices in our minds
concepts etc and these altogether
function as an imaginative relationship
so there's two things there is a real
situation out there it's real it's real
and the same for everybody but of course
our imaginary relationship with this
real situation is partial and it's
tempered by our thoughts and our
concepts and so you you can't buy
without an ideology if you were without
one it would be a kind of a form of
maybe mental retardation or a disability
in that you would be overwhelmed and
maybe maybe you could say that autistic
people don't have an ideology or
something like that but let's admit that
everybody has one and for someone like
me who has lived all my life with
spectacles on it's a easy metaphor to
think of an ideology as a kind of a set
of spectacles that what you would want
out of an ideology is perhaps the
biggest view screen the most clarity the
fewest number of blind spots the fewest
number of blinders the idea that maybe
you could see the whole picture rather
than the top half of the picture in that
you would want to maybe grind your
lenses in a continual process to try to
clarify your vision and see more
understand more so that as
mathematicians would say you would have
more more power and elegance to your
ultimate vision and and things would
make more sense in a way that doesn't
involve grotesque contradictions etc and
that would be what you would want out of
your ideology but that we all have them
so from that point of view and if you
think of I maybe I could
say very briefly that my own ideology
would be very similar to perhaps what
John Warner said science and my
grandchildren I'm a science fiction
writer I'm always trying to look at our
moment from the point of view of the
future a few generations down the line
to see what it illuminates and then
science it strikes me as the is the most
powerful intellectual methodology that
we have so by coincidence i believe
senator john warner came very close to
describing what i would like to call my
own ideology so and from that point of
view from the point of view of science
and our grandchildren this situation is
getting really really severe because the
when we say climate change we don't just
mean climate change we are using it as
metonymy or it may be that it's cynic
doke i have to admit that even though
i've been a rhetoric instructor my
entire life I've never fully comprehend
the distinction between metonymy &amp;amp; senic
doke but in any case the part for the
whole when we say the White House and we
mean the whole administration when they
say the land belongs to the crown they
don't mean that the crown owns the land
and so that's what metonymy is and when
we say climate change we're using it
conveniently and sometimes in a way that
distorts the full situation in order to
mean really the full environmental
degradation that's going on right now
and I don't want to waste any time in
this talk rehearsing things that we all
already know already so I'm not really
going to go to take too much time here
but I would want to point out the ocean
acidification the co2 that we're putting
up in the atmosphere a certain
percentage of it gets up taked by the
ocean and it acidifies the ocean and the
ph of the ocean has changed from its
first measured levels till now and has
become more acidic by a degree that is
measurable and is leading to the notion
that it could be dangerous for those
smallest sea creatures who make their
shells out of calcium carbonates and who
may not be able to survive a shift
toward a more acid ocean base and these
little creatures form part of the bottom
level of the food pyramid inside the
ocean and we all know from our 3rd grade
science classes that when the bottom of
a food
collapses everything above it is in big
trouble and of course we are at the top
of that food chain along with many other
creatures so that we when people talk
about climate change and they say well
it really has to do with the air the
temperature the weather we can probably
farm better if it gets warmer we can
turn on the air conditioner we can
survive the occasional extreme weather
events we just have to up our insurance
policies etc etc what they're avoiding
talking about even though they usually
know it at that moment is everything
else that's going along along with
climate change partly causal partly
result partly independently being caused
by the effects of human impact on the
environment and so it's not just the
climate and when someone like Bjorn
Lomborg who was here at Google in August
says well quit focusing on climate so
much you know really we have very much
worse problems than climate to me this
is not a reassuring notion it doesn't
mean that you can then forget about
climate what it means is that climate is
just one symptom of a much larger
problem that we have to deal with all
together so the result is that the
scientific community has been going off
like a an alarm in a hotel it's it's
unique in history it's never happened
before that scientists have spoken as a
community and as scientists about a
emergency situation for society at large
by and large the scientific community
has been happy to stay in their labs and
in the field and doing their work that's
what they want to do that's what they
like and even during the nuclear
standoff of the Cold War most of the
scientific community gave it over to the
nuclear scientists to go ahead and sound
the alarm about the dangers of a nuclear
holocaust figuring that otherwise it was
obvious and they didn't need to disturb
themselves and they could keep on with
their work in the last five years that
just hasn't been true there has been an
outcry like never before there are about
ten scientific articles and media
articles per day in the major media
online that can be collated and put out
there and antenna day quickly begins to
add up because
each one of them seems very significant
and is saying something new in major and
with all of the impacts that I described
to you in the previous slide that add on
with climate change the question is
becoming in the scientific community is
it already too late can we do anything
about this situation or are we merely
imagining that we can do something about
climate change when it's too late it
mark Wally brooker a climate scientists
from Washington published an interesting
essay in science magazine suggesting
that we only can burn about 720
gigatonnes of carbon between now and the
the 560 parts per million limit that
will put us into irreversible damage he
suggested that there should be a carbon
pi and that it should be basically
population-based that each person on the
planet had the right to about 16 billion
of the burn of that 720 gigatonnes and
so that meant that the developed world
the major industrial countries the major
emitters really only deserved about
twenty percent of the remaining carbon
burn that we have left to us in this
century and that puts us down to about
150 giga tons and we are burning it at a
rate of about eight per year so
essentially the industrial world has
about twenty-five years left and then
they've used up their allotted share now
this ignores the political realities
that in fact the developed world owns
most of that carbon and has no intention
of dividing it up on an equal population
basis with the rest of the world but
it's a measure of the scientists kind of
desperation to search for new ways to
talk about the emergency Hansen James
Hansen of NASA has become quite famous
talking about this and haines recently
compared the coal trains to the trains
of the Holocaust leading to the death
camps a rather shocking statement that
got him quite a bit of controversy as a
result but what you see is that the
scientists are getting really really
alarmed because we don't seem to be
responding as fast as we need to this is
the most recent a very wonderful USGA
nasa combined internet photo of
antarctica and i put it in there because
the the part of antarctica that is not
sea ice in the middle that is pure white
is the about the size of the united
states and mexico combined and it's
nicely divided across the middle by the
Transantarctic mountains so that the
eastern antarctic ice sheet is the lower
one that is closer to us the western
antarctic ice sheet is the smaller one
that is more say the shape of mexico but
pointing up towards South America there
and when the Transantarctic SAR the the
uneven line dividing the two well the
western antarctic ice sheet is the one
that is resting on ground but the ground
is below sea level so it's a weight of
about six to eight thousand feet cake of
ice that is that is so heavy that it's
on ground but that ground is below sea
level that's an unstable configuration
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet can come
off with a little bit more warming and
it has come off frequently in the
Earth's past because once it gets warmer
and it starts to break up at the edges
the tides rip at it and it slides off
into the sea and at that point you've
got a 8,000 foot tall cake of ice
dropping into the sea and ninety percent
of it goes underwater like like icebergs
do and that's why if the Western
Antarctic Ice Sheet were to come off you
would have a rise of sea-level worldwide
that would be about seven meters in
other words about 23 feet and we'd be in
water right in this room I believe but
it's certainly about a quarter of the
world's population would be affected and
you call that maybe two billion people
by the time it happens and you get
something like a thousand Katrina's in
terms of the number of people displaced
and we can't handle a thousand Katrina's
we couldn't even handle the one and it's
an indication of the severity of the
problem and it's only really it's no
spectacular of the disasters that could
happen but there are others like the
stopping of the monsoon or the melting
of the Himalayan glaciers in a disk a
destruction of the water source for most
of the Asian populations around the
Himalayas
would be equally devastating to humanity
and are just as likely and probably more
likely than they are quicker than the
coming off of the Western Antarctic Ice
Sheet so there's a in an attempted grasp
it even an analysis of is there a
solution at this point this scientists
have gone gone into a number of
different studies and one of the most
famous of them is by a solo and pakala
this was in Scientific American just
last year in 2006 the wedge concept that
you take the circle diagram i think is
best for this point and sorry for my
reproductions i only really mean to show
you the wedges themselves and the way
that they've been portrayed differently
in different kinds of articles and the
reason that I I wanted to do that will
become clear shortly but in any case
each one of these wedges if it was
pursued fully would lead over the next
three or four decades to a savings in
carbon burn so that the bottom left
there shows you the carbon burn if we
did nothing and then each wedge if
effectively pursued would cut it back
down to the blue thing at the bottom
would be if we had pursued all of them
successfully over time and what I this
made me think that these days of
graphically representing the problem are
a little bit inadequate you know it's
not intuitive when you look at any of
these how they were going to work and I
want to remind you of the great graph by
men are this is Napoleon's invasion of
Moscow in 1812 this is as it says
probably the best statistical graphic
ever drawn and what it made me a wonder
is could we have google graphics one of
the things that Google is among many
other things is information technology
and the processing of information
technology to clarify the issue and the
conceptual understanding depends on
visual representation human beings are
very much better and understanding a
situation if they see it and can imagine
it visually in their mind spatially so
it seems to me that one thing that
Google could be doing is is het is
having a really top-notch graphics
department that begins to try to
represent the problem of climate change
better than it has ever been before it
also occurred to me that that wouldn't
be a bad model right therefore what we
hope for carbon you know in the next
century it should be like Napoleon's
March and start out with 450,000 people
and end up with about 10,000 people at
the end of the winter that this is the
21st century carbon story if we can if
we can make it happen so that this leads
to my notion that there really ought to
be a kind of Google climate that you
have information sorted because we have
the famous drinking from the firehose
problem once again there's so much news
it comes in every day at a rate of 10
articles a day there's a atmospheric
scientists at University of Illinois
named Michael Schlessinger who's doing a
wonderful service and collecting all of
the internet articles about climate that
he can find and then and then sending
them along to a list that he is compiled
of I don't know how many people but it
strikes me that that is a very
labor-intensive and incredibly useful
service that he's providing for free and
on his own recognizance to try to do
what he can to help but google has a lot
more resources and might be able to do
this not only more completely but also
do it for its entire client base in a
way so and then also prioritizing this
is a famous problem but it seems to me
that and it takes human judgment to do
it but it seems to me that maybe one
thing Google could be involved with is
providing a little bit of prioritization
so that it's the most important climate
news that comes through to your client
ill and not just everything so that you
provide a little stopper on the fire
hose and get it back down to drinking
fountain size are the other things it
would be neat if when you go into the
Google homepage that you could find out
how much electricity your house was
burning that very moment it would be
neat if you could to calculate your your
personal carbon burn and the and use
also ecological footprint measurements
we're now using amino ecological
footprint measurements on the global
scale we're now using like 1.3 Earth's
we passed the the carrying capacity
limit
the planet back around nineteen ninety
as far as people can tell but this is a
very difficult thing to judge and so
it'd be interesting to go into and I put
mission architectures in there because
this is the word that I used before the
invention of this wedge diagram the idea
that what would be interesting would be
to describe everything that we could do
and have analyzed it on a cost-benefit
way that actually includes real costs
real benefits political problems the
advantages and disadvantages of each one
of the methods and then also put them on
a timeline of okay we need to do this
then and then that will lead to the
other thing and slowly but surely the
developments necessary to get our carbon
burned down in a timely fashion would be
described in full this is a project that
is an information technology project and
at Google is as well equipped to do it
as anybody and is a more publicly placed
to dispense disperse that information
afterwards which is one of the problems
if you are say at a small University and
you manage to do this beautiful thing
the dispersal of that knowledge is not
quite as certain for somebody in a small
science department in a small University
than it is for for you guys so something
to be thought of oh boy let's do the
next okay just very quickly even if you
had a good mission architecture and
really I think that's one of the easier
parts of the problem because it none of
these things require new technologies
although many of them can be improved
but mostly the problems come in the
following areas really the scale is huge
when you like compare this to the ozone
hole layer problem the the ozone layer
had a hole in it it was a matter of
chlorofluorocarbons hex Oh Florence
being inserted into the atmosphere we
gathered together international treaty
was passed to say let's not do that
anymore and it pretty much those
chemicals stopped entering the
atmosphere although it's been a little
bit compromised lately but those were
refrigerator coolants and air
conditioning fluid and so
quantities were small in this case we're
talking about the carbon burn and really
it comes down to everything our energy
our creation of our energy systems and
our transport are the two biggest
factors but we are burning carbon in a
way that really makes refrigerator
coolant look like nothing whatsoever so
the scale is huge the inertia path
dependency they sometimes call it any
technology you said into place is going
to continue to be used and to continue
to emit whatever it emits for 10 years
20 years 30 years and so we are path
dependent in especially in the sense of
infrastructure and technology but
there's also a path dependency in law
and in culture and these are often
pretended to be of asthma as massively
entrenched as the infrastructure
although we see rapid cultural change
from time to time so that we know that
it isn't quite true and it's possibly a
political stance to say that oh you
could never change the law or oh you
could never change the way people are
which means our culture only so i
mentioned quickly you know this bad
feedback it's at one of these weird
ironies that if we were to have clean
coal for our coal plants we would not be
putting up the sulfur in the atmosphere
that appears to be the reason why we
have solar dimming we're only getting
ninety percent of the sunlight that we
got when we started to measure it and
it's a little mysterious why I mean
that's a big difference but apparently
it's because a lot of the light is
bouncing out because of the sulfur that
we've put up there so we get clean coal
we're going to get ten percent more
sunlight and so in climate terms this is
problem and then lastly active human
opposition there are going to be people
who are going to be fighting tooth and
nail to keep any of these reforms from
happening that's just the way it is we
see it happening in the Senate floor
that's very weak we see it happening in
Bali and we're and it's never going to
go away so this is really too bad but
it's inevitable and I think all you can
say at this point is that it's an
ideological problem we need to try to
convince as many people as we can that
this is real and important and also take
comfort in the fact that many times in
the democracies you only need to
convince
you know fifty percent of the people or
maybe sixty percent if you need to
override a veto but that you don't have
to convince a hundred percent of the
people and that's good because yeah oh
okay so you can block with 60 but it
takes 67 to override a veto sorry yeah I
I knew that but I've been Miss speaking
myself well let's end this for this
purpose let's just say you need 51%
let's hope that by and large the problem
is severe enough that the minority that
is constantly going to remain opposed to
this effort are either going to be
convinced or rendered politically
inoperative so that we can get this done
in a timely fashion the people ask me
you know as a novelist you know explain
these people in and I want to just
remind you of a joke word invented by
Karl Popper Monica zotac so filia the
love of single causes that explain
everything and this is a love that we
all kind of have it would be so nice it
would be convenient if we could explain
everything with a single cause and you
see physicists still grasping after the
grand unified theory you see
fundamentalist of all kinds taking a
great deal of comfort in the idea that
there's this one explanation that
explains everything you see economic
fundamentalists like free market
fundamentalists who really grasp for the
single explanation the single mechanism
that would make everything possible but
when you talk to biologists or when you
look at the diagram of the genome and
realize that's really only part of the
story even when you talk to physicists
and they say oh what we do have the
single explanation it's you know it's
it's it's really simple it's it's
quantum mechanics and then you think
okay well if that's the simple solution
I don't want to see the hard solution
and so we've got to get past I think
this notion that there will ever be a
single cause that explains everything
and we also are going to have to get
past an economic system that relies on
it
being the ultimate the ultimate way to
deal with these affairs because we live
within an economic system that is truly
inadequate to the problem that we have
right now is it the economic system does
a couple of things that are wrong for
big flaws first physical reality isn't
properly accounted for many real costs
are externalized and not counted in the
price of things and this has caused one
of the basic discrepancies that is never
accounted for in standard capitalist
economics and the other problem with it
is that it retains the the hierarchical
power structure of its predecessor
historically of feudalism that
essentially it's a nice thing to
remember this this this conceptual
rubric of residual and emergent with the
idea that at any given moment in our
history there is a lot that is residual
from previous moments in history that
has never gone away and one of them is
the power structure of feudalism we
still have a tiny amount of human beings
who have an enormous amount of wealth
and power and it doesn't matter that the
power the basis of power has gone from
land to money that this only liquidity
is the basis of power makes it a little
bit more mobile but the power structure
remains and I'll get to later when we
start discussing population issues why
that would be a bad thing but we need to
admit complexity especially in human
affairs and we need to admit that the
the solution to this problem is likely
to be multivalent and that it is not
going to be a market solution only and
that if a choice comes between
continuing to make profits and rescuing
the world from a giant national natural
catastrophes that we actually have to do
the rescue work and change the economic
model and so there are many alternatives
that are coming into place here if you
google post capitalism you actually get
a really meager set of listings they're
very partial their small-scale they are
often out of date and they're tall
in about little local situations
essentially even though we know that
feudalism became before capitalism we
never think about what comes after
capitalism and it's not being theorized
and this is another one of the
weaknesses of economics that it only
describes a system of laws as if those
laws are eternal as if they're like
gravity but in fact they're not like
gravity at all they're a system of laws
that is always being changed and so be
nice to have a theory of where we were
going to and in that first 10 listings
that come up on Google when you put in
post capitalist economics there is one
really interesting book called
participatory economics by Albert and
Han and one of the things that would be
interesting about studying that a little
bit further is that it would be very
computer intensive you would need a
almost a gigantic information exchange
to make that particular economic system
work and then if you are curious about
my objections to capitalism you could
find a fuller description of them here
in the books that I've decided but the
problem with theory is that really where
problem is right now and as the IP CC
head said we've got like three years
left and so a giant new economic system
is not going to be enacted in that time
so you need to look at things that are
happening in the world right now that
might indicate ways that will help us to
deal with this problem in the future
where the Commons are accepted as being
real and as being important and as
having an economic value that can be
costed out so I would recommend looking
at the town of Mondragon Spain which is
run as a system of nested coops
including the banks and the credit
unions and Kerala India Cuba Scandinavia
even France simply because in France it
seems to me at least up until recently
the idea that quality of life was more
important than economic efficiency this
is what makes it so shocking and
insulting to certain Americans that just
stating that idea that quality of human
life is more important than economic
efficiency as an insult and needs to be
slapped down instantaneously it we need
to go back to that notion because
otherwise it seems to me that you've got
economics backwards at it's very basis
so maybe there should be goo
economics this is information technology
that's really what economics is and so
far I say although there are many
interesting economic studies the field
as a whole doesn't have a good paradigm
doesn't have a forward-looking mechanism
it makes the mistake that in literature
departments we call the pathetic fallacy
in in literature if you think that if
you say that nature has intention and
emotions like Victorians might do in
their poetry then this is the pathetic
fallacy the notion the fallacy that
nature has pathos it has emotions well
in economics i think is doing the
reverse it's saying that the human world
is like the laws of physics or is is is
unchangeable as the world of physics and
can be described by mathematical models
when it isn't really true so maybe it's
not the pathetic fallacy maybe it's the
the ridiculous fallacy but in any case
we don't have a good economic model and
it seems to me that not only could
Google look into that and began to study
it as an information technology but also
can could and he already has i think
began to in try it out a little bit
in-house one way or another so if you
were to do a google economics if you
were to try to do it a fuller analysis
of our current moment and what humans
might do about it you almost certainly
would end up taking another look at the
politics ipad formula from the i think
from the 1980s a argument over what was
creating the most environmental impact
the first world or the third world was
finally I think resolved by admitting
that it was a combination of the of what
they called population times affluence
time technology now this is not a an
equation that works as a mathematical
thing you cannot plug in numbers in each
one of these categories and then
multiply them and get another number
this is a metaphorical equation and if
you double the population it's not
necessarily true that you will double in
mathematical sense the results that you
get any time you can replace the
the multiple multiplying symbols with
addition stumbles and you still have a
workable equation that's when you know
you've got a metaphorical equation and
that's what we have here but it's a
useful teaching device and what it does
is give you a way to talk about the
various aspects of our current
environmental crisis and break it down
the the first one I want to talk about
is technology the because this is
exactly where Google has made its
initiative that it just announced a
couple of weeks ago the idea that they
were going to invest 100 million dollars
in finding a renewable energy source
that was a cheaper than coal and then
coal plants which is a very worthy goal
and a good first place to start looking
as a company particularly one like
Google and given its capacities and it's
also good to have focused in on solar
energy and not just photovoltaic but on
heat engines that's a that's a smart
move because there's a lot of
improvements that can be made there and
there's already a Southern California
Edison plant being built that will have
like a 500 megawatt plant which is
really a full size power plant that it
will be made out of mirrors reflecting
the sun's light onto an heating element
that will then hate steam or move
turbines in a different way and so once
again it's very computer heavy in that
you in there in the workings of the
mirrors and in the maximizing of the
effect of the device and then every one
of the else are the ones that I've
mentioned here I think is known to
everybody and they all have the
potential of a small savvy investment
making a big difference in how much they
will work in the real world and in and
really quickly so that I think that all
of these methods should be looked into
and I only want to mention one clean
shipping what does that mean well once
you get a series of giant shipping
shipping containers onto a ship and
moving to a different continent which is
really happening all over the world all
over the oceans right now and it's and
as a major polluter because of their
giant diesel engines it doesn't really
matter if you have a perpetual
how long that ship takes to get from
point A to point B which means that they
all could be sail sail ships they you
could have very very big ships with
computer controlled and modern materials
the crew sizes would be larger it would
be less economically efficient using the
current rubric of what efficiency is but
on the other hand it would be utterly
clean power and wouldn't be adding any
carbon whatsoever you could make the
cruise coed you could make them colleges
you could make them universities and or
party party ships one way or another you
could make a life at sea quite
interesting it's not as if we have full
employment right now and so there's the
possibility I think of making enormous
savings there by simply changing the
paradigm as to how we do our shipping
the other areas I think are obvious and
the only other one I want to talk about
here is the angel investing the idea
that instead of just being venture
capital we're always capital is being
invested with the idea that it needs to
make a profit and really fast like
within the next couple of years the this
so-called angel investing where people
who have enough money to that is
discretionary somehow that they can find
the important technologies and bring
them to across the valley of death the
bridge between the beautiful research
ideas that never actually get enacted in
the real world and if you look at the
history of Technology you see the
history of things like the diesel engine
or the light bulb of the telephone you
realize that all these could have
remained in the lab and that it is a
tricky process to get from the
innovative research idea to full-on
production and yet these are
technologies that are actually intensely
needed because we have to have renewable
energy if we're going to continue going
the way we are i also just put at the
bottom i mean so much of google's work
has been open source which is something
i would like to learn a whole lot more
about but what if these solar plants
what if there was a solar heat engine
plant that was like village sized if the
engineering was completely done the
costing out the actual investment maybe
there would be bonds the the of course
the initial investment in a power plant
is intense but if after that you have
got free clean energy
okay on a renewable basis it might be
worth doing and spreading and the
advantages the the return to the company
that invents this stuff would be
manifold and it might not come in
immediate profit but it would come so as
a science fiction writer I have to
address this issue because it's coming
up all the time now we're in such
desperate straits should we get into geo
engineering and these are the obvious
ones that I've heard about everybody has
I think to me the unintended
consequences of the biological methods
are really scary particularly messing
with the ocean but on land you know it
would be equally problematic if
something got out of control and we
don't know what will happen if you put
iron in the ocean yeah you get more
plankton yeah they sink to the bottom of
the sea or below the 100 meter limit and
then that's a lot of carbon disappeared
but what else happens we don't know and
we already have as I pointed out a
problematic enough situation in the
ocean the physical methods I think are
safer you know you can you can shoot
stuff up in space and see what happens
but they're outrageously expensive and
so it's hard for me to imagine that we
will decide to do it and also as a
culture we are so bad at coming to
consensus on on big issues right now
that the idea that we would deliberately
mess with the Earth's climate even
though we've accidentally done so as a
by-product to deliberately do so with
the idea that we're going to supposedly
control the results i think is pretty
much an impossible goal right now and so
i would say let's not do the google
terraforming let's that maybe that could
be an emergency measure maybe in the 20
60s in this very room somebody will be
outlining all of the things that are
possible to do that might reduce the
temperature on earth and maybe the you
know they'll all be ankle deep in water
at the time it would be very a dramatic
situation but that's for another time
and meanwhile i think all it does is
leech energy away from the
decarbonisation project people be
thinking well okay maybe we don't get
rid of the carbon but we can always
throw up you know 12 trillion little
plan
big balls into space and they'll bounce
out the sunlight away will be saved in
the end and so let's not worry so much
about the carbon burn I think we need to
worry about the carbon burn and so I
don't think it's the time to talk about
geoengineering yet population a very
interesting book on this in terms of
demographics I have heard you know how
many people can their support these are
carrying capacity estimates i have read
estimates ranging from 100 million to 12
trillion and that is a afore magnitude
difference so it's like you get
scientists in a room and you say well
how many tennis balls are on the floor
and and one of them says well there's a
you know there's a hundred tennis balls
here on the floor and the other one says
no there's a hundred thousand well this
is a big difference and it seems to
indicate there's a problem going on and
indeed those two estimates the hundred
million estimate comes out of the deep
ecology movement and seems to regard
humanity as a kind of a parasite and be
better off with less of us and then the
12 trillion estimate comes from a
physicist in Britain who seemed to
translate the amount of insulation solar
energy hitting the earth directly into
human calories with no intermediate
steps whatsoever so those I estimates
can be thrown out as outliers the strong
estimates I've heard range from about 2
billion to about 30 billion and this is
satisfactory because it's within the
same magnitude but it still is a pretty
big spread if it's two billion then
we've already over shot by a long
distance if it's 30 billion then we have
a little bit of a comfort range when you
go to the UN demographics which are
maybe like the IPCC maybe that's the
best you can get you get carrying
capacity estimates of anywhere between
say you know 6 and 15 and the
demographers at the UN were predicting
that we would have somewhere between 10
and 15 billion before it topped off now
that prediction is about 20 or 30 years
old and has been revised downward and it
has happened because of the effects of
women's rights on populations growth
within one generation in countries like
Thailand Indonesia and the prosperous
half of Mexico
you have seen the reproduction rate go
from about seven children / mother to
about two and this happened in one
generation as a result of social changes
and so that's when you get to this point
where social justice becomes a climate
change technology that we need
population reduction and you can't do it
by way of population control which is a
phrase a pair of words that will make
most politicians in every human being
shudder it goes back to China's
one-child policy and I idea of a big
brother telling you how many kids you
could have nobody likes it population
reduction however is probably something
that we need every year the world's
population goes up by about 75 million
people which is about the population of
say the British Isles and no matter how
many progress you make in other areas
you get this increasing population that
is burdening the whole system so it
seems to me there should be also Google
demographics because again this is an
information technology it should be
studied I think it collated and talked
about how many people can live on this
planet sustainably over the long haul in
a steady state and then talk about
population reduction strategies as
something that Google will get involved
in defining discussing and maybe even
promulgating or advocating so that
implies Google Washington the idea of a
lobbying firm and here really it's
diving into the swamp and mud wrestling
in the most political process there is
making the law in Washington DC that is
a very technical martial art jujitsu
kind of thing where you need to be there
you need to know the rules of the game
essentially you need a lobbying firm and
you can't just hire a top-notch lobbying
firm already in Washington DC because
amongst the multitude of their clients
they will have competing loyalties they
will not want to insult senator a on
issue be by advocating their particular
cause too hard and so they won't no
matter how much you have paid them as an
individual client needs one firm it
costs you about a million or two million
dollars to start one up
and then cost a million dollars a year
or so to run it thereafter and so Google
has just put a hundred million dollars
into improving a technology that it's
already pretty damn good this solar heat
technology so I think they could afford
you know you could afford to put in say
10 million dollars or put in 50 million
and it would be done doubt forever but
you could also run it as a ten-year
experiment because as James Hansen said
the next 10 years are the crucial ones
so that going to Washington and getting
into the mud and wrestling over each and
every law each and every clause is is
real work that is climate control work
and so naturally that kind of work also
does suggest google ads although that's
another swamp that i hesitate to
recommend to you but it's another
information technology it has to be
considered lastly affluence which at a
conference i attended somebody suggested
you change affluence to appetite because
after all what does affluence consist of
it could be actually a very low resource
burning life and you could still
depending on your health your emotional
set you could feel very affluent with a
very small expense of both money and
carbon so appetite might be a better
word for it in any case let's look at
this because we have a situation here in
the united states that is a kind of
carbon obesity crisis and it is partly
infrastructural the way that we have
built our freeways the way that we've
built our power systems with their path
dependencies so that even if we decided
okay we're going to get back to five
percent of the world's carbon bird it
would be tough to get there because of
the infrastructural problems but it's
also a cultural set it has to do with
hyper consumption it has to do with the
american culture that we live in of more
things all the time and the sense that
we are all in a rat race of perpetual
action perpetually trying to keep up to
make enough money to buy enough things
to have the life that everybody else
around us is leading because we are very
much social creatures and if you're in a
culture that's doing this kind of stuff
then you do this kind of stuff it's hard
to go against the grain it's not really
what we are designed to do
evolutionarily
and so this has gotten me thinking about
well how do you make culture change of
the sort that looks like you're asking
people to go backwards tamp down
simplify lower standards of living etc
etc these are all kind of bad sounding
things what how do you talk about this
stuff and I got interested in
contemplating questions that come out of
sociobiology what are we as social
creatures and what would make us happy
and so you go to social biology with a
certain trepidation because when it was
first introduced by EO wilson in about
nineteen seventy it was immediately
attacked as being a new kind of social
Darwinism we didn't want to hear the
news from the other primates the idea
that we're nature was red in tooth and
claw and that the primates were a matter
of alpha males wailing on everybody else
was all you know the world was already
depressing enough without the idea that
this is just human nature and we could
never escape it so the response to
sociobiology was at first quite
political and an immediate kind of
allergic response because social
Darwinism the the idea that Darwinists
evolutionary theory justified the
oppression of the strong oppressing the
week and that's just the way nature was
was already a lot of the worst
incidences of the 20th century came out
of that justification system so the
attack on sociobiology was quick however
it has since been modified both by
Wilson's own work and by the work of one
of his students Sarah hurty who lives up
in near davis near me whose book mother
nature is extremely instructive she
looked again at the primates both with
her own eyes and through the literature
and began to talk about sort of feminist
sociobiology or the notion that the
alpha male might have been like the
president in a parliamentary system you
know really useful for flag-waving
events and for ceremonial events but
that the prime minister that really got
things done in the guts of the machine
was the alpha female and so on and so
forth throughout the the description of
every single primate activity was being
reevaluated by sarah her tea in a way
that was a paradigm-shifting i think and
allows one to use social
LG to just consider where we came from
and in evolutionary terms it's rather
mysterious because in the million-year
run-up to becoming human beings the
brain grew by a factor of three in about
a million years which in evolutionary
terms is really really fast and yet we
were doing the same things throughout
that period in other words that the
technology stayed the same you can find
a cool Ian hand axes for a whole half
million years of pre human history the
same kind of all-purpose Swiss Army
knife tool never changed and the
lifestyle never changed and yet the
brain was growing like a balloon being
blown up well to me this is a kind of a
paradox that needs exploring and so you
go to what did we do during that million
years and it's pretty simple this is
what we did during that time and every
one of these activities in modern
society has been replaced i think or
augmented by technology and often made
for profit and become something that we
consume rather than we do or something
that we watch rather than we do and
simulated one way or another or
augmented and a lot of times the
augmentations are useful or exciting or
interesting but a lot of times they also
add to the health crisis that we're in
the we're not actually doing the thing
that made us human we're not actually
doing the thing that would keep our body
going some of these in particular say
looking at fire that is a powerful
experience that we don't have very often
anymore and there's a big part of our
brain ready to look at fire that hardly
ever does look at fire in fact my friend
Terry bisson says that when people go to
movie theaters what they really want is
to sit in the dark together and look at
flickering in front of them and that's
the whole point of the movies and that's
why it doesn't matter what the movie as
good as bad you still have had a good
experience to go and do that maybe there
should be a Google fire you know a
website that you go to and you're since
especially fire burns so much carbon you
need a simulated one in this case so
that in the evenings when you're around
rather than watching TV and doing other
things you just have a fire going maybe
it'll be better for health may be better
for mental health
and many of these other activities here
have a but you know they have a
commercial replacement that makes them
other than what they were to begin with
it's it's pretty obvious in certain
cases that if you have a technologically
augmented and and and have to pay for
something like sex then you don't have
the same activity that you had before
and so it we have come to what I call
the technological sublime a phrase out
of postmodern criticism that never meant
anything before but I think it means
something the things that we do in
ordinary modern life our primate brains
are freaked out by them and we do them
anyway as suppressing the terror and
enjoying the beauty of it and the
sublime was a real experience when
you're in the Paleolithic and you were
in the middle of a lightning storm it
was beautiful it was terrifying you were
there and it was amazing the Shaymin
takes you down on the cave on a special
night when you've drunk certain drinks
and had certain preparations and you go
down into the cave and suddenly there's
animals on the ceiling overhead and
they're moving and everything a sublime
experience amazing but those were
supposed to be the exception to the rule
and then everyday life would have been
this stuff okay but in the technological
sublime we actually are an ordinary life
is in the sublime all the time and Orden
and then the daily activities that
actually made us human are something
that we do on a kind of a vacation basis
you actually pay money to go off on
vacation and do these things and it
feels good and why does it feel good
it's because that's what made us this
way so I bring up to you an old English
phrase it's like on page 10 of
Bartlett's quotations it's older than
the written language itself it's not
really an American proverb right now
enough is a good as good at these you
don't really see that as the motto of
very many companies because it's not
really very good for business it's not
really good for capitalists growth which
has to be three or four percent a year
or else the entire economy freaks out
and compound growth inside a finite
system is one of the many problems that
we're running into right now so what I
like to do especially when I go to
college campuses is to say it's not a
matter of you lowering your standard
livings it's not a matter of you of you
know we torch the planet having our
party and now you have to suffer put on
your hair shirt become as a monk or a
nun and get used to deprivation because
sorry the party's over this is not a
good message and the thing is it's not
even really true because the hyper
consumption life of America the
twenty-five percent of natural resource
burn at five percent of the world's
population has not made us happier
hasn't made his healthier hasn't done
anything but made us more frantic and
wondering why in a kind of a Chinese
finger trap or one of these addiction
problems the more you do it the less
satisfied you get even though it seems
to be the goal hyper consumption
stepping back and actually going back to
these activities as often as possible
and these activities many of them are
free and many of them can be done
immediately right outside your door and
take very little augmentation although
it's nice to have a good pair of running
shoes yeah you don't want to be killed
by annals but if one chases you and you
get away you know you've had a good
moment it's been sublime and those are
important so what I'm saying is that i'm
not saying making an anti technology
argument you need good dental care you
need good anesthetics but appropriate
technology a phrase out of the 70s that
has almost gone away because we are so
inappropriate the idea that a technology
is here to make life better and that
there could be a cleaner and more
sophisticated tech that would include
clean energy that would allow us to do
all the things that we love to do but
would also augment and allow us to
actualize ourselves as primates with a
certain set of basic biological habits
that we have so that last Google I
didn't know what to call it the various
possibilities none of them actually
adequate to the situation of trying to
describe without main- without being
anti technology but talking about true
appropriate technology talking about
true human actualization
how do we get forward to a sustainable
civilization which I call permaculture
because it sounds like both permanent
and it sounds like permutation because
it will always be changing it'll just be
something that can be sustained you can
help me with that perhaps but what could
be done here there's just a few things
that I think immediately could be done
on campus you might as well have all
these meetings outdoors you've got one
of the greatest climates on earth and
you know 300 days of the year you could
have meetings outdoors and it'd be nice
for everybody concerned gardens you need
that garden it's a beautiful thing to
have and it'd be really good for all of
you to go out when you get frustrated
with writing code you go out and kill
some weeds it is very gratifying and
good for you the rest of them I think
are a little bit more radical I would
like to suggest that the point of view
that I'm recommending the permaculture
project is an old American project it
comes out of many places
transcendentalists the Quakers the
shakers and Henry David Thoreau the
greatest American writer has written
about this extensively and as journal is
too long it's 2 million words long so
Google should be scanning it and maybe
putting it on state on on the page in
real time every day when you wake up you
can see what Henry did that day it's
very instructive I've been doing it
myself for about 10 years now and I'm
only about one quarter of the way
through his journal and I recommend it
to everybody because it teaches you a
lot about what it means to be an
American and also it's not in the heroic
mode of John Muir you don't have to go
off to the Sierras for five years
straight and behave like a saint in the
woods that'd be great if you could but
what if you're a suburban a responsible
parent with a job well thorough is
perfect for that because he was
suburbanite through and through
small-town guy his nature was just the
kind of stuff you see in your backyard
and in your garden and yet it was a full
life a full natural life and then
because this is a California company and
we're talking about a kind of a
California culture among other things
although i would think that there's
global variants of it everywhere but
there's something beautiful about
california culture i proclaim as a
Californian and mirror as a really good
Saint figure for that well Hetch Hetchy
should be restored that water can be
cached downstream in the Don Pedro
reservoir and you lose nothing but a
tiny bit of hydroelectricity and and
since you're a Bay Area venture that is
probably drinking Hetch Hetchy water or
maybe that's just San Francisco I don't
know the details this far down the
peninsula but it would be really a
powerful thing if Google were to be
saying let's give Hetch Hetchy back to
the National Park let's let's restore it
let's learn about landscape restoration
and do something that would make John
Muir happy and so I come to my end just
in time we're at an interesting point in
history we are at the emergency moment
remember what the IPCC had said the next
two or three or ten years tells the tale
for how things happen afterwards now
that's a strange moment and a one is
tends to doubt it there is the principle
of mediocrity out of physics which is a
bad name for a principle but it's
probably true that you should be
skeptical of anything that makes you
look extraordinary or unusual in history
or in physics and that's the principle
of mediocrity well is it really true
that we are at a crux point in human
history hard to tell it kind of looks
like it though when you look at the
scientific evidence and at the same time
you have the invention of the internet
and the internet was like a library
without a card catalog until Google came
along so that Google is like the key of
a very important story and now in the
future a thousand years from now when
people write the history of the world if
it's a reasonably comprehensive history
Google is going to get mentioned and if
it's a history of technology Google's
going to get a chapter so this is rare
power I mean a lot of people a lot of
forces on this planet have a lot of
wealth they have a lot of fame but daily
presence and also a key to the the
information tech of the moment these are
unusual this is what google has that
most companies don't have and it doesn't
last forever well you're only new and
hot for a certain amount of time and
then you know Microsoft was new and hot
once IBM was new and hot ones Standard
Oil was new and hot once upon a time you
only have a certain window of time and
it happens to be the same window a time
is in big trouble so when I recommend
these various information text I know
for one thing that google is already
doing a lot of these and that i'm only
saying things that you already know and
have done but on the other hand i also
would urge you from the viewpoint of
science and our grandchildren and from
the viewpoint of a thousand years down
the line that it's time to actually go
outside the box or business as usual is
not good enough anymore that we are in a
moment where business as usual doesn't
hack it don't be evil doesn't hack it
you have to go from the negative which
is a writing instructor i always hate
things written in the negative to the
positive which is not actually be good
because be good is not a as kind of a
wimpy message it's more like do good or
that's not grammatical so you get to do
some good do some good well okay that's
the moment that we're at you got to do
some good and i like it because in my
Mars novels the company that was doing
some good was called praxis and
practices an old lefty term for do some
good so it all comes together don't be
evil praxis there by a transitive
equation they're basically almost the
same thing so Google is already there
and is a kind of a science-fiction thing
happening right now and since everything
right now is a kind of a science-fiction
incident it's fitting and it's it this
is its moment so let's see what happens
with this moment and thank you
yes so do you really think the reason
yeah yeah do you really think there is
any code I one of my favorite James
Blish novels i can remember the name of
it now ready a long time ago had a
population escaping a world whose son
was about to explode in the last contact
they got from the planet with of a war
going on between the poles because he
was eating up isn't that more likely
then well there's an old European phrase
of pessimism of the intellect optimism
of the will that I I am an optimist by
will I say that it's a it's not we don't
have the luxury of being pessimistic
anymore that that is a disservice to our
kids so when I say of course we have
hope it's this is a matter of policy
when I look at the scientists who are
beginning to freak out and say it's
already too late I think well I can
that's scary because I'm not a scientist
can't make the same in kind of a
assessment with full sense of being a
have an ability to judge it but i would
say that what they need to do is the
same thing they need to say the it's not
a question of is it too late because
here's the thing if you ask is it too
late and you say no it's not too late
then you think oh good i don't have to
do anything and you say is it too late
you say yes it's too late you think oh
good i don't have to do anything so it
it's it's not the good question what you
want to say is how much can we save and
then that becomes a relative thing life
on Earth will not end this particular
crisis will not end the the seagulls the
ants the grasses you know there are life
forms that are just amazingly tough
rotations yeah corporations no
corporation said relations don't Fiat
climate change but well they should they
have they have careers and life times
just like into any other entity they
might be longer than human lifetimes but
you know you don't see Standard Oil
around anymore in the same way that it
was before and in corporations but
this is a goes back to the economic
question why shouldn't corporation
spirit if you put the real cost on
carbon it's like fifty dollars a ton
beyond what it's charged it's like
thirty-five dollars a barrel beyond
what's charged so corporations
especially the carbon dealing
corporations are dumping and not only
that but it's predatory dumping they're
selling it for more than it costs to
make well who are they predating when
they do this predatory dumping our
grandchildren well you know anybody can
make a profit if you rip off your
grandkids it's simple as pie you just
you steal from the future you pay the
present you say that was a profit and
then it's the future that has to pay the
cost but that's what we're doing
systemically so we could as a as a
society we could say well let's think
make things cost what they really cost
and at that point you are talking about
taxes oh my god taxes well there should
be a carbon tax and at that point if the
whole society says yeah there's carbon
taxes then corporations some of them
will react and say thank God we can
finally figure out how to deal with this
in a rational basis we're not dealing in
a vacuum anymore and we know what's
going to happen so I think corporations
can be brought into the fold of the
total human project I guess is what I'm
saying there I like the backdrop by the
way but
I'm a physicist by training so let's say
we reach a stage where the panacea
exists a nuclear fusion reactor let's
say but the building of it is well
beyond our technological I mean we have
reached a stage of evolution society
where we no longer can throw of the
technological resources to build these
in large enough scale to today to be a
fusion reactor or a and a shield
blocking the Sun or so have you thought
about that that's a good science fiction
story and that is the that is the
mechanism by which one thinks of science
fiction stories where does technology
and society reach hard points or
contradictory moments and when people
think about that one I which I myself
haven't any great degree but what it
fits into the class of windows of
opportunity that that history may have
windows of opportunity that come and
then they go but the exploration of Mars
is one that I'm very very familiar with
because of my Mars novels the idea that
okay we've got about 50 years where we
could get it together to go to Mars and
after that it might not be possible but
what I'd like to suggest is that what we
need what we would need then is to go
stepwise towards it and maybe even sort
of sideways and create a permaculture
that gets into a balanced sustainable
balance with the earth as its natural
bio infrastructure and that once you get
that balance back you might have only a
population of 3 billion humans if they
all are healthy and and have food water
shelter clothing education a sufficiency
then at that point it's going to be a
stable population because the natural
replacement rate of about 2.2 for human
beings is achieved in all prosperous
countries because no couple can can bear
to have more than a couple of kids
without going crazy more or less unless
you're really into it and like it but
the natural replacement rate would be
achieved and at that point then you
could clean then you could build
could get out into the solar system you
could build the fission or fusion plant
and and so we might have some recovery
work to do some carrying capacity work
to do and I hope that we can do that
what people fear I think is the general
systems crash or the the science fiction
scenario of the fall that civilization
goes back to a barbarism because people
began to fight for resources so intently
that they began to destroy each other
and the ability to do these these these
positive things and I still think that
that's very very unlikely that we we
simply aren't that aren't that stupid
and that we have a moment in history
that's mostly democratic and that once
once 51 percent of the population it
comes to agree to this that we need to
do these things then they will get done
so this is a somewhat optimism of the
will because we are such a conflicted
society right now but I think there's
also real reasons this is a this is
another Google question you know and
it's another information tech question
is this just an imaginary relationship
to a real situation and the real
situation we're totally screwed or or is
it or is it an assessment of the real
situation it says we still have the
opportunity to reach a balance I have
inclination but I don't know you talked
a bit about a different economics and
you've also written about it in your
novels do you see any steps toward a
different economics happening anywhere
yes i do first and they're both quite
legal one of them is cooperatives that
people get together and the employees
are basically privately owned their
company there are not stock that we're
outsiders are taking away the surplus
value as profit but actually it goes to
the employees and every five years or so
the employees review their management
decide management's doing a good job
rehire the management and in the five
years the management definitely sets the
rules and says this is how we're going
to do it but then they get reviewed some
whatever reversal to the normal course
of things and coops are legal and they
are not widespread but to me it's a
miracle that they're not because they're
obvious and they're good
and then the other thing would be
something you guys know much more about
than I do which is open source which is
the idea that open source shouldn't just
be about computer code but should
involve other aspects of society
engineering all all expertise could be
open source and what is that that's the
commons you know there was a working
economies where the commons was
something that everybody went out and
used and it replenished itself and then
nobody owned it and it didn't make a
profit for anybody but was the commons
and the attack on government that we see
ever since the reagan revolution is an
attack on the commons because the
government is the virtual reproduction
of the commons it's one of the few
places that is all of us gathering
together a whole bunch of capital saying
we're going to do this we're going to do
that the government is the current
manifestation of the commons open source
is another kind of mind-boggling
manifestation of the commons especially
to me because I'm kind of being newly
educated to what it really means as a
computer illiterate person open source
is somewhat mysterious but the better
you explain open source the more it
might be taken as an economic model for
other activities once you have a
sufficiency enough as as good as a feast
even better than a feast because a feast
makes you sick once you've got enough
then you begin to get into the gift
economy maybe n to give out you think
gosh I've got what I need it's like
Maslow's levels of actualization where
once you get needs then you go into
desires and get into more spiritual
things and certainly the gift economy is
part of this notion of return like life
gives me food and all these gifts my
friends etc therefore I give back and
this is not profit this is not profit
loss thinking this is non non capitalist
thinking and so we live in a capitalist
economy but it's add also a democracy it
also still has a Commons that is
embattled by privatization and yet it's
pretty robust because people like it
better it happen make a profit and still
not feel good but if you but you giving
almost always feels good so these are
the things that I see and I do think
what they need is theorization what they
need is narratives like science
fiction novels or you know describing
how it could be and how it could feel
but it also needs theory and needs
economists who believe in it needs more
people like Paul Krugman Joseph Stiglitz
I mean there are mainstream economists
so we're writing about this stuff right
now but even they I mean when you name
two out of an entire field what you
would say is we need a lot more of this
why when I google post capitalism don't
I or alternative economic models why
don't I get five fat textbooks that are
being taught in every business school in
every economics program I mean why don't
I get those because the blinkers on our
ideology say as Margaret Thatcher once
so famously said there is no alternative
but that's stupid really there are
alternatives and they're always work you
know it's just as crazy as saying
there's no such thing as society which
he also said and that's like saying
there's no such thing as an abstract now
you know it's one of those you know I
never tell a lie type statements or this
statement is a lie a paradox and
basically wrong so what Google you know
if you've got a hundred million dollars
to to put into hardware then maybe
there's a hundred million dollars to put
into software and certainly you guys
more than almost anyone on earth know
that software is a technology and is as
important as the hardware i'm right i
mean this is more or less the name of
your game and so I hope that new
economic models and alternatives and the
next step and also reform how do you get
from this massively entrenched set of
laws and which capitalism is kind of not
only has it bought up almost everything
on earth but it's brought up the next 30
years in the forms of contracts debts
mortgages and supposedly they're all
written in in stone and can never be
changed we see right now with mortgages
that isn't quite true but the the idea
that the future has already bought and
is already secured by somebody who then
gets to dictate what happens is a
powerful notion that people want you to
believe but it isn't really true I mean
tomorrow
or maybe I should say a year from now
there could be an election in which we
elected a group of people that decided
that everything was going to change in
the next five years it happened in 1932
for instance and it could happen again
so new and and and better economic
models I hope will come out of that
process too because we need a bat it's
part of the project you can't get out of
climate change without a better economic
models well thanks again folks it's been
fun
