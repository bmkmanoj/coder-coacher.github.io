nickel u-dub justice and if you want to
continue your introduction there from
that yeah my name is Jeff rose Adama
plenty of uh physics I just at Baton
Rouge Washington off campus silly ribbon
red ribbon fun Physics Laboratory we
work on humanity I try to keep this talk
pretty simple I don't know how you guys
are probably some of you guys probably
pretty familiar with
may not be toxic
I'm using here before
so quick shot of our machine when it was
it's clean room probably so first one to
acknowledge a few people that I work
with and some others gave me some
information and help with presentation
Park Yong Hoffman who's our director out
of our lab and dr. Cheng lobe is our
principal scientist and then just as a
general human energy Plaza physics book
because the book by Freiburg is a very
new one and it's got a lot of good
information on not even up-to-date
research and then the US Department of
Energy also has a more information on
energy as you can possibly imagine on
their website my outline will be just to
talk briefly about fusion and what it is
and then I'll give a quick overview of
status of some present research and then
going to what we're doing at the
University of Washington which is what
I'm obviously ultimately and afterwards
you guys want to come by or taking the
tour of the lab so presently the United
States hope is our number one source of
producing electricity it's over person
nuclear is a second at 20% and then you
can see oil hydro gas gas getting
natural gas turbines and then other wind
solar and geothermal and
biodiesel and things like that they're
all relatively small sources of
electricity the United States actually
is a world largest producer of nuclear
energy not many people know that
anything's grant is because they're 90%
nuclear electricity but we currently
operate about 104 nuclear plants and
produce the multi power also consumed
the most arm
Oh Walter maybe all right so it's really
the impetus for this talk is to get
people excited about diffusion and why
we need it presently our worldwide fuel
supply is for fossil fuels is dwindling
there's 1,000 years of Paul in the
United States and Saudi Arabia of coal
pretty much the whole country almost is
just covered with this now there's the
long supply of coal but their obvious
problem burning
worldwide and when you talk to there's
less than 100 year supply of oil stand
with natural gas and even even just
burning uranium if you don't mean
breeder reactors its own development of
your supply of uranium for doing fission
with a breeder you can push that to you
about 20,000 years
either a reader this is uh it's a
fission reactor that captures the
neutrons and makes its own so you
basically can murder 238 uranium which
is the eight percent presently you burn
for 235 which is the two percent fish
very much of it compared to the 238 and
then with 18 fusion which is deterring
the tritium also which is also the
easiest form of fusion to do we have a
lot of 20,000 year supply and that's
chiefly due to in creating tritium just
not naturally occurring it's got a bread
also usually in the lithium blanket the
DD fusion which is a more difficult
reactor to build there's about a 2
billion year supply because you can just
burn to turn ability oceans so clearly
if we're running have electricity much
longer than a few hundred years we need
to go with run with at least breeding
vision or
so nuclear reactions are Porter's and
orders of magnitude more energetic than
a standard chemical reaction chemical
reactions such as burning gasoline is
Bruce was about ninety seven electron
volts which is a unit of energy per
reaction where you can see a fission
reaction produced over 200 billion
several orders nature fire and fusion
reactions are also the million electron
volt range which clearly shows that
there's a lot more bang for your buck in
nuclear reaction than there is a
chemical reaction so what is dude what's
the process the powers of Sun obviously
protons in the Sun or burned under
enormous gravitational pressure and the
Sun will produce all the way up to iron
before it runs out of fuel in a sense
though we've been using fusion on this
planet ever since it was born fuels the
wind obviously gets solar power from the
Sun fields the weather so even in hydro
power is derived in some sense from from
fusion energy and even I guess you can
say fossil fuels
we've been causal fields are created
from dead dinosaurs for plants you know
the plants had to get their energy from
the Sun as well so everything sort of as
a as fusion in that sense
environmental advantages of fusion
obviously are that there are no no
emissions co2 or otherwise and currently
right now a co2 and greenhouse gases are
a big issue with politicians and and
environmentalists and other people so
the advantages of nuclear in general you
shouldn't did you know that there's no
no co2 and depending on the fuel cycle
you use there's no radioactive waste it
with fusion ledum huge power plant takes
that much less space than wind farm or
sword facility also it doesn't look as
ugly as arms on there there's no
pollution that's produced
so what photovoltaic cells they had a
silicon in there some pollution issues
with remove making silicon waivers and
around here there's a lot of people
concerned salmon and fish so dams block
up rivers and kill fish once not too
long ago
it's really hard to do here's a simple
simple chart showing the mass of the
nucleon hydrogen being the smallest and
uranium up here on the high side you can
see it this is basically a chart showing
the amount of energy that's available
with the reaction so if hydrogen if you
put two hydrogens together you've got a
lot of energy here available to fuse
atoms together until you get down tired
it was rhenium there's a lot of energy
available here to vision atoms down the
entire
was going to remove this bullet because
it's not entirely a true statement
fusion reactors could be a proliferation
threat if used improperly there is
little or no radioactive waste whereas
there is the fission
there's no meltdown threat vision a lot
of people are afraid of runaway reaction
it's important to Chernobyl meltdown the
reactor and kills everybody around but
what fusion that is not possible once
you take away two in power the reaction
stops it smell like burning wet wood
can't keep a torch on it it'll burn
you'll get more energy out that you're
putting in but as soon as you take that
torch off stop burning the wood then
diverting stopped as well so it's
cause problems that way and again
whereas the greater reactor you get
about twenty thousand years or with
non-readers only about a hundred years
of fuel diffusion allowance so are on
two million years
some common fusion reactions the
simplest one to initiate in this one
that's used in magnetic research now is
the first widely used magnetic charge is
the DT reaction it releases a lot of
energy unfortunately a lot of that
energy is a very high-energy neutron
high-energy neutrons and into things
like stainless steel radioactive so
that's not necessarily a good thing
unless you're looking for a new I would
say in this field the most abundant the
most abundant fuel is that obviously
deuterium deuterium reaction images also
produces neutrons but at a much lower
energy level and it produces some
tritium and a proton and obviously
Trinity reaction with that as well
almost better so this would be ideal
reaction for you know here two billion
years fuel cycle some advanced fuel
reactions that don't produce neutrons
and this is one of the reactions that we
would that my group would like to do in
the distant future is the future of
helium-3 which is the produces helium
and protons and a lot of energy and then
there are also people particularly an
electrostatic fusion community who want
to burn your feet or on eleven which is
the ultimate I guess an atomic fuel
because it doesn't produce any neutrons
at all yes the two billion year thing
does that include all of this breeding
so you can go
two tritium down to the healing reaction
damage the very reaction or does that
just include the usual that's just
burning deuterium obviously when you're
burning the DGE you get some helium-3 so
you get some of this reaction you also
gets into tritium so you get some of
this reaction as well but deuterium is a
relatively abundant element it's in
seawater so this is just just realtor
psa's indeterminate register house and
the lunar sources are right so that's a
good question um tritium is not
naturally occurring so you do have to
breathe at the tip of them we'd be done
with lithium you use this high-energy
neutrons banging into some lithium it
would make some more tritium essentially
have a fusion breeder reactor helium-3
is also not naturally occurring but it
is the end product of trilliums
radioactive cycle so if you make tritium
you can make helium free but helium-3 is
exceptionally abundant on the moon
because the Sun produced a lot of in
captures but one of the benefits do not
have magnetic field up there I guess so
presently there are several different
kinds of fusion energy research in the
world today that the main one is
magnetic confinement there's also a
nurse'll confinement which is often done
with lasers and then electrostatic and -
which I don't really know that much went
on magnetic an inertial confinement take
up the launch of research dollars as far
as commercial reactor research goes it's
mostly magnetic inertial confinement
tends to be more bomb as extended as
actually trying to make a reactor
because they tend to be very short
pulses and long timescales in between
shots
magnetic confinement is also closest to
producing a test reactor there's an
international test reactor that is being
built
supposedly sometime this year over in
France called here I'll talk about that
a little later of the talk so how do we
do magnetic fusion tokamaks are the most
led to research in the most advanced the
fusion devices they've been being
researched for about 50 or 60 years now
50 years now and they're at the point
where they're going to build a test
reactor to show that is actually
feasible to to move on to commercial
reactors stellarator is another concept
that gets a lot of attention there's a
picture of the w7x accelerator in
Germany here and it's a turrible device
like like a tokamak but it is able to
run steady-state so you basically just
turn it on and it runs current through
these coils and run your puzzles that
way the on geometry has to do with
making sure the magnetic field lines are
always giving you stability so
accelerators have really come a long way
in the last probably 10 years with the
intent of being able to do super
high-resolution magnetic calculations on
on computers before people had to do
this stuff by hand and very obviously
would be very difficult to determine
what the magnetic geometry this coil had
to be in order to get direct buzz but
you can see the complexity of of even of
a device like this you know building
these coils to serve to not easy
designing them is certainly not easy and
then you know there's a lot of hardware
inside all good forms of research like
this air mac or configure field nursery
figuration that we work on at University
of Washington are not as well advanced
then really seriously consider the last
maybe 20 years and have not been
seriously considered monetarily but
they're much simpler geometry art device
is actually just Linear's it's a simple
love solenoid basically actually our
device is very close to advantage so
theta pinch is you run current through
magnetic through a solenoid you make a
magnetic field and plasma sticks to the
magnetic field and when you crank up the
current magnetic field that crushes it
down and ideally uses get-ups
however ions and electrons are free to
move along magnetic field lines so when
you squeeze really hard on these here
they just want to move out the ends so
you'd have to have a device many miles
long in order producing energy with the
native engine so if the tokamak guys it
is they just twisted that into a tarts
so you just have these things running
around in a circle
problem with that is is once you turn
your magnetic field into a circle the
pressure of the magnetic field on the
outside of the tourist is less than on
the inside and the plasma just wants to
move out to the lower bank of the
pressure so magnetically it's not a
stable configuration for making plasma
so you had what many more coil
presently there are some the jet tokamak
in Europe is the largest the most
accessible film back in the world we
have one of our scientists actually
worked there before coming to work for
us picture that here in a moment eater
which is being built now is the
International thermonuclear engineering
reactor to be a very large tokamak and
it's supposed to produce more energy
than it consumes there's several large
topamax also operating in the US that
are better research tokamaks and d3d is
probably one of those problem the
general atomics is the one that I've
done some work on and East is a new
tokamak is being constructed in China
and I believe it might be the only
superconducting poloidal tokamak that'll
be an operation they're moving you
wanted to paint
so here's the thought of the jet tokamak
and is the inside of it on this side you
can see the plasma during out during a
discharge and one of the main things to
note is the amount of complexity in the
interior of this device each one of
these little plates has to be able to be
remotely serviced every part in here has
actually able to be remotely serviced by
robotic arms as after running deuterium
and tritium reactions it is slightly hot
this yeah this is about a two half
meters across two meters high so this is
the larger device and the engineering in
these things this is amazing but also
exceptionally complicated very there's
very few people who actually can
understand and design this is a cartoon
of the eater device this will be the
International reactor cost somewhere in
the order 20 billion dollars over the
next 10 years or so and you can see the
2 meter tall man here like gives you an
idea of how big this is and this would
be approximately the size of a working
reactor here the tokamak become a fusion
reactor it actually maybe have to be
slightly bigger even but again you can
see that the sheer size of this thing
and the other issue that these have is
you have to have blankets protecting
your device from neutrons so you have to
blanket material inside here protecting
everything you have to blank material
outside outside the vessel predicting
everything your magnet
particularly superconductors don't
really like getting hit by neutrons so
there's a huge material science issue
and engineering issue with designing
magnets that can withstand Neutron flux
is that I can that you should device
will produce so a lot of what either is
going to be focused on is a materials
development and things of that nature so
tokamaks have some advantages and
disadvantages and edge is obviously the
most researched concept and they're
pretty close to being able to show that
that they can become a reactor the
physics looks good either almost like
they work but they're huge a gigawatt
reactor is you know plant we need to be
in the ratings of just reactor itself
would have to be in the radius of 10
meters or so and you know the whole
building may be the size of a potato
field or something like that so they're
not small by any stretch of the
imagination the other thing that Toph
mix can't do is earn advanced fuels in
order to burn fuel other than
deuterium-tritium de neutronic fuels
you have to have a extremely large
magnetic field with the tokamak I will
get into that a little bit later and the
engineering heated built them is said
very impressive but also it's a
nightmare so at the University of
Washington we're looking into more of a
what would be a good approach from an
engineering standpoint assuming we get
the physics how would you do it if you
were just looking at it from engineering
and what we have is a concept we've been
working on for many years here simple
linear called the field reverse
configuration it's
probably the simplest reaction or
reactor geometry you can make keep in
mind that the picture of eater I showed
you a while back and here's a conceptual
design of what our reactor might look
like with our 2-meter man confinement
coils are just again simple solenoid
coils the whole thing is is simply
connected and it also has what's called
the natural divert meaning that there
are open field onto the outside of the
part of the plasma that carry helium
alpha particles LPNs and that can be
very useful for spaceflight or direct
energy conversion so you could
conceivably just take your alpha
particles that are coming out and
directly convert them to electricity
rather than having with Hristina cycle
or something of that nature
so like I said the frc geometry is very
simple we have the simpl called a
solenoid coil that reverses the field
and the process of burst in the field is
something we've studied a great length
at the University of Washington the flux
flux and curving coils so we put a
magnetic field in here the plasma itself
reverses the magnetic field mo get into
a little to that new spice here and
creates they stay like a football shape
plasma where the field lines on the
outside are able to impress the plasma
against the coils
one parameter that I'll talk about
briefly is data that is the ratio of the
plasma pressure density and temperature
of the plasma to the magnetic pressure
this is an important parameter because
it turns how much magnetic field you
need to define a plasma tokamak
typically have about a 5% plasma
pressure to magnetic pressure which is
why it cannot burn advanced skills to
earn say helium-3 for the tokamak you
might need thirty tesslar so dirty Tesla
is a lot more than a quilt of any
reasonable size of finger can generate
whereas an FRC
the magnetic pressure is about equal to
the plasma pressure so there's a chance
of burning an advanced fuel at much much
lower magnetic field and the reason for
that a lot of that is because if you'll
recall
Butler's
rotate around magnetic field lines orbit
around them so to speak and when they do
that they give up energy
any object this accelerating gives up
energy and the higher your magnetic
field the faster these go the more
energy they radiate so with a device
like an FRC whether this has very low
magnetic fields you can get if you don't
use as much of your energy in in your
cyclotron radiation that's right word
but anyhow this allows us to burn
advanced fuel it also means that fusion
conditions the simple coil designs are
much much much more simple
so there are some definite advantages to
the adversity the simplest it's as
simple as possible geometry it's
cylindrical and engineering is very
simple the high data allows for low
field confinement pigments he's got a
natural converter which gives you a
chance to generate electricity with
direct drive and to get you that
advanced fuel potential reaction ions
like another in the in tokamaks another
fusion devices would provide much of the
current drive the other thing that's
nice about this geometry is it is a very
natural geometry for space propulsion or
you want to take your reactor out in
this case get someplace and then put it
down and use it to make energy you can
you can do both there are some problems
the physics is not as well understood as
it took and it's it's different from
tokamak visits stability of the magnetic
configuration has always been a concern
because it only has a boil or it doesn't
have a stabilizing desperate magnetic
field like a tokamak does there is a
a mode that if you have a if you have a
magnet in a magnetic field that's
opposite the direction of the field
north-south going the wrong way it wants
to flip over well sort of learn FRC is
it's kind of a thing that wants to flip
over in its in its field we have not
never seen anything like that happen our
research but it's
theoretically it is possible but all the
currents are diamagnetic which means
that the plasma pressure itself supports
the current so current drivers are one
of our biggest issues how to keep the
magnetic field going after you start it
up and the amount of what you need is
key
obviously achieving a high flux you have
to achieve a high amount of flux and the
thing in order to actually compress it
down to get hot and make it fused we
have had a fair bit of difficulty
technologically getting a high amount of
flux in our our devices so far without
using very high voltages and powers like
I said earlier this is a night yield
geometry for a space propulsion and we
at one point had an asset contract to
study sustainment of the net varsity for
space propulsion and this would be a
sort of idealized varsity rocket if you
will we had her the husband cost coming
out here hurtling you through space on
the other side you use direct energy
conversion to power your spacecraft and
then once you land you can put this
thing down and use both ends for
converting power in a tune and also in
space the helium-3 fuel may not be so
hard to come by so
I want to talk a little bit about the
program we have at university of
washington right now we're looking at
developing the technologically simpler
formation method so that we can sustain
her FRC's for steady state we're
conducting Basic Studies at people
living in instability and one of our big
problems is fuel recycling we have -
comes off the walls of your device while
your pod was running and it's cold you
have to burn a lot of energy and
ionizing anything it into the pin of the
into the plasma so one of the things
we're working on is reducing the amount
of hydrogen we got our walls older
device down and we're also our main
focus is on rotating magnetic field
current drive which is similar I'll show
you the next slide I believe that
similar to an induction motor we
actually start our card
the next few years working on recycling
and period control meaning in a high
vacuum system like ours a few percent of
oxygen or carbon or something like that
is not nitrogen can kill you it radiates
an enormous amount of energy away on our
last device the oxygen alone that was
coming off our walls was radiating a
hall power that we put into our plasma
away so we weren't able to get it on at
all but we're great progress here's a
picture of our device so our main plasma
chamber here you have a chamber down
here where we can we are able to make
FRC's with the high voltage method that
are very hot very dense that's would be
used possibly at some in the future to
fuel a steady state type of adversity is
sitting in this chamber another shot of
our central chamber are these are our
solo nodal field coils here I guess
you're using
linear magnetic is going to feel all
points this way now the device this way
here difficult to see but we have our
rotating magnetic field coils hook it
into those a little bit later but these
are what generates the current it makes
our varsity and for anybody who comes to
the tour afterwards you can look at that
up close and personal
another shot of the machine here so the
basics of our map current driver which
we what we do is are very simple you
have a plasma in a theta pinch field you
turn on I wrote a magnetic field that
isn't in a Helmholtz pair so it creates
a field that just rotates around this
way with the 90 degrees to the the
solenoid field and it drag the electrons
with it and similar to how an induction
motor works and that it drags the
electrons the electrons create a current
this current then creates a magnetic
field the magnetic field and forms the
shape of the football basic
the beauty of this is that there's no
there's no other magnetic fields that
are inherent to this this thing that can
cause billing in a tokamak that the main
main magnetic field also there's a
another toroidal field here and that
takes an enormous amount of the energy
of the device to sustain so this is what
allows us this simple field
configuration as allows us to state
linear and also if you'll recall with
the theta pinch you know puzzle would
just run at the end in this case the
bottom is often find because the rook
the magnetic fields are connected in on
themselves inside Detroit
one of the main compliments we've we've
done in our car facility on our new are
new devices we drastically clean up or
make our vacuum system one of the
problems we had in our whole system was
we had rubber o-rings and dirty vacuum
walls basically we went to great lengths
to develop a system that had no or
minimum amount of rubber or non steel
and copper gasket acting system and we
took great lengths to make the thing
very clean we built a cleanroom when we
put this thing together and we've also
employed heat blankets on our walls to
make sure that you can drive things like
water and carbon dioxide another
security is off and make the thing as
clean as possible and it's paid
dividends in in our operation already
our first shots we were able to produce
two hundred electron volts of
temperature keep in mind we need about
ten thousand in order to inertia
reasonably diffusion but compared to
what we had before just about 20
electrons enormous improved
so we're pretty happy so far I think it
shows some data and sort of art this is
what in blue is our previous device
this is fired at exactly the same rotate
rotating magnetic field and solenoid
field conditions you can see the factor
10 improvement in temperature our
magnetic field we were able to achieve
inside the adversity was 50% higher the
same driving fields and lower with lower
against we would like to have a higher
density obviously that's a technological
limitation that can't leak into due to
the complexity of it one thing we have
been able to show is that we're
essentially able to offer in a steady
state which has never been possible in a
varsity up to this date
this chart shows that our our RMF field
as long as our MF field is on our
configuration stays intact so we're able
to drive current long and grim people
are on the field on the droop here is
just due to the fact that our mem field
is generated by a capacitor banks and
capacitor banks run out of energy
officially but we can come up with a
solid state system we could run this
thing potentially forever and that's a
another enormous breakthrough that we've
got
so we're in the process of proposing a
new facility at the U job hopefully a
much larger device it will be sort of a
proof of principle device to show that
this can take the next step up and try
to come I have a reactor be much larger
our advice now is on a meter across a
new one of you know two and a half to
three meters all of our antennas and
everything else will be inside the
vacuum vessels so we won't have some of
the issues we have with with ports right
now our our main vacuum vessel is
actually made out of quartz we have to
have an insulator in order to get
magnetic fields through so we want to
put an all metal chamber in order to do
that we have to put everything inside
okay one problem with metal is magnetic
fields only like to go through it on
resistor fissure thing and now we also
want to add neutral beams nope you
notice it was a neutral beam is but it's
one of the principal ways that tokamaks
actually used to drive current and
basically what it is is a particle
accelerator where you get a hydrogen or
deuterium atom including it kilovolts
energy or 100 kilovolt center here over
make your meeting what I make and at the
end you have grid that we captured an
electron and so you've got at that point
a very high energy deuterium atom that's
a electrically neutral that you can fire
in your machine and so that's a way of
injecting high energy particles into
your device and then with with the
charge exchange you will end up getting
captured these things you can drive
current with them that way to tokamak
typically shoot them in and then they're
able to sustain their their toroidal
current
currently runs a tokamak the neutral
beam and we want to do the same thing
but to this date
there's been no apartment there are no
FRC's that have had the plasma
parameters that were capable of using a
neutral pavement we are very close
so in summary fusion will be a necessary
of going to power the energy into the
world for more than the next 200 years
in bridge the gap with vision but as
long as the human race has to be around
more than ten thousand years or so it's
going to need to be a fusion tokamak
test reactor is being built it should
show that these ability of a fusion
reactor as as a commercial energy source
that ought to be done with construction
in about in 2012 I believe they're
supposed to be an operation sometime
around around then at the University
Washington however over researching
accomplish that it's much more
engineering ly simple and we think offer
significant advantages over tokamak
should should be a physics antenna
so you've got some energy up directly
from the jerk Guinea man's most
reactions also produce not neutrons
correct old chamber be hot I could
repeat the request a question yeah so he
said that's not that hot the hockey John
so that some of the reaction comes out
of it trading reaction comes out in
helium alpha particles this home comes
out in neutrons typically in a fusion
reactor what you want to get to
something called ignition where your
helium actually gives up its energy to
deuterium atoms and tritium atoms and
heats them that way so you can turn off
in some sense your external eating and
supplied devices and get your your
fusion reaction products that your
husband neutrons would then be captured
what people are talking about now is a
liquid lithium Walt would surround your
entire device neutrons would hit the lip
for the lithium because that would heat
that up and then they run a steam cycle
using the so if you have a liquid
lithium wall you'd probably have a water
bath on the outside of that as well
maybe outside of here would have to be
outside would have to be outside that
containment or the the vacuum vessel but
not necessarily outside the magnet
right
it's a mouth but
not a not a physics question but we've
had a couple of alternative to tokamak
fusion Bolton's come in and talk to us
in the past year or so and they seem to
get a lot of pushback from the
established fusion field on doing
something other than tokamak and I was
wondering if you experienced the same
kind of issues yes and when I first
started grad school thank you Mike oh
yeah
he asked about them whether or not we
were getting sort of pushed back from
the tokamak community being an alternate
content to the tokamak and the short
answer is yes tokamaks I have really
they have a large political inertia
there's a lot big labs Kristen is one of
the biggest usually labs the country and
it has a lot of people who have a lot of
political connections and they are
tokamak lab however a Princeton is
moving sort of away from that now like
that a 93 all research that was not
related to the tokamak was actually like
about 1990 1990 that all research not
really to talk to I was cut magnetic
confinement anyways and so we survived
by taking our FRC and turning it into a
tokamak fuelling device which sounds
funny but the nice thing about being a
linear device like that is you can shoot
stuff out she can't stop at the end and
that's one of the things or one of the
things that our
this source here this is actually the
source that we use for doing we can
create FRC's in this manner and it's
really actually a beautiful concept
because you just energize the magnets at
the back very slightly and you can push
the thing and it's like squeezing
toothpaste out of a tube you just kind
of push on the back of it a little bit a
little bit a little bit and just give it
a little bit more energy as you go it
and you can get these things up to
tremendous velocities and so we had a
pretty successful program actually
showed the weekend that we could
reasonably fuel a tokamak with a flippin
FRC so that's sort of bridging the gap
and then after that money started to
flow a little more freely and then the
last couple years been a real big focus
on eater so there's been some here in
the alternate community that eaters and
then soak up all the money but now we're
not in E or anymore so
fucking's you guys need okay again
asking about a amount of funding for it
for all of you in court
just us so first of all all occasion is
magnetic fusion is somewhere in order of
200 million dollars a year I believe
including the United States only arm
either is something like a billion
dollars a year but that's spread out
over several countries
and not everybody is really pumping all
that money in my art budget I think is
somewhere in order about 1.5 million
dollar generic it's pretty small arson
target of energy get permanent energy
does most of the research there's a
company down in LA now that's working on
that's doing some private research on
action on FRC's
venture capital and they're running
about twenty million dollars a year but
they're really pushing hard to try to
get something started
our next facility that we're proposing
to build would probably operate around
the five million dollar a year range how
do you manage your construction in a
university environment so he asked how
would we manage our construction in a
university environment um very slowly we
did our whole upgrade with no additional
funds so we had some overhead returned
and things like pets of a sort of a
slush fund that over the years that we
had built up that we were able to buy
out a lot of the equipment with but
building something universities is
difficult especially we have a
relatively low funding levels like we do
are you doing what's up for you doing a
manufacturing with Parker we don't do
them in fact well it depends on what is
most of the stuff is you know through
personal companies we have a lot of
parts from other labs particularly the
los alamos has provided a bit of our
equipment we were able to buy some of it
from Princeton diagnostic women from
Princeton but for the most part our
vacuum chamber is all bit out to private
companies MDC vacuum kirlosker vacuum
couple places like that they're sort of
the big vacuum companies most everything
was done we don't have it facilities too
much more than some machining of parts
so it's a slow process when you don't
have a lot of budget to do it like it
took us about three almost three years
to to to or upgrade something if we had
the budget the manpower we probably get
it done in six months
so we had to talk to him Plus are we
talking California it sounded really
exciting that billiard is going to you
evaluate that so he asked about dr.
Buzzard electrostatic trap I've
evaluated that I've seen this talk I've
actually seen him talk several times and
I know several people that work on that
so I don't really understand it well
enough to make a evaluation on another
than there's always a gotcha
it seems very simple and like any
concept the people who believe in it
really believe it and you know that
worked it would be phenomenal because it
really is a very simple technique but he
kind of got a wonder you know why hasn't
it been able to move the next step a lot
maybe funding I don't know I mean it's
not something has been funded in any
kind of level there's guys that George
Bailey has been working on this for
years there's some people almost didn't
working on this for a while but I really
don't know I don't believe in detailed
enough to
hey there's always a there's always a
gotcha somewhere you know I'm I'm pretty
much up for anything the works
I don't they can make fusion work with
that that would be fantastic
comment that is actually probably one of
the best if it worked would be one of
the simplest devices you can make and it
burns the best fuel so
on that for us people are lovin is
probably at least in my grandkids like
not technologically feasible dm3 I think
is doable it's only a few Tesla field
for an FRC to be able to do helium-3 the
problem obviously is we haven't overcome
the physics barriers even to get where
we can do DT so you know you take a step
at a time
it's the it's really the FRC really is
difficult neat magnetic concept that
convert helium-3 and has a potential to
born burn for 11 there are other there
are other FRC concepts out there another
guy one of our colleagues at the
university works on sort of using this
acceleration technique he has two of
these devices that he aims at each other
and he slammed two at Marcis into each
other opposite ends and then crushes
them down he also has a device were eat
least in that he's trying to build where
he would shoot one of these things out
and accelerate it into an ever-shrinking
tapering coil and then would achieve
basically take the kinetic energy which
is really easy to put into these things
and the thermal energy as it slows down
and compressed into this coil you get a
burn that way
those are apparently built machines so
if you're happy with post devices then
that would certainly be a way to go and
actually I kind of like those I actually
I don't like that concept I worked on
some of that with as a grad student very
interesting
the state status is very well
our current challenge now is we are we
have a an RMF field that is lane is the
best on it
the coil generate a field that is just
moved in one direction and if you look
at it for a few moments you'll realize
that a magnetic field that's closed
another magnetic field going through it
it's open and you add them together you
get a magnetic field that's open which
is the whole part the whole idea of our
concept is that it's all of those
magnetic geometry so that you don't have
electrodes and running out hitting walls
and sort of thing so there is a way of
running the coils where you run them
sort of give two sets that run opposite
directions that actually keep those
built lines closed so right now we're
working on trying to get that working
that's a major challenge and also we're
working at working on different
frequencies of trying to clean up our
RMF there have a lot of powers the
problem so the higher frequency go in
our RMF the lower amount of power we
have to put into the device and ideally
what a much higher frequency them we're
running it now
how do you know the right direction
oh well okay sweetie that's been how
we're how we know we're moving in the
right direction whatever whatnot we turn
in order to do this well we have a set
of basically magnetic field coils is our
main our main diagnostic on the outside
of the chamber we have loops of wire
that mention agentic field if you put
those in a particular configuration you
can actually measure the size and shape
of the FRC it's a unique property of our
scheme we also have an interferometer
system which measures the density we
have various Diagnostics spectrometers a
lot of micrometers monochromator that
measure spectral lines of carbon and
oxygen how much tip area we have we have
a camera that can actually spend from
use the spectrometer essentially to
measure the velocities of hydrogen
various points in the inside the device
so we have a fairly wide range of
Diagnostics there's one more diagnostic
we want to probe machine that's a direct
emissions electron temperature which is
would be a big benefit to us we don't
have that on yet another one of those
$100,000 Diagnostics that we're slowly
building up the money for well assembly
was all done in-house our technicians
and our grad students in the North
scientists we go out turn wrenches thing
together most of the actual parts are
built by various companies and our
government locator we know how to use
computers um we have actually a group on
campus that does the jumpin button
simulation work that's a relatively new
group over there does nothing but
simulation work on varsity's Spira max
which is another alternative a concept
and then all of our Diagnostics
signals remember digitized and going to
a screening room and out and we use our
computers to run runs machines or the
diagnostics monitor everything but I
think probably your question is more we
have a simulation theory group that does
use this computers and they use the
supercomputers on it more over there
she expect like I guess leading up to
vision project there were sort of his
expectation that
to figure out what positive the work
we do that
if the hitter is that here we go or
close to Eureka where things get simpler
at a certain point where you start now
korkin exactly reverse
there is vision reactors have gotten
simpler
like computers sure to search yeah um as
far as our concept goes just as far as
our concept goes I don't know we're
quite at the point we've made a sort of
this current drive method sort of a
Eureka moment if you will in that as far
as the tokamak goes like I don't know
that it can get much simpler they're
actually moving more towards the larger
and larger but that's what the physics
demand is to get bigger and bigger our
Hawaiian timing our concept itself that
work would be that very thing that would
drastically reduce the complexity and
the size of a reactor
tokamak but I think the tokamak itself
probably will work I think physics was
they don't see any reason why when they
turn II here on it's not going to just
work it makes prettiest power in two
dollars a kilowatt hour but is it a
three cent but it'll work
so using that money can solve this
problem okay so the investment but if
throwing some money at this problem with
solvent that's sort of a bone of
contention that scientists my age have
had the scientists that are altering
writing on the fusion community there's
throw a break there's scientists that
have been there a long time and they're
about to retire and then there's thirty
year old scientists there's not a lot of
people in between basically yes in part
because funding has been so bad it just
nobody stays in the industry until
recently the old guys my own guys um
have had this 20-year plan and an
include here and you've built a big
machine and you push it and it you go
slowly and then in 35 years you've built
another reactor that actually might
bring some electricity to sell there's a
fair group of younger scientists who
like to have a polyp project which do it
in ten years those the money at it you
know what's going to work build a bunch
of machines and parallel projects
parallel research and really trying to
hammer out what needs to be done not on
one big machine but on maybe a bunch of
small machines and yes then twenty
billion dollars if you need to do it but
a lot of political you know part of
fusions problems early on they sold it
as a hey we'll have it ten years and has
been fifty meters away
and then another problem is that
president congressman don't like things
that are longer than their term in
office so um we were trying to sell them
the 35 year plan like yeah great you
know like you know Canada gets credit
for the space project is you know he
launched it it would have been done in
his publicly during his presidency term
but if you stole a 35 year plan to
somebody they're not gonna be around so
politically it doesn't help you much so
pushing a 10 year plan would certainly I
think
you do but this got to be a political
will to do it right now there really is
not a political will to do really
anything energy-related it's useful well
a fair amount of attention that
paramount there's a few people who work
on infusion or earned the bomb research
I mean the Livermore in Los Alamos their
data stewardship program they bring in
scientists and work on my hot ones up or
come on this duration or that's
certainly something to that a lot of the
initial employment facilities are linked
here or person oh they're really our
fault they say they're not but they all
but I really think we'll is there
perfusion because it's not I mean
there's plenty of oil you know a lot of
well eat cheap there's a lot of people
who want to use ethanol but they come
talk about em tall but I I don't see
that working we're really worth a thing
it you know people anything wind and
solar and that's great but when the
solar doesn't isn't base power so
doesn't run all the time it's not like a
coal plant where you turn it on and it
produces a gigawatt forever so there
just has to be a basically a political
will and you really need a smarter
allocation of resources natural gases is
a really cheap easy way to build a power
plant but is it necessarily the best you
will power plant is expensive and it's
really better than he hoped maybe wind
is better if you have a little wind
turbine on your house somewhere over the
mountains or something you say that the
Erwin and I agree with you but can this
be founded on genomic problem anytime
soon saying that the prices of energy go
up then it might be that private company
invested here
yes that the only way to put up the well
could possibly be there is an energy
crisis go so I get what he gets
I'm an attorney and investor is going to
do it if they see that there's a
potential make a profit there right now
and usually it's our enough oh it's far
enough often then that's probably not
that there is a company try out energy
in LA that's actually does that if
they're born twenty billion dollars into
try to that make
because essentially an FRC is under our
sea reactor one of the problems is
there's not a lot of people there's two
labs in the country that were funded
varsity's produce people to know
in Japan there's not a lot of experts
around partly because funding has been
gone for years I would love to see it
being willing to invest 20 billion
dollars over the next ten years or so in
order to do it certainly we can get it
to work would be it once you get the
thing working be able to print money
last question probably do you drink
while you're doing research you have to
worry about that things happening
I mean in software you know you write
some code you try to test it and then
you run it and all hell breaks loose for
society it seems like such a situation
here in the middle of you know the
industrial district of Redmond
cookie-cutter hazardous I mean he
pointed out that you know you can have
high energy particles you know shooting
at both ends this thing he worried I
mean with our with our device now there
really is the worst thing that we've
ever done the Redman was epic we've
ground out yeah in the summer one day
your treasurer Minister makes the full
charge everybody else had air
conditioners on and a substation blew up
and whoops soon after that everyone went
home
but since they've upgraded that
substation that's way the words that
we've ever done to rent okay you know we
we have the occasional energy arc blow
something out okay that's pretty
confident they'll be ready are our
neighbors are used to hearing banks and
the thing about fusion is it's really
particularly our device are really not
we may made one Neutron confusion
Neutron
we're so we're so called might get one
probably not even so no we don't have
that problem the tokamak does they you
know they do have to be out an area
that's away from public and particularly
like jab with Iran at tritium have to
have the trading mainland facilities
tritium poisons so you know there is
something like that product opening
before our said research now of course
they were going to happen is an arc so
we're covering our personnel make sure
you know what's around firing there but
as far as the danger neighbors
