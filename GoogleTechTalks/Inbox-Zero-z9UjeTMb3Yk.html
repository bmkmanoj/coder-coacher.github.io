just a quick note if if you can't find
SATA there is an over spell room for
this one it's Tunis I believe is the the
over spell here on campus so if you if
you need somewhere else to watch this
from that's the place when it comes to
superheroes I've always been more of a
spider-man than a Superman fan
personally and I'll come back to that
reference in a minute today it's my
great pleasure to introduce Merlin Mann
who I've read and followed for many
years he's the creator of 43 folders
website also slightly less well known
but very good is his fives website
that's a really good one if you haven't
checked that out and he's got a number
of other projects including macbreak
macbreak weekly regular on the twit
podcasting network and and so forth so I
mentioned spider-man moments a little
like spider-man to me spider-man is this
kind of really cool superhero with all
these powers but occasionally he swings
into buildings or has to wash his own
underwear and to me that makes that
character much more accessible and when
it comes to getting things done I feel
the same way about Merlin's advice he
swings into the occasional building or
um you know occasionally deals with the
day-to-day issues of washing your own
underwear and to me that advice just
makes a lot more sense so with that said
Merlin man thank you very much good with
this guy here can you guys can you hear
me okay
the thing is if I worked at Google I'd
have other people that could wash my
underwear for me so three four
you guys get laundry I don't know if you
know maybe that's just some of the
people that been here for a while
yeah they don't pick it up for you yeah
dry cleaning they'll do that yeah I was
ragging my friend about this the other
day okay he work in a place that you're
so infantilized they do your laundry for
you look you know but I pay for it and
I'm working out okay well still it's
pretty good ah thanks a lot for having
me here today I'm gonna talk about email
and something that I call inbox zero
based on a series of articles that I
wrote for 43 folders a while back a year
or two ago and has a lot to do with my
own struggles over the years to deal
with high volumes of email 1993 I got my
first email account
it's a pion account on the Tallahassee
Freenet this is a wonderful thing you
get a free internet account you get a
shell account anybody in town could get
it look up The Simpsons on gopher holes
till 2:00 in the morning was amazing and
it blew my mind
I mean I'd use Microsoft mail before I
had never had internet email and it was
astonishing
I knew probably maybe a dozen people
that had email addresses mostly people
who were like in grad school I had a
friend who was going to Oxford I could
email this guy could write him a letter
it would get there immediately and then
he'd write me back I mean I know a lot
of you are younger than me but this was
astonishing this was my boy I mean the
sense of like connecting with people
people you hadn't seen in forever you
find out they got an email address and I
said you're emailing it's email I you
got to have the email it was fantastic
was unbelievable and like every little
email I wrote was like a special little
letter was like I was getting a little
hug from somebody and I was returning it
with a little hug a dozen people in a
little network international network of
hugs and it felt so awesome and it
really it kind of stayed that way for
like probably almost two years it like
remain astonishing to me that I had
email it still kind of freaks me out a
little didn't always stay that way
eventually more than a dozen people
found out what my email address was I
suspect people more than that know yours
as well and somewhere along the way
email went from being kind of this funny
hip thing that you did with your geek
friends
into being the lingua franca for how you
dealt with your entire life and it
became kind of the one source for all
incoming and outgoing information and it
started to get a lot harder and all of a
sudden the messages became a little bit
less like careful letters and became
more like I don't know like a falling on
your head every morning and it became a
lot less fun and it became a lot less
about a network of hugs and that made me
sad
in 1993 I didn't need a system for doing
email the system was I logged in and I
tried to remember the commands for doing
things in Pine and I got my email and
that was all there was to it to have a
system for doing email with a dozen
people in at work seemed kind of crazy
and anal why would I need that and yet
today I feel like the only way we're
going to succeed at a job one of the
most important soft skills you can have
is figuring out how to deal with a high
volume of email and the only way that
you're going to do that is to be able to
put some kind of a system into place
it's going to be simple and repeatable
and is allow going to allow you to have
an actual life outside of email it
actually can happen - believe it or not
I think this does have to be a very
simple system it has to be a relatively
complete framework that regardless of
who the message is from or what kind of
content type it is you know how to deal
with everything that comes into your
world you're reducing the number of
possible options for what something
could be and turning it into a
relatively small number of verbs for
what you can actually do with any of
this stuff I think one of the most
important things an email system can do
is to build walls where they don't yet
exist a lot of people right now are for
practical purposes living in their inbox
they leave their email open all day long
it's Auto checking throughout the day
little blips come up about every minute
an email becomes the Nexus for
everything they do with work they use it
as a to-do list manager they use it as a
calendar I'm not talking about look
talking about people who like literally
scroll through their inbox they decide
what meetings they have to go through
today
to quote Walter subject you're entering
a world of pain that is that is not a
way to live that's not a system that's
crazy those edges are so important
because you guys are knowledge workers
which is a fancy way of saying you add
value to information and if you're a
knowledge worker the
two most precious natural resources
you've got or your time and your
attention they're both finite and
they're both irreplaceable there's no
way you're ever going to add a couple
hours to the day and as much as you
Emacs people probably think it's
possible you can't actually do 17 things
at one time multitasking in my
experience tends to be something of a
myth where you decide to put your time
and attention says a lot about who you
are says about a lot about you as a
human being you have some idea in your
head of all the stuff that's
high-priority to you right all the stuff
that really matters if I sat down and
like asked you you know what's really
important to you you go oh my family and
my church group and I'm a deacon but
then I go when I look in your email box
and your news feeds and your web browser
if I went and I got all CSI on that like
what
what would the last two weeks of your
electronic life say about how it maps to
the stuff that you claim is really
important maybe really well in which
case you should leave but um if you're
like me and you struggle with that you
need to have these walls and you need to
find ways to honor where your time and
attention go and there's probably no
better way to have your time burgled
than by not having a healthy
relationship with your email and not
having a sense of where stuff belongs as
much as your time and your attention are
finite the demands on your time and
attention are infinite there's no end to
how much people can ask of your time and
your attention you're ultimately the one
who's going to have to make decisions
about how your attention and your time
map to the things that you actually do
the actions in your life there's a
really a good writer and developer named
Joel Spolsky you probably know him from
Joel on software and he uses an example
that I like a lot that I'm gonna steal
he says that whether you're developing
software or what-have-you it's good to
think about the amount of available time
and effort as representing a box and
that's a box that's got a certain number
of cubic inches available in it and you
can put whatever you want into it but
every kind of task that you want to add
to that box is basically like a little
block big tasks or big blocks and little
tasks or little blocks
but no matter how you cut them up
there's still only so many cubic inches
in the box the fact of the matter is
that's all about opportunity cost every
time you put a crap block into your box
it means a really cool block doesn't get
to go in there and as much as we
sometimes feel like we're beholding to
bosses and teams we're ultimately the
traffic cop for this kind of stuff so
one idea behind this is yeah obviously
kind of a more general point but I think
it really keys to the idea of inbox zero
because it's a way of saying that
ultimately you want to not have to worry
about taking stupid blocks out of the
box it's better to make sure they never
get in there in the first place and that
requires a very kind of proactive
approach to managing the action in your
life that's really what this is all
about if you're managing actions you're
ensuring that your time and attention
are always mapping to the stuff that you
claim is important and as heretical as
this might sound it also means you could
spend less time doing email and discover
that there are things outside the world
of email that are also your job and your
life it's true I promise inbox zero has
a lot of prior art in particular I'm
taking a lot of these ideas from David
Allen's book getting things done
a lot of other stuff show hands getting
things done people anybody read it read
it you know in particular a lot of the
ideas around processing if you're
familiar with GTD it's going to have a
lot to do with this David Allen has a
phrase that he uses in getting things
done that I like a lot
he calls getting things done advanced
common sense and I think that's exactly
what a lot of this stuff is the stuff
that I'm going to talk to you about
today could not be any more obvious the
trouble is we don't always do the
obvious things and so putting them into
some kind of framework that you can get
your head around can be a great way to
keep things on the rails so the idea
behind inbox zero first of all we admit
to ourselves that email is really
nothing more than a medium it is as
Senator Stevens might say it's a tube it
gets things from one place to another
and I think that's really critically
important there's no need for you to
live in email there's no need for you to
be there that's not where the action is
right emails swell it's great for
getting stuff around but you don't want
to be focusing exclusively on the email
itself to the exclusion of the other
things that are in the email that need
to be liberated into other places
like appointments and tasks and
reference materials
I really believe there's a single place
for anything that's going to differ for
each one of us we're all going to have
our own idea about what that right place
is once you know where stuff goes it
gets a lot easier to figure out where to
put it and having an idea in your head
about where stuff needs to land and
where it could potentially live forever
that's your job to figure out the single
practice that I think could really
change your life starting today is to
process to zero process to zero every
time you check your email you never
check your email without processing
which I know sounds again heretical but
a lot of people get really good at
checking email and they don't always get
so good at doing anything about it
so we're going to show you how to do
processing but you're never going to
have an over full inbox if you can get
out of the habit of allowing that stuff
to kind of stack up in the first place
and that begins with processing every
time you check and finally it's an
action based system kids this is all
about converting stuff into action even
if that action means deleting the email
it's about deciding in the moment what
you need to do about it and then moving
on processing is probably the most
important piece of that in terms of how
this is going to be affecting you from
from day to day I think one of the one
of the problems is that a lot of people
especially kind of the BlackBerry kids
think that checking is enough I'm going
to check my email
gotta go check my email well you know if
you check something and theoretically
you're doing that so it's because
there's a fire in there that might be
coming up okay well you checked it
there's no fire but there's also five
other emails that you haven't done
anything with well you know checking
brings with it a certain amount of
responsibility if you're checking on
your friend's cat while they're out of
town it's incumbent upon you to tell
them if anything goes wrong with the cat
if you check in on Monday and the cats
fine check out on Tuesday the cat's fine
check out on Wednesday it spontaneously
combusted you don't just come back on
Thursday and hope that it got better
you've checked on the cat and there's a
problem and now you deal with it don't
let your BlackBerry turn into exploding
cats that's that's that's not a good
thing
I've been get at the same time the good
news is that it means less than
responding right there's more than
checking less than responding responding
is one possible outcome of processing
but it's not the only one that's 1993
talking every time you think every email
you
needs a response I know most of you
probably aren't in that place but
somewhere search your your mind and see
if there's maybe some little corner that
still thinks man you got to respond to
200 emails and you don't you got to
process 200 emails which is so different
at the end of the day processing means
that you're going to look at every
single piece of email in your inbox and
decide what it means to you where does
this go or remain to our point what
actions do I have to take as a result of
this email think of yourself is like a a
minor you're an information minor an
action minor there's little veins of
gold and probably fools cold in some
cases in your email and it's your job to
go figure out what that is and that's
kind of what the processing is all about
I have this idea that if you work in a
deli and you're behind the counter
people keep bringing you orders orders
orders orders a lot of people I know
would think hmm these orders are really
interesting I should check to see if I
have any new orders mmm five more orders
okay yeah I get any new orders oh yeah I
got coming orders what how I should have
organized these should I alphabetical or
maybe numerical no you're making
sandwiches you're not stacking the whole
point of this is to go make a damn
sandwich you know if you just sat around
all day trying to figure out is are
there any new orders that's not the
point focus on putting out the
sandwiches and don't worry so much about
the orders once you've mined the gold
out of your email it's a dead skeletal
husk and you can throw it away when
you're processing the idea is to
liberate all that stuff and be done and
throwing the husk away as quickly as
possible
don't don't clean in this like sad like
Buddhist way to your to your email and
this is likes weird cya you know anxiety
fest you just you know move it on get it
out of the way as quickly as you can't
get it off your plate now the way we're
going to do this is through a limited
number of options for what you can do
with a given email this is my system
this is what works for me okay so your
and number here might be different but
for the way I do this there's five
potential potential things that can
happen to any email five and only five
verbs that tell me everything I can do
with an email why is this a good thing
well like right now
just think to yourself imagine your
inbox is there any email in your inbox
right now that you read but you haven't
done anything about maybe a couple
couple of you chances are because you
don't you haven't really thought about
what the possible verbs are and it's
weirdly comforting once you know what
those verbs are for yourself in your own
little system it's can be it can be
weirdly comforting to be able to just
blow through that stuff
oh gosh you should delete so much of
your email it's just unbelievable how
much email you can delete or archive
either kind of roughly I'm going to use
my laser pointer these are kind of
roughly in the order of desirability
just for the way I think about this
stuff but if I can delete an email boy
I'm for damn sure going to delete it I'm
gonna get it out of there the default
state of your inbox should probably not
be keep sitting here until I start
weeping that's that's not a good
approach if you find yourself with a
little scroll wheel going up and down
while tears run down your face like
something's something's not working and
so can you delete it okay delete it
that's great
it's just something where this would
really be better for somebody else to do
you can delegate it to somebody else
that could be delegated horizontally or
vertically just means somebody else is
going to work on it if it's enable email
that you can respond to very quickly
just blow out a one to three line
response in one or two minutes keep
moving keep the ball in motion it might
be something that you want to defer this
can be a tricky one
but if it's something where you need to
respond to this but it's going to take a
little bit of outside work it's still
primarily an email based task you might
want to kind of put that aside to do for
later on and then finally if it's
something you can do go do it now and be
done with it right advanced common sense
yes I will give you that but if you can
find out what your little verbs are and
then make sure that you're always doing
them you're never going to have that
stuff stacking up in your inbox again
because you know there's only so many
outcomes and it's just a matter of you
as quickly as possible
determining which one of those outcomes
it is and then dispensing it as quick as
you can let's talk about each in just a
little bit more detail I include
archiving and deleting and I'll explain
why in a minute
but obviously you know if it's if it's
you know
urban myths from your aunt if it's you
know viagra ads or whatnot you know to
jump that but I mean there's a lot of
stuff that you get that you can also
junk once you get really good and fasted
this stuff it's going to blow your mind
how much of your email you throw away
once you kind of lose the fear but
anything that doesn't have any place in
your life and never will
get rid of that's said if there is stuff
that you will need in the future archive
it and what is our kyvan archiving for
me is a single folder it's a single
folder called archive it does not
twenty-four folders friend it's not it's
it's not coming up with the most crazy
Byzantine taxonomically complete system
that you can think of cuz be honest for
those of you who do have the 24 folder
Byzantine system when's the last time
you used it to actually find anything
maybe you do maybe you use it all the
time user will win a prize but for most
of you I've seen you you sit there and
you go wow this is going to be
definitely 2007 July blog relate it's a
blog related or CMS really it's more
like my Ruby ultimate golf group really
it should go here I'll tag it and
duplicate it dude it's the modern age
you got the freaking Gmail search for it
flag it if you need to if you to flag it
and put it into a folder that's great
but ask yourself and I will give out
grant you some of you need this
structure because you're crazy but if
but be honest with yourself what is the
payoff are you getting for the amount of
time that you I'm on a Mac I grab an
email and I start dragging it I have to
start thinking now where does this go
for an email that I'm going to archive I
kind of think about where it goes I'm
not a librarian I have a blog like it's
all goes into archive ask yourself what
is the minimally Byzantine system that
you can tolerate that will still allow
you to find stuff later on does not need
to be taxonomically satisfying it needs
to be easy to find there's a really big
difference but delete whatever you can
and just try to keep it simple delegate
is kind of a no-brainer if you're
forwarding it usually to somebody and
you're saying hey I think can you give
can you give this person this
information or what have you the only
addition I would add to that there's
another action associated with that
especially if you do GTD which is the
idea of having a follow-up so if you
want to be proactive about this
I've used that twice so I need to put a
dollar in the jar now if you want to be
proactive about this you want to drill
down net-net
open the kimono seriously friend EA if
you want to if you're going to delegate
to somebody it's a good idea to give
yourself a little tickler and say okay
in two weeks give yourself a reminder to
make sure it happened everybody's got a
different way they handle this I have a
in Miami I use OmniFocus as the program
I use and I have a little context in
there called waiting on where I can
watch stuff sometimes I put things on a
calendar but I think it's a good idea to
whenever you can start getting in this
is mindset of converting things into
actions it's not always just somebody
else's job and then just kind of get it
out of the way as quick as you can
quick responses I'm guessing this is
probably a huge amount of what you get I
know you kids are on a lot of the email
lists you get a lot of stuff through the
day you're participating in learning to
blow out a really fast like one or two
line reply is such a ninja move there's
a website that started last week or two
called five sentences I don't if you
guys have seen this there's five
sentences four sentences three sentences
and two sentences and there they're
Spanish sites so the end in DES five
sentences and kind of funny and it's
it's a way of saying to people I have
undertaken it that from now on no no
email I ever write will be longer than
five sentences and and so you put in
your foot or your emails and people know
that you're not being terse you're being
efficient maybe you're being tors maybe
you're from New England you're just
naturally taciturn
but get it out as quick as you can
and and I you know I think if you can I
think there's this I don't know I want
to come up with some kind of fancy
computer term for this but there's got
to be some phrase for like the
disproportionate way that how many times
have you gotten something usually from
over your pay grade where somebody sends
you a one-line email that represents a
month of work for you there's a terribly
disproportionate thing going on an email
and the same thing happens when somebody
writes you a twenty five paragraph email
do you feel like you've got to write
them back as 25 I struggle with this I
get a lot of email from really nice
people and I there's no way I could ever
write that much so you gotta find your
comfort zone with this stuff but being
able to respond quickly and just kind of
keep the ball in motion keeping the ball
in motion is very important if you don't
have enough information to respond to
this right now ask a question just keep
things moving and get it out of your
inbox
this one's thorny but it's important and
this is the idea of deferring if you're
doing a quick check-in on your email and
you're processing there may be some
things that you don't want to deal with
right now but you will want to deal with
later if there's stuff we're going to
need extra information before you can
respond you might want to put that in
dot personally I put this into a to
respond folder and then throughout the
day I go down and try to winter that
down so that I'm kind of hopefully
trying to empty that by the end of every
day don't always do it but the idea is
that your inbox really kind of should be
for stuff you haven't read yet I know
that again
advanced common sense but there's a lot
of you probably a few of you who have a
milliner that's read you're not doing
anything with well you know if you need
to figure out what you need to get rid
of it and then do that and get it out of
the way and then finally if there's
something that you can do this is so
important do it or capture a placeholder
for that action of doing it so what does
that mean if it's something I can do
right now if I can just go walk a folder
down two cubes go do it you're done with
it email is finished but if it's
something you can't do now or shouldn't
do now or won't do now what if it's a a
meeting in the future put it on your
calendar you would be amazed how many
people decide what they're going to do
today by looking at their inbox their
inbox means this hasn't blown up yet it
means these are things I
feel bad enough about that I haven't put
them in my trashcan as much as possible
liber8 activity out of your Inbox
I just cannot put this strongly enough
keep a separate list for tasks it
doesn't matter whether what you're using
you guys don't have a task app yet you
need that but you could use you know
whatever we could use Remember The Milk
you could use a Google Docs I use text
files to remember a lot of this stuff
but don't live out of your inbox and
don't use it as a to-do list because
that will make you crazy
I just I feel so strongly about this
there's one and only one thing you can
do with each one of these but the thing
you don't do is just let it sit around
without a reason because that's when the
procrastination starts and as soon as
you see I don't know if you guys have
ever dealt with clutter in your life but
it happens with clutter in the home too
we're like one area you put down a
jacket and then pretty soon there's a
pair of pants on it and then there's
Hulk number four and there's some court
of wood and like pretty soon that area
is completely gone the same is true here
if you keep your inbox tidy you're going
to respect it more and in a certain way
that really says that you're respecting
your time and attention and saying that
I as much as I love the email it's
important enough to me that I take it a
little bit more seriously so one and
only one so like I say last time I'll
say this this may not be your trip like
you're gonna have to figure out what
your I think these are actually pretty
sound
I think 80% of the DNA for most email
systems is probably somewhere in here
but you need to figure this out for
yourself you have your own workflow you
got your own live sketch room weird
peculiar habits you picked up in college
honor that with my blessing I think one
of the most frustrating things about the
life hacking movement one of the things
I find most vexing is the implicit idea
that acquiring a system is all you need
to take care of a problem to me this is
really not so much more sophisticated
than thinking that you're going to be
more organized because you got a PDA
ultimately whatever system I think I
happen to think the inbox zero system is
very I think it's pretty intuitive and
easy to follow but it's meaningless if
you don't put it in place the whole
heart of life hacking comes down to one
idea in my mind and it's the idea
there's a really smart part of your
brain and there's really dumb part of
your brain and if you always let the
smart part of your brain think that it's
really smart and don't do anything to
help the dumb part you
you're going to be in a world of pain to
make the synaptic leap between the dumb
part and the smart part is what a life
hack is all about and that's what really
what this is I haven't shown you
anything here that you don't already
know how to do but if you actually do it
you're going to see extraordinary
differences the way that you have to
make this happen though is you've got
you've got to make it a habit you got to
have it be something that you do
repeatedly otherwise there's really not
much worth to it at all and I think one
of those healthy habits in the long run
is that processing ironically processing
on a regular as in repeating basis gives
you time to get out of email and go have
a life somewhere else so just to kind of
put some of these tips in perspective
and to give you some ways to help this
stick a couple quick tips I think it's
really important to do email less and by
that I mean don't leave email open do
not leave Auto check on I know this
sounds crazy consider turning off your
email applications sometimes and working
on other stuff if you're in customer
service you can't do that if you're in a
Korean missile silo you can't do that if
you're the one who who feeds and grooms
the Pagerank you probably can't do that
but if you're like a normal person who
has a job there's a pretty good chance
that you can shut your email off
sometimes and let it accumulate for a
while while you go and work have you
ever had this happen you go on vacation
and you come back and you get the 700
emails or whatever and it's I'm always
gobsmacked by how incredibly stupid most
of my email is but it seemed really
important if I got a reminder after a
minute you know if you leave those if
you leave I think mailed that app if you
leave it in its default state will
remind you of new mail every minute
that's 2,400 interruptions a week so
it's worth figuring out how many of
those under options you can really
tolerate given how important the news
that we're having Sally's birthday at
TGI Fridays is to you at a given time I
really feel like you want to schedule
email dashes my suggestion to you is
that you try to check your email once
per hour and in that hour go and check
your email for ten straight minutes
process it to zero respond to what you
can close it up and get back to work
maybe that won't work for you maybe for
you it's every 20 minutes trying get
yourself onto some kind of a schedule
where you're looking periodically enough
that you're not going to lose your mind
or have your boss think you're you know
smoking weed under the desk but as much
as you can try to shut off and get away
from that one thing you will immediately
notice is that a lot of stuff seems less
like a fire than it did when it was
coming in all the time and while we're
at it
ditto for hate to say it ditto for news
feeds if you have it in you to to check
a little bit less often go past do a
pass twice a day you'll enjoy it more
and you'll get a lot more done it is
totally okay to cheat the first cheat
that is awesome is filtering if there's
any stuff that's coming in I'm sure you
guys are already doing this with all the
lists and stuff that you're on but if
there's stuff that's low level high
noise not important I don't need to know
this now stuff filter it in such a way
that it goes into a folder as being red
give yourself a reminder to go check it
once a day once a week or however often
you need to check it but there's no need
to be notified of noisy stuff there's
any way you can filter that stuff out
which what can't you filter you can't
filter stuff that requires your brain to
be engaged on an ongoing basis obviously
if it's like your primary project you're
not going to be able to filter that be
careful that you don't over filter which
I know Gmail will let you do it's kind
of like if you train spam assassin and
it starts like throwing out your mom's
emails you know you've got to be careful
about how much of this you try to
automate because you still do need your
brain engaged with a lot of it the other
one and I don't know if any of you kids
work on the Gmail but I love templates I
would love to see template functionality
in Gmail I currently use an application
for mail app called mail template it
makes it really easy to create custom
templates that you can just respond
superfast to email if you start thinking
in terms of templates you guys are
already thinking in templates in terms
of the way you code things right you
reuse libraries and stuff like that if
you discover that 80% of your email
comes from the same ten responses
consider automating that with with a
template especially for stuff outside
your team can really speed things up
yeah I have a male template or somebody
god bless them asked me an incredibly
obvious question about something that's
on the site that was on the first
response first return in Google so I'll
go and I'll do the search on Google and
it goes to my clipboard and then mail
template I'll respond to their email and
I've got a little international symbol
for HTML but it's got a little spot
where it drops in whatever was in my
clipboard so it says dear Jimmy hey
thanks a lot for stopping by I think you
find what you're looking for here Wow
and it drops in the clipboard could be a
fake use could be whatever but it's sort
of like you guys thinking about how you
talk out of my butt for a minute but
think about how you refactor code and
how you can reuse bits of stuff same
thing here if you discover you're
answering the same thing over and over
try to automate it and keep it simple
and the other thing is you know I know
you're like--you're whatever like
freaking Walt Whitman and everything
every word you write is a dream and you
would never think of boilerplate but at
least use it as a jumping-off point like
consider at least having a little core
of a one paragraph response if it's
something you write a lot saves you a
lot of time and finally try not to
fiddle don't be that guy going up and
down in the inbox just all day long
sitting there thinking about where you
put stuff try to minimize any kind of
activity that does not directly support
creating and managing actions if you're
not actually getting that stuff done
you're not really doing work you're just
playing with email if you guys ever seen
that movie metropolis the one from the
20s they're just awesome scene in
Metropolis where this this experiment
expressionist worker man is hooked up to
the the impossible to keep up with
machine and he has to keep turning the
arms on this clock and this completely
asinine see it's hilarious awesome scene
well I'm here to tell you you know if
you don't be doing this all day long
being hooked up to anything right if
you're just doing metal work inside of
email you're not really getting stuff
done and so I think as much as possible
it's a good idea to kind of self monitor
and figure out what are the things I
need to do that are going to keep me
moving this stuff and let me create
create little email corpses out of these
as quickly as possible try to stay with
the program get out of email as often as
you can and then just stay focused on
man
in action and looks a periodically just
give yourself a little check and you
know remember when you felt guilty 20
minutes ago when I asked you how your
actions tracked your things you say are
important try and do that once in a
while and really say to yourself am i am
i putting my time and my attention where
it should be right now and is there a
way that that I can have this email
become less noisy for me and generate
more actions and the irony in my opinion
is that if you do this well it actually
becomes a little bit more like 1993
because you spend less time messing
around with a lot of junk you don't care
about and a lot more time doing the
stuff that really matters to you and
that's a pretty good gig Thanks I
deliberately tried to keep that short so
that I hope we can have a discussion and
chat and have questions and you can tell
me where I'm wrong we got plenty of time
I'm just gonna stand here until you guys
answer question ask us questions so you
can ask questions you can tell me about
what it's like to work at the Google and
have a high volume of email you can tell
me yes sir so I really like the idea of
only checking your email once every hour
but I think the problem is that everyone
expects me to be checking it once every
30 seconds and how do you how do you get
other people aware that you want to
follow a system different from the
system they expect you to do yeah it's
absolutely the number one you're right
on it's the number one response anybody
would have to that seemingly crazy idea
and the truth is that a lot of its going
to depend on your team's well whoever it
is you work with a lot it's going to
it's going to have a lot to do with how
they think about this stuff and how the
person who's in a position to evaluate
you thinks about that stuff but I think
you might be surprised you guys work in
cubes right I mean do you have to
renegotiate every day how allowed to
play the music and whether you should
eat a tamale like you work it out right
don't you kind of figure out within your
own little culture how that's going to
work I think one thing you can do is to
say to each other you see this happening
now everybody talks about like oh no
email Fridays and stuff like that I
don't know about that but I do think
that more and more people are people are
having these conversations
to at least say hey you know anybody
else feeling like our news groups have
gotten kind of noisy anybody else kind
of feel like what if we were to say we
check email like one day a week let's
say we check email when we get in we do
a scrum or whatever and then we kind of
disappear for a couple hours
who would have a problem with that and
what could we do to work around that
it's really up you know I don't have
there's not one answer but ultimately
you're identifying the more basic
problem you would never call somebody at
their house at like nine o'clock on a
Sunday night not when I was a kid it
just wasn't done but now because your
emails out there people feel like they
have unlimited access to you so part of
this I really think I think we're
starting to see the pendulum swing back
as we try to negotiate how much of
ourselves we want to be available to
people all the time and how we maintain
our sanity at those times when we need
to not be getting new data yes sir so
addressing the previous point if you
don't set up an expectation that you
will answer rapidly it's amazing how
much it affects how people try to use
the email to get in contact with you but
my second question is using the inbox as
a to-do list I have a tendency to do
that because I don't have good tools for
doing managing a pseudo to-do list
outside of email and what tools are out
there that might actually integrate the
to-do list with the scheduling of the
time to do what's on the to-do list
then I think you're right on and I mean
I think managing expectations
I learned this a long time ago when I
was first a web designer back before we
had interaction designers we just had
web designers about $20,000 less
when I turn in 16 colors then it was a
different world I learned early on
because I always because I'm a sad
pathetic person I always want to please
people and so I would way over deliver
way early with clients and man when I
ever regret it I think you're absolutely
right I think people will take you more
seriously if you do kind of establish I
mean part of it is like I say it's team
culture I mean in the same way that
people sometimes say oh we got to get a
wiki to help communicate better as a
team or like we need a new you know our
problem is if we need a new CMS you're
like no you need to figure out how to
talk to each other better like this
getting a CMS then you got two problems
you know I think that's I think that's a
big part of it to your point about where
to put this stuff it's my feeling and
again I'm just going to this come
straight out of getting things done
great book I think the idea of
understanding that it's all about
managing action means you take it
seriously enough that you park actions
someplace special one thing that's
important to me I think is the idea that
whatever I accept as an action whatever
goes onto my list that could be a text
file that could be it could be something
like Remember The Milk it could be Todd
Ollis there's a lot of electronic ways
could be a moleskin notebook but
whatever it is you put on that list has
a certain kind of almost magic to it
because the act of committing that to
your page is your way of saying this
isn't just a good idea this is something
that I'm going to do and I think one of
the distinctions about understanding
processing has everything to do with
task lists as well the reason to do
lists don't work is because there's no
skin in the game to-do lists are great
everybody in here can make a list right
now a great to-do list because really
most people to-do lists are about
collection capture they're about anxiety
it's about what's what's what's top of
mind right now goes on the list
retirement ah lumps ah and all this
stuff goes on a list and now you've made
a list awesome you made a list and the
list could include vacation to Paris
pick up milk buy diapers and it's like
whoa the content types are crazy here
and these are all different sizes and
shapes the only way to make a task list
that really means anything
is to kind of try to make those roughly
the same shape and to make them all kind
of have a certain amount of decisiveness
about it so whatever you use you know I
think for most of you a text file could
be all you need
one thing about geeks and my experience
is that they don't have a lot of what
David Allen calls context or a lot of
different sets of tools and
opportunities you know at computer is
pretty much it and so for a lot of us
that could be that could be a text file
all I would say is whatever you choose
choose the tool that stops just short of
being fun to use if it's too fun to use
you're gonna fiddle and you're going to
be like the guy with the clock again
like keep it keep it to where you kind
of don't love using it like and and
where you don't become so concerned with
the taxonomy every time you start the
kid about taxonomy go do three tasks
that's all I am I don't know if that
answers your question it depends a lot
of people I think it'd be great thing
for Google to make I could totally see
this being integrated with Google
Calendar
at some point I know none of your
position to say you can't even tell me
how your subversion works I know but but
I think in the future that'd be a great
thing for Google to add some kind of
task management but personally I like
something that I can take on a plane you
know what I mean I don't the whole like
wired thing is problematic for me I'm
sure you guys got a solution that's
gonna get my personal information but I
I think having
I think there's nothing wrong with
having a sheet of paper I can't like you
do not believe how many friends of mine
especially friends I know who work here
walk around on the pad of paper they
write things down then they cross it off
you got ubiquitous capture you know no
batteries run down
I personally carry around the stack of
index cards to write things down
whatever works for you yeah but having
having the tasks the main thing is that
there's it's important to be able to
capture them when they're on your mind
and I like to say the time that you
remember that you're out of toilet paper
tends not to be when you're at Safeway
in the toilet paper aisle and so you
need a capture device it's going to be
widely available but then you're gonna
want to have recall at the point when
you can do something about it so
whatever system does that for you other
words the mic yeah hi um well know that
you just got done talking about how
great text files in piece of paper are I
wanted to ask you about your opinion on
the state of GTD apps you mentioned
OmniFocus which I've tried and haven't
really gotten too involved with I can't
quite figure it out you just tell me you
I'll put that as a bug thanks you just
tell me what you think about them yeah
when what's their value that's a chance'
fantastic question he's asking about the
state of GTD apps when I started 43
folders in a 2004 Wow
apparently I'm 40 there was not much in
the way of GTD apps especially for Mac
users and I kind of at the time was very
like there should be GTD applications
and now brother are there every GTD
applications so many I think the failing
of a lot not the failing but the
challenge of GTD is its if you I'm sorry
to go on about this for those of you who
are already sick of GTD which I can
understand but part of the beauty of GTD
is that it's such a tool agnostic
framework and part of the the challenge
and the wonder of GTD is that it's
applicable in so many situations I think
one problem with a lot of applications
is they try too hard to be an all-in-one
GTD application and that especially
tends to fall down in the review process
which is the most critical part of
keeping GTD working on an ongoing basis
just like your filters for email
shouldn't try to do the thinking for you
I would try to avoid any GTD application
that
nice to do too much thinking for you I
think you want to be looking for an
application this doesn't this is this
isn't limited to just GTD it's true for
any task management applications you
want something where it's easy to
capture in a way that's seamless and
doesn't require you to change modes that
I would say that's important you need a
way to kind of put it into the most
basic categories that allow you to
contextually have tasks when you can do
something about them and you need a way
to afford reviews they can't do the
reviews for you and I think that's a
problem with some of them I was talking
with at lunch today actually about one
thing that's neat about Unix I mean as
little as I really understand about UNIX
I do understand the idea of pipes and I
love the idea that tiny applications can
do things together and in some cases I
want the really sharp paring knife I
don't want the goofy Swiss Army knife
that came out of the bubblegum machine I
want the one super freaking hot sharp
paring knife to do this one thing and
that's why I think the beauty this is
you can do capture on paper right and
you can do task tracking electronically
and you can do your reviews you know on
a white board what do you know whatever
works for you and the way that whatever
compensatory muscles you need to develop
to keep your your brain upright you can
cobble together a system that will do
that for you
Merlin so if you come back from vacation
and you have a big pile all right hey
how are you or you know Monday and
there's the medium-sized pile what's
your thinking about the order in which
you should process the mail should it be
you know chronological should be
alphabetical this is one of those VI
Emacs
kind of things because there's the
conventional wisdom is you cherry-pick
for the stuff that's highest priority
and there's nothing I can say to you
that will keep you from doing that
because that's how our brain works and
you guys are all smarter than me I can't
talk you out of that but as much as
possible I think I try to go latest two
most recent in order
and I think once you've made the psychic
leap from I have to respond to all these
too I have to process these that becomes
less painful because once you become a
total ninja at processing and this is
where something like mud or something
becomes you know if you can you have key
commands for doing these kinds of tasks
it's hugely helpful mail act on for mail
bot app great for stuff like this that
ability to just blaze through it really
quickly you you've taken down the ramp
up to that right because ordinarily you
feel like oh gosh it's Monday I got to
go run and put out my fires but you can
do that but as long as you don't do it
to the exclusion of the other stuff how
do you do it so I think I try and get
rid of the junk first and then see
what's left I think that's a brilliant I
think it Thanks I think that I think
that no but I think that I'll tell you
why sure it's funny but the but what
you're doing is a pattern and you say oh
throughout junk no duh well that's a
pattern that you can extend a long way
that pattern of okay this is I
immediately see that this is stuff I can
get rid of taking that and extending
that to okay and here's stuff that I
don't need to do now that I can do later
or here's things that I need to do this
about but you're making these very fast
in the moment decisions and once you get
good at this stuff indicating you should
any of those five steps should come to
you very quickly because you know where
it goes deleting is easy because you
know it just goes away if you can't make
decisions as quickly as you delete it
because you don't know where stuff
should go and that's the missing part in
your system maybe yes you sir so we
related question if you're a very bad
boy
we have large involves dating back what
would you do if you found your sorry
here if you found yourself in such a
situation including like letters from
friends and really guilty so so
hypothetically hypothetically if you
have been letting so I'm assuming this
is a live email account that's checked
all the time okay there's a difference
but like versus like having Iman checks
accounts the only check periodically but
if it's something where that's that
attrition has been happening over time
and it's been piling up piling up piling
up I'll tell you the very first thing I
would do I asked I tell people to create
something that I call the email DMZ so
the first thing you need to do is to
stop sucking like before you get good
you have to stop sucking so first of all
go make a folder called DMZ and drag
every one of those emails into that
folder and then stop doing that that's
my first thing do you follow what I'm
saying it's like so but you thought I
say that to people they're like well
yeah but I still got all that email I'm
like yeah but if you had done that six
months ago you would have six months
less of stuff that it piled up so number
one clear out your inbox give yourself a
fresh start and put that into a folder
you still have to go through all that
email what you can do in dashes that's
the first thing that I would do um you
could there's a lot been a lot of talk
lately about email bankruptcy and the
idea basically BC seeing everybody you
know and saying that's it new dealer I'm
done if it's really important call me
see suck it I'm out of here
hi that's hard to do and I in a company
that would probably be really hard to do
but um I think no seriously I think it I
think it helps to give yours I mean how
can I put this you um if it was easy for
you to answer those you already would
have answered them if that was something
that you could do in in your head if
that's something you could do in five
minutes you already would have done it
you've got to be honest with yourself
you don't get an empty inbox by living a
lie you've got to start by being really
honest with yourself so if you know
you're never gonna respond to some email
even if it's somebody that you love love
love delete it what do you do instead
keep it for six months and then delete
it oh that's awesome that they probably
feel great you know if you're gonna
answer it answer it now I mean I don't
mean to get all like kung-fu on you but
I mean like that's what you got to do
and I mean what you could do I mean
there's all kinds of this is how
pathetic I am there's all kinds of
little tricks you could do like you
could go in there and take it from a
slightly different point of view and say
of the people in here all those friends
and all those babies that have been born
and all those birthdays that went by
what would make me feel great which one
of these people would I actually really
like to connect with so instead of
thinking of it as this deficit that
makes you feel terrible try to think of
it as like if I could reach out to one
person and feel really energized by
writing to them start there yes
hey so one of the issues that many of us
here have is it seems like your system
would work really well on a personal
account but with a work account
frequently somebody will email your team
and now they're you know maybe 20 people
that could respond to this issue so you
might look at the email and you might
say well I could respond or I could wait
for one of the other 20 people to
respond right and so you ignore it for
an hour or two and then you come back to
it later and you say oh did anyone
respond yet maybe do I have on to
respond now and so how do you have any
suggestions for playing this little
waiting game with your teammates
well yeah two things well first of all
it's a trick question because you know
it's that's a if that's if the practice
of your group is to have stuff
generically go out to 20 people and hope
someone takes care of it there's there's
a part of that workflow that makes me
think that could probably be tuned a
little bit
I would suggest something like bug
tracking or something like that but no
but seriously I mean you're right I mean
but how can I put this I mean my friend
Jeff Veen he's talked about this all the
time you know people come in they come
to your Co we got to get a CMS we got to
go to this we got to get it out here's
this thing I read about in the in-flight
magazine it's going to make our company
really great and the oh the trouble is
the technology is going to do your
bidding but it's not going to fix
communication problems or broken
practices that said there are ways that
you could probably do it is there's a
tend to be one or two people that
actually do the work or does it get
widely distributed that went up to 20
people right and so you see if they when
they respond to that that could see seed
everybody in the group and you would
know that it got answered so the whole
time you're just kind of sitting there
going like who's it gonna be wow that's
wow it's a good question I mean I that
sounds like kind of a practice that you
guys could talk seems like you could
talk a little bit to clean that up a
little bit but I don't know I mean I
would have to think it something like
like bug tracking would be better for
something like that but um but it gives
me a chance to say one thing there are
some problems that can't be fixed by
email and there's some problems where
email how can I put this email you know
is just the canary in the coal mine you
feel the pain in that place in the inbox
but by the way you can read more about
this stuff at inbox zero com it
redirects to a 43 folder series that
contains a bunch of this crap but what
do you do with somebody who keeps
sending you junk for example this is I
mean in some ways this is somewhat
related to that like you get the the the
aunt that keep sending you the the urban
myths and the 200 dollar cookie and all
that stuff and you just keep sending
them the Snopes links but they keep
sending you you know the stuff there's
some stuff we've really just got a
you've either got a proc mail them or
you've got to talk to them so I don't
know I mean I guess I feel like there's
all kinds of problems that you could at
least start to say hey does anybody else
that see this as something that we could
work
on I don't know what do you guys think
is this is that it was what he's
describing a big Google wide problem you
know it's like the FBI is here people
are shooting this entire thing this is
all being recorded now seriously but
that is that is that a widespread
problem not knowing who's going to
handle something sent to distribution
who's got the best solution for it here
yeah
does it does getting good about
responding to that harm you in the long
run do you become the go-to person and
is that a good thing or bad thing
the problem is responding immediately is
then the person to send a genome is very
responsive
granted so there is some advantage to
waiting just see what happens to prevent
everyone from responding simultaneous
yeah
every day
Oh
bringing all the
so it becomes a little bit like reverse
office hours like there's like you have
a time when you're not responding
yeah
oh I'm interested in hearing more about
that though that's I think that's I
think that's a very that's a tough
question and I'm just curious though I I
know sometimes you guys try to try to
squash the myth but so show hands emails
that come from a Google address that you
receive every day in your estimation
hundred raw like you come in you turn on
your computer if you had nothing in
place how many Google emails would be in
your inbox doesn't somebody toss out how
much 200 500 I'm gonna have a Dabba
Dabba de so anybody more than 500 but
it's photo is more than 500 some of you
are getting more than 500 emails
whatever helps if I'm an eye I would
really want to ask what I get out of
people getting 600 emails a day and how
much I'm how many were actionable what
percentage of your emails are actionable
require you to do something other than
read them and file them one to five
percent 2% hey how's it going
um wow that's that's extraordinary if I
was if I was mr. Google I would I would
want to ask a lot of questions that's
extraordinary
well more questions yeah um actually
just an announcement but not to finish
the questions many of you know this but
I wanted to mention that we do bring the
David Allen company here to do getting
things done courses on a regular basis
so if any of you have not taken it or
you've studied GTD before and you want a
refresher you're absolutely welcome to
enroll for a class in fact we have them
going this Thursday and Friday
no it's last-minute but we do have some
seats it's a one-day class we offer it
across to half-day so to morning
sessions or to afternoon you can enroll
by going to go /gt DW so just wanted to
mention that that's awesome
yeah that's great I know I have took his
took the blogger team to that a while
back I think it's I mean this is I guess
this is a plug so I'll call it a plug
that's a heck of a seminar it's funny
one thing people always ask is how do
you how do you do GTD on teams
the truth is it can be pretty hard to
like make anybody do anything like that
but it's kind of this object-oriented
productivity approach where everybody
has responsible their little black box
is responsible about input and output it
kind of makes things a little healthier
that's cool that you do that we've
probably got time for one more question
anybody else and I'll hang around after
if anybody wants to say hey or whatever
but one more question come on make me
feel good ask questions yeah
just like um just to bother checking
every single email like literally
clicking the box is more pain than I can
bear
and I think the problem we have at
Google is that you're on we don't have
like we have an internal RSS reader but
a lot of stuff that probably could be on
blogs like we're just used to doing it
on mailing lists and so your mailing
lists are kind of this knowledge archive
firehose type thing yeah so do you have
any techniques for dealing with like the
knowledge firehose that even a sort of
proxies that's that's really interesting
that you as we're speaking I started to
think there was an article I read in the
I find the early 90s that was comparing
talking about Macs and Windows I guess
was the mid 90s comparing Macs and
Windows and saying that Windows was very
Protestant and Mac was very Catholic it
seems like you need almost like an
information priest you need it sounds
like for like some of these problems you
need sectional representatives who are
helping to digest this and then share
the really relevant parts of it if
there's stuff we're not everybody needs
to know about it but yeah that's a
firehose that's crazy and again I mean
blaming email is you know that's just
kind of blaming the messenger it sounds
like that's one thing that might be
helpful but good Allisyn say sometimes
I've thought that Google relies on
randomness to make sure that information
gets to the right person it's kind of
like a redundant random graph and like
they might or might not flow you know
for the best really it's so like they
just they just throw it all out there
and kind of hope today like you're
talking to somebody at lunch and they're
like oh you're doing that project have
you heard of a person in New York who's
doing a very similar project no no I
have it well Google home of the random
information spotter hey so I have been
Merlin and this has been inbox zero and
thank you very much to to dick in
particular for having me in today thanks
to everybody I'll hang out thank you
you
