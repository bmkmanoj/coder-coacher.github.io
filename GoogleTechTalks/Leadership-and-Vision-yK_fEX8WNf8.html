is our second installment in the
hispanic Googler networks series of
talks called perspective us where we try
to provide mentors at scale to share
their stories of success today we're
honored to have Jerry Porras from
Stanford University will be talking to
us about leadership and vision
so without further adieu Jerry Porras
will hello everybody I'm happy to be
here and to have a chance to talk to
some Googlers my only connection with
Google is that Sur gays wife happened to
be the daughter of a very good friend of
ours on the Stanford campus and grew up
and I so I've known her since she was a
little girl that's my connection also I
use Google on my computer so there's two
connections I want to talk about
leadership and talk about it with a with
a bit of trepidation because if there is
any topic in management that has been
over written about over researched over
commentary its leadership I mean there
are literally thousands of studies that
have been done about leadership
there are literally probably thousands
of books that have been written about
leadership each of you has maybe read
one or more books on leadership and when
you finish the book you say well you
know that was a nice idea that was a
nice idea but does it affect the way you
see the world does it affect your
behavior does it really lead to you
being more successful maybe maybe not
it's kind of almost random outcomes to
two books on leadership or to learning
about leadership so with that
introduction you probably say to
yourself well you know what the hell is
he doing talking about leadership and
why don't we talk about something else
well the reason I am talking about
leadership
is because I think that out of the
research that Jim Collins and I did for
a book that's titled built to last we
uncovered what I think is a very very
fundamental difference in in the leaders
that built these incredibly enduring
great companies and that difference I
think is fundamental and it's not a
difference that's commonly perceived or
viewed or thought about by by most
people who are talking about management
managing or leading or actually doing
leading before I begin my more specific
comments let me ask you how many of you
have have actually read the book built
to last
anybody one person okay how many of you
have heard about the book and maybe skim
through bits of it yeah three people
there have any of you been in the same
room with the book well yeah you can all
raise your hand cuz I have a copy of it
up here so so now you can achieve that
very briefly what built to last was
about and this is really the source of
these ideas was a study that we did
trying to understand what made what we
were calling visionary companies
different from any other company and
when we started the study we didn't
really have a very clear definition of
what a visionary company was we had
these vague ideas and actually
discovered what a visionary company was
through the course of doing the study
but very briefly a visionary company is
a company that's that's had a
significant impact on the world it's
widely admired by its peers it has had a
long track record of being successful on
a variety of dimensions and it's done
this through
multiple generations of leaders multiple
generations of products and multiple
generations of industry cycles so using
other terms a company like this is is an
enduring ly great company and and the to
operational words are enduring which
means more than 10 years or 20 years you
know and in the life of you know someone
at Google 20 years is you know an
eternity but these companies that we
studied have been great for on average a
hundred years so these companies were on
average founded in 1897 the earliest was
founded in 1812 the youngest were
founded in 1945 and they are companies
that you heard of they're all big
successful companies today you know the
companies like IBM like like Merck like
EULA Packard a list of 18 is the ones we
wound up studying and what we wanted to
understand is what do these companies do
from the very beginning when they were
small and just starting out you know the
way Google was like six years ago what
did they do then what did they continue
doing as they grew to be sort of middle
sized companies you know 20,000 people
it's probably more than middle size and
what do they continue to do when they
got to be huge companies with employee
bases of a hundred thousand-plus and and
the world focus so we wanted to
understand what were the continuous
threads of the way they manage their
companies from the very beginning to the
present and in order to understand that
really well and understand it in a
significant way we came up with another
group of companies that were comparison
companies that had been in the same
industry they repaired comparisons the
same industry found in the same dates
roughly the same products still alive in
1990
when we were collecting the data so we
wanted to know you know it's like having
two horses running a race and these two
horses started the race a hundred years
ago and they run for a hundred years and
one horse just is spectacular and the
other horse is quite good but pretty far
behind what is a spectacular horse do to
run the race how do they run it
differently than this comparison horse
who by the way runs it much better than
the average horse so to give you an idea
of what that might mean in terms of
something more concrete like the stock
performance of these companies we looked
at the stock performance all the way
back from 1926 to to 1990 and I've
updated it to 2000 and if you invest $1
in three portfolios one's the market
ones the comparison companies and one's
the visionary companies you find that
the comparison companies outperform the
market by a factor of about four to one
the visionary companies outperform the
market by a factor of 16 to one so these
are really really high performing
companies in the traditional ways that
we look at performance but also their
high performing companies in a broader
way in terms of they've really had an
impact on the community they've had an
impact on the culture while Disney is
one of the companies we studied hey
that's had an impact on our culture
these companies really do have really
affected the world that they've operated
in so what do these companies do that
makes them so spectacular that these
other companies who are really the
silver medal winners if you will what
are the silver medal winners not do that
the gold medal winners did do and one of
the things that we found was that the
leadership looks different the
leadership of these companies look
different and specifically when I'm
talking about leadership the leaders we
studied in most depth
we're either the founders of the
companies or the leaders who are
responsible for transforming the
companies into the great companies that
they are today because they didn't all
start out as great companies 3m was a
real loser
3m went bankrupt actually in its first
five years and it wasn't until it was
about 20 years old they continued to
struggle along that it started getting
transformed into the 3m that we have
today so these companies didn't all
start out as winners and they were
transformed by specific leaders and and
what we wanted to understand is how did
those leaders behave that was different
from the way the leaders of the
comparison companies behaved and so I'm
summarizing those findings and I'm
weaving them in to what they might mean
for you since none of you I assume in
the rumor the CEO of this company some
of you may be managers many of you may
not be well let me get a fix on that how
many of you do have some sort of
managerial supervisory responsibility
raise your hand okay so the rest of your
kind of wannabes huh that's good it's a
time to listen to these sorts of things
all right so let me start out by asking
you a question which I think you can
sort of answer in your head what's a
great leader like you know think of your
own stereotypical view of a great leader
and what are the words that you would
use to describe this great leader so
think about that a minute and here are
words that often come up and some
research has shown that these are
typical words that are used to describe
what we consider quote great leaders
now there are many more words but this
is sort of a fairly representative base
of words that get used to describe great
leaders now you look at that list that's
pretty powerful stuff
and one of the most powerful dimensions
to that is the whole area of charisma
you've got to be charismatic to be a
great leader and I call these types of
leaders charismatic visionary leaders
and this is what we think of this is
this is our view of what a great leader
is all about and if you're not this
you're not a great leader if you don't
have these characteristics you probably
can't be a great leader well I don't
know about you but you know when I get
up in the morning and I'm brushing my
teeth I'm looking in the mirror I don't
see a charismatic visionary leader
looking back at me now maybe some of you
do I'd ask you to stand up but I'm
afraid you would what do we see well we
might see some of these things are a
little bit of these things but we tend
not to see these things the typical
person tends not to see these things but
these are the types of leaders that we
admire and respect and aspire to be this
type of a person
well these types of people are the types
of people that built some of the
companies we studied they were like this
and they built great organizations they
built great companies what makes it
interesting when you look at a long time
frame and is hundred plus year history
we found that these types of leaders
built great organizations that were
great while they were there
and then the question is what happens
when they're gone well the reality was
that these companies didn't die they
continued and survived just as long as
the visionary companies that we were
comparing them to they didn't die but in
the long term hundred year history of
these comparison companies we found that
they were never as great as when that
great leader was there and they never
had a second great leader so it's like
one per customer you know you get a
great leader maybe it's a founder maybe
it's an early transformational leader
and once that person is gone you're
probably not going to get another one
like him and they're all hymns they were
all hymns in the companies we studied so
you can create greatness you can create
a great organization and it's great
while you're there and after you're gone
it isn't as great now many people don't
care they say hey that's not my problem
you know while I was there I was doing
my job I was doing a great job I was
creating a great organization after it's
gone that somebody else's problem and if
they can't cut it that's their fault I
did my duty and I'm going on to in with
my life someplace else that's the type
of leader that we tended to see in the
comparison companies in the companies
that we said are these silver medal
winners well here's another view of
leaders
now this isn't as common of you but I
suspect when you start looking at this
list you find more words that you can
hook into and that you can say hey I'm a
lot like that I've got some of that I
think this relates more to the normal
person to you and me these are what
we're calling by the way because these
were the characteristics of the leaders
that either founded or transformed the
built to last companies the visionary
companies so we're calling these leaders
built to last leaders these leaders
created the companies that were enduring
ly great and interestingly enough they
also built great organizations and these
great organizations endured long after
they were gone big difference big
difference let me give you one really
concrete example
motorola which has kind of been in
trouble in the last few years but when
you look at their long track record
they've been an incredibly successful
company and Zenith which for many many
years was really a prominent television
manufacturing company and then got
bought out by by LG in in Korea and as
the zenith name is kind of if you go to
second-rate motels you see Zenith TV
sets today so I see them frequently but
by and large they're not as prominent as
they were ten years ago 15 years ago
Motorola and Zenith were founded in
roughly the same time period in the
1920s Zenith was founded by a guy named
Eugene MacDonald Eugene MacDonald had
been a commander in the United States
Navy during the First World War he was a
larger-than-life guy very strong
personality made everybody in the
company call him commander built an
incredible company he was a brilliant
product idea person he was a brilliant
marketer he was a brilliant advertiser
and Zenith was really a very substantial
company from its founding date until
until the late 1950s early 60s Motorola
in contrast was founded by a guy named
Paul Galvin who was not a
larger-than-life type of guy he was
described by a lot of the words that we
saw here just a minute ago and he
founded Motorola he had founded two
other companies had gone broke so he had
didn't have this great track record he
set about creating a company that that
turned out to be Motorola they're both
in the same roughly the same industry
Zenith at that time was building radios
for home and Motorola was building
radios for cars so they were pretty
evenly matched companies they were sort
of running together Zenith was ahead in
the race they are there radios in
when the weather products they were more
successful and then television gets
invented and they transform it into TV
sets and they're both building TV sets
and Zenith widens the gap over Motorola
their TV sets are much more popular and
then in the late 1950s it happened to
both of these leaders and what is it
what do you think it is they died they
died they both died in office not in
their office okay but in office they
died in office within 18 months of each
other well those of us who do social
science research love to see things like
that happen I mean that's a natural
experiment we can't go in there and
shoot the guys and say okay that's our
experimental treatment let's see what
happens now to the companies but this
was a natural experiment and then if you
track Zenith and you track Motorola
after the the great leaders founders
died you see a tremendous difference
Zenith kept making TVs that kept making
TVs they tried to make some computers
but they just fizzled in that they made
set-top boxes to try to convert signals
from from cables for their TVs and they
essentially stayed in the TV business
after their leader was gone
what did Motorola do well I mean this
they just all sorts of things from
transistors into also mobile devices
telephones they tried this Iridium
project which is network of satellites
it happened to fail but it was an
incredible project that they tried they
kept constantly changing growing and
evolving
whereas Zenith kind of stayed stuck so
what was the difference what was the
difference the difference is
that it's not style that made the
difference because although we found
that these words described people
differently from the visionary
charismatic visionary leader to the
built to last leader there were quite
different words we found leaders in the
built to last group who also were
Parra's Matic Sam Walton was charismatic
when he founded and built Walmart he was
a charismatic guy so we found people
like that so we concluded it look it's
not style it's not what your style is
and a lot of literature and leadership
talks about improving your style got to
create this style or that style we
concluded that it isn't style that's
really the key difference the key
difference is what does the leader pay
attention to what do you pay attention
to the charismatic visionary leaders
paid attention to leading their
companies they built a company that
revolved around them their brilliance
their abilities their technical
knowledge their fantastic ideas their
creativity unless I'm proven wrong and
we'll know in maybe a few years this is
Apple Steve Jobs built Apple around his
brilliance and their by the way we have
a natural experiment in that when Steve
Jobs was building Apple blah blah blah
was going great
he got replaced kicked out he leaves
Apple goes like that he comes back Apple
goes like that that's a natural
experiment pull him out what happens the
company put him back in what happens the
company so you know it looks pretty much
like Apple is Steve Jobs maybe not we'll
find out but that is an example of
creating a company that you lead that
depends on you to be great and that's
what we saw in the leaders of the
comparison companies in contrast what we
saw in the leaders of the visionary
companies
was that these leaders focused on
building the great organization and when
I say building I mean building across
all dimensions building the people
building the systems building the
culture building the structures building
the technology that you focus on
building into the company all the things
the company needs to be great that you
don't sort of focus on yourself all of
those abilities and you provide all of
that knowledge and all of that focus for
the company and it's great while you're
there so the built to last leaders
focused on building great companies
rather than leading them a real concrete
example that happened with Westinghouse
and General Electric in the early
founding dates of both these companies
Westinghouse who founded George
Westinghouse who founded the
Westinghouse corporation was a brilliant
engineer an inventor and he invented
numerous products had lots of patents to
his name and when you put together
Westinghouse he founded it on his
inventions the early products were
outcomes of his inventions and that's
how he built Westinghouse and made it
very successful in the early years in
contrast Charles coffin who's the key
founder in General Electric was not an
inventor he wasn't even an engineer but
he knew he had to have great products
how do you compete in this market place
especially against Westinghouse without
great products what he did is he created
the very first industrial research
laboratory in the company he built the
company's capabilities to do all of the
research and all the invention necessary
to compete with a George Westinghouse
and Westinghouse corporation he built
the company what happens to Westinghouse
when Westinghouse leaves what happens to
GE when charles kaufmann leaves geez got
this structure got this body inside the
organization that will continue to make
it great
so focusing on building a company and if
you're managing a small unit focusing on
building the capabilities of that small
unit is what leadership is all about if
you're if you're a team leader in a
project to produce some sort of software
you know you may not be a permanent
supervisor but you're the team leader in
that in that group focus on building the
capabilities into that group to do all
the things necessary to make it
successful rather than having them that
group rely on you and your brilliance
you know you're brilliant programmer
brilliant systems designer whatever
don't I'm not saying don't use that but
don't have that dominate or use it in
such a way that it develops the
capabilities of the others to do the
same thing okay so you say well this
sounds okay this sounds fine but hey how
do I become a built to last leader how
do I become one of these leaders that's
a fundamental question well I wish I had
the magic potion if so I would be a lot
richer than I already am but I've got
some ideas I got some ideas I'd like to
share with you and the first idea
revolves around clarifying who you are
and what you want okay we all kind of go
through life and we have a lot of needs
and so yeah I want to Porsche I want to
I want to be able to vacation in France
I want you know this I want that but
those aren't the fundamental things that
you want if you really sit and reflect
and and ponder on on what it is that you
want and how that relates to who you are
you begin to get a first step built in
becoming a great leader and so
clarifying who you are what you want I
think can be done in a lot of different
ways but let me suggest one way and and
the way that I would suggest you do it
is by creating what I call a personal
vision
now we studied organizations and we
studied what organizations did in this
regard and it turns out that these ideas
translate very nicely to individuals and
although I haven't done research on
individuals in this arena I get a lot of
reports of people who have come to me
and said yeah I'm using those ideas for
me personally and in fact one of my
colleagues at the Business School has
actually developed a whole series of
exercises that that are part of a
workshop that he puts on but if you're
interested in those exercises I'll refer
you to them later but look here you are
you're in a company and companies are in
turbulent environments and individuals
are in turbulent environments things are
changing around you all the time it
forces coming at you from different
directions and I liken this to a little
sailboat out in the ocean and by the way
as an aside I started out life as an
electrical engineer and one of the
things that I became very accustomed to
was the idea that if you can't draw
something out you don't understand it so
you know I always want to draw out what
it is that I'm trying to conceptualize
well that's good and well but it turns
out that my ability to draw sort of
stopped growing in the second grade so I
have very sort of primitive ways of
drawing and you'll see them in these in
these slides here but let's assume that
you are a little sailboat out in the
ocean this is you but also a part of you
is that you're the captain of your own
ship
this is you the captain of your own ship
here's your captain's hat okay and
you're out in this turbulent environment
and there are the waves or bashing you
in one direction and the wind is blowing
in another direction and the rains
coming down and beating you another
direction and most importantly are
you really gotta watch out for so how
the heck do you maneuver yourself around
in this world in this environment you
know how do you make sense of it how do
you create a successful life a
successful career well this is where
these ideas about a personal vision can
be helpful to you okay
this is you let's not forget your
captain's hat okay this is you and I
don't sail I was born in El Paso Texas
and all we had with sand dunes so I'm
speculating here okay but you're out and
in it's ocean that's buffeting you
around and how do you get someplace this
is before GPS and all those fancy
electronic stuff but how did you get any
place in those primitive days well very
often you had a star that was out in the
distance that guided you and from the
purpose of our metaphor this star
represents your purpose your purpose
what is the reason that you're here what
is the sort of the fundamental
contribution that you would like to make
to the world what will the world lose if
you're not around making this
contribution why do you exist now for
organizations we asked that question but
we can also ask at an individual level
and you can get very philosophical and
all that you can kind of blue-sky it but
if you get concrete about it and ask
yourself you know what's the
contribution that I'd like to make to
this world that I'm in I think you know
in in the sort of privacy of your own
mind you will come up with something
that's meaningful to you that's
important to you that you feel
passionate about that you feel is really
a significant contribution that you'd
like to make and it doesn't have to be
huge you don't have to change the whole
world but most of us would like to do
something that we think is important
that's purpose that's the star out in
the distance that's what guide you
forever until you die
now for those of you who sail you know
that you can't sail in a straight line
so you have to do other things you have
to tack back and forth and so one way to
sort of think about how do I limit my
tacking is it the second thing that you
need to establish for yourself is what
are your core values now core values are
a small number of values that you hold
really dear that you will not violate
for anything
unless you make a misfit unless you make
a mistake companies have core values
people have core values so you're
willing to lose money you're willing to
lose a relationship you're willing to
lose an opportunity you're willing to
lose all sorts of things rather than
violate those values so needless to say
there's a small number most of us don't
have a long list of 30 core values in
companies we found 5 on average not more
than 7 not less than 3 to give you an
idea of a company so for yourself
there's some small number of core values
that are principles that are ideas that
you hold in violet and that guide your
behavior you know so if you believe in
you know in respecting people and guides
your behavior you respect people and you
will not disrespect people you will not
treat people badly even though it may
advance you in some way
so core values sort of provide a
boundary for the third part which are
these tax and the ends of these tack
points or what we call these big hairy
audacious goals big hairy audacious
goals or goals that really stretch you
that are not something you accomplish in
a year or two or three maybe it takes
five years maybe
takes ten years but their goals that
challenge you their goals that force you
to change in order to achieve them
that's a key thing they force you to
change in order to achieve those goals
they force you to learn new things they
force you to learn how to behave in new
ways develop new skills new knowledge
new experience so they're not easy goals
they're not something that you can
achieve easily they're they're typically
not something that you see the pathway
to achieving them right away that you
can't say to yourself oh if I'm going to
achieve this goal I'll just do step one
step two steps 3 to 4 and I'll be there
that's too easy ago the types of goals
that we're talking about or goals that
really challenge you and you don't know
exactly how you're going to get there
but you have confidence that you'll
figure out a way to get there those are
the goals that really promote change and
growth in you as an individual and
that's part of you figuring out who you
are now if the core values do is if they
limit those goals the core values say I
will not try to achieve a goal if it's
going to force me to behave in ways that
violate that goal that value so in order
for me to achieve that goal I'm going to
start cheating and I have a value of
integrity that goal is not a good goal
for me
so by setting these goals to be
challenging but still within this
envelope of the core values they keep
you guided toward doing things that
really serve the purpose that you've got
for yourself
these are all very key dimensions in
understanding yourself and they don't
they don't drive you to to do a lot of
other types of analyses I mean they're
pretty pretty sort of straightforward
and simple in nature but they're hard to
achieve because you have to face
yourself you have to confront yourself
you have to do it in such a way that you
know that you're not kidding yourself
with with what you come out with so
that's step one step two as a leader
then is for you to build an organization
that's consistent with who you are and
what you want so if you're starting a
brand new organization or you're in an
existing one and you want to build it it
needs to be consistent with who you are
and what you want if you build an
organization is very different it's
certainly not going to make it easy for
you and probably won't be possible
because you just can't be in this
constant internal conflict so build an
organization that's consistent with who
you are it's consistent with your values
it build an organization that has a
purpose that fits your purpose that
somehow is a is on the path toward your
purpose so when you ask what might be
some of the characteristics of this
organization and this will be my last
comment is you have to build an
organization that first of all has a
core ideology and the core ideology fits
with what we're calling a passion for
change now the reason we use the
yin-yang symbol is because it represents
duality things that are seemingly
opposite but fit together and the
duality that's represented here is that
the core ideology is fixed it never
changes your purpose never changes your
core values never change at the same
time the passion for change means you
drive to change everything else in order
for you to achieve the goals that you
set so organizations reflect that an
organization's reflect having a core
ideology and also having a passion for
change and the core ideology or the core
values and the purpose and the passion
for change is an organization that likes
to learn experiment take risks stretches
itself challenges itself but this is a
reflection once again of you having gone
an analysis and an understanding of who
you are and then you're trying to
translate those ideas into the type of
organization that you lead or in the
case of the you those of you who aren't
leaders today it's a type of
organization you want to get connected
to should fit who you are that your
chances are being successful in that
organization go way up if what the
organization is fits who you are
if it's over here and you're over there
you're probably not going to be
successful in that organization in that
company so often what happens when
people join companies is it they look at
the first of all they look at the pay
how much am I gonna get paid that's kind
of the first big question the second one
often is then what am I going to do but
they rarely ask is this organization
doing something that I think is
important I'm spending a lot of time in
this company giving it my blood sweat
and tears it ought to be in the service
of something I think this is important
and not just there for the pay or not
just there because I happen to have an
interesting job although those are both
important things I'm not trivializing
them what I'm saying
is that you will be a more successful
person in a company if the company also
fits who you are and in order for that
to be possible you need to know who you
are and then you need to ask questions
about the company you're with to figure
out if it's the type of company that
fits who you are so these ideas I've
taken them from an organizational level
from looking at the built to last
companies and and focus them on a person
and focus them specifically on thinking
about yourself as a leader but but these
ideas also and if you're ever interested
in reading built to last
it describes companies in a lot more
depth in detail about you know how do
they sustain their core values and their
purpose and
how do they continue to promote change
because they developed very interesting
intriguing ways of doing that over a
long time period and that's what makes
for during greatness in companies and I
would propose to you that these ideas
would also make for enduring greatness
and you as a person and you don't have
to be a larger-than-life charismatic
walk on water glow-in-the-dark visionary
leader you can just be you if you focus
on the right things ok thank you we'll
open up for questions the mind
apparently decision tape so what kind of
suggestions would you give if you find
yourself in a company that has all has
all of these things but you find
yourself within a branch of the company
that there's one person that's not doing
all these things that is on top of is a
suit a very large part of the company
that to some degree is but some degree
isn't yeah is holding on to too much of
a part of it and not letting it be that
yeah I don't know you know it's it's
it's a real challenge you know obviously
the person has done things that the
company thinks are good and positive and
that's why they've gotten promoted to
where they are so so there there are
some things that they're doing that are
that are good yeah yep so you know you
can try to battle the world and you know
and be Don Quixote and trying to battle
those windmills but if that person is
high enough above you that's not going
to do much so what I would suggest and
recommend is kind of a coping response
that that you try to cope with that
reality but what you do is you
you affect and influence the things that
you can affect an influence and and then
if your supervisor or manager that means
that you can affect the things below you
so I would focus my efforts in my energy
on those things below me and and trying
to implement what you think is the way
you'd want to operate and building that
organization and more than likely over
time that will certainly be recognized
and and lead to your success and the
more successful you are the larger an
entity you can influence yeah so you get
together with other people kind of see
the world the same way as you do and and
and you work together to build success
and you start to compensate for whatever
barriers this individual puts up in
front of you
and
you know that's exactly right and and
and remember that you want if you want
to focus on the things that you can
really influence and/or control and the
things that are out of your control you
just have to figure out a way to respond
to them so this person does something
that really is a blocking behavior then
you've got to figure out ways around it
or to compensate for it and and you know
that's a very important skill to develop
because the world will never be perfect
you'll always find individuals who you
know run counter to some of the ways you
think things ought to be done and and if
you spend all your time trying to battle
them you know you create a certain type
of reputation and you also frustrate the
living daylights out of yourself because
you never have the power you're always
down below so focus on the things you
can do something about put energy into
that and after a bit what I've seen
happen in organizations is that if
there's enough visibility about of
people having to do things to compensate
for negative stuff that the top person
is doing that gets discovered by a
higher level person
so
decisions are made there and
you know so some other decision
wait so if you're right so it's very
very interesting I learned a lot yeah
yeah yeah yeah it's a real challenge to
figure out ways to influence your boss
but there are ways to influence the boss
and and part of it is getting is getting
in the head of the boss and asking
yourself what is this person trying to
achieve what do they want what what
would they think makes them successful
and how can I help them get that within
the constraints of the way I think I
ought to behave and operate yeah yeah
yeah great okay
I wonder if you applied this or thought
about this in terms of countries you
know like Iraq Iran Afghanistan places
that are really struggling to get a
leadership in place and do something
versus the corruption yeah
well one of the one of the uncertainties
that comes to that has come to my mind
when we start talking about other
countries is is whether these ideas are
like very American and and and wouldn't
wouldn't really apply in other countries
with other cultures and that's a
question we haven't done the research in
other countries to know if these ideas
do apply if we talk about the US and you
think about the founding process of the
US and and things like the the
Constitution
you know we hold these truths to be
self-evident they're citing the core
values of the company you know and and
the purpose is never clearly illuminated
but if you look at the history of the
United States you can try to discern
some some broad purpose about you know
creating democracy not only in this
country but in the world and having
people have freedom to choose their
leaders and you know things around that
area
so our country was kind of founded on
that but yet yet the Constitution and
all allows for change it promotes and
stimulates change and the creation of
three bodies in our in our legislative
process you know that allows for balance
and for change to be driven when one
body is satisfied with how the way the
other two bodies are doing things so so
it in our country I think these ideas
have worked or have been applied or were
applied by the founders of this country
we go to Iraq Iran and we start thinking
about those countries I suspect that
that at a very basic level these ideas
still make sense but the way they get
translated into reality looks very
different and I don't understand that
translation clearly enough to be able to
speak about it but I'm speculating that
yeah Iran Iraq you know they have values
and they could illuminate those values
are they shared by the entire country or
their I start being puzzled you know if
you've got a lot of these clans that
have been plans for centuries and
centuries and you try to put them
together into a country do you have any
values that are shared across all those
clans I mean those would be questions
that would come up in my mind yes
so I'm hello I'm on the onset of my
career so the piece of advice I would
like to ask you is in addition maybe to
trying to find a butyl as leader that
broadly I identify with my values do you
have any other piece of advice for
trying to become the best follower
we're trying to be for trying to become
the best follower right or maybe a photo
earth but we realized okay well I think
some of it relates to what I said just a
minute ago about trying to figure out
and and I think the most effective way
to try to figure this out is in a
conversation with the leader and and the
conversation needs to revolve around you
know what does that leader need from you
what do they want from you how would
that what you do contribute to the
success of the of the organization that
you're in and to the leaders success
sharing what you think you need from the
leader in order to accomplish what you
want to accomplish what you're being
asked to accomplish sharing sharing your
personal ambitions with that leader so
the leader knows kind of where you're
coming from and trying to build a
relationship that says open in
communicating things like that as it's
possibly can be now some leaders will be
open to that you know they'll be
responsive they'll talk to you other
leaders won't so if they if they're not
then you kind of have to become a
detective and try to figure out you know
what is this leader need for me and and
I'll try to supply it now there's more
chance for mistakes there because you're
guessing but it's better to guess than
just to kind of go your own way or to
follow the letter of the law the letter
of what the person tells you because
very often I mean people communicate
things and they communicate with some
words and there's a lot of hidden
messages in the words that are used and
you got to find out and understand what
those hidden messages are so if you have
an open relationship with the leader you
can ask questions about that know is
this what you mean is this what you
intend is this what you'd like these are
the constraints I feel I have therefore
I need these resources or this support
building up that sort of a dialogue with
with your leader can make you a much
more effective follower
I really like this idea of defining who
you are and what you want and especially
of finding a team or you know
organization or collaborators who who
can allow you to be that you know
experiment and challenge yourself and do
you know risky things while still being
true to you know your principles but so
what interests me is how that can be
reconciled with the idea that those
charismatic leadership qualities that
you listed are often qualities that
people say that women are
underrepresented you know ethnic groups
or any group in an organization tend to
not do because they think oh I'm just
you know I have a lot to prove so I'm
going to be humble work in the corner do
my job I will talk to the people who
talk to me I'm not going to be silent
but I'm I'm not going to go you know
claw my way to the top and to take on a
personality that's not true to myself
because you feel alienated if you can't
you know if you exactly why you want to
create that organization you want to be
who you are feel like you're being true
to yourself and succeed that way so you
know I'm an engineer I'm a woman on my
latina I'm highly underrepresented and
I'm you know I'm still enjoying what I
do but I definitely struggle with trying
to take on those charismatic leadership
qualities because from all angles I'm
told you should be doing all this if you
really want to succeed yeah you know
that that's that's a real dilemma
clearly that and I think that the
reality the reality of it is that these
leaders that built these companies were
unknown pretty much outside of their
companies because they weren't always
Tooting their horns they weren't always
getting themselves involved in high
press situations they weren't always
being recognized etc they were just kind
of doing their work and building a great
company and creating success with their
efforts and the proof was the companies
that they built and how successful they
were well as a minority person either
either woman OH
or a person of color or both
there are added pressures on you to sort
of be more visible to it to be more out
there to to be to be more of this
charismatic visionary than any
charismatic visionary around because
that's supposedly what great leaders are
all about and I think it's a trap it's a
trap that I would urge you not to fall
into I would urge you to stay with who
you are and and and to resist the
pressures to be something that you're
not doesn't mean that that if you have
trouble speaking before big audiences
that you shouldn't work on that that's
part of your growth that's part of your
development that's part of you improving
yourself and your ability to build a
great organization so it doesn't mean
that you could you could just sort of
like say okay this is Who I am and I'm
not ever going to be different I don't
mean that there are things that you can
be different at doing but still maintain
your core so so you still have a lot of
places to grow but I but I suggest that
you don't try to grow in ways that
violate who you are and and there is a
lot of pressure in that there's a lot of
pressure to do things that might violate
who you are because they'll make you
more successful and that so it's it's a
tough it's a tough battle and it may and
it will lead to you being frustrated
because you think you're not being
recognized for the contributions you're
making and a part of it is because the
stereotypes of white males around you
put you in a box and and it's the only
way you break out of that box is
behaving more like the white male that
put you in the box and that's not who
you are so so things are changing okay
and and in ten years if you ask me this
question probably the answer would be
very different or you might not even ask
the question in ten years because things
would be different but they are the way
they are today and
and I think it still is important to say
okay I can grow in these areas I can
become more of this or that and still
that's consistent with who I am but I'm
not going to do things that are really
inconsistent with who I am so you got to
know who you are yes I have a question
on the research that you did for finding
these companies and the criteria for
success so you had some companies that
were founded by strong leaders who had a
product which was perfect for the time
and they kind of created a vision in a
company around that you also had
examples of companies that whose leaders
didn't have the product they weren't the
inventors but they came on board and
were able to transform the company in a
particular way
how what sense do you have as to how
whether some of those products were a
serendipitous did they always drive that
by being open to the ideas that were
around them by being open to the
economic or you know environment that
was around them can you kind of break
that up a little bit yes up there were
some exceptions to what I'm going to say
but by and large these companies
essentially started without a product
all of them most of them the vast
majority of them did they started
without a product but we spoke with Bill
Hewlett Hewlett Packard we said Bill you
know what you were you and Dave thinking
about when you started the company and
he said this is almost verbatim he said
look he said we were a couple of young
guys we'd recently graduated from
Stanford we thought we were pretty smart
which is by the way something that
flicks a lot of Stanford graduates we
wanted to get in business together and
we wanted to make a contribution what
kind of contribution do you want to make
bill we wanted to make technical
contributions
that's what we're about there first
products contrary to popular myth was
not the audio oscillator that they sold
to Disney the first products were a
bowling foul line indicator you know
your foot goes across the line and
little light lights up an automatic
urinal flushing
some sort of a jiggling machine for
weight reduction jiggle a body somehow
those are their first three products all
failures they didn't start the company
on a product they started the company
because they wanted to build a company
and then they search for products to
build that fulfill this technical
contribution basic purpose that they had
and 3m it started out with a product and
the product drove them into bankruptcy
they were mining this carborundum this
grit it was used for sand paper they
mined two tons of it couldn't sell it
and they essentially went bankrupt and
the Board of Directors kept putting
money into the company to keep it going
and little while little while was like
almost 20 years later they limped along
doing all sorts of goofy stuff then
along comes William McKnight and he
comes up with the idea of masking tape
and that launched 3m into the 3m we know
today so so the products are a
consequence of the company not the
company is a consequence of the product
in your second kind of companies that
you're the really successful companies
that you're talking about those are
those are the built to last companies in
the comparison companies they invariably
all started with the product Zenith had
this radio that they initially developed
it was who started out with it with it
with a product from the very beginning
and then the company was built around
that product
okay thank you okay thank you I say if
anybody wants to stick around for lunch
we'll be having lunch with Professor
after this Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
