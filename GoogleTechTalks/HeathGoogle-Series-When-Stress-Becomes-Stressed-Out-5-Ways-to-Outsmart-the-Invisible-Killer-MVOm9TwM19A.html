work here in marketing at Google and
delighted to welcome to the Googleplex a
good of mine dr. Nick one tongue one has
got a very versatile background she an
engineer by painting an engineering
mechanical and biomedical engineering
and stone conversations with her again
he can go head-to-head against any
googler engineer here as far as
engineering design is concerned but she
was a bit smarter than many engineers
old many of us here because she went on
to medical school too and practice as a
physician that Kaiser Permanente for
many years but during this time she
realized that rather than treat one
patient at a time for a particular
medical problem they have can be bots
martyred by teaching people about
self-care and prevent the problem in the
first place so she went on at a company
and she's the founder CEO of a cut of
intelligence and the focus of this
company is to teach corporate employees
self-care dr. sangwan is sought after
international speaker and media
spokesperson on the topic of employee
stress wellness and communication and in
particular expertise is on preventive
preventive health stress management and
clear direct communication today dr san
juan is going to focus on stress
something that many of us here are
familiar with something that is the
primary cause of ninety-five percent of
illnesses and in particular dr. Sangwan
makes the point that stresses the has
got up that often we get or used to it
we assume it as a part of our life and
don't even realize that on a continual
basis it is doing damage to our physical
emotional well-being so today dr san
juan is going to talk about how to nice
when and very quickly a actually prevent
it please help me welcome dr. sun
thank you thank you set me hold it away
all right we're going to see how I can
do this click and somehow I thought I
was going to have these note cards up
here so i didn't get stressed out and
we'll see how this works so let's begin
with a multiple choice question you're
on your way to work cruising down the
highway at 85 miles an hour and suddenly
you check engine light comes on do you a
pull over pop the hood and get to work
be treated exactly like fuel light
you've easily got another 50 miles or do
you see put on your shade so it doesn't
interfere with your texting our body has
a complex set of feedback loops it is a
well-designed it's actually better than
a well-designed automobile or computer
it relies on error messages to tell us
if something's wrong the science of the
body is extremely complex when in regard
to stress today we'll talk about a
combination of how your nervous system
hormonal system and immune system come
together around stress to help propel
you as dopey said even through the times
when stress just keeps accelerating more
importantly I would like to make this
extremely practical for you today you
will walk away with a framework and a
way to decode stress and with the
remaining time with questions I would
like to take live scenarios and help you
help show you how to decode that stress
and come out with a different outcome
you guys in
okay great here we go so if stress
sounds complex or seems complex that's
because it is Walter cannon and 1900
began laying the foundation for this but
the man credited with coining the term
stress is Hans am I is this okay it was
Han cell yay and in 1936 he decided that
what stress was going to be defined as
was an organism's nonspecific response
to stress he then spent the rest of his
career debating that is that this is it
that now what is he talking about he's
talking about the fact that bungee
jumping to one person could mean pure
thrill and to another it could mean what
terror so the same event causes
different responses in people so there
are as many error signals that come in
as there are people in this room or
around listening and they are unique
that signal is unique to you so today
I'd like you to start thinking about as
i start teaching you the science and
some tools i'll be asking you questions
like what is your signal what are your
coping strategies so i'd like you to
take a moment there to to just think and
reflect this will be an interactive
experience it will be experiential and
it will be scientific my biggest hope is
that it's practical and when you walk
out you can actually change something
you do this afternoon so as go be
mentioned it's true it's true I my
background is in engineering and I went
on to medical school and all of that all
that means is that i'm a good indian
child that's all that means so what did
i learn in that schooling well in
engineering school I learned about
fulcrums and loads and I learned about
the stress-strain relationship an
equation but really if I could summer
is it in 11 statement it would be that
when we're out of balance things don't
work I went on to medical school and
further my knowledge around the anatomy
and physiology of stress and the science
of the damage that stress can do on the
human body especially over time stress
causes or worsens ninety-five percent of
all illness everything from diabetes to
heart disease to stroke and even cancer
that's why we call it the invisible
killer and despite all my knowledge
knowing about stress from every angle
somehow I managed to override my own
signals and burn out and I did this
through a very well-crafted vending
machine equation to ice cold mountain
dews plus a king size snicker bar
Snickers bar equals neha's ability to
stay awake in a 36-hour shift in the
hospital and function many of you think
you have to be many of you think you
have to be online and available a
hundred percent of the time between
tweets text chats status updates and
don't forget that middle of the night
messaging from Heather Bob you may not
have signed up for a 36-hour shift
constantly but your body knows you have
so let's talk about how your body works
if I could simplify all my knowledge and
learning in anatomy and physiology would
come down to stress physiology 101 the
nervous system it's just like a car to
controls an accelerator and a break
let's begin with the accelerator when
you experience
getting cut off in traffic or more
realistically now when that dreaded name
mysteriously appears in your inbox you
experience something called the
fight-or-flight response that's when
your accelerator is in full gear and
that's called the sympathetic nervous
system the good news is you've also got
a brake the brake is called the rest and
digest system and this will become
important shortly this is known as the
parasympathetic system so understanding
this physiology so when your body's in
fight-or-flight mode adrenaline kicks in
and it serves to get you out of danger
yes this is pretty common yes no okay
sure okay so basically adrenaline kicks
in your heart rate shoots up your blood
pressure goes up your muscles might
tighten and you might get shallow
breathing write your check engine light
is on right so when you're out of
balance even though you love your job
you are not able to digest the food you
just ate even though the micro kitchen
is a hundred feet away what shuts down
is your brain function your digestion
your creativity and you may not have
written it on your Google guys survey
but I want you to know that you would be
the first person in history to have
these symptoms and not have it affect
your sex life the good news is anybody
here attend gopi's Monday night yoga
classes all right we got a few so
there's some yo blurs in the audience
when you relax yourself the opposite is
true
so there is recovery and good news so we
all know that stress in life at least in
our modern day life is inevitable so
let's talk a little bit about the
evolution and then we'll be moving into
the practical tools so how is our
nervous system actually originally
designed to support us well when we were
caveman here let's call him Fred in this
situation is he's running away there's
only one of two outcomes that's going to
happen here either he gets caught and
Fred gets eaten for lunch or Fred gets
away so I believe in the underdogs so
let's assume he gets away if he does
right now his fight or flight system is
in full gear but what used to happen is
a few minutes later he'd be in rest and
digest and so his system was allowed to
rebalance his parasympathetic system
kicked in and his stress began to
dissipate so all the hormones and the
bio chemicals that get released in that
fight or flight system they immediately
dissipate so for all you engineers out
there we have the engineers oh yeah we
do good because I tried to put things
back in equations now I still don't
think that I could out design you but
thank you go pee this is uh what it
looks like so a saber-toothed tiger
right caveman days plus its commitment
to living plus him running like crazy
equals short term stress now let's
translate it to today modern-day stress
looks very similarly to our
saber-toothed tiger is traffic coming in
that's physical traffic it can also be
virtual traffic that now piles up as you
sleep there are many other stressors
that we can include here there's
physical stressors in the world like
earthquakes and tsunamis there's
physiological stressors in our lives
like when we don't get enough sleep or
we haven't fed ourselves well or we
decided to stop
exercising until we got through that one
project all of those are our
saber-toothed Tigers so we don't really
have a problem committing to staying
alive our problem is over committing and
I don't know about you but I'm not
really worried about running away from
anything I'm pretty worried about how
much I run around and that is how we get
stuck in the loop of long-term stress so
what we've basically done is very
successfully or unsuccessfully turned a
biological response that was designed to
save our life into a way of living so
there's some negative medical side
effects as you might imagine people have
studied this extensively just take a
look at a few of these we've even
learned that brain cells in the
hippocampus die when under stress for a
prolonged period of time your memory
declines cognitive function and your
ability to think creatively declines
your decision-making becomes you know my
decision is not which way do I get out
of here I go down to basic function if
there's a fire over there I just start
running I don't really consider all my
options and think about things i
actually just flee your immune function
as well after you've been under stress
for a while you'll tend to get more
colds and viruses and flus we know that
also really important is that your blood
sugar increases and when you have short
term stress your body kicks out
something called adrenaline it's
short-lived and it dissipates in your
body quickly if adrenaline continues
over time it turns into another hormone
that is much more long-acting called
cortisol cortisol takes up to 48 hours
to break
down in your system so after you've been
going on that really busy project and
you finished if you took some time off
you probably won't feel like you're on
vacation for at least two days you ever
noticed that like oh now I've arrived at
vacation right your cortisol finally
starts to clear out of your system now
very important thing about cortisol that
I learned is that cortisol in your body
your body senses danger and when you go
into long-term danger it deposits fat
right around your midsection
specifically it doesn't know if you're
moving into famine and it deposits
reserves right here so for many people
that come in and ask me how do I lose
those last five or 10 pounds after I go
through what they're eating the next
thing I say is take me through a day in
the life of you and it becomes very
clear to me why those last five or ten
pounds aren't coming off so here we are
the stress decoder it's a practical and
powerful and simple tool that will help
you decode stress in your life it's a
framework it's a way of looking at the
various and sometimes vague and complex
experience of stress and simplifying it
down so you can see where stress is
coming in and how to break it down like
i said i am happy at the end if anyone
is willing to bring up a live scenario
and run this through the stress decoder
so if something comes up for you as
we're doing this I want you to keep it
in mind and asked me shortly so the
framework five things it begins with the
body the mind your feelings your desires
and your actions and the way it's set up
is very clear that these are all
connected they're interconnected so you
have to connect the dots to end up with
the end result that you're hoping for
so external signals let's talk about the
body how do you get collect data points
externally you collect them through what
your senses right so it's what you see
hear smell taste and touch
every time I look through these I start
salivating I'm like oh yeah it works it
works so those are your external data
points that you're collecting now where
it gets a little more complex is there's
also internal data points and you might
recognize some of those their physical
sensations your heart racing your
stomach turning your muscles tightening
all of these are your internal data
that's controlled by your unconscious
mind in relation to the external world
sometimes the internal world as well but
for this example let's say as it's
related to the external world so how you
choose to connect these internal data
points with the external ones often has
you making up a story in your head and
we'll get to that in a moment so one of
the simplest things that I've taught to
the physicians and nurses I couldn't
believe we all went through anatomy and
physiology together and no one really
ever put this together so it's going to
sound simple in the beginning but I
really want you to listen just for a
moment when you feel these uncomfortable
sensations the first thing that people
tend to do is try to figure out a way to
get out of them so they're running from
their heart racing or their stomach
turning there's a lot of drugs that can
help you take care of this okay and the
simplicity of somebody saying to you
take a deep breath it's then a little
annoying take a deep breath like leave
me alone right well let me tell you why
it works so it works because the
physiology behind it is that your lungs
and this is very approximate take up
approximately this much of your chest
cavity okay where does the best oxygen
exchange occur we're at the basis of
your lungs but I'm walking around saying
hey can you grab me a glass of water
thanks so much hey I'll see you at three
I'll meet you you know over over in the
meeting room in five minutes I'm using
approximately this much of my lung
capacity and it's
only when I get frustrated that I take a
huge sigh and ever use my full capacity
those of you that exercise very
regularly you part of why you feel so
good is you're using all of your lung
capacity your oxygenating your body very
well so how can we use this in everyday
life in a meeting right after someone
says something or does something that
really annoys you well you have
something I'm going to know I can't set
this down right because everybody has to
hear it okay so you have a diaphragm
which is an umbrella shaped Oregon yeah
where you hold it for one second so you
have a diaphragm which is an umbrella
shaped thin sheet of muscle it's below
your lungs and above your belly when you
take a very deep breath I mean like a
deep belly breath and soften your belly
your diaphragm has to contract and when
it does it stimulates the largest nerve
of your parasympathetic or relaxation
response called the vagus nerve when it
does this thank you it slows down your
heart rate it brings down your breathing
and you have a sense of feeling calm
again from that place you can start to
make more clear decisions so when
someone says take a deep breath I'm not
sure they understood what they were
saying but that's what they're saying so
you have all the equipment in you and I
know that a lot of you are thinking on
if you can't tell me to do something
that's going to take any more time in
the day because I don't have any well
guess what you already have to breathe
I'm not giving you something else to do
I'm telling you to pay attention to what
you're already doing so here comes in
that stressor whatever it is you now are
going to soften your belly we're going
to try this together because you're
going to need it a little bit later on
that's I'm going to have you do this the
reason I would actually go through it
with you is I cannot tell you how many
consultations I've done in the emergency
department okay anyone in the emergency
department thinks they're going to die
true
everybody right so their level of panic
is enormous for stress when I come in
this is what they're doing doc I mean
I've been breathing heavy and when they
breathe in they don't soften and let in
the air they suck in their stomach and
then when they breathe out they do this
and that heightens your anxiety level so
it's very important that what you do is
everybody put your hand on your belly
and i'm going to show you when you
inhale I need your ladies in the room we
are not taught culturally to let our
stomachs be loose we're taught to suck
it all in so this time I just want you
to relax let your shoulders let gravity
work on your shoulders and as you
breathe in slowly and deeply I'd like
you to feel your abdomen expanding with
air that's how deep you're going to
breathe so take a nice deep breath in
and as you exhale move your belly button
back towards your spine and two more
times deep breath in and out belly
button towards your spine and deep
breath in one more time and out your
vagus nerve starts working just in that
moment in that much time can you do it
in a meeting is anybody going to know
not really you're the only one that
needs to know and all of a sudden you'll
start setting yourself up to have more
clear thinking and make clear decisions
so what I want you to know is the body
is how we get external and internal data
the pause button so DVD players have a
pause button so do you many people don't
know how to use them or what to do with
them you just learned one skill that you
can use in real time so what I said was
that your external signals and data as
well as your internal signals get
connected to create a story
this is very important what movie do you
create in your mind who would have
guessed that we're all creative writers
right is it a horror film that you
typically create is it a drama is it a
thriller or is it just a documentary
whatever it is you tend people tend to
create similar stories right like the
catastrophe story I knew I wasn't going
to get that promotion there's no way it
was going to work right however you
create connect those dots determines
what type of story you create in your
head the problem is we don't know if
that story was made into a book whether
it belongs in the fiction or nonfiction
section we don't know that yet until we
connect the rest of the dots so
depending on how you connected the
internal and external data and what
movie you made up and chose to believe
determines your emotion okay well
emotions are not really well understood
and not only are they not well
understood I mean do I really have to
deal with those things at work don't
those get to stay at home how many times
have you heard someone say at work
listen I don't have to like Joe I just
have to work with them well there's
there's many there's many much research
actually being done on positive emotions
many books have recently been published
unhappiness and you know the work at
happiness at work and gratitude in the
power of gratitude and feeling grateful
in your life so now let's take a look at
feelings and why are they so complex
what emotions do you typically
experience when you feel stressed the
most important emotion that you can feel
is to be curious but before we get there
I want you to know why there's benefits
to doing this here's just a few of them
so emotions they're simple because what
because even when they feel complex they
can be described in one word jealousy is
a pretty complex emotion it can be
described in one word anger sadness
disappointment now what makes things
complex especially emotions is that
they're often tied to that dreaded
physical sensation in your body and also
to an experience of something you might
have experienced before or are afraid of
so the most important thing I can have
you remember here is that curiosity can
get you untangled right once you have
this difficult experience inside your
body it then leads you to a short-term
desire which would be to get out of
feeling that way that would be your
short-term desire that leads you to
coping mechanisms let's talk about a few
coping mechanisms if you're
uncomfortable your heart is racing and
your stomach's turning you might head
straight over to that micro kitchen and
make yourself up a double latte true you
might head over to the nap pod and hope
that some shut-eye will make all of it
go away you might go out with your
friends and have a glass of wine or
three you might talk about the stressor
to others these are all short-term
coping mechanisms that we use to get out
of the discomfort of experiencing the
physical sensations of our feelings
the problem is is that their short-term
I want you to take a moment and I want
you to think about a few things right
now the first one is what is your
physical sensation that you experience
and what coping mechanism do you
predominantly use because some of us use
multiple coping mechanisms and most
importantly how long does it last
because if you can actually pause and
breathe you may actually realize that oh
hold on a minute when you have been
exposed to stress over a prolonged
period of time you actually develop
multiple coping strategies that can numb
out your ability to recognize that
you're heading straight for danger let's
move into the long-term actions uh
desires so what are your long-term
desires what those are usually much more
meaningful things than getting away from
the uncomfortable feelings in my body
they're usually things like I'd like to
learn how to influence others you know I
really think it would be great if I
created some work life balance you know
I'd really like to show up in that
conflict confident and curious so your
goals change from just getting out of
that difficult physical sensation into
much more meaningful things to you that
are going to create outcomes and the
life that you hope to have so now we
move on to the final piece which is our
final step in the stress decoder which
is how you take action if your action is
solely to avoid the physical feeling you
will do those coping strategies we
discussed and if it is to solve or solve
a problem you will actually create new
behaviors and that's what we're going to
talk about so let me take a simple
example and let's run the stress decoder
through a simple example and see how the
outcome might change before I move on is
that
that sound good everybody everybody's
with me okay lots of nodding so we're
going to connect the dots in a different
way the first time I'm going to run it
through I'm going to run it through with
the short-term desire to get out of the
feeling you're in the second time I run
it through I'll run it through with the
goal of the long-term desire and show
you how things will change so you're an
anticipation of a four o'clock interview
screening for a promotion it's the final
it's the final interview you're walking
down the hall at 10am this is at 4pm
you're walking down the hall at 10am and
your boss you see your boss walking
straight towards you and your boss is
the interviewer you get the guts up to
say hey see it for your boss looks up at
you and continues walking while she's
texting or he's texting Oh what just
happened in your body your heart might
start racing your throat might getting
get tight and you might feel a sensation
of your stomach dropping so what's the
story you would make up in your head
connecting those external dots and
internal dots the external dots are
pretty simple they are I saw my boss
walking towards me I heard myself say
see you at four I saw him say nothing
and text those are the data points the
internal data points were all those
sensations I just described now what's
story about you make up oh he never said
anything about my presentation to
leadership last week I knew he didn't
like it I don't think I'm gonna get this
this promotion what a waste of my time
then you move into a feeling which might
be defensive angry or hurt possibly and
so you head straight to your computer
and your status update says bad day
period anybody up for a drink at seven
you proceed back over to the micro
kitchen where you see three of your
buddies for business school and you
proceeded to tell them what how rude
your boss was this morning and you
cannot believe this is not a fair
process while you cook up another double
latte actions are that you show up at
the 4 o'clock interview wired on
caffeine and sugar with clothes body
language bracing answering with very
abrupt answers bracing yourself for the
worst yeah let's run that same scenario
through the stress decoder same scenario
with your boss walking by you you say
see you at four your boss doesn't say
anything and continues texting the
external data points are exactly the
same the internal data points can
exactly be the same how you make sense
of them and what type of story you run
in your head is what changes so at first
you recognize that your stomach just
dropped and your heart started racing so
you take three deep breaths and as you
do that your typical nightmare film
begins I knew he didn't come so let me
let me finish up I wanted to take you
through a little guided imagery do you
guys know what guided imagery is to help
you I see yes it's basically a doorway
to the unconscious mind and then I'm
going to close it is a way in which you
access the right side of your brain
which is more visually oriented
shift your mood state and your
physiology in your body the way I know
that all of you can do this is if anyone
has daydreamed before you can do it you
can do guided imagery okay and the other
other way that you can understand this
really easily is if you've had a
nightmare before and woke up and realize
that no one was chasing you but you were
sweating and the sheets were wet and
your heart was racing you can see how
powerful just your mind can be in
changing your physiology even when the
threat is not real it's imagined does
that make sense so I want to close and
just have you go through a guided
imagery so put your both feet on the
floor and you're going to use that
breathing that I talk to you about a
little earlier and I'd like you to take
a soften your belly allow gravity to
pull your shoulders back down towards
the Earth and I you can keep your eyes
open or closed people close their eyes
just to get rid of visual stimuli but
you do whatever is comfortable for you
take a nice deep breath in and out and I
want you to begin by starting at the top
of your head and just noticing your
forehead and your eyes around your eyes
noticing if there's any messages that
your body is giving you with your next
breath in moving down into your jaw and
cheekbones and paying close attention to
the base of your tongue allowing it to
relax
and with your next deep breath in gently
moving into your neck and your shoulders
a place we often carry the weight of the
world just noticing if they feel relaxed
or tight if one feels different than the
other with your next deep breath in I'd
like you to move down your arms and your
elbows and forearms all the way into
your hands and fingers and gently moving
back up into your chest cavity paying
attention to your ribcage and how it
and then I was the experience the
compassion did you give your friends
you're calling your family in the world
with your next deep breath in jetting we
mount into your abdomen and pelvis
against the chair how we work supported
jasny move into your thigh gap
just noticing there's any messages your
body wants to get it giving it our
oxygen and attention with your next deep
breath in moving down here he'll be the
balls of your feet they're told home and
just notice in here what you defrost and
a little bit of focus of attention and
do for your body with your next key
process of looking slowly Thank You
chest face and sell back around as you
do and achieve all that compassion you
came out and I'd like you for a moment
showering
if you nice deep breath in and out begin
to wiggle your finger to close in
allowing yourself to gently come back
this room and I want to come home at 85
miles an hour try slowing down when you
