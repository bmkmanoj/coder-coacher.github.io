and Angley from from right here at
Google Oh take it away it is the clicker
that's it sweet
oops okay
cool this is apparently multi-device
testing so I'll try and talk about that
I guess this is only and I'm Alex in the
interest of time I will try to pronounce
my last name and we're going to be
talking about multi-device testing and
end-to-end tests especially for the
mobile environment the way we do it at
Google and this is to us this is an
important topic because there's a lot of
end-to-end test cases that have to do
with mobile devices the mobile devices
need to talk to other devices they have
Bluetooth connectivity of NFC
connectivity they have other than server
jobs that are running they have other
hardware you might want to interact with
and we've developed a framework that
kind of covers all these use cases which
I'll get into the moment so basically
what we're going to talk about is what
are we doing why are we doing it have
you considered not doing it and the most
important is can I do it too and just
skip ahead the answer is yes you can do
it too because the framework is open
source so on harp on this this is the
food pyramid of testing that you've seen
like 46 times by now and end-to-end
tests of course is the meat and sweets
area that you should use sparingly and
unit tests are the bread and the veggies
and stuff so what harp on this because
I'll sound like the FDA but our
framework is focused on the end-to-end
test part and there is a good reason for
that a unit tests are very important you
have to have a lot of them they're your
primary testing type but especially for
mobile devices and Torin testing is very
important because like I mentioned and
to our mobile devices interact very much
with things around them and the
environment they might want to send data
to other devices appear to peer they
might want to discover what's around
them they want to discover a Bluetooth
beacon or another device they might want
to talk to a device in the Internet of
Things I don't want to talk to a light
bulb or a fridge or a VR handset or a
watch you might need to care about what
your network is it might be cellular it
might be Wi-Fi it might be a low quality
signal it might be 2g and your app might
behave differently in those conditions
it might behave differently under bright
lights or under low battery conditions
or on a low spec device versus a
high-spec device
and depending on the performance of your
network and of course you also probably
interact with some sort of cloud
back-end service you receive data from a
to send data to it so you can't test a
mobile app in isolation just by itself
and have a good picture of how this app
will work for users but thing is that
that's what we do right so most
frameworks that exist for mobile testing
are very much single device based they
are you creating an instrumentation or a
unit of some kind sometimes even not
even a mobile J unit use robolectric
which is fantastic for testing single
units and is very important for making
sure that your algorithms work and for
for mocking your dependencies and things
like that but ultimately it doesn't
answer the question that is the whole
app work and if you don't use
robolectric you can create a junior that
runs on device or using a stress 0 or UI
Automator or something like that and run
your tests but you're restricted to just
the device that you're on and we've seen
presentations about labs that allocates
you a single device and and your entire
environment is restricted to that device
so using multiple devices is stuck
number one for end-to-end tests for
mobile devices other issues are you need
to trigger complex actions on multiple
devices you might want it to start
connecting or sending a message or
connect a bluetooth or switch the
orientation or start scanning or
something like that you might or you
might want to trigger your own SDK or
make a call in software that you wrote
like arbitrarily complex things that
nobody can prepare for you if you have
multiple devices you need to synchronize
them so you have one device that sends a
message to another device you wait for
it to be received or place a call
decline the call make sure voice message
appears for example you might need to
drive a wide range of equipment in your
test so you need to somehow handle the
drivers for that the way to synchronize
with that how to talk to the hardware
making sure it's hooked up to the device
making sure its allocated together with
the device making sure that you know if
you have an attenuator here and a phone
here you don't think those are somehow
related in any way you have to group the
devices together and of course you need
to communicate with cloud services like
I mentioned and when you're done you
need to collect the debugging artifacts
and logs from all those different places
to get a consistent picture of
your test actually looks like so we've
tried very hard to address some or all
these issues and to do that we've
created a framework that we call Mobley
it's open source and you can use it to
and to tell you more details about that
I present you only thanks Alex oh it's
weird to hear yourself hey long I work
on Android OS so oh it's like Slade out
we have a mountains problems and we need
to address we chose a shower with
credits framework and we we should spice
on because it's very descriptive and
most most of it developers probably
don't want think about all the crazy lot
of the crazy language stuff we write has
you just want it to work and you prefer
writing English but amperage we couldn't
it today so our test logic runs on the
host machine on this because when you're
coordinating multiple devices and many
different types of complex interactions
it's much easier for human to read a
piece of code say oh this is what this
could do and supposed to separate in ten
thousands of different places it's also
makes debugging much easier since you
have a single point logic and then we
bundle it with some essential libraries
then you can use right off the shelf
obviously being all the way Andrew it we
do android device very well and will
demonstrate later we also did have some
RF components like engineer and monsoon
will open will open these code up in
phases and we also make a very flexible
and plug well as you see on this
conference there a lot of everybody has
their own bill system and workflow in
their company and you probably don't
want to throw away everything you have
just to use Wi-Fi so like very much like
the open hfc you guys this morning our
stuff is also a library then you can
easily integrate with your workflow and
it's open source also we've been
actually running this insider of company
for a year now and there are about a
dozen different products that rose on
this platform and we think it's mature
enough then we want to share it with you
guys now
so this is the basic architecture and
decide we don't deal with test
allocation and device provisioning this
stuff we leave it to your existing
system or as you know like Rafe as it
exists established systems then we focus
on the part of the internet that exposes
its devices to you in your test script
so Mobley runs on the computer and it
just basically it's very similar to the
Python PI uniform at with a few caveats
because unit we found out that unit test
frameworks don't necessarily satisfy the
system testing requirement for example
you probably want some device recovery
logic to be executed if the something
goes crazy wrong in your test so we
build those callbacks into the system
and also probably a simple assertion may
not be sufficient for device testing in
that you probably want to attach the
actual information in what went wrong
the device that's all some numbers into
the in your assertion while you leave
the test so we build at two and Alex
mentioned we so in our concept our tests
don't operate on a single device or a
single entity like we offer our
collection of them and the question can
be composed of really anything it
doesn't have to be just like consumer
electronic devices it can be some
equipment in very close to hardware
domain or it can be some software
service since they offered in the other
direction so we codify this concept
called test bed in our framework this
the test bed is just since the unit of
things you operate on your integration
test as you can see it could operate as
mobile devices it could have one two
three multiple Android phones then it
could have RF components I teenagers or
car boxes and simulate the entire
telephone network or you could talk to
cloud services like App Engine or your
own back-end then then your app uses all
good
we even have teams testing like network
switch back end in using this room
inside the company and then we all just
goes through i really like Adele or just
go through a simple test just to show
you what it looks like so before that we
had window config file the config file
just describes what the test that is
composed of it can be here we're just
having this is a syntactic sugar to pick
up all the Android devices and then this
is a cold it looks very much like a pile
in a test and you set it up and instead
of process process you were declaring a
hardware dependency so that has can oh
if you don't have this device we will
fail we won't execute then you basically
here with the Creator and we need
android device here and we call that
then we make a toast on it and when you
actually truly it will actually feel
exactly like a Python unit tests with
the config file so there are some other
cute features we've added in like Oh
most of the SS will require tons of
parameters and you can pass it in easily
or we have a welcome so physically way
to declare Android device dependencies
let's say you have a test then certain
Android device play certain roles in
this test and you want those signal
somehow correlate that information to
the test without hard coding the serial
numbers so that's the design there and
you can attach other values like phone
number you may think oh why do I need to
text phone numbers in central should
have that API well turns out it doesn't
work for while the API so how this other
because we have had so many times so
much time to run internally that is cute
also true features like oh I just want a
lot with something related to this
device we have this special logger
inside that Android device object that
you don't have to always log L serial
numbers so as I promise you we're from
Android we do and really well so in
android there are many ways to control
android device it's not just so
obviously you have adb that's the basic
then you have a UI Automator we're using
the UI all major open source project
here then you get into like most people
kind of stop here so but we it's
certainly not enough for google to be
able to test our platform so we we added
all these other ways to test the to do
deep dive into the system and the all
these control or comes in the single
object so the object has flexibility to
come disease and it without your tests
having to look like four different
handles to up to the same device then
you have to device just goes crazy so
Alex will talk more about the Java come
from here okay thank you so as I
mentioned the point of having devices in
your test is to control them there's
lots of ways we can control going to do
a d-type on them but just in general I
want to say that different multi-device
frameworks have different approaches to
controlling devices so last year in 2015
we had a very interesting talk by uber
about how they did their multi-device
control and just today we also had a
very interesting talk about actually
might even yesterday Intel's approach
and all of those approach were
decentralized so the main logic was on
the device and you would have used sort
of a single and slot system or a locking
system to block and then wait for
something has to happen and our
framework actually takes the opposite
approach it's centralized and your test
logic is on the Python side the field
it's a lot easier to manage the dispatch
and return and synchronization of
multiple devices and the debugging
because all of your code and logic is
centralized but it makes a little harder
to dispatch particular logic so the
first step to dispatching logic is
Android API calls there's a there's a
rich Android API it's and Javid runs on
the device you might have multiple
devices in your test how do you trigger
actions so there's no personal project
called SL for a witch that's for
scripting layer for Android which
basically exposes on the Android API as
facades it has essentially an RPC RPC
calls and we have integration with that
so we just call an RPC on the SL for a
side it's an app that you install on
your phone so make toast
this particular example is an RPC that's
defined by a cell-free you call it and
internally it will implement the call
using the Android API and return back
and we have created a special extended
version of SL frame which is also open
source it's available in this link which
you can find on the G tap website after
this is over and it will essentially
expose also the system and hidden in
private ap is if you want to do system
testing or Bluetooth or Wi-Fi our
airplane mode all that stuff it'll allow
you to call those those methods but this
is just the Android API which is not
sufficient because chances are you're
not developing Android and you have your
own app in your own SDK that you care
about and also because s all for a
require system privilege which could
require installing an AOS people live
Android it gets kind of hairy so to do
that we have custom snippets which are
custom basically just like a software
callbacks but you write your own code
and you expose that to the RPC server so
in the Python side you can invoke your
own java code at any time now you can
use it for your own SDK calls the care
units you can use it for espresso
whatever else you want to run on the
device this is a very simple example of
the Java that you might write in this
situation I just wrote a Java function
that depends are prefixed to an input
integer of course in reality is to be
much more complicated might be an SDK
call or something and I extend the
interface snippet which is very buried
just basically has the shutdown method
in it and I tag my method as at RPC
which is what allows the system to find
it and then in your manifest you just
declare the particular classes that
happen to have snippets in them and then
you build it into an EPK and you added
our library to it which we will very
soon expose on live in central this
won't work yet but it's under the last
stages of review and just by including
this jar into your APK into your Android
test cpk you will get all the
functionality that we see server
required to make these calls work so
when you build the APK and install it on
the device that is the APK with the RPC
server on the python side you just call
load snippets which will go and start up
that app with that package name connect
to it and then automatically find all
the methods in it that are tagged with
our pc and then in your python code you
just call get foo
and there is your answer fool to was
what your java logic was and you can use
this like for stress so for example in
this situation you can use it to drive
your app you just for arbitrarily
complex things and but there's more in
the world than Android devices so you
might want to hook it up with your own
toys with your own hardware and we'll
tell you how to do that thanks Alex all
right now you can wake up the people who
don't work on Android so vaccination we
want you probably won't have your own
robot your telepresence magical machine
to to testing your to involve in your
test so like this morning you saw the
approach of the black walls or in the
other frameworks so we thought we kind
of the same thing we want to make it
very easy for you to migrate your coat
over likely you probably have something
already working so we intentionally did
not choose its inheritance way on
because I know programmers they really
don't want to change their code and
especially the basic inheritance and
it's kind of hard to do in Python so we
have this very loose interface in the
past module you just tell us how to
create your crack how to release it I
how to get information from it so for
example let's say we have something like
a car then you just same as Android
device you declare the dependency always
registration then you can move on to do
action some way and I know it's not much
but like for various devices you
probably have various levels of controls
or protocols for example some goes
through your pastoralism goes through
the USB protocol so if we the pre bundle
libraries kind of provide examples on
how you can interface different kind of
devices or with the desire panting there
is there for you to kind of take a look
and see what you can take away from that
and with that all set we have a view to
show just so this in action so I just
explain it because we you doesn't have
any narration so what you will see two
three devices Oh
Oh see two phones and one wearable and
the one of the phones will make a voice
command and the variable will take them
always comment and may interact with the
other phone so make a phone call daddy
oh the audio is not working so we hear
the phone cells called daddy and the
watch costs daddy and you can see now
it's placing the call and the other
phone gets a call and just hands up I
don't want to talk to him yeah ah go
back to the size right so this is
actually written by of some just random
team inside the company we've never
talked to them just write our talks and
wrote it and be demoed it to us oh wow
so this shows you how easy it is to use
it and this hotel is probably less than
50 lines and including the assertions
and stuff so and now coming soon now you
can wake up to 900 people we are working
i was very hard but yeah it all depends
on what Apple Isis to do so then we
bring async events into snippets because
most actions on Android or call back
rest so it might be useful someday you
might want to have some basic logic and
we also want to provide a single set of
libraries for you to interact with
Android because not everybody wants to
write that 20 live function to connect
to Wi-Fi and it's kind of sad that it
takes 29 seconds Wi-Fi android too and
that's it thank you and we have some
sources we're just our rifle just went
ah I like two weeks ago so we'll keep
pushing documents and codes through but
just it's just the logistics from for
cinco from internal text moe Mobley is
already up the snippet live will be up
in the next few days going to the final
stages of review excellent
okay Alex name just a note after this
talk we're heading into a break so if
anybody needs to get started out a break
that's what we'll be coming up but we'll
go through some questions until then
first of all how does this compare to
everything else we've seen at this
conference all right I suspected that
what's gonna come up oh we didn't
actually know each other until we met
here ah so I actually talked to them
silver focus on the hardware teams that
actually have to do is manufacture ring
and stuff we are more focused on the
device size and like apps libraries
these more higher level stuff and we
have that's yeah that's kind of the
folks and our approach is slightly
different for example the class
inheritance and also oh we don't ask you
to declare your heart with dependency
for every single test case which is kind
of a casing HTF on just these small
things so we do look forward to
collaborate things probably not every we
have to write the same library ties in
there slightly different formats um yeah
so there's kind of two pieces there's
the test runner that actually kicks off
the test collection results and things
like that and then there's the set of
devices and API is that it ships with so
there's actually it seems like there's a
lot of overlap between open hf so open
HTF the runner the kicker off and the
Mobley runner we should be collaborating
with them quite closely but in terms of
the bundled library it seems like
they're more focused on hardware devices
iphone mentioned whereas we're focused a
lot on android and AP is and software
and being applicable to app developers
not hardware developers but let me talk
to them very good always good to talk it
out if there's any questions in the room
go ahead you can raise your hand as well
I think we covered that can we use the
real devices and
emulator simulators both with it yes
because there we don't really make
assumptions so our controller for
Android device really just take a TV
connection if you have a t-butyl Intel
simulator that's fine and we're also
working with some other team to cook up
something really cool oh but I can't
really say that yeah but but real device
and simulators all a mix is fine oh yes
what's the biggest challenge in taking
this from internal to open-source
internalized there are a lot of magical
tools in google them we don't have to
write and yeah but opens awesome we can
work still a disfiguring these are
there's a big set of utilities that we
have internally that are pretty closely
tied with other utilities that we have
in particular teams that are working on
them that are changing them all the time
so the process of trying to abstract
that into a public stable useful
consistent set of utilities or the
open-source release is something that's
still ongoing for sure yes it is very
hard to do I know that what about the
test result do you have any dashboard
available the framework is designed to
integrate with a test runner that's why
it doesn't handle things like device
allocation chicken files around and
sending results back the results go
firstly into the summary JSON file that
is part of your log directory for
machine parsing and secondly the test
case itself is executable and the exit
code of that execution is non zero if
the test failed just like pie in it
would be so we're hopeful that wherever
you can sort of plug in PI unit or a
generic command that runs a test you
should be able to plug this in it's
we're definitely working on better
integration with test runners which will
provide dashboards and results and
execution and things like that it's a
little hard to focus on it because we
have tools internally that we're all
already using that are excellent but
that we can't release but we're going to
try and
make something in future okay I think
we'll do one more before the break is
the configuration or implementation easy
as compared to another open source tool
with another did you make your
configuration so difficult that so it I
first of all I can say is pretty easy
because i'm very lazy person i really
don't want to go have to go rest three
different files in different formats to
people i can't run tests that was just
too difficult for me so we just have
this one config it just described really
describes what the test but has and how
to find it like say a unique serial
number to el device all a network
address so that's really all we want you
can go as crazy as you like in the
config since it does a json we do have
teams and do that of where the convicts
are just like they will include the
entire encryption key in basic civil
straining and total them so yeah but for
me personally it's i prefer to see on
the either side the config you can
attach your own parameters to the
devices you can create your own devices
in their own config keys and you can
have params with the top level that just
get passed directly into your test case
so it is very configurable and the basic
country gives you saw is very simple and
they can get arbitrarily complex so it's
quite configurable oh great oh yes that
brings up a good point when choosing a
testing tool make sure the developer was
very lazy beforehand and that's a good
signal that'll be used until you need
bug fixes one thing it it took all right
got another hand for Alex and me
