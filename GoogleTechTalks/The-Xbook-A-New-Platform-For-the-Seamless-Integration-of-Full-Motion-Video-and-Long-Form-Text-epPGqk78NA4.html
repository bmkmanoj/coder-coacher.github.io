introduce our speaker today thanks for
coming by the way so my husband Bob
Whitsett who's in the back there and I
have known Hank mishkov for over 25
years Bob and Hank both worked for texas
instruments on the ill-fated TI home
computer some of you were old enough to
remember that they both insist however
that it was not their fault that it
failed Hank's written books and magazine
articles on various computer related
topics and if you look at his website
web feats Fe 80s web feats com you'll
see the you write short stories as well
he's been on the internet business for
more than 12 years and in fact he hosted
the very first web site that Bob and I
developed earlier this year Hank gave us
a demo of a product idea he calls the X
book he asked us if we could set up a
demo at Google if we liked the idea and
if we thought it might be of interest to
the Google community we do like the idea
and we do think that Googlers will be
interested and that's why we're here
today so to tell you all about the X
book here's Hank mishkov thank you can
you hear me am I miked everybody can
hear me that's good this is uh a lot of
fun for me I Lana showed me a photo last
time I was in town of a talk that Jane
Fonda and Gloria Steinem gave here and
she showed me a photo that she had taken
of that speech where Jane Fonda's
leaning over and saying something to
Gloria Steinem and it happens that
Atlanta was close enough to actually
hear what Jane was saying to Gloria and
so while all the Googlers were I imagine
sitting out in the audience thinking wow
we're here in the same room as Jane
Fonda and Gloria Steinem Jane Fonda
actually leaned over and said to Gloria
we're at Google
real excited and I understand that
that's exactly the way I feel I think
this is cool I'm happy to be here and
thank you for having the X book is what
I call an idea that I came up with for
integrating video and text in in the
form of an electronic book and the X
books just a working title it's not a
product I don't have a prototype I just
did this software emulation to show what
it would look like so hmm I hope this
will work you're not getting the bottom
of the screen something about the
resolution well we'll find out as I get
to the video portions imagine as you're
seeing this that what you're looking at
is not a computer screen but a product
that you're holding in your hands it has
two screens to emulate the two pages of
a book and you hold it in your hands and
it has some controls along the bottom so
that's the key to this this is not
designed to be software that you're
running on your computer this is
designed to be a handheld product that
you're reading like an electronic book
of course there are other electronic
books on the market notably the sony
reader but there are others as well how
many of you read things on electronic
books that you own electronic book
devices okay how many of you download
electronic books and read them on your
computer okay let's do more okay of
course with google reportedly getting
into the electronic book business i
guess and having all those books
digitized I can understand that that
would be a popular activity here and one
of the reasons I came up with this idea
is because I'm a writer myself and
actually this is a book that that I'm
working on and one thing the first on
this first screen I just want to show
you real quick one feature that all
existing electronic books have as far as
I know electronic book devices let me
stop for one second and talk about
terminology because
it happens that people use electronic
book or ebook to mean both the hardware
and the software and it can get very
confusing and I'm sure I'll be guilty of
confusing those terms as I go along and
Wikipedia what they they point out the
ambiguity is is an e-book something you
download or is it ebook something you
hold in your hands and they use the term
electronic book device or ebook device
for the hardware which is kind of kludgy
I think or ebook reader which then runs
into the problem that Sony's product is
called the the reader so when I say
electronic book I could mean one or the
other but hopefully by the context
you'll be able to figure out which one I
mean and what the existing electronic
books can do is they typically have a
control where you can increase the font
size and or decrease the font size
you'll notice that the page numbers
change as I do this that's because if
the font size is bigger that takes more
pages to say the same thing I know the
sony reader does this there are some
interesting computer problems there can
you recalculate page numbers on the fly
for example I'm not in in this demo and
I don't think Sony does in there reader
although I can't be sure Sony only has
two sizes i believe large and small
there's no reason why you couldn't have
more but then you'd either have to
hard-code a lot of pages or figure out
some way to do it on the fly okay most
of that's showing them that's good this
is a book that I'm writing I've been
writing for some years and to help
motivate myself at some point I started
posting chapters on the web as I would
write them hoping to get feedback from
people which would help motivate me to
continue and it occurred to me at one
point that maybe I could get people to
contribute graphics cuz I'm not an
artist myself and I put a page up asking
if anybody wanted to illustrate the book
would they send me some graphics and
here's an example of someone who sent
one in to illustrate this chapter and
then at some point that occurred to me
if I can get people to send in
illustrations why couldn't I get people
to send in little video clips and I
think I started thinking about this one
YouTube company are all familiar with
became real popular and people were
doing their own small video clips and I
thought that would make the book much
more interesting if people did that and
that's when I started coming up with the
idea of the X book and I think what
really clicked it brought back an old
memory of an old video game called
missed if any of you ever played missed
remember it at all okay then you
probably know where I'm going with this
one of the central themes in all the
missed games is something they call the
linking books which is something that
appears on the screen it's a book just
like this but it has a window where
videos appear and that's from the first
game so this is a I guess this is the
linking book but I call it the X book
well unfortunately the video is wonder
if I can change the resolution on this
at all how would I do that well i don't
think i will i think i'll leave it like
this you just you're not going to see
the whole video unfortunately but you'll
see enough of it so that you'll know
what's going on so i started thinking
about the idea of integrating video into
books and I started wondering what would
be good applications one thing that
occurred to me is books are sometimes
made from movies novelizations for
example and I remember when I watched
when I went and saw Star Wars when it
was first out I went and bought the book
Star Wars thinking that it would fill in
a lot of the blanks in the movie but
turned out that it didn't because it was
actually written from the same swing
play so here's a book that I made up and
at the end of the chapter
to hear the audio doll
so the process I'm imagining and you
read the chapter the chapter there is a
video you can watch someone lyst
interpretation of the events on chat
you can have videos on your page
depending on its on what you're being
too intrusive text
but I think in a work of fiction a video
of the enemies want to kill that there
anybody anybody recognize the video by
the way but very good very good that's
das boat that I wrote some text around
so it would match the video now one
problem the whole problem of digital
rights management comes into play when
you're working with a new work of
fiction when a new work of fiction comes
out is the author going and publisher
going to want to make it available in
electronic book format right away and
they're probably people in this room who
are wrestling with that issue right now
one source of material it doesn't
involve that is material it's not
copyrighted any longer so you're reading
the Christmas new window are you afraid
after each scene you can see how low a
dremel tool adder interpretive less able
to fool yeah but the touch of my head
and you shall be up he'll need more than
busy now in this particular case the
text is not copyrighted the movie may or
may not be I'm not sure how old it is
but after material gets to be old people
aren't buying a lot
think that the owners of the copyrights
would happily let you release it in a
new form you new vision and then I
started thinking about other ideas what
you could do in well I'm calling an ex
book of video book that really you
couldn't do in any other medium and I
started thinking about different
interpretations of the same text so
here's a scene from Hamlet and I've set
it up so that you can see how three
famous actors interpreted it first you
can watch Laurence Olivier the left port
yard I knew him Horatio the fellow of
Infinite and I won't play this all the
way through one thing I found
interesting is he actually messes up one
of the lines here you throw me on it
back of both phrases which if you're
reading the text and watching the video
at the sound board hell my imagination
everybody has their own interpretation
of Shakespeare so you might want to see
how Mel Gibson to let those exact same
lines I knew him Horatio a fellow of
Infinite Jest of most excellent fancy
but of course if you want to see the
best interpretation if boom you're going
to have to go to mystery science theater
3000 who you are hey I did all right for
myself I knew him Horatio i sat next to
him in trig fellow of Infinite Jest of
most excellent humphy yet bohmian is
back but anyway you get the idea and and
Shakespeare is a really rich source of
this because his plays have been
interpreted so many times and and
Shakespeare I remember from my school
days you can read the plays and it's
really hard to figure out exactly what
the author meant because the language is
so old and then some
you'll see it acted and it'll all click
into place if you have a few different
interpretations to to play with on every
scene then I think you can really get a
lot more out of it for yourself and then
I turned that same idea around on its
head what if you had the same video but
different versions of the text one
source where we commonly have many
different versions of the text for
example is the Bible so here's a where's
my mouse master what should we do this
woman has been caught in the act of
adultery here is a saying that she
should be fun and frolic merely a little
and there are many different video
interpretations to in this case I'm
video we want to know your you could
have multiple video invitations have
multiple texts interpretations so if
you're reading the Bible and you're
trying to study a certain point you
among you is we want to see how since if
you've not originally written in English
you can see how the King James
translators handled it and then switch
over to the american standard version of
the same text and then the new
international version and not only can
you do different versions of course you
could have different languages if you're
trying to study different languages you
can switch it over into Spanish or
Russian or the Chinese version and this
is something again imagine now this
isn't you're not looking at a computer
screen we are now but this is a book
that you're reading a handheld device
that you're reading that you can get all
these different interpretations all
these different translations and see the
video I like to think of it as an
entirely new medium that I'm probably
not creative enough to come up with all
the possibilities of things that you
could do with this just putting a video
clip on the screen at the end of the
chapter is is just a starting point as a
launching pad there are many more
creative people who could come up with
all kinds of ideas for how you can even
better integrate video and text
here's a situation book that's a class
again a movie that's close good so it's
interesting you can read the text and
then see how the director interpret the
text it's not a word for word
translation you'll find and as you
review it you may if you're studying
film or studying literature you may
understand why the director made the
decisions that he made another fertile
area for material i think is children's
books i got a choice word for you
because of course children are like to
read we hope and they like to watch
videos so why not combine in my package
right instead of either having to read
the book or watch the video why not do
the boat read a chapter watch the video
of that chapter more of that page you
spending on how it's done he's gone
there's a place children learning to
read this is a and it's a place where we
oh I had an idea that I never
implemented in the demo but why not
highlight each word in the text test
videos your children learning to read
will happen
they'll just be being entertained
they're just watching the video there's
next and it's highlighted and s goes
long and they're learning to read
whether they know it or not I started
thinking about other genres that might
be interesting to combine video and text
and one thing that occurred to me is
coffee table books we all have books on
our coffee tables with a lot of photos
about places that we've been or that we
that we like to be or that we might like
to be someday and our guests skim
through those books but there's no
reason why the photos in those books
couldn't be videos and instead of
reading about this room in the palace
you can you could have it pan around the
room you don't need a lot of still
photos to show you the palace you can
just watch the video which I think gives
you a much better idea of what's what's
in the room
I've talked about children's education
but I don't know that this will work
because the screen is cutting off but
let me try well typically if you're
reading a an engineering book or a
science book textbook you're going to
see a lot of places where they'll be
describing a process and it will say
describe something and then say see
figure 1 describe something else see
figure 2 different stages of the same
process but you don't have to have still
photos why not show them the process
dynamically and this is something about
integrating along a line of charge i
have no idea what that means but you can
show it dynamically so you're instead of
referring to the different photos you
just refer to the video and another
advantage of having it on a basically a
computer device is that you can it's not
showing up real well because I'm missing
most of it you can move the video around
and see the it's not really working I
can move that so if you really want to
investigate the phenomenon you can turn
it around and look at it in three
dimensions that's something that you
can't do in a book I don't care how many
photos you have you're not going to get
that point across you can do it on a
computer obviously that's this stuff was
developed for a computer but I still
think there's a difference in the
experience of reading it in a book a
computer even a portable computer is not
something that you're going to want to
read a 200 page book on whereas
something that's light and you can hold
in your hands easily you're going to be
more inclined to sit down and read the
entire thing okay this isn't part of the
demo these are some notes that I just
made for myself so I'd remember to hit
the high points here before I insert the
intermission but don't get up and get
any popcorn what are the key features of
the X book one thing I think is dual
screens this has the disadvantage of
making the device more expensive
but it has the advantage of feeling more
like a book the sony reader i always
feel is really a slate rather than a
book and that's not to denigrate the the
sony reader but it's a different
experience reading something that's just
one screen we're used to the idea the
form of the book that we have now is
called the Codex forum it's been around
for a couple of thousand years and
that's the way we're accustomed to
reading plus when you add the video the
video takes up screen landscape and if
you just have one screen you're going to
be able to fit very little text if you
have the facing screens you not only
have the comfort of the book form the
Codex the Codex storm that we're all
used to but you can have the video on
the screen and still have enough room
for significant text so dual screens are
important the videos obviously that's
what the ex book is and most of the
videos that I've been showing you were
in the same spot on the screen but
there's no reason why the videos
couldn't be anywhere on the screen they
could be on both screens I showed you
one example where I had two videos going
at a time it could you could use it just
for pure video you would have a video
book that would have no text in it you
could have the videos that I've shown
you for purposes of demonstration you
notice I had to click on them to start
them there's no reason why you couldn't
just turn the page and the videos would
start by themselves especially in
children's books it's just a different
effect and the sources of videos I think
movies are an obvious source we have
digitized movies millions of them
YouTube is a fertile source of video
clips and there are others as well that
I don't remember I can't see them on the
screen but that's the basic idea other
features you could do animation I had
one example of computer animation audio
you could have the entire book read to
you i believe the Sony Reader actually
does that as an option so you can be
wearing the sony reader on your hip and
have any earphone in and just use it as
an audiobook or you can read it as you
go along
I think you could have for audio you
could have it read one page at a time
the current page that you're on
highlight a line or sentence or a word
that would help you with pronunciation
it could pronounce the word you can
click on a word and have it defined you
could have sound effects another thing
that I think would be interesting to do
with a video book that you certainly
can't do with a book on paper is sort of
a book to dot 0 a book community you
have you know Google's big on mashups on
their maps and on Google Earth why not
have the same thing in books why not
have discussions on certain points in a
book a little bit different for fiction
or for nonfiction for fiction writers
might want to discuss different literary
techniques that the author use for
nonfiction for a text books you might
want to debate the opinions that the
author is expressing in a pool in a
political book but you could do it right
there in the book you could have
something that you could click on while
you're reading the book can I hold
questions to the end is that okay I'm
unless I've really confused you there's
something that okay and you can have
commentaries just like you do on on DVDs
today you can turn on the director's
commentary as you watch the DVD and get
all the background author of a book
might give you more background for the
book than he could really fit into the
book and annotations you can make your
own annotations or read annotations from
other people so a book 2 dot 0 community
is what I would call that loosely and
then there's advertising this is an
interesting point why not have some
tasteful non-intrusive context-sensitive
advertising in books and here again this
is a little different between fiction
and nonfiction I don't think any of us
want to be reading a novel and turn the
page and have an ad flash at them but if
you're reading a textbook which you're
typically not sitting down and reading
cover to cover
and certain concepts are being discussed
so people reading the textbook or
nonfiction book and general have some
interest in that topic why not have
advertising there for them as I've
talked to people about the X book that's
as soon as I say put advertising in a
book a lot of people just cringe and
they say they don't want any advertising
in there in their books i'm assuming
that a google i'll get a little
different reaction since you folks
basically make a living on advertising
but but basically you would have to just
to not completely destroy the book make
sure that it's tasteful not intrusive
and context-sensitive but i think you
could do that both on fiction and on
nonfiction then of course there's search
which you already have searched through
books at Google if you typically you can
get dozens or sometimes even hundreds of
books on the sony reader i think says
you can store 150 books on the reader at
the same time so then you could be
creative and have searched through
multiple books if you have books on the
same topic for example you might want to
see where different authors how they
treat the same topic I'm going to skim
through the rest of this you've seen
what I've done with different versions
of the same material and you could do
translations either the entire book in
different languages or you click on a
word and it translates it for you and
pronounces it and I've shown you the
example of variable font sizes and
bookmark Sony Reader also has bookmarks
where you can you know Mark not just
where you left off but places that you
want to remember that you want to be
able to find later in the book without
dog earring the pages which is what I
typically do that's going to say 10 and
I don't know that sony reader does this
but it occurred to me that if you have
multi one person reading the same book
at the same time you could have people
log in and then they'd all each have
their own set of bookmarks or people
could share bookmarks of things in the
book that each one of them wants to make
sure the other person doesn't miss what
kind of sources would we find for that
books and I'll go through this real
quick obviously general fiction general
non fiction which basically I think
would be treated a little bit
differently although maybe not but as I
did the demo as i tended to come up with
different techniques for the fiction and
the nonfiction textbook strikes me as
the place where you'd really want to
start if if the ex book was going to be
a product i think i'd want to test it
out on a college campus for a couple of
reasons one is you could then fit an
entire semesters book on a device that
was about this thick and wouldn't have
to carry stack of books around to your
classes and to one problem is going to
have to be resolved is copying you have
to know author is going to let or
publisher they're not going to let their
books appear in an electronic book
format in general an ex book format
specifically if they can be easily
copied and sony has addressed this on
their device but i think putting on a
college campus will be a good way to
find if there any holes in your security
system because the college kids will
will find them in two minutes and
classics which are not only read a lot
but are not copyrighted which is a
source of free material children's books
i think are obvious travel guides i
won't go over each one of them but
travel guides is my favorite just
because i like to travel a lot and in a
way you could make a case that a
sophisticated PDA is a lot like what i'm
talking about in that it has the text
and it has possibly some video at least
in terms of directions but i think i
tend to travel well when i go overseas
with a Michelin Guide in my back pocket
and I read it the night before to figure
out where I want to go that day and then
while I'm traveling around since I don't
always go exactly where I plan to go
it's nice to open up the Michelin Guide
and see what other sites are nearby and
what's famous about that and it just
seems to me that it would be even more
interesting if I could pull out the
Michelin Guide the night before while
I'm doing the research and see videos of
the places that I'm going to
visiting to get a much better idea of
what they're like and then while I'm
traveling if I get lost I can get
directions with an animated map and
again that's these technologies are
being used on different pdas today but I
think you could do a lot more if it was
a real book and had all these features
as well so to continue with the demo
here's something that I thought for this
audience that you could do you could
have magazine the best of youtube and
this is just an idea I'm not necessarily
suggesting that you do this particular
treatment but if you somebody sub you
could sell subscriptions somebody
subscribes to the magazine it downloads
to the X book automatically and each
week they see and the fifth loss to go
the sensation really of these
championships and you can have sold
David Harris to describe what selection
a and person who shops radio can tell
you a little bit about what he did we
were told he would hand you'll notice on
this page I have an ad so you can have
context-sensitive ads in this case you
know somebody's watching a video that
had something to do with horses so
you're selling a someone who does
artwork on horses so that's an example
of a context-sensitive ad that you can
have in a book and I think that's oh
it's not quite it
oh you're still here it's over go home
go I don't really want you to go that's
uh that's just what about for every clip
so I had to put it in there and that's
it that's the X book I'll talk for about
two more minutes and then throw this
open for questions and the question I
want to answer that you haven't asked
yet is why am I giving you this demo
here and the answer is I came up with
this idea earlier this year and I had no
idea what to do with it what do you do
when you come up with an idea that you
think is great that you know in 10 years
somebody's going to do it anyway and
you'd really like to be the person to
develop this idea but I don't have
billions of dollars lying around so I
don't think so i had to figure out what
company might be interested in
developing a product like this and
having me work with them to develop this
product and the first company I thought
of was Google which may seem a little
bit strange because you folks are not a
hardware company but it just seems to
play into so many of the things that
Google does of course Google there's so
many different things you could probably
say that about anything dhaka weight but
between the the digital books and the
book search and youtube and advertising
and i could go on and on it just seems
like a great idea for google so I showed
it to my friends Bob in Atlanta who
thought it was a good idea and set up
this so I could show it to you folks and
I don't know that if if you folks if
anybody out there likes the idea as much
as i do and wants to come and talk to me
bad i'd love to talk to you about it i
don't know if any of you folks are in
the position to
yes i'm going to give you 10 million
dollars to go develop this but maybe you
know someone else at Google who is and
if you think this is a good idea this
has been videotaped I believe in the
video tape is available to anyone else
who wants to see it and if you look at
the abstract my email address is there
and as I said I know in 10 years from
now somebody this will be a product
somebody will do it and I would really
love to be involved in making that
happen and I think Google is a great
place for that to happen and thank you
very much I appreciate you showing up
and thanks for your time and i'll be
happy to take any questions um my
question is does it have to be a
hardware software combination can it
just be software I think that for short
pieces of writing articles people will
read them on the computer I mean we all
do that all the time I'm not sure that
people will read a novel just to use
that as an example on a computer I don't
think that okay have the software and I
think it's an evolving idea is that
there is no need to assume what he saw
hardware
and increasingly that will be true so if
you design this for a specific piece of
hardware you're saying the only way you
can get it is to run it on this hardware
and and Google's I'm just telling you
that I don't think singles that way it's
more like will develop the software and
whoever wants to develop so hard where
they'd be running yeah in a way I don't
have a problem with that in a way I do
and let me let me explain I would agree
that any software that was available for
this device for the X book should also
be able to run on a computer i mean i've
i've shown you what it looks like or
what it would look like if you can see
the whole screen and there's no reason
why you couldn't download that same
software and with the proper emulator
package have it run on your computer and
if that's if that's how you wanted to
read it that would be fine it could run
on any device but as i said i think that
a longer what i call long-form txt novel
length text there's not going to be much
of a market for reading it on the
computer people are going to want to
read it on a handheld device now what I
think you're saying is that assuming for
the sake of argument that that's true
what Google would want to do is say okay
here is all the software and maybe a
description of the kind of devices that
would need to run on it but Google's not
going to make the device somebody who's
in the hardware business could go out
and make the device and then you'll be
able to run our books or X books on your
ex book device whatever it is or or on a
computer but I I think that there is
something to coming out with both at the
same time the software and the hardware
platform but then also encouraging
people to develop their own devices if
for no other reason then you're going to
have different form factors like I say
when I when I travel I have a Michelin
Guide stuffed in my back pocket now your
typical book won't fit in my back pocket
so i could see lots of different
pieces of X book hardware but I think
whoever comes out with this first it
would be a good idea to come out with
the hardware and the software may be
partnering with a hardware manufacturing
not making it yourself or coming out
with it at the same time possibly with
the with the Google brand or possibly
not but I think just releasing the
software without the hardware platform
available would be a mistake because I
don't think people are going to download
the novels to to read on their computers
so I don't think it will be successful
if you have a separate handheld device I
think it has much more of a chance of
being successful and then you can
encourage other people to develop
software and encourage other people to
develop hardware as well just my opinion
yes sir so I I played with one of the
sony readers and it is much easier to
read and write
but I kept running into the fact that
it's this close black one I can't use it
in for anything else and it's yet
another device i would have to carry and
that's a big barrier yeah it's a perfect
it's a stripped-down stupid computer and
in a way that's true of a lot of the
devices that we have all cell phones mp3
players although as you're probably
going to point out they're all growing
together to the point where in a couple
of years we're only going to need one
device and I can actually see that
happening with the ex book to that the
travel version of the ex book would
certainly have gps device in it and
there's no reason why it couldn't be a
phone and an mp3 player as well of
course everything you know your garage
door opener is going to be a phone in an
mp3 player someday but yet we use all
these specialized devices which
certainly have a CPU in them and are
certainly capable of being full function
computers but they're not well I say
that I don't know what you use you may
use a phone that runs windows and and
can do all these things I agree that we
don't want to carry around too many
devices but I also think that there is
room for a certain number of
special-purpose devices and right now
you carry all these things and you carry
books around so in a way I'm giving you
less fewer things to carry because now
you have to carry all these things but
just one book because everything you're
reading can be on the same book on the
same device I I understand where you're
coming from and it is kind of
frustrating at times when you know that
the device that you're carrying around
is perfectly capable of doing all kinds
of computation but it's been dumbed down
to do to do one thing but I think there
is something to be said for a special
purpose device as well my opinion Lana
I think the SP technology has pointed
out that what can be said for the
special purpose device is it it's time
on this earth is always short if you
were to build this book you have a
hardware device capable all these things
why interactive business if you want to
put gps my other things I
implicitly is going to have to have
and the Texas
and I've storage
today 34 years ago a special device did
just this sort of the feasible to make
the case with the pieces network but you
forget to forward the network connection
that was essentially free the storage
improves essentially free the
computation of up essentially free now
I'll admit a lot about it connects put
in our pocket
whoever solves that is murder that's the
big way but this when you can simulate
this on webpage as long as I have a web
page that I can pull up and put in my
pocket I've got direct right like
there's nothing essentially buying this
to a particular parking lot other than
you would like to be to be you have to
be to pull a term of the dump history
computer science from this thing done
easily carry and I think that you're you
really have hearts out harder device
that you're set up a disappointing but
if you're interested in the next media
that I was just go ahead but because
these questions of how I have an
abstract description of a book that's
both pre page in a table that contains
embedded links that have different
options like that is a general format
that's individuation but I don't think
that you're going to have a lot of
successful
because why would I have a device not
only do one thing have advice you
everything if the hardware costs of the
same to me what's an interesting what my
tendency is to argue with you because
that's what I do but I will go away and
think about what you've said because
that's an interesting point of view just
to throw out another consideration here
I didn't talk about I'm not really a
hardware technologist I'm not one at all
but the way that these devices are going
now is they use a screen that's a form
of what's called electronic paper which
is millimeters thick at most and it
doesn't electronic paper doesn't do
color video yet but it probably will in
about five years three to five years the
refresh rates just just too slow right
now well the Sony Reader uses it but
that's that's text-based you can't do
you can do color but you can't do videos
full motion videos but within 35 years
you can and one nice thing about some of
the electronic paper they're playing
with is that it's rollable you can roll
it up into a little device so you know
we think about how small something can
be the screens which I've also read that
the guy who invented electronic paper
was from Xerox PARC which I gather is
just right up the street here and where
everything is was invented and and he
feels that within 5-10 years the
electronic paper screens will just about
be free joining joining the list of that
memory and disk space are basically free
now they're so cheap so the screens are
will be free once they get into into
mass production and so the question is
if you have a little device that is even
smaller when you carry it because it
rolls up into something that can easily
fit into your shirt pocket but then when
you want to read it you can unroll it
with something clever that holds it
stiff so that it's not folding while
you're trying to read it and your point
is that if I could do that why not just
make that a general purpose come
then that would be your computer may be
one of the things you could do with it
is read X books but you can also run
your spreadsheets and your Word
documents and I'm not sure I still tend
to think and maybe it's because I have
so much invested in this that in terms
of time I like the idea about the
dedicated device it doesn't have to have
a keyboard that you would need to do
general computing it would if you plug
that into a keyboard there's no reason
you couldn't use it as a computer if it
had the right OS if we ran windows and a
web browser that's a long answer to a
short question but I haven't really
thought about what you said but I still
like the idea of the dedicated device
but I understand the objections to it
anybody else well thank you so much for
coming i do appreciate your time I'm at
Google that was fun thanks a lot
