Rasmus as one
of our health a Google speaker series
dr. Osmond graduated from the Medical
College of Virginia in 1966 where he
received his doctor of medicine he
completed a surgical internship at the
University of Minnesota and obtained a
cardiovascular fellowship from with dr.
Lily hi I think it's the right um doctor
has been completed a residency in
general surgery at the Cornell Medical
Center in Dartmouth Medical Center in
1991 dr. Osmond founded the new hair
Institute and quickly became a world
leader in hair restoration surgery and
inherited transplant technology this
technology enables epic Jack surgeons to
perform hair transplants with large
numbers of graphs and single surgeries
these high graph count hi graph counts
were previously thought possible only
with four to ten surgeries his many
innovations and techniques and equipment
have been presented at medical meetings
around the world and published in
industry newsletters and prestigious
medical journals as he pioneered these
advances dr. Osmond has presented more
than 19 scientific papers before
national and international societies
such as the International Society of
hair restoration surgery and the
International Society for hair and scalp
surgery and with that I'll hand it to
dr. Westman thank you for for those
people in this audience and if the
people from outside of the campus want
to ask questions at any time I'm always
loved to be interrupted anything that's
urgent I tend to set the pace so I will
go forward there for those of you who've
seen something about my background
before I entered this field I'll be
happy to talk about dairy farming and
milking cows if you like biotechnology
windmills or any of the other things
I've done if any of that interest you
meanwhile of course the focus today is
of
hair loss why do I have it of course
that's the that's one of the big
questions and the most important
question is what can I do to keep it and
that is not an easy question to answer
unfortunately we don't have the answer
that's good that's ideal which is a cure
for balding I have with me for patients
to they're very distinctly different
groups and I will introduce you to them
as we get to them in the presentation so
why is hair important it certainly
reflects youthfulness and health and we
do not want to appear unhealthy in the
days of the two of tuberculosis when
that ravaged the world one of the first
things that men would do is they would
lose their hair and so women who are
seeking men for their lives would
immediately eliminate balding men and so
the history of health and youthfulness
and the ability to be around to father
their children it was clearly an
indicator was was the amount of hair
they had on their head it's it's clearly
an important issue for self-esteem it's
a big dot secret for very many men who
are bothered by the air Louis it's not a
subject we talk about in public I've
gone to I've gone to many places to talk
about hair loss and when I go to a gym
where there are lots of men and lots of
women and I hold a conference they are
no men show up because they don't want
to admit that they are vain in the
slightest way yet I hold these open
houses in my office in which I have
former patients come and we we get very
big crowds there and I always look at it
as like an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting
that if you're one of the people you
don't mind joining others into the
meeting but you just don't want to be
isolated as a separate person there
the hair has actual function it protects
the head from sunburns and cancer and
people who don't have any hair on the
head will be frequent for basal cell
carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas
and the longer they get exposure to the
Sun the longer the more surgeries
they'll have on their head for skin
cancers it is a radiator for the body's
heat regulation there's a story about
when Napoleon invaded Russia and the
winter came in and then devastated his
army because they were poorly equipped
the first men to die were the bald men
because they lost their body heat and
they couldn't they couldn't protect
themselves from the cold and the Africa
planes the air becomes a radiator so the
kinky here we see with african-americans
is a radiator that allows air to air to
move through a sweaty scalp and cool the
body so it's it's a general body
regulator and of course the industry is
huge when we talk about haircut stylists
a variety of hair products wigs and
advertising monies and let's take a look
at hair this is your ideal hair a
presentation and if we zoom in and take
a look at the microscopic somewhat micro
macroscopic view of the hair what you
will see is that the hair grows in these
little clumps and sometimes there are
two hairs sometimes they're single
sometimes there are three hairs in the
clump and we call these clumps if you
will follicular units it's the medical
term industry standard medical term and
you'll hear me
refer to them as that so let's talk
about the causes of hair loss the most
common cause of hair loss is genetics of
interest about half of the male
population have some degree of balding
and and about half of the female
population have some degree of balding
for the men it occurs mostly before the
age of 45 many of them in their 20s and
the most severe balding patterns are are
present in the very young men in their
20s so the men who are going to go very
bold in their life will have it by the
time they're 29 most of them while in
females the the balding doesn't start
showing up until they approach menopause
and when they are hit by female balding
it as I said fifty percent of the
population in that category they get
generalized thinning it's a diffuse
process unlike the mail which tends to
have a pattern balding the female has a
diffuse balding appearance so there are
lots of diseases that also produce
balding their autoimmune diseases a
variety of types of alopecia thyroid
disease there are mechanical problems
braiding wigs and I brought with me if
you want to hone in on my wig I got this
from a patient that I treated he threw
it out and gave it to me as a gift and
they're hard they're very hard to attach
and this particular wig has a as a tape
border so you shave your head and then
you tape this on to the head and and
this is an actual wig so we call these
things hair systems the word wig is
fallen in disfavor by the users then the
the braiding issue is a really important
issue again against african-americans i
would say way more than fifty percent of
females
who have pigtails and twists and a lot
of work on their hair when they're young
we'll actually lose their hair and
develop traction alopecia and the wigs
are heavily used amongst African
American women and stress is a very
important factor in hellas him I
remember a man coming to see me he lost
his four-year-old child from acute
leukemia and in the six months it took
her to firm the appearance of the of the
disease till the child's death he lost
all the hair on his head and he became
an advanced hair loss pattern patient
all induced by the stress of his child's
illness and of course then we have
environmental factors of the things that
we eat antidepressants a whole variety
of drugs birth control pills for women
will frequently cause hair loss and
particularly when they're genetically
inclined for vulnerable for that and of
course vitamin deficiencies which are
not common in America are causes of hair
loss and there are a lot of people who
are selling vitamins to cure your hair
loss problem unfortunately it doesn't
really work so let's take a look at a
man who's going bald and this when you
get down to the microscopic level and
you look at it you'll notice that hair
grows in in little clumps as I as we saw
when we saw the whole pattern from above
and if you look over here you'll see a
clump on the far right of four hairs in
a single clump follicular unit and then
if we zoom in on another stage of
boiling in this particular man you'll
notice that the hair is thinner and more
puny and this is what happens in the
boiling process it becomes miniaturized
it loses its bulk it's it's number count
is still the same but the bulk starts
disappearing and then as it gets further
down the course of the balding like in
the very
front of that circle all of a sudden you
start seeing that the hairs are starting
to fall out and there's nothing left of
the hair on the head so what can we do
about hair loss well if you've got a
disease like thyroid disease you treat
it if you're anemic you try to get to
the root of the problem to the anemia so
if you pick up a deficiency it's pretty
easy to to at least afford it stop the
hair loss it may not return the hair
that you've lost then there is a
material called concealers and here's a
patient that has a concealer on his head
and a concealer is like a is like a
powder and here's a piece of paper and
I'm going to put the concealer on this
concealer call topic and you can imagine
what happens if you see this I hope that
shows up on the camera ok that's a
powder that sticks to the top of the
head you try to get it in between the
hair and this does a good job it did a
nice job on this man heat you have a
see-through back a crown of the head and
on the right you'll notice you can't see
very much because the concealer reduces
the contrast between the scalp color the
hair Carla and it makes them almost the
same and therefore you can't distinguish
the bowling and this is very popular by
the way the the companies that
manufacture these powders and sprays
have businesses and the tens of millions
of dollars a year and a lot of people
are using them the problems with them of
course is that the powder falls on your
shirt your blouse and you have a problem
on how to fix it there and that's one of
the issues ok of course I'm in the
business of a hair transplant business
and that means that we move hair around
the head from one place to the other and
here's here's an extreme example of a
man who has
who has the most extreme form of balding
this is a what they call class 7 balding
pattern and if you look at the right
side you will see the clumps and of hair
here have more hairs per clump more
follicular follicles in the follicular
unit then we saw in the previous patient
example and these follicular units this
man had one of the highest counts that I
have ever made and as a result of that
you can see he was all bald and I was
able to put back a full head of hair on
him in a series of surgeries and he had
a fantastic result and this is highly
unusual to have this type of donor
supply the the hair transplant business
is a supply demand issue if you have
enough supply you can meet the demand if
the demand is low it's very very unusual
for a man like the one in the picture
here to have his demand met by the
supply of his hair and when you count
the average male Caucasian male has
about a hundred thousand hairs on his
head this happiness man had about
200,000 so we had a lot of excess hair
that could be moved around amongst the
races the hair densities very amongst
Caucasians there are a hundred thousand
hairs on the head of a typical of
Caucasian in a standard bell curve if
you're an Asian it brings the count down
to about 80,000 hairs and if you're
African you get down to about sixty to
sixty-five thousand hairs so the amount
of hairs on your head decrease and it is
somewhat racially dependent okay now
since we pull out these follicular units
that I was talking about and we move
them to the top of the head if you look
over here this particular patient had
had two types of extractions one was a
strip where we actually cut out a piece
of scalp sewed it together as you can
see where it says trick acidic closure
and there's a little bit of a light scar
there's a bit of a white scar but it
barely is noticeable in this patient he
healed very well and this particular
type of closure surgical technique has
minimized the scar and then below it we
actually remove them with a punch so
there's about a point eight millimeter
of Point nine-millimeter punch sharp
circular punch that gets cord at that
cores out these follicular units and
then you move them to the place that's
balling in the old days when hair
transplants were first started up the
punches were the size of a pencil and
you could imagine if you took a
pencil-sized punch and you put it in
your bald head you look like you were
plugging and of course that gave hair
transplant a pretty bad image for many
decades actually since it was conceived
in the end layer early in the mid 1950s
and here's a person that had a young man
that had 600 follicular units these
multi haired units place in its head
extracted from the back of his head
excuse me and we did not shave his head
we only shave little strips and then on
the right you can see that the hair
combed over it so you really couldn't
see it so here are the strips of of the
areas that we shave the hair follicles
will remove from here and then placed in
the front of his head if anybody has any
questions about this wants me to slow
down or something like that please speak
up I'm just looking scanning the
audience on that one so what is it that
we take out where we take out a
follicular unit and this is a follicular
unit on the right over here you will see
what the actual follicular unit looks
like when it comes out of the head and
this one has to this one has actually
two follicles in it one of the follicles
is actually a baby follicle that's in
the state of growth the other one is a
mature hair follicle so this is what we
call to hair follicular
unit and the anatomy you can see is a
bit complex the the hair actually grows
some place over here right underneath
the sebaceous gland is the growth centre
for the hair and the rest of it comes
from the bulb so the hare has got two
different growth centers and when it
regrows it it regrows from contributions
in both places the dermal papilla and
right below the sebaceous gland and he
has a typical patient that we did this
man is fairly well known I won't tell
you what circles but he had a very
dramatic change in his appearance and he
loved his work and here's another man
who was thinning there wasn't much hair
left on his head and you could see the
change that occurred in in his hair
transplant and this is mark i'm going to
ask mark and Fred to come up here mark
come on up over here and Fred you can
join him because I have pictures of both
of these men before hand and I can have
mark you can take the mic and we'll keep
this so one second okay and they can
talk a little bit about their experience
if that helps get you get you away from
me go ahead mark you can start ok well
what box of showman I just want you to
know that that's what he does for a
living so I've been in rock and roll
basically all my life yeah to her all
around the world during the 80s did all
the big hair was a big hair band that
toured with a lot of people that you
probably were listening to when you're
ten years old and I was out there
trucking it and I'm still doing it and
about six years ago I my son we were
swimming and I got out of the pool and
he said she dad you're bald and I go
really and I looked in the big plate
glass window in her oh my god I always
combed it forward I didn't notice so I
went out looking
like everybody when they find something
they really want change they start
actively searching the web and
everywhere else and you go and you get
interviews and all this stuff and I
lucked out i was coming back from a gig
and I heard about an open audition for
extreme makeover remember that show the
home makeover so long but it started out
with making the guy or the girl over a
knife said I'm not ugly but I'd really
love to have my hair done and I went and
I was interviewed and I auditioned for
it and I got on the show I couldn't
believe it and the first thing I asked
them I said you can do anything with
this you want fine I need hair and they
say well we'll think about it and they
said sign this contract it's about the
size of the Webster dictionary and I
said okay sure thing so the rest of my
life you can go on YouTube with Google
me its marked strong ma r qu e and you
can find everything he did to me this
man changed my life and I've enjoyed it
ever since so the first time I went in I
it was four days before the airing the
airing of the reveal for the show he did
a 1300 count transplant and they cut my
hair real short dyed it brown and put me
on the show and you would never know it
we can go into detail me this was
because you combed your hair forward and
covered it up not for the show for the
show they had an old real short big
family I look I look at mark like Samson
you know he lost his hair he lost his
strength yeah okay horse mark lost his
talent when he didn't have his hair and
now he feels more creative than ever
since he got his hair back and there
really is a lot to it a lot of patients
that I've done believe that I am the one
that's responsible for their careers
because they didn't have a self
confidence necessary to do what they
wanted to do and then made it nicely in
the in the world of acting or whatever
he's asked to talk about his experience
go for sure in my case I had general
thinning and my hairline had gradually
over the years move back to the point
where I was a small forehead and
hairline was probably about halfway back
on my head three inches farther back
than where it currently is I was also
thinning in the crown and in fact when I
first visited dr. Rast and I actually
talked to him about transplanting in the
crown and he advised against it at the
time of Sonoma you only have a limited
amount of donor hair let's save that for
the front and also let's get you on
propecia let's see if your crowns not
too bad yet and you might have a chance
of getting some recovery and I started
propecia right away and after being on
it for 45 months I did get a good
recovery on my crown lady their hair
hadn't completely died it was becoming
miniaturised thinner and kind of
transparent but that after being on the
propecia it regained its health and
thickened up and got us covered back and
so the so I never did have to do
anything in the crown we did transplant
the front I've had two surgeries the
first transplant we did 2,800 graphs
which really what the dramatic
improvement filling in the front and
then the second surgery which I did a
few years later we hit the same area
again with about half as many grafts
about 1,300 graphs a second time just to
thicken it up and and give the density
or the thickness in front to get it a
little bit more consistent with what I
have in the back I've been on propecia
now for about five years I've had no
negative side effects from that in fact
I've had a positive side effect in that
it's also a medication that shrinks to
prostate in men at 50 years old it used
to be that I was getting up in the
middle of the night used the bathroom
once a night and after being the
propecia for a number of months of
shrunk the prostate down I don't even
have to get up in the middle of the
night anymore so that's been a nice
it probably pays to mention something
about it appreciate was on my agenda and
I'm glad just you talked about it about
13 years ago 14 years ago Merck released
the drug propecia which is finesse er
I'd the drug finasteride it was used
many years before that for the prostate
as well and and they did notice that the
it would stop hair loss and in young men
it might even reverse their loss
particularly in the back of the head not
much in the front and that's critical
critical drug that I try to ask all men
not women men only to go on the drug
they're a teratogenic effects of women
teratogenicity means that there are side
effects on babies that they produce if
they're pregnant and therefore they ask
you to say women to stay away from the
drug particularly women in childbearing
age the other drug that's available as a
drug called minoxidil rogamus is the
commercial version of at the brand name
and that's not quite as effective it
works okay on women maybe fifteen twenty
percent of women will get a get a
benefit from it and men about ten to
fifteen percent will get a good good
result from it it is an addicting
medication if you get benefits you and
you stop it you will lose it if you stop
propecia you will lose your your hair
that you was that was saved by the
propecia so for the men it becomes
lifetime commitments for the propecia in
particular I wanted to bring up one
other thing that we talk about when we
are having your open house open houses
in your office which is really nice he's
one of the few doctors that I've ever
met that invites people in to meet
previous patients and discuss things and
formally and that's kind of like what
we're doing here so any questions you
have for any of us or if you want to
come up and pull and grab the hair
that's fine it's all real hair but
here's one thing that we talked about at
when you take it from the donor area
which is your best hair and it's DHT not
in pervious to DHT but DHT
that's a lot less and you put it in the
front of your head well the the number
one thing that I've noticed is that now
you have the healthiest hair on your
head right in the one spot on your head
that is the weakest so all of a sudden
now you've got great hair in the front
the hair in the back on this particular
man that I'm showing you it's a rim of
hair three inches high that runs above
the ear around the side of the head the
back of the head and this hair is not
never bald and men for reasons that
nobody really understands there are
theories as to why that happens but
other than for the American Indian that
all the other male populations on earth
have balding with the exclusion of the
American Indian that came out of the
Alaskan bridge and there's some theories
as to why that happened as well but this
permanent rim on on Victor here in the
picture is is the permanent rim that
donates the hair and that hair behaves
like it did in its original site when
you move it and it grows really fast so
you gotta trim it all the time even I
trim my hair does look like it I do
there are no plugs anymore anybody with
modern technology you really can't tell
a hair transplant from a normal head of
hair and I would defy anybody in this
audience to look at these two men well
myself who's been transplanted the whole
back of my head has been transplanted
and and I would defy anybody to show
that that that they think it's
artificial or or wasn't my own hair or
God hadn't intended to put it there in
particular any questions for these two
men before I bring the other two guys up
okay yes go ahead did was there a
question here okay good there ya see go
ahead no I have not experienced hair
loss at all since the transplant
generally speaking if you're over 40 35
years old most of those people are
stable and if you take propecia it's
almost certain to be stable the
the big problem patience of the people
in their 20s early 20s mid-20s that that
have a lot of loss and who have very
aggressive hair Louis patterns but you
you learn to create what I call a master
plan and the master plan takes into
account the worst case the best case in
the probable case and if you can't
handle the worst case you shouldn't do
anything about it and just let Paige
take its course but i think that the
that's an important question stability
does encourage you get older it's
unusual for a man to stop losing here at
the age of 40 35 40 it does happen on
rare occasion the famous actor Don
Ameche started losing here when he was
50 but that was an exception to the rule
yes one I was going to say um and again
my son says you shed all over the place
dad and I got ya I've always been that
way so a lot of people worry that oh
there's a certain amount of hair and my
brush or whatever everybody does that
but it's when you are shedding more than
you're growing then that's when you know
you have the problem all I could say is
there is that shock loss right after the
surgery which we talked about in the
office which a lot of people ask about
and there is a certain amount of that
where you will lose from the original
area and then it'll grows back that's
why it's called a shock loss because
it's mr. but this condition can be
prevented by just being on the drug
finasteride propecia so for most let's
say ninety percent of even young men who
are on the drug before they have a hair
transplant they can hold their hair
pretty well and they won't develop shock
loss just that he just pointed out an
important issue is that hair goes
through cycles you don't grow a hair and
then it stays there for the rest of your
life you grow a hair two to three years
at a rate of about a half an inch a
month and then it falls out and gets
replaced by another one and this cycling
from growth to resting phase
occurs over an average of three years
two years and men three years and women
the the story of the brother grime
brothers grime who wrote the story about
rapunzel talked about the princess up in
the tower let down your golden hair so
the Prince can climb up and rescue her
well the hair never gets that long but
most the hair can grow is probably about
five and a half six feet and then it'll
fall out and grow another hair the good
news is color isn't about a hundred
hairs a day on a caucasian and it grows
in at a rate of 100 hairs a day so that
there's a big wash between what you
losing what you gain what you see in the
drain the hairs that you see in the
drain is really the hundred here's a day
that you're going to lose if you get an
acceleration of that that may be balding
yes friend sure the the question was how
much pain is experienced what's the
recovery like yeah in the strip method
the only deal were in the it's in the
back of the head where they actually
extract the section of skin and then
close it with the sutures and the
surgery itself is not at all painful
because they numb you up that you know
there it's you might have a little bit
of trouble sleeping the first night but
they give you some medication to help
with that but look like by the day after
the surgery I was completely off the
pain medication never felt anything up
in front where the hair was transplanted
only in the area where we extracted the
the skin strip and enclosed with sutures
had staples for about two weeks to keep
the suture clothes and then had those
out just a little bit of numbness in the
back where the strip was taken and that
eventually goes away after several
months there is a redness initially up
on top where the
heroes are transplanted that redness
generally goes away in seven to 10 days
I personally found that I had a little
bit of swelling around the forehead and
just cold compresses they always plead
with you to come in the next day to have
them shampoo your hair and show you how
to take care of it properly for the
first week I always equate it to like
planting tulip bulbs in the ground you
can't just hose it down with
high-pressure hose and expect the bulbs
to stay underground everything has to
have a nurturing point and then it's so
negligible I mean he just gave me a
couple of xanax and I'm sitting there
listening to him and he went through the
whole procedure and I was fine with it
and I've had three procedures and every
one of them has been exactly the same
and the recovery period is according to
your skin color your your hair type and
how easily you bruise that kind of thing
but for most of us that he'll fairly
easily the recovery period is very very
quick the body comes back really quick
and then you will notice hair growth
within three to six months if I noticed
was about force immediately what's that
Fred for me it was about there was about
a four month dormant period or nothing
was happening for the first four months
but then it started coming in then it
really came in quickly between month for
and month eight but but even a year year
and a half out I mean it was still some
stragglers kind of coming in and and
also the even the hair that had come in
early was thickening up over time and
getting more healthy yeah and I color my
hair and I've known Fred the whole time
he's been going and his hair if you get
really close to it looks like a 20 year
old and he's amazing there's a couple
other guys Moses
okay is another question well it's a
good idea to catch it early because then
then you can stop it with the drug and
then you could put it back and hopefully
that'll take care of it so that's the
best of all worlds yes another question
I have just told on a number of doctors
that that account for about 10,000
patients over 20 years and the numbers
of cases that were reported of
irreversible sexual side effects meaning
loss of libido erectile dysfunction was
about four so use those as statistics it
does happen we didn't recognize it
before the drug company has not been
forthright of coming forward with that
as a side effect probably because it
didn't fall within the statistical range
that they have required reporting but
but it's still rare and most of the time
if you develop sexual side effects you
work with a good doctor and you can deal
with the sexual side effects pretty well
yes oh I'm sorry that was on sexual side
effects and how often do you get
irreversible sexual side effects sexual
side effects itself is about 1% one to
two percent reported by the drug company
Merck in my hand my experience it may be
a little higher maybe three or four
percent but the irreversible I've done
thousands of men put them on that
medicine I've never seen it for those
people that have stopped it and that was
true amongst the six or eight doctors I
pulled if you go on balding blog com and
just look up sexual side effects you'll
see the statistics that were done by the
doctors that I called specifically to
answer a question like that from the
audience yes later on now for a second
question for you guys can you cut your
hair very short and find that find that
it just grows back or
something where once you now you got the
menu well I mean let me answer the first
the the propecia effect to remember it
might work within the first week or two
it probably does but it takes time for
the hair to grow out and it takes a bit
of exposure to propecia to see it so we
tell about most people I start on at the
donington on doing any surgery to
basically wait a year eight months to a
year to see what the effects are they
are very subtle on the front of the head
and they may work in the crown and
you'll know whether your respondent
usually an eight to 12 months I'll tell
you that for me it was for months on
propecia before I saw noticeable results
both in terms of recovery in a crown
getting a thicker healthier hair and
also about the same for the shrinking of
my prostate which I talked about there
is a friend of mine that I send over and
he's going to have the hair transplants
done now and he actually met with dr.
Aspen 15 years ago and got on the
propecia and he's had hardly any hair
loss he said to me before I ever sent
him back to dr. assmann in the last 15
years strictly because of the he stayed
on the propecia he's has hair loss but
it was all there 15 years ago and it has
not progressed and he said I'm finally
ready I've got the cash I'm ready to go
in so I got the tan skier other question
if you shaved your head it'll grow out
at a half an inch a month okay so it's
just like every other hair on you
there's no difference at all we talked
quite often and there used to be a
gentleman that would come into the
office and he had long hair like I did
and he was an extreme sports guy and he
had a lot of balding all the way back
well he had dr. assmann bring his whole
the where his hairline was down even
further than it was originally and then
he joined the Navy SEALs and now he
shaves his head
so it still grows out just fine but he
keeps it really really too but you need
not everybody will get the same result
and that's why you need a good doctor to
to work out what is the plan what are
the expectations and to set realistic
expectations always that's important
because what good for one person may not
be good for another one like anything in
medicine that's the standard any other
questions I'd like to call up the other
two guys yet this is a question in the
back okay all right if you guys will
step by will we'll have everybody open
to this in a few minutes this is a
Jeremy coming first and Tony behind them
and and they've had an unusually
different type of a procedure that has
just been introduced by our company and
and this is we call it scalp
micropigmentation it's a fancy name for
a tattoo and it's to try to make it look
like it was there forever and it's like
a stippling effect on the head to
reflect every hair follicle that was
there and both of these men were class
seven patients so here's here's Tony
beforehand and and this is jeremy and
and Jeremy and Tony both had class seven
patterns and if you remember what I told
you earlier about a class seven pattern
this is a class seven pattern so they
were almost to the class seven patterns
but much younger and if they waited it
out they would look like this man I
don't mean to scare you okay I don't
know whether I told you thats pretty
much or it was anyway Tony you're the
first one on the picture so why don't
you go and talk how the help pardon me
how did you make this decision to go do
this well her loss is a very sensitive
subject for most men and anyone in
general and I started when I was quite
young and
I didn't want to accept it so for the
first couple years it was more of a
denial phase and then there's a reality
that sets in and you just have an odd
don't have a choice you're gonna you're
gonna be bald the rest your life
basically and so I started I just said
scrotum started shaving my head pretty
young and I didn't have a problem with
it went through college and stuff shaved
my head and just just looked at it like
that that's how I was going to be the
rest of my life then I started thinking
one day what if there was some way to
give it the illusion that I had a full
head of hair but it was shaved because I
shave it anyway what's the difference it
can't look any worse than I already do
you know so I just kind of went down
that path and did some research and came
across micropigmentation now the thing
is what it did is to change the focal
point of my face and it's more of a
personal thing honestly there shouldn't
be anything wrong with going bald it's
more like a personal thing society might
look down upon it but as a personal
thing it's like a breast augmentation
you know you want to get it done or not
you want to feel better about yourself
it's going to make you better person in
general people might look at you
different or or something like that and
so was personal thing and has changed my
life greatly in different aspects and
stuff I can't say that I didn't I wasn't
unhappy what I looked at all I really
wasn't my wife loved me the same with
with or without and it was just some way
I chose to do and and it it's made a
good impact in my life and I'm pretty
sad I'm very satisfied actually with how
things have gone the hairline as you see
I was I've had it done quite a while ago
if i was to redo it i might do my
hairline a little different or some
because what why guy with a full head of
hair bix their head right oh well
it's more of a choice thing got most
guys that shave their head don't do it
by choice because we're losing their
hair and they don't want to look like it
you know around and go around sides and
whatnot anyway that's kind of my story
white one when with it dr. Aston is the
by far the best in the business if
you're looking to get a hair transplant
or this micropigmentation if you have
there's those guys that do where the
hair pieces they as dr. Essman brought
up they weave I'm only knowledge this
cuz I research it they let the hair on
the side to grow out and then they weave
it in so every month to go on in and
they get this thing tied down well
there's a lot of guys that do that they
can get those taken off and then you can
do the micropigmentation and you go into
work a week later and it looks like you
just shaved your head and honestly I
just saw one of my best friends I
haven't seen in like eight years two
days ago and doesn't have a clue I see
my friends I might not see for a certain
amount of time they literally don't even
notice it's not like it's a drastic
change to them at all they don't even
realize it and in so that's so that's
what I'm looking for honestly people
just think you just shaved your head I
get questions at work all you decide to
let your hair grow out or I've even had
the question do you get a hair
transplant or how'd you do that there's
curiosity things most of it is from
other guys losing their hair because I
knew I was losing my hair prior this was
at work a lot of guys and they're like
what you do and self and it's kind of
tough to explain quite a story obviously
but yeah I highly recommend it if you're
thinning on top you can get the hair
transplant of course but it'll also
thicken up everything on top and give
you more a thick beautiful if one of the
if Tony for example wanted to do a hair
transplant but if he had a density like
an Asian aura or an African density and
he didn't have a lot of donor here with
a class 7 pattern you
never get enough hair to transplant his
head yeah my hair was really thin as it
was anyway so even if I wanted it done
there's pretty much no way that I could
even do it I mean maybe in the future
when they have an unlimited amount of
hair because they can clone it or
something maybe go down that road and no
no and I'll address that at the very end
so its up its oh ok go ahead during grad
generally I uh managed enemy to talk a
bit a little bit about what happened
when you went to work cuz you recently
did it than you can talk unlike Tony
Tony's had it done almost a year ago now
I had mine done about a month ago I had
it done on a I had gone on a thursday
and i took off friday and monday so i
had a four-day weekend to recover from
everything and when I say recover that
we're not talking anything like a hair
transplant it's really I was sitting in
a chair I watched a movie on my phone it
took about two and a half hours and it's
like somebody giving you a tattoo when
the topper headed little tiny dots all
over the top your head that like Tony
said like dr. Aspen said it replicates
the look of actual hair follicles I went
back to work I've been working at the
same job for 12 years so these are
people who see me every day day in and
day out i went back to work a couple
people said just like tony said hey are
you shaving your head like with a razor
now and i said yeah that's what i'm
doing and a couple of you've grown your
hair out and i said yeah that's what i'm
doing whatever you say i'm going to
agree to and it was really a seamless
transition and again speaking as
somebody who was also class 7 if you
guys would have seen me a month in a
week ago i had a full clear line through
my head if I would've turned around
you'd have seen the cul-de-sac and
everything even though I kept it really
really short that's what was there and
you know what like Tony said it's not a
not something you should be embarrassed
about necessarily but a lot of guys
don't like it and I was one of those
guys I felt uncomfortable about it I
realized that was going bald I think
five years ago I was in a cold dressing
room trying on a pair of slacks and came
out and there was mirrors all over the
place and I saw the back of my head and
I thought oh my gosh like what's
happening here from that point on
immediately self-confident shot down and
just you know didn't feel good about
myself and so been looking into a couple
things I'm not trying to do a hair
transplant I kept my hair short anyway
so I was thinking you know if something
else and I didn't know of anything else
until I ran into dr. Asmund he said you
know what you would be perfect for this
scalp micropigmentation thing coming out
I looked into it saw some things on the
internet look to be too good to be true
like a lot of things on the internet
right my dad always taught me if
something's too good to be true huge
is I insisted on meeting somebody would
had it done dr. assmann brought tony and
i met this guy I'm looking at his head
I'm like I have no idea that that's not
real hair that you know what if you let
that gross guys gonna have the thickest
head of hair ever but you won't and
that's not something I'm and that's not
that you want to do by the way you don't
want either of these men to let the real
hair grow because then they would have a
runway in the middle of their head that
that that looks shaved and then they'd
have bushy hair around the side and back
of the head with long hair and that's
not what we think yeah it's a normal
look and you don't have to bake it we
pick our heads with the razor it's it's
less noticeable I guess you can honestly
do with a local Razor setting and it can
just look like a trim look user 0 or I
used to use a zero actually but started
baking and I just like it much better
this is all real all around the sides
only the top here's only the top appears
don't know if you see it with the
lighting and stuff but and we can add at
the end of this we can have you look at
all these four gentlemen when we move
into the informal place are there any
questions here from the audience about
this okay this is very new and we're
just starting to build the the patient
patient numbers here and it's a nice and
satisfying yes if I can if I can jump
back in i think the thing about the
scout micropigmentation is is that it
doesn't have to be somebody who's hey
look at look at my head of i'm going
bald so I'm gonna do this I I think if I
would have known about this prior if I
was a guy who was losing my hair but I
still had you know some hair on top and
it was kind of going away you could
literally take a day off have this done
go back to work three days later and now
you're the guy who shaves his head and
appears to have a thick full head of
hair and nobody knows and that's really
what it comes down to is I think I
didn't want anybody to know that I had
something done that's the most that's
probably the most uncomfortable thing is
you don't want people to know that you
had a hair transplant necessarily don't
want people to know that you're
uncomfortable about this part of your
body but again I think this could go
kind of across the board anybody who's
looking to have something done if you
decide you know what I'm gonna start
shaving my head from this point forward
keeping it short get something like this
done and it's just again seamless
transition people don't know what's
there and now you're the guy with short
hair and it works wonders for people who
have scars on the back of it or any
place on the head that can make the scar
go away and we do it in conjunction with
hair transplants when people get enough
hair and then they just fill it in with
this pigmentation so it's it's a very
interesting blend when you work the hair
transplant with the pigmentation okay
milla okay I have yes no more questions
okay yes glad for women we minoxidil
works not great but it does work a
little bit the for women you want to get
make sure that you've had a full medical
workup that you're not working around
with hormone deficiencies or a variety
of diseases like thyroid disease or
anemia and so the first thing we do is
go through a thorough or recommend that
the patient has a complete thorough
medical workup in laboratory work up but
but by and large there isn't very much
we can do we do transplants on women
about half the women that we do are
women that have had facelifts and
cosmetic surgery it works great for that
and the other half are women that have
more pattern balding like a male which
is about less than twenty percent of the
women that have bawling and sometimes I
can i can actually transplant a woman if
we work out a a style that they want to
fix the fixed on their head I can put
hair in that area like parting the hair
in the middle I can you know cover an
area maybe two inches by 4 inches and
put hair there and that works for women
the big problem with women is that the
hair in the donor area this fringe area
that I showed you off man
work is usually not healthy so it might
have miniaturization to forty or fifty
or sixty percent of its original
population and that's moving bad hair
too bad hair so you have to be highly
selective i don't think i would say only
about twenty to thirty percent of women
have value with having a surgical
procedure like a hair transplant we have
been doing a few women with scout
pigmentation in between the hair and
that's worked very nicely on selected
women to thicken it up so it doesn't
look as thin and i think that'll have a
nice bright future in our practice yes
if there any validity to biotin no there
is no validity to that helping well most
of the claims on a variety of vitamins
and medicines just aren't just not true
and unfortunately there's a lot of
people get preyed on by by a lot of not
good marketing material and scam is all
over the internet and of course
everybody buys a lot of people buy into
these scams unfortunately so if you see
a good doctor they'll tell you that's
not good stuff don't waste your money
and if you read my balding blog i have
that all over there but people will ask
questions constantly will this work will
buy it at work you can you can go in on
balding blog and ask the question of
that biotin i've answered it already
before for other people yes okay let's
talk about cloning we just started a
study in our office we just got an IRB
an institutional review board's ability
to do human experimentation and and that
is a with with hair multiplication we've
selected the population that we want to
do it on they
to have a big bald area and what we do
is we pluck hair out of the back inside
of the head pluck and and the hair that
you pluck out will regrow and then you
put it into the front or the back or the
bald area that you're targeting we've
been doing a hundred hairs it per area
and sometimes two or three hundred air
two or three hundred hairs are placed in
maybe two or three areas and we have
just started this about three to four
months ago I'm getting all the patients
to come in now I have not seen any
growth yet I wouldn't expect it if I saw
hair transplants either at this stage it
may be in three months I'll have answers
on that as to whether here
multiplication works there is some
evidence by one doctor in North Carolina
that indicates that he's had success
with it and I know what he did and I
which is doing the same thing to
validate the study like any good science
you want the study to be replicable in
more than one institution the hands of
more than one daughter and that that
will put credibility to it if it works
if we get a failure of this all the
patients who volunteer for this have
agreed to realize that one it's a
completely experimental procedure they
don't charge them for it and it's free
basically to do it so we just doing this
to learn and the paid people just lined
up as soon as I announced that I would
be doing this on experimental basis we
were swamped with people wanting to be
experimental subjects and of course most
people had too much hair for that I want
absolute bald areas thank you for the
question well yeah I haven't done any
experimenting on women yet but there
should be no reason why a woman wouldn't
respond the same as a man here
okay i would invite those people are
here to come down and and meet these
gentlemen and i will you may test to see
whether you could tell their transplant
that if you want to run your fingers
through my hair you're welcome to do
that to thank you very much very much
for inviting me here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
