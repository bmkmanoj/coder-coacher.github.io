I was introduced to cliff by some
friends who went to Nigeria to set up a
granary at a school and they were just
so amazed at the impact than having this
information being available to the
students it was just you know I opening
for the students and for the people who
helped set this up so they were really
excited about sort of this being a
solution which can work today you know
without waiting for a huge amount of
infrastructure to be set up in the
poorest places in Africa and the
developing world so i might eclipse to
give us a talk about his experience with
this project and the challenges he sees
so it's a cliff the director of the
project is going to talk to us hey thank
you thank you p grab this on is it on
can you guys hear me don't like a phone
cool alright so thanks very much for
having me I'm delighted to be here to
share some ideas about serving the
world's poor with information technology
I just got back from a conference in
Malaysia a UN conference on information
technology heard a great story there
wanted to share it with you this guy
tells a story about a village a hilltop
village in Africa that had petitioned
the local government saying we need some
help to develop this village and to
improve the lives of our people and so
the government people got together and
they decided education and computers
this was it so they told the villagers
you will be there on Sunday we're going
to bring a bunch of stuff and this would
be great so they get to the end of the
road and they have to hire some donkeys
to load up with all this computer stuff
that they've got they've got these
fantastic plans eight hours up the hill
they finally arrived at the village and
they tell the villages look we have
brought things to improve your life and
the villages that oh thanks and they
took the donkeys
and that one of the conundrums of
working working in the developing world
working with the world's poor you know
we're talking about people who are
making a dollar a day and but there is a
critical critical need for information
everywhere everywhere in this world poor
people are dying for a lack of knowledge
and it's it's imperative that we help
them get access to the knowledge they
need when they need it and this is what
Google does best right getting people
access to the information they need
exactly when they need it and one of our
one of our missions is to to to develop
that I've been working around Africa
since 1982 mostly in water development
but since 1996 I've been teaching about
the use of information technology in
developing countries and in 2019 99 I
went to Nigeria as a senior for brighter
and spent a year teaching at a
university there and wandering around
the country meeting all kinds of people
vice-chancellors and librarians and
others at these universities to kind of
discern what their plans what their
process were and what I found we're a
lot of people who had very little money
huge ambitions and and we're not
confident about their ability to to grow
IT on their campus so out of that we
founded the wider net project which is a
nonprofit service organization based out
of the school of Library and Information
science at the University of Iowa and we
see ourselves as a coach and an advocate
for people in developing countries who
are setting up their first IT systems
and I guess the the first the first
tenant of our work is that there is no
digital divide
that's that's it that the notion of a
digital divide is a luxury that we are
allowed because we have kind of awkward
or kind of ironic to say this with a
free food counter next door we have
everything we need and digital
technology and through that lens we look
at people in developing countries and
say eh they don't have digital
technology but from the lens of somebody
and in in most developed countries they
don't have very much at all and they
also don't have digital technology so
there's a refrigerator divide there's an
antibody biotic divide there's a road
divide there's an education divide right
bear and simple it's an economic divide
their poor and we are not we are not in
such a way that we oftentimes forget
that we stand on the shoulders of giants
that there's generations of
infrastructure development and civil
society development that makes it
possible for us to be in an
air-conditioned room with 24 by 7
electricity right makes it possible for
me to have my credit card over to
somebody and say yeah go ahead and take
forty dollars a month off that thing
right totally inconceivable ideas in
most of the impoverished world so a lot
of the challenges for me in doing this
work is is moving out of this privileged
space that I exist in and understanding
what it means to spend money on i.t and
our main focus our main purpose is to
find low-cost high-impact ways to do
that so since 2000 we have had over
4,000 people go through our training
programs in Africa and that is things
like showing up with donated fiber
optics and tools and doing fiber optics
training where a dozen technicians
within a week fiber up three buildings
for less than five hundred dollars right
they do it themselves and we end
we just came back from my training in
Ethiopia technicians from nine
universities in our program and
everybody within a week had completely
taken a computer apart put it back
together again done troubleshooting set
up networks cut network wires configure
the machines with all the software and
most importantly turned around and
taught somebody else how to do it
because the building of human
infrastructure is really critical so we
have our volunteers at the University
have refurbished over 1200 computers
we've collected donations from microsoft
and 3.com and others to take do
installations there and we're really
focusing on really practical
cost-effective solutions that that meet
their information needs we also work on
building a digital culture something
that that we sort of take it for granted
here is just this whole idea of Google
Groups right usenet this whole idea that
for for 20 some odd years now people
have freely been sharing their knowledge
with each other helping each other out
right and the zelda all this you know
web 20 stuff it's about people
communicating with each other and and
moving each other along in their IT
knowledge these are things these are
things that have happened in the last
few decades here which haven't taken
root and a lot of cultures around the
world so we're talking about changing
communication patterns changing
education and getting people into
cooperating and collaborating with each
other so these are the three challenges
I see to scale and let me say you know
if you've done any reading or never seen
any articles about internet and
developing countries you almost always
those are articles about somebody doing
a demonstration project and I'm I've
been around this business far too long
I'm starting to get bored with these
right because this is what we call Cal
plop development okay the calculus of
like poopoo there's development right we
airlift in a computer and with a
generator and a solar panel and a na
vsat okay and wallah we are connected to
the Internet
I I mean did we did we think that that
wasn't possible sure we can put we can
put an internet station in Antarctica we
can put it on the moon right we have the
technology to do that but none of that
scales all right I go to university that
has 60 computers and they have worked
really hard for years to get those 60
computers with 128 k internet connection
right and they have 30,000 students at
the University we know we can put
computers anywhere and connect them to
the internet if we have enough money but
how do we get 30,000 students working
with computers so the issues are scale
and these are the three issues i see
face time there are so many projects and
I want to do sort of digital dope slap
okay because there's people who are in
this field especially people who are
selling something in this field like to
talk about big numbers and huge impacts
so they'll say we put 60 computers in a
university that means 30,000 students
have access to the Internet no right
unless they line the students up and
have them you know 30 seconds each every
day right or and and and and goodness
knows you know what somebody 60 people
can do with 128 internet connection not
much so there's a lot of hyperbole in
the field people over emphasizing what
they're able to do with the technology
if the students are going to learn from
computers they're going to need 10 15 20
hours a week at a computer and if the
electricity is only on for six hours a
day right there's a limited amount of
time limit amount of students who can be
served by a handful of computers we have
on our website we have what we call a
FaceTime calculator where you can plug
in the numbers you can say the computer
lab is open so many hours the students
need so many hours at a computer you
know and how many computers you haven't
I'll tell you how many students can be
served at my university we have 35,000
computers and we have 28,000 students
that's a good mix it seems to work you
know at a university where they have
24,000 students and they want the
students to spend 10 hours a week on a
computer you're looking at eight
thousand computers so the face time is
important is FaceTime going to scale
using only new computers probably not
most institutions aren't going to be
able to afford that when we ship
refurbished computers there our partners
pay for the shipping 300 computers in
one cargo container and those cargo
those computers are worth twenty-five
dollars a piece and there are some
really different things that you can do
in deploying a $25 computer that you
can't do with an eight-hundred-dollar
computer so it just changes the dynamics
scaling information access and this is a
huge issue now I'm going to I'm going to
jump into some numbers and show you some
slides about the cost of the internet
but I don't know how many of you want to
operate 128k at home right but there are
universities who've literally have spent
years getting that kind of capacity for
their thousands of students it's so
expensive the average University in in
in Africa is paying a hundred and fifty
thousand dollars a year for a dedicated
one megabit connection just wicked
expensive those less that's not going to
scale and i'll be talking about the
granary digital library as one way that
we can scale information access and the
last thing to scale is human capacity
and you know we need a whole bunch
people just like you all over Africa
right we need to train tens of thousands
of young bright African people to be
able to do what you're doing here and as
you know if you go back and you recount
your education that was a lot of years
and a lot of money to get to you get you
to where you are today and we need to
start doing that in Africa it's not
going to scale in the same way that it
scales here because here we can do
things like charge people 25 thousand
dollars a year to go to college that's
that's not going to happen and
Africa so that's why we're working on
models to set up user groups and getting
people training each other and and
developing low cost high impact training
programs across Africa here's another
digital dope slap alright and if you've
heard of the One Laptop Per child
project alright this is a group of
people who actually know better but
aren't following through conscientiously
they're going into countries and saying
all you need to do is buy a million
laptops at one hundred million dollars
or actually two hundred million dollars
now and you'll be fine but every one of
them and every one of us knows that the
cost of maintaining a computer over five
years time right the technology is only
twenty-five percent thirty percent is
training people thirty percent is
staffing it so if we want to be honest
we would go into these countries and say
yeah one hundred million dollars were
the computers and expect to spend
another four hundred million dollars
keeping them working for the next five
years and all that is about human
capacity to support and run these
systems so have you seen this before
picture of the world at night all
stitched together and you know it does
this is one of my points the easy
networking has been done for about two
and a half two and a half trillion
dollars or something like that we've
done the easy networking all those lips
are networked and what we know internet
penetration in the u.s. is about 60 some
odd percent depending on who you talk to
okay we've essentially been able to
serve everybody who makes more than
thirty two thousand dollars a year and
if we look at internet penetration in
developing countries it's about the same
we've been able to serve everybody who
makes 32 thousand dollars a year all
right but if those dark places on these
on these pictures where the information
is needed the most where people are
dying every day because they can't get
access Istanbul information where
people's economies are suffering for the
lack of being able to communicate not
with you or me but with each other
Digital dope slap number three okay oh
but Wi-Fi and wimax is going to fix all
of that right I just brought this and
this is this is my little third world
country of Iowa all right and there's
the there's the telephone coverage map
the cell phone coverage map before Iowa
the deep orange means you're pretty
likely to get a connection everything
else means good luck right wireless is
great in some situations and but it
doesn't necessarily scale for data the
way we'd like it to this poster
demonstrates the size of Africa I don't
know if you've seen there's rumors going
around on the internet that Google is
going to wire up all of Africa now all
this started when Google provided some
free software to a telephone company in
Kenya but that rumor snow balled into
Google is going to wire a ball of Africa
look at that all of Europe all of the
United States all of China I say good
luck right that's not going to happen
it's going to be trillions of dollars
before we get to the point that these
areas are wired up the way we want we
would want them to be wired up and and
they've got a lot of other economic
pressures on them at this point that
don't prioritize putting in networks
this this graph shows internet use and
uptake over time and as here's the u.s.
climbing to close to sixty percent in
2005 in terms of household penetration
in middle-income countries around the
world ten to fifteen percent and that
would include India and then low-income
countries with the I think Tanzania at
the bottom there that you know two and a
half percent internet penetration again
if we look at this from one perspective
two and a half percent of the people in
Tanzania make thirty five thousand
dollars a year and they've been served
and there's this there's a great hope
amongst the economists and theoreticians
in the area that well actually this is
just going to be a slower curve but
pretty soon everybody there will be
connected hey I've been working in water
development since 1982 training people
in rural villages to drill deep wells
using ancient Chinese hand-powered
technology right in most countries even
though all this money has been spent and
all this interest has been has been
focused on improving water access around
the world most countries have seen
negative or no growth because they can't
even keep up with population growth so
is IT going to follow a different path
mmm don't think so what's really going
to change variety penetration if we keep
up with the same model is the economy's
growing to the point where people start
making 25 35 thousand dollars a year so
here are some is a map of Internet
connectivity costs there's a little
inset here of Europe where the first
number 378 indicates that 378 people per
thousand use the internet on a daily
basis and they spend two percent of the
average annual population or income for
there for there for the population
across Africa see we see completely
different numbers is just in Ethiopia
one person per thousand using
the internet and they're paying three
and a half times the average annual
salary to do that so you can imagine
who's you know who's connected right
these are these are folks from wealthy
families who who can afford to go and
spend a day's wage and I had for an
hour's worth of internet connectivity at
an internet cafe so the reality of the
cost is that's just freakishly expensive
and many of the institutions that I'm
working with I've visited 2420 no 26 now
universities in sub-saharan Africa and
every one of them are making remarkable
sacrifices to be connected to the
Internet and I don't want to embarrass
them in making this talk because it is
embarrassing for some 22 to be seen as
in adequately connected because some of
these people have risked their careers
some of them actually risked their lives
to put the money aside to get connected
to the Internet literally I talked to
one vice-chancellor of the University
this last year his university is a part
of a consortium that's getting cheaper
internet which means they're paying 100
thousand dollars a year for one megabit
instead of 150 but he wasn't paying his
bill and I said how come you're not
paying your bill and he said he said
well look here's here's what happens
that we don't have any money if I don't
pay my internet bill I'm going to be
embarrassed and in front of the
international community like I do
several times a month if I don't pay my
salary's I'm going to get killed and I
have a good friend at the University of
Johnson Nigeria who actually has a
machete cut in his forehead from raging
rampaging students during a particularly
hard time at the University these are
these are really serious issues for
people out in the field and there is a
there's the thing I call bandwidth
blackmail where those of us without any
we don't really understand their
situation we don't really understand
what they're going through you know we
say hey look you guys there's all this
really great free information on the
internet all you have to do is the most
expensive thing in your context pay rent
to some outside satellite company to get
access to that free information and and
there's a lot of big decision makers and
individuals here who adopt as
aristocratic attitude oh let them buy
bandwidth internet will fix everything
it's great for them right and that's
simply not the case so we have to we
have to adjust our thinking to think
about what it means even for us to what
we think is a common good common thing
let's just promote the internet but in
fact that is for some people a painful
alternative so here's a here's a
demonstration of a comparison between my
University of the University of Iowa and
amount ability university in Nigeria
both of us have for our local area
networks we have 100 megabits which
really fast ample bandwidth for
everybody outside the university of iowa
is a two gigabit connection to the
internet and still the students
complained that the movies take two
don't too long to download outside Amata
Bello has a two megabit connection
that's for common use around the
university okay one scary fact is that
both universities are paying essentially
the same amount
the other sobering fact is that at a
mountable University that's the
equivalent of 30 full-time professors
every year and you have to stop and ask
what are we getting out of a 2 megabit
connection that's worth 30 full-time
professors so in their context getting
connected the internet as blissful as it
sounds to us is a painful pain we do
speed tests you can come to the wider
net project website this little button
says test retest your bandwidth and
it'll you know download several sizes of
files and tell you how fast your
connection is so the first bar here is a
typical American University we're
testing what the users are experiencing
not what the university is purchased so
the students are downloading files from
our server at 17 megabits per second
typical company in the u.s. two and a
half megabits per second is what the
individual are experiencing we have
somebody from overseas here and then
home connections in the US and finally
connections from across Africa and I
just I just did last month's num
Randlett in last month's numbers and
again in unless we're talking about an
institution that has some special kind
of connectivity like an American Embassy
or something like that the connections
across Africa what people are
experiencing are still between the range
of 12 and 40 k not much you can do at
that speed the other problem is that
these connections are very unreliable
right so why we might get happy and say
hey two percent of the people in Malawi
are connected to the Internet if you
interview those people from Malawi and
say hey how's your internet they'll say
oh let me tell you stories right because
we do one set of testing where we ping
servers across Africa every 15 minutes
to see when they're up and when they're
down okay and very few of them are doing
24 by 7 service usually the technician
comes in at nine o'clock plugs
everything in because he can't trust the
National Grid to provide decent power
overnight so he plugs everything and
everybody starts using the system at one
o'clock there's a power outage
had three o'clock it's back on again we
get a few more hours out of it and then
everybody goes home right so very
unreliable in that sense and also
frequent lapses of a day or more I teach
a course simultaneously in Iowa and
Nigeria and my students Nigeria will
literally disappear from the radar for
weeks at a time you know modem gets
burnt on their satellite dish or
something like that and you know they're
off and so we have we have a young woman
in Nigeria who is helping to install eat
granny's around the country and she's
been keeping a log of what it means just
to have a daily conversation with us via
email right and sometimes she goes to
three or four different internet cafes
before she finds one that has adequate
bandwidth and electricity right and at
probably two days a week she's just not
even able to find one so it's quite
quite an experience so it's unreliable
so there's no teacher at any of these
universities who can say you know what
next Wednesday I'm going to have my
students do an online tutorial or watch
a video inconceivable one that would be
enough bandwidth and to that the
Internet is even going to be available
next Wednesday so this is what people
have to have to deal with even when they
are connected so this is why we came up
with this little box here the e granary
digital library a solution for for
delivering information it is a local
solution what we do here is we replace
bandwidth with store with we take
millions of documents with permission of
course from the internet put them in
this little box and deliver them inside
the local area networks of institutions
that we're working with so here they
have its millions of documents
maintained by librarians no pornography
knows no viruses nothing like that just
educational information we even avoid
popular culture so you can't get sports
scores from here but there no bandwidth
costs and it can be used with an
internet connection or alone but what it
does it means everybody on the local
area network has free and fast access to
everything in the
in this collection even when the
internet connection is broken we have
about 250 of these out in the field and
more than half of those installations
there is no internet at the institution
so right now we've gotten you know in
the last few years we've gotten
permission from 800 authors and
publishers we've got the whole Wikipedia
we've got wa chose website and and and a
bunch of others it's about to it's about
a 1200 websites and CDs that are served
up from this little box and that's ten
to the tens of thousands of full-length
books and journals and and virtually
anything you might find on the internet
except smut we have one of these in a
prison okay the prisoners are kind of
unhappy about the no smut thing but I
just tell them you know we can't find
any volunteers who know where to find it
so let me let me pop out of this for a
second and pop over to the granny I've
got one hooked up here we don't need no
stinkin internet no wires no wireless
this is just it so let's say we're
interested in a book we've done some
cataloging here because the first thing
happened when we take this out to the
field when our first prototypes all
these librarians who had never seen the
internet before looked at this and say
hey where are the books you know let me
ask you that question about the Internet
where are the books on the Internet
they're everywhere so we realized we
needed to put together interfaces that
would help them get to the information
they wanted faster so now we've we've so
we've done some some cataloging here but
let's see Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland click on a page it opens up
just like that and this is exactly what
it looks like out in the field that fast
we have videos how about my favorite
site will go to music and here's a group
called Mew topia they have sheet music
online so let's go for violin sonata
number three
and I can listen to it in a MIDI file i
can download in a PDF do you know what
PDF paranoia ok this is this is a
phenomena of people with behind them
slow connections you're browsing the
internet and you're waiting five minutes
for every page to download and then you
accidentally click on a PDF file what
happens you're 20 minutes or more
waiting for this file you're paying five
cents a minute ok and you can't hit the
back button and you can't hit cancel
you're stuck so you have to turn off
your machine and start over again so
people in Africa are very careful about
clicking on PDF files clicking on video
files all that I'm not going to be
nervous at all I'm just going to click
on this PDF file it'll take it probably
take more time for the computer to load
up Adobe Acrobat than the file itself
and now I've got the sheet music that I
can print out and start playing we have
this and I was just visiting with a
couple here from from from the Bay Area
who took one of these and installed it
as a secondary school in Nigeria last
year and if you go to their voices of
angels website you can here to see some
of the stories but the you know they
talk about how just utterly blown away
these kids were they had never seen
pictures of the world they had never
understand you know seen anything about
the cosmos or seasons or anything like
that and suddenly here they are freely
just clicking on buzz of things are
popping up right it is truly an electric
experience to watch people using this
for the first time and having this kind
of access to information the other thing
while the young boys wrote an email
saying he said we were given an
assignment to to do research on
evolution and he said you know that the
concept of evolution itself was
interesting enough but really what
really blew him away was that he found
tens of thousands of articles on
evolution that so many people had talked
about it from so many angles for so long
all this information that they had no
idea even existed right and right and
then it's all right there and his
fingertips so you don't know how to play
the violin but you're interested in
doing the violin sonata let's go to stay
pin
h to go to the violin site here's
everything to learn about violins will
go to violin lessons here and here's my
lesson for today there's my music here
is a button to press to watch my
instructor
loading up the video software
and it's pausing there we go now that
would have taken 20 minutes or more and
fit at the very few connected places in
Africa but here it pops up almost
instantly so we can deliver high-quality
educational information to anywhere on
the planet one less than one last
demonstration here we have people who
send us whole cds with software this is
stuff you can't get off the internet
because it's an executable file but the
greenery acts like a file server as well
so I'll click on bones of the skull and
this will say hey this is this is an
installable I say go ahead install it
and run it and it's a 250 megabyte
program it will open up just like that
and now I've got a text book that I can
wander through to learn about the bones
of the skull interact with the textbook
answer questions even pull up here has
got a demonstration raccoons goal for me
to play with take a minute to open up
the browser and there i've got a sky
Coon skull just like i can pick up one
of these skulls here and spin them
around and investigate them from any
angle when we showed this at the
university of liberia's medical school
where the students had a library of less
than 2,000 books right the students just
got up and sang and danced to see
something like this never seen anything
like it before so
go back to my presentation here and
two
sorry
press the wrong button there we go ok so
we've seen this slide before right okay
except now it's different now that first
bar is a secondary school on Mount
Kilimanjaro in Tanzania 50 miles away
from the nearest internet connection and
those kids are opening with playing
these with these documents five times
faster than the students at an American
University so the speed difference is
just radically different some people
like this because it's a curated
solution like I said we have it in a
prison here in the US right we have
parents contacting us who are home
schoolers who don't want their kids on
the internet because of all of the
dangers there but they want their kids
to have access to knowledge and in India
ran across some technical schools in
India that were concerned about you know
students wasting their time on the
internet but they were perfectly happy
to give them given this information so
it's a it provides some level of safety
for those who are concerned about that
there's something um here's an idea let
me break out here just a second and show
you when we talk about expanding it
there's all kinds of ways that that can
go but what we're finding is
I know a second I've got the wrong slide
show well I know what I'll do I'll mute
and run this one so how many of you
share your internet connection with your
neighbors
how many of you just sit up at your
internet connection up wireless let all
your neighbors use your internet
connection anybody why why it'll slow
you down and you're paying for it right
oh the granary right is there any way
somebody on a 54 megabit network is
going to overwhelm a SATA hard drive so
we got people out in the field not just
buying Wi-Fi why why max putting up a
tower and turning this into a public
library because they can share it with
anybody who can attach so one of the
concepts were working on is this whole
idea of building knowledge spheres local
knowledge spheres in which you know we
take the granary without already talked
about it's got all these wonderful
features and in it we put in you know
the 10 million plus educational
documents 20 million next year i'm sure
all kinds of local information
information from the local school
districts information from the local
governments if we went to the planes fly
where do the doctors work how much does
it cost to get from here to there right
all that information that people really
want to know local information we put
that all into the e granary and then
serve it up in the town now the typical
model for that is that you know we take
the granary and we put it on a local
area network so that everybody on the
local area network has free access
remember receipt now is the ability to
take this and stretch it out adding a
wimax backbone it'll serve people in a
five ten fifteen mile range all right
and then anybody underneath that
backbone who wants to connect they
connect to the wimax backbone turn
around and turn it and turn it into
Wi-Fi and deliver it to everybody in the
neighborhood so a curated collection
lots of local content and we can use any
kind of device to get connected to this
right so we're not getting married to
one particular piece of technology we're
still sticking with IP Wi-Fi the
standards
so we're looking at the ability to serve
tens of thousands of patrons with this
and the cost of the internet connection
well nothing so back to my other
presentation sorry that's definitely sir
this is like having a tiger by the tail
we came up with this idea because it
seemed really practical all right we've
grown into 250 installations now we have
big organizations like wh 0 and others
looking at using this and hundreds of
locations around the world we're looking
at a lot of people using it as an
adjunct to the internet librarians tell
us hey I can meet ninety-eight percent
or i can meet the needs of ninety-eight
percent of my patrons right here in this
little box now what's the least amount
of internet I have to buy to serve the
other two percent that puts them in a
position of power that they haven't
known before so it's just going in a lot
of directions is it's growing in a lot
of directions and we have a long list of
a hundred and fifty things that people
have asked us for you know can you make
it so that I can put my own local
Holdings you know from my library in
here can you make it so that we can
communicate via email locally but still
be able to go out can you make it so
that we can block hook it up to the
internet but block certain people are
certain types of uses so that we
preserve our bandwidth there's all kinds
of requests that people have brought to
us right and my job is to say yes right
because technically we can do all these
things logistic like ye that's a little
hard you know we're a nonprofit
organization out of a state university
so we live hand-to-mouth mostly students
and volunteers doing the work but we're
looking for people like you who can take
on one task or another and start to
build this because what we want to build
is a world-class information service in
a box that any poor institution in the
world can purchase pop in place and
immediately do whatever they do more
effectively
and we have to remember before the
internet millions and millions of
computers were sold there's a lot of
things that can be done with computers
and communication technology on local
area networks that make people effective
there are companies in the US with tens
of thousands of computers connected to
local area network but not one of them
can reach the internet because of
employee efficiency and effectiveness
and a number of other things so there
are there are a whole host of ways that
we can build access to information
access to mean communication in low-cost
ways in developing countries that will
serve their very critical information
needs so we're looking for partners
we're looking for people to help us to
help fund this to help participate and
writing the code to participate in
finding the content and getting the
information in there and in organizing
the content most of your interests
adventure and computers and computer
science and the like how about a google
google labeled portal in the e granary
for teaching computer science in
developing countries where you go
through the millions of documents that
are in the granary and pull together the
good ones right to make a curriculum
that teachers can deliver out of the box
all kinds of stuff can be done that way
i just got back from a trip to Ethiopia
and i got to tell you the the hard part
for me i would go out during during a
between breaks of doing our training
program and walk around the university
and it was you know that's a gorgeous
university in beautiful flora and fauna
and some of the most fantastic birds
I've ever seen in my life they look like
they were created by Pixar okay but to
stand there in the in the
and the shade of a tree and watch the
students Neander around and congregate
around the university there was like
being in any other university in the
world bright beautiful young people some
of them strutting for each other others
hiding behind their handbags right boys
showing off girls showing off everybody
chatting and carrying on it was it was a
picture that we've all seen a million
times but there was one thing missing
from this picture not one of those
students was carrying a book not one not
that they didn't want to be carrying a
book they're just no books to be had
so for somebody like that it is an
absolute miracle to sit down at an
internet or the e granary and click on
buttons and have information just pop up
and we've stumbled upon this idea a way
to make information available to the
majority seven out of eight people in
the world who don't have access to the
Internet and now we need to grow it and
appreciate your help your advice your
ideas and making that happen thank you
very much yeah
believe in access to
you're especially primary secondary
information library exactly
so have you actually thought about
collecting data
so
about the world is
that was getting
asian that
yeah Thoreau says that oh okay so the
question was we are identifying
different groups that that need access
to information but how are what are we
doing to make it more accessible to them
collecting local information
right right so the we're working with
the interesting thing is that what p in
a local communication local information
is the most critical that's one thing we
learned from the gsm revolution right is
it you know 70s and 80s if you go back
and read the hyperbole from the seven
and 80s about the telecommunications
revolution it was all about hey these
folks in africa need to call New York
and London and we need to be need to
create systems for them to do that well
it turns out that in fact once they got
gsm phones they're not calling New York
and London you know pull out your own
gsm who you talking to you know the last
10 calls more than most of them are
probably to your family or two friends
who are within a few miles right it's
that local information local
communication that's really important so
we're working with groups to they can
anybody creates a website can add it to
the e grin or if they know what they're
doing in just a few seconds right but
we're working with in fact we're in
negotiations with Intel right now to
help sponsor building a platform to make
it just incredibly easy for local people
to start plugging information in they
should be we don't want them to have to
reinvent the wheel so we're going to be
creating prototypes of you know if your
university these are the kinds of
information you know I'm building
content management systems in the
background so that people can just start
typing and adding information bliffil e
to the to the collection we find there's
a in the projects that we do we find
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit
there's a lot in the last ten years
people have produced documents in a
digital format but not in a web format
and so we work with them on getting
those converted quickly and put into the
granary whether the one thing we find
for sure is it when people see
themselves in this technology they get
really excited about it right so that's
when one of our our main focus is
getting that done so we're working on
coming up with more consistent and
easier ways for people to add their
content
to the dreary and one of the things we
offer them is that when they have
digitized their material if they want to
share it with the rest of the world will
host it on our web server at the
University and we'll put it into the e
granaries so they can share with others
who also have a granary and we're
talking with some government agencies
for example who who see this as a way to
get there their local content into the
hands of people in their own country
yeah
light language I get two questions that
how do we do with language and literacy
the the language in all the backend
stuff for the granary is unicode
compatible so we can we could we could
do any language like i said this has all
been done on on a shoestring budget
right so we've had to focus on the one
easiest language for us to do english
but it's you know it wouldn't take too
much money and too much time to make
other language versions of it and we
have integrated content and at the
language is already the literacy issues
there's a number of them in fact we're
working on mother projects in the prison
is about teaching reading the skills to
the prisoners in the first place so
there's a lot of things that can be done
with that but that's a well there's
several levels of literacy that we work
with teaching people to read is one we
can put the resources in there and make
it possible for teachers to teach
reading the other bit of literacy is
about information literacy right people
who've never seen the internet before
right I mean in 1996 most of my
colleagues were arguing against the
Internet well you know that's for geeks
you know but I don't need that at my
house yeah really and and for many
organizations getting the e granny for
the first time they're back in 1996 some
people love it some people think it's a
bad idea right and how do we get people
to shift their thinking and shift their
information access behaviors so they
start using this but one of the things
we can do with the granary far better
than we can do with the internet one of
the issues of information literacy is
being able to sift through you know go
through a hundred documents in an hour
and contrast and compare and come up
with the more pertinent information
right we can do that much more easily on
the granary than we can with the
internet because their people are
waiting 20 minutes to get one document
and then they get married take it home
introduce it to mom
yeah so there's a whole lot of issues
there but we see yourselves are the
enabling platform for people who are
working on building all kinds of
literacy yeah I used to set up in this
country since I've been away top this
time for us going online but one thing
that I realized precise local high
street was that much but the
communication was usually that yahoo
lots of those service got here whenever
hmm so whenever i want to say the plane
that was tardy again that email both
hero to a cabin across the street so one
we hope you're brave realizes that's a
very important to keep local content
block out yeah this week I'll concept
now and you're broke I mean what
individuals within Africa same doing the
practice issues that you are saying if
you think a saber right now is it after
look Alex and not of milliseconds to
convention but if you're someone is
about that you knew someone maybe it's
bubbles here
that's it so I hope that this is quite
useful movie says for know how ping law
right that way instance someone send an
email and said why is pretty good it's
not happening another first he doesn't
want to do yeah if they were
echolocation points in Africa when
that's in each other in Africa you know
you right what's better so she broke up
under this you're safe and if we're
talking about making people really
effective and making their life safer
making them more efficient all that an
email you know most email their most of
my colleagues at universities across
Africa don't know the address of the guy
in the room next door right because
everybody's got you know disparate
accounts on disparate systems and
there's no directory right so they can
they can communicate more blissfully
with somebody in Europe or America than
they can with somebody in their own
institution right but we know we do the
analysis of email boxes unplug them at
most major institutions ninety percent
up to ninety percent of the
communication is internal right inside
the home email system and and so we can
make them ninety percent effective just
by putting local email there and of
course we do some bandwidth analysis go
and plug in our laptop and kept your
capture every packet and look in some
places fifty percent of the bandwidth is
just email because people are going out
to some server overseas where a 4k
message becomes 150 k of dancing
advertisement right and and that's
really inefficient and expensive so yeah
a lot of things we can do building local
applications on local servers and then
making the distinction making it making
it really easy for you know when they
run out of information in their local
thing to for just slip out to the
internet and get exactly what they need
at a low cost a question back here
what's that how much does one of these
flowers clashes the library costs to
university too little okay and I this is
a weird thing because we set up a bad
cop-bad a bad business model that we're
just we're wrestling with we made agree
made a deal with the UH with the authors
and publishers and this is how we get so
much participation that we're not going
to charge people for their content and
boy if I could sell it once I'd be a
millionaire because there's some great
content in here right so what we sell is
logistics of getting the drive prepared
and shipped out all that so seven
hundred and fifty dollars for a 750
gigabyte hard drive that's dollar a gig
okay and we have a server version which
can serve thousands of people on a local
area network for twenty eight hundred
dollars so as you can imagine you in
fact in most countries where we have the
e granary you can't buy these two
devices blank for that amount of money
so how often do we update how much money
do you have
and I this is this is this is like the
most intriguing question right and this
is my own big dope slap okay when I
first started this program it was all I
it all hinged on being able to update
this information out in the field so we
spent years writing an update mechanism
a new protocol for updating machines
that aren't even connected to the
Internet okay and it works marvelously
you give us your website you tell us
every year you update it really about
once a month so once a month we check
our coffee against your copy we find the
differences we add all kinds of metadata
we index it against a large index and
then we packetized everything to go out
the door how it gets from here to there
doesn't matter internet intermittent
internet cd-rom DVD we've even used
digital radio world space radio to
broadcast changes okay so and then you
know somebody can download it from the
internet put it on CDs and circulated
around their country you know we've got
we got all that stuff figured out okay
so here's the wacky part 250
installations in the world only six
people are paying for updates so some
lessons I took away from this right and
I just are walking around my university
being the bore opening up people's
textbooks and oh yeah this book is five
years old right educational information
doesn't change that much and for most
people out in the field it makes more
sense for them to say okay we can serve
like I said before ninety-eight percent
of the people in our heart of in our
school with this information and some
people need the most precise and you
know most current information well they
use the internet so we have an update
mechanism some people are using it but
the critical pneus of that information
being fresh has I've learned over time
is not as important as I thought it it
once was a year old Wikipedia is still
pretty cool and the librarian sees these
are these people are sharp and they
don't have any money it's a lot of the
librarian say hey you know what that
hard drive is going to die in five years
in five years old by another one and I
get all my updates for free you had a
question okay
the r is equal
natural
there
that's custom first question second
question is how do you choose your
concept is it is a food basically
depending on people what your moxie or
is it
who wants to buy content right okay so
two questions the first I'm sorry the
first the first being oh yeah how can we
turn this into a profit-making or at
least a cost recovery organization and
the second one being what's our what's
our policy for getting how do we get the
content so the we have a business plan
that has us you know beings copacetic in
five years but it involves people buying
services from us and it's not it's not
inconceivable we just got a grant from
one group to create a portal for
violence and injury prevention and
agricultural settings right so we get
our students to work on pulling
information together they gathered
volunteers to get to work on the project
and and that's really where we see our
us making money is actually building
more services and doing the research and
development for this we have started
with identifying young IT savvy people
in the countries that were working in to
do the installations right and where
we've come up with a social
entrepreneurial model for them to make a
good living but one that's above board
where everybody understands who's
getting paid what so that they do all
the field support and installations so
we're working on building those models
there's a chance we might have to raise
the price of the granary to cover more
of the development costs and I think
part of our problem right now is simply
that we've just been unlucky in grant
applications than last year when we did
the project in Ethiopia where we went
and we sent three hundred computers we
trained a whole bunch of technicians
they paid for all that to be done right
and that's that's really what we need is
more people saying this is a valuable
thing for us and we willing to pay you
know to have it done but you know I'm a
fuzzy-headed professor I have a new idea
that's really going to work I have a lot
of colleagues around me who understand
business better who are constantly
throwing their hands up in the air about
about my ideas so I'd love to it was
that yeah
yeah well you know we've talked with
people at the NSF and they said oh
that's interesting but you know and
sometimes what I'm really finding now is
that there's a there's a really keen
internet centricity to a lot of people's
planning because it is actually glorious
vision and I would love to see it happen
I'd love to see everybody in the world
have broadband right that would be
wonderful and so there's a lot of people
still hanging on to this hope right I'm
on my internet buzz kill tour saying no
that's not going to happen at least not
for the next couple generations we have
to come up with something else now but
there's still a lot of people holding on
to this idea that somehow the internet
is going to catch on when we were doing
market growth stuff in the last 10 years
here in the US we were trying to
convince people who had money that it
was worth spending their money to be on
the internet right but this is a
completely different kind of equation
that we're working with the developing
countries are people who have no money
and are lacking in a lot of things right
and can try to convince them to be on
the internet is almost mean so what I'm
finding is a lot of organizations i'm
working with i have to go out and they
have to try the internet and after
they've tried the internet then they
come back and they say okay what's the
next best thing and so that's that's
where we are right now in terms of
gathering content we do a lot of low
hanging fruit stuff looking for creative
commons open source public domain kinds
of material we have the we have a ton of
music material tons of linguistics
material just because we've had
volunteers who are interested in those
subjects going out and doing that a lot
of water development because that's what
i'm into you know a lot of computer
science stuff and then a huge amount of
medicine and public health and that's
really that's where our volunteers have
been interested but anybody get sent an
email to a librarian at wider net org
with a request and we'll try to find
volunteers to go out and get that
material and i want to show you one
other thing that we're doing here is
that we're building portals this is a
really interesting lesson went to Uganda
confused back met with some teachers
gave him a demonstration of the e
granary and they said wow that's
fantastic we don't need it
and so most of development is really
about listening so spend some time with
them and what they said is you know
there's too few teachers there's too
many students too many of their
colleagues have died of AIDS and the
government all they can hope to do is
train students to the national exam so
they might some small percentage of them
might pass the exam and get into college
and so that's all they focused on they
said we're teachers we don't make
curriculum somebody like most teachers
in the world somebody makes curriculum
they give it to us we decorate it and
deliver it right so so we had a graduate
students spend some time with them the
following summer and now we have
volunteers working on creating a portal
and this is where I think it this is
this is where the magic happens here
what we've done is we've taken the
ugandan oh and a level curriculum and
turned it into a hypertext menu and this
is something that teaches this is a
paradigm the teachers are really
interests they're really familiar with
and as we go down through the through
the curriculum and get to the end points
there are links for them to click on
that will take them to resources that
they can use to teach that concept right
in their classrooms so we make it really
easy for the teachers to drill down and
we're developing a whole host of portals
as people come to us with them here's my
water portal
jeju-do pantops drilling with links to
you know it's a bird's-eye view of a
thousand websites you know for people
with specific interests and we're
finding this is having a bigger impact
in the field we have a search I'd show
it to you but it's kind of embarrassing
cuz I'm at Google but we're finding the
portals are more used in the search
engine because you know for the further
people who fit that profile question bay
yeah sure you bet yeah we have we have
our search engine is based on this scene
you know Java up front we do a lot of
little customizations with it like
trying to make local content rice to the
top of the list faster you know those
sorts of things but again it has all
been done by students and volunteers so
you know it's it's a it's quaint okay
and it works but it could definitely be
improved
thank you for Graham thank you
