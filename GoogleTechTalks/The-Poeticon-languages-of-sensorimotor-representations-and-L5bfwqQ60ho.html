professor yiannis aluminous from the
University of Maryland at College Park
yiannis was my former advisor and he's
the director of the computer vision
laboratory at Maryland and he's
well-known in the vision community for
his work on active vision and his
discovery of the tri linear constraints
in multi-view geometry and a lot of his
work on omni directional cameras motion
estimation many things among others so
over the last few years Janice has been
very interested in creating linguistic
representations of human actions in the
various places like the Moto space or
the visual space and of course the
natural language space so he's so that
so today's talk is going to be pretty
much about his work on modeling actions
before I hand it over to you on is one
little note so anybody who wants to ask
questions if you could please ask them
at the mic over there and they'll get
recorded for for the video so thanks
would be honest hey thank you very much
a budget I must tell you after a budget
left Marilyn we have been suffering we
still haven't recovered this is the
truth it is really it's a real pleasure
to be in this google land and my
research has been envisioned for the
most part but I I have been interested
in theories of the mind in general
intelligence for a long time and when I
decided to come here and speak to you
guys I thought that it would be more
interesting if I speak to you about
something that is in your future
business and by that I mean meaning
meaning because right now Google is
doing an amazing job of finding
information by imagine a with
a and B with me you cannot really go
into the meaning of the texts that are
around because the community is very far
from melee so the title of this talk has
is an introduction to the poetic on the
poetic on is the name of a project that
is funded by the European Union where I
participate with a number of
universities and Institute's raising
from the Max Planck Institute in Germany
to the Italian Institute of Technology
where they develop humanoid robots so
let me start very quickly with a
preamble so that I don't get you don't
get lost and then I have something for
computer scientists something for
engineers and physicists and something
for the cognitive scientists and by the
way I'm very happy to have in the
audience professor Tom Dean who is one
of my co-authors we have caught or the
textbook in artificial intelligence
which still sells if I say Tom ran to
the store you understand it well how do
you understand tom ok not so important
Tom store how do you understand line
what does it mean to run you're going to
go to your lexicon are you going to look
it up so you realize that ran is from
this run and if you look it up you find
move with quick steps faster than
working then if you have to deal now
with move you have to deal with watching
you have to do with the rest but let's
concentrate on these guys and then well
how about walk what is walk you look
this up to
walk is to move by putting forward its
foot in turn not having both feet off
the ground at once pretty amazing
definition and so on now you realize
that we are in trouble already big
trouble however you also realize that
you don't need anybody to tell you what
run is why because you have run you have
seen other people we have seen other
people and you have run yourself you
know what it means to run you have
sensory motor experiences of Frankie you
remember it and you know what it means
as a matter of fact if I ask you to give
me a definition of walking on Ryan you
can have trouble cuz you never thought
about it because you have a intimate
understanding of this actions so that's
what I'm going to talk to you about that
you can take the lexicon which is what
the linguists have made after thousands
of years and you can augment it you
cannot Lance it you can enhance it you
can make it very powerful how by putting
inside it things like run but ran like
in another space you're going to put a
representation of ranking that involves
vision or involves your muscles your
motor system
now as I said before it has to do with
your ability to remember sensorimotor
representations now the sensorimotor
representations the sensorimotor
experiences are things that today we can
measure how well it depends what you
want to measure I'll tell you what we
are measuring we have these suits now we
get a better one that this gives you
what the graphics and animation people
call motion capture it gives you a
sequence of their joint angles over time
and then we're using that you can
produce a movie now this is not exactly
muscles but it's very close to it you
could measure muscles it's going to be
much more expensive and much more
complicated but if you have motion
capture data and you have a humanoid
robot to you an idea you can program the
controllers to move the robot in such a
way so that its motion is like the
motion capture data so motion-capture
data is not optimal that is good at this
stage then you can also get the images
that you see and also you can use
tracking devices so that you can know
where you look inside those images you
can also put our sensors in the hands so
that you can have touch and then this is
what the philosophers and cognitive
scientists have referred to as grounding
grounded meaning to connect symbols
language with the sensorimotor
structures it's like the first step
towards grounding
now let us say I'm looking at someone
doing something and I understand it like
I see somebody walk I understand this
that's because I possess visual
representations that allow me to proceed
to such understanding but at the same
time I can myself perform an action I
can see you working I can walk myself I
can see you jumping icons up myself
don't give me examples about paraplegics
now that are looking at actions and they
understand them we can deal with that
later okay but also i can say walk now
this this and that are the same thing
and action but this is in one kind of
space that people have been standing for
a few thousand years this is another
kind of space that people have been
studied for 30 40 years and same thing
this is another kind of trade is the
space of the motors the muscles this is
the visual space this is the language
base ok now the linguists have told us
that there exists structure in language
in natural language we are not hundred
percent sure about exactly what the
structure is but because the general
named grammar of some sort this grammar
in language now can you imagine having a
grammar for this space and having a
grammar for that space that would be
very cool you know why because since
this is the same thing what you need is
you need translation mechanisms to go
from one space to the other and you got
to do this very fast too
and if I have a language that describes
this space and I have a language that
describes that space since here i have a
language then I would be able to go from
one language to the other if I can
translate
the mirror neurons is one of the biggest
discoveries of our times in my view it
happened about 15 years ago by accident
the mirror neurons are neurons actually
one of the problems that they have is
that they have the wrong name they gave
them the name mirror neurons what are
the mirror neurons they were discovered
in the lab of giacomo rizzolatti in
Parma in Italy and one of his students
at the time was Luciano fadiga with whom
will collaborate in the political
project he is now a professor at the
University of Ferrara in Italy mirren
arose a nurse in a monkey they are also
in a human but they were originally they
are in primates in general discovered in
a monkey and these neurons they have the
following property they are active
whether the animal is performing a task
or whether the animal is watching
somebody else perform the same task do
you see the difference in other words
whether the input is coming from the
visual system or the input is coming
from the motor system that neuron is
going to be active and is going to say
good asp grasp and i don't care if this
is visual grasp that I see somebody
grasping or if I grass myself this is
grasped abstract so what the monkey is
doing the monkey is having abstract
representations of action because that
neuron or that cluster of neurons that
represents grasping it has pointers to
the visual grasp and has pointed to the
motoric clasp so anyway
what this means let me give you another
example it may be relevant to you the
community of computer vision is trying
to recognize few months in action video
from video it's the big bladder problem
you have videos and you want to find out
what people are doing and the community
is doing only one thing they are
basically tracking they are looking at
the problem as a visual problem and they
are trying to track every part of the
moving human hoping that that's how they
will understand what he is doing but
what the mirror neuron story is telling
us with hundreds of other experiments
that I cannot go through here is telling
us that when you the human when you
recognize somebody else doing something
you do so because of an internal act
that recaptures the essence which means
when you see the movements you transfer
this to your own coordinate system and
then in your mind you can you do the
same thing that this other person is
doing but in your mind you imagine it
you think about it what does that mean
to think about an action an action is
movement of the limbs goals changing
things etc but one of the important
discoveries in cognitive neuroscience
over the past 30 years has been the fact
that we have representations for action
that are such that we can think about
them without actually performing the
action this is very important because if
we have a hierarchical framework that we
have a hierarchical structure to
represent human action then that
hierarchical structure basically lends
itself naturally to thinking about that
action at different levels like at a
high level when you are at the lives of
that tree
then you have the actual stuff when you
are at the top you are obstructing the
same way that you do with sentences in
language so the basic this is that we
formulated a few years ago and a budget
was part of this and some of these ideas
actually originated from him that
actions are characterized by a language
it's a new language that has its own
phonemes it's all more themes and its
own syntax well you know it doesn't take
long to realize that speech and human
action are very similar to each other
they both have a generative and airy
cognitive component you can speak and I
understand what you say but I can speak
to you can do an action and I understand
what you did but I can do it too these
things are parallel to each other so the
hope is that we can use technology that
has been developed for speeds for this
problem either in a thematic sense here
or not this is an action absolutely
speech is an action this is something
that happens because you move your
tongue and your mouth in a particular
way and I have some interesting news to
tell you if I forget please remind me
regarding this
so and then you know the project
political studies meaning as imagined
from the integration of different types
of representations that prefer to the
same entity and the integration
representations that refer to different
entities but collaborate in forming
concepts at different levels of
abstraction so when we talk about
actions there are many things involved
raising from intentions goals movement
objects and so on there is a very less
amount of literature in psychology
cognitive neuroscience robotics recently
and people have offered lots of the
interesting theories like schemas
Michael R Beebe functions models and so
on now before I tell you what we'll try
to do is let me give you just give you
the action representation sort of unit
the intention inverse model a ferris
copy when the brain sends a signal for
you to do a movement that signal not
only go to the course to the appropriate
place so that the movement can be
executed but the copy is kept it's
called the pharons copy it's pretty
interesting why would you say that a cop
is kept a copy is kept so that the
system can do the internal simulation
because up to now up to now the movement
hasn't happened you have the intention
then you have the affair ins copy and
you can go use a forward model and
predicted feedback and this is the
simulation internally of the action you
can keep doing this as long as you want
but then boom you can do the movement
and now you can start getting actually
sensory feedback which you can put
compared with this now it would be nice
if can have mathematical framework that
uses this thing as a unit well that's
too hard so what we will do is we will
concentrate on the movement will
concentrate on the human movement and we
will attempt to build a language out of
it
so that we can have a language that
describes any kind of movement that
would be alcohol we are still not there
yet but that will be our goal and what
would we do how would we approach this
well the word that we are using is I get
something I don't know if you are using
this word probably you don't but that's
what you do this hyper empiricism using
gargantuan amounts of data that either
exists or that you can collect fast this
is what hyper empiricism is and this is
the poetic on consortium ok and of
course there is all these basic
questions in cognition on like for
example how is what is a concept to the
particulars of perceptual and motor
systems play a role in concept
definition let me diverse a little bit
because now that we are trying to build
this we are coming close to the
difficulty of what a concept is what's a
concept when I say to you Apple what is
happening what is going on in your mind
or if your system your artificial system
understands Apple how does it too so is
there some kind of a predicate logical
representation says Apple safe route has
this color it has this that what do you
think what is an apple for you you don't
really know we don't know but it's a big
problem it's a very big problem my
students are refusing to consider that
there is a representation for Apple that
is there they say no what you can do is
you have sensory motor experiences of
apples you see an apple now and Apple
later
see lots of apples you touch them you
smell them you eat them you taste them
all these arts experiences sensorimotor
that you have with apples if you collect
all of them which means you have to have
this amazing capability every time you
have a sensory motor experience of an
apple to go and put it on the right
place yeah the physical abuse of soul
and where how would I say how do you
feel it on its own soul yeah okay your
colita is trying to create problems for
my simple framework before it even
started by going to the so-called
abstract words okay we're going to deal
with abstract was later if we can deal
with apples then we'll go for the
abstract things if you could see the
children that as they grow takes them a
long time to understand what Saul is
actually I still don't know myself so
what is the point or some kind of a
thematic scheme here is that we could
achieve artificial intelligence that has
been our dream through measuring human
behavior because by collecting all these
characteristics from a behaving human
through this high / AP racism idea you
could learn a very large number of
things that we were not able to learn
before now you may say why humans if I
have an intelligent system that is
different but remember the intelligence
systems of the future will have to share
some conceptual set with us we have to
mean similar things if we are if we are
to make progress
okay so now i'll show you an example of
a language that we call Hal that was the
thesis of my student Gutenberg Guerra
who is now a professor at the University
of Texas very quickly an example on
language grounding if you read if what
does that mean they'll escort the most
beautiful goal against we did in the
nineteen fifty eight World Cup final and
now what pelle number ten always the
master and the scorer of goal number
three all right okay so for the next ten
minutes or so i'll show you how from
data you can get to what we call hal hal
stands for human activity language and
we have various ways of capturing this
data to hear some examples that are done
optically so that you can develop these
models lipids amp over that now this is
what I was telling you before and this
is some good news in the sense that as
we study this problem if we don't manage
to get what we want or if it doesn't
come soon in the way we are solving
problems that are at the heart of
today's technology many industries and
many may entities are interested for
like controlling robots with natural
language or annotating video so since we
go for a language what we have to do if
you study linguistics and I have to
admit that I'm an accidental linguist
myself if you study linguistics then you
find out that linguistics is
for the most part about three things
what is called phonology morphology and
syntax and there is of course I'm antics
and pragmatics and so on but morphology
has to do with how you get going to the
signal and pull out I mean phonology you
pull out the phonemes or the primitives
that exist well it's not clear what the
phonemes are in speeds from what I read
but people have been making a lot of
progress in this problem now we're not
going to have phonology because we don't
have speeds we're going to have kaneto
lousy but you know at all of the amounts
to find in primitives inside morphology
we'll have to we will be the set of
rules that will take these primitives
have put them together in two morphemes
or words and syntax will be the set of
rules that will take these more themes
and put them together into something
that makes sense now this is the data
from the suit here what you have is
joints like abdomen fitne etc and here
you have time and in every row you have
at most three angles that is the
representation of an angle this is the
motion cups of data as the angle changes
over time basically this tells you what
the body is doing and you can already
see that it doesn't look hopeless
because you have a lot of food
correlation and look at that you have
these columns and we may need things
make what happens in one joint happens
similar things happen in other joints
that's one observation okay
now imagine that you are an
archaeologist and you find the populace
which is like this and it is four miles
this way and then you say you know this
is this is text in a language you got to
find what the language is it's a
learning in kind of problem grammatical
induction techniques exist in the
literature where you can give them
examples from things in a language and
they will try to come up with a grammar
for the language there are simple
techniques very powerful and they are
very sophisticated techniques as well
and what we have done is not optimal but
it makes the point so just like in
linguistics you know you have you have
any you have an interface between
phonology and morphology you have here
too in other words this process is not
one two three I do my phonology then i
do my morphology and then i do my syntax
and i'm done because they are happening
together and they are influencing each
other so let's see so this is a examples
from data like the right angle okay and
it's a very simple way of making this
data discreet with of course all the
difficulties that come afterwards but
anyway this will give you the idea now
you can take this data and look at the
derivatives we painted the derivative
the place is where the derivative first
and second derivative are positive or
negative so you have four cases four
colors doesn't look too good here but
this is a viable skin let's say this is
a simpler one if the function goes up
you make it blue if it goes down you
make it red now this happened down it is
not this wouldn't work for any kind of
signal
here it has a mini up means the angle is
increasing down is decreasing it has a
physical meaning they're going up and
coming down as a physical meaning okay
has a physical me closing opening so
what you can do then is you can turn
your signal into these rectangles the
blue and red rectangles where one of the
dimensions is time and the other is the
difference in angle okay and these are
going to be basically your phonemes so
in other words you take your initial
data and you turn it into what you can
call an ox ox on gram which basically
every row has become a string now you
feel more comfortable if you are a
computer scientist because you have
strings now this is the computer science
domain and they think is if you are able
to discover structure along its row
that's good and if you are able to
discover structure between roles that's
good so you're going to have two kinds
of structures this representation has
interesting properties like
reproducibility this is a database from
NIH these are workers and you can see
that that the the sequence of phonemes
for this joint this is one join over
time it's the same these are different
people except this one with key
selectivity you have to have selectivity
properties like the one work should be
different than run this will be
different than John okay this is another
example from a database actually you
know we have we have about a thousand
actions that we have collected that are
annotated like seed run heat tons
and we have lots of hours of
unrestricted free behavior but there are
other databases to which we try to
capitalize on like one from Carnegie
Mellon this is the joint hip for working
and these are the numbers correspond to
different subjects in the database and
you can see the ultimate goal that we
have this is a very similar experiment
is to so basically these are the key no
teams let me give you this so that you
can get a oops so this is 1 this is
another one this is another one this is
another one so in other words if you
take that data and you get your
rectangles the blue and rectangles this
is what they will correspond to so you
have to solve the symbolization problem
because when you go to the data and
you're going to get this rectangle this
guy you know it's not going to be
exactly the same like this guy all right
like that one they will have differences
and then you have to perform some
interesting pattern recognition
techniques here what Gutenberg used was
hierarchical clustering and you have to
end up with you know saying this is the
same thing like this so here we put
letters to denote that these are
specific Tina teams ok and you know now
you can do this technique where you can
build this grammar will show it as a 3
here by going through the data and I
don't remember actually the name of the
string of you probably know if you have
two symbols that one of them is after
the other and this keeps repeating now
you can take this two symbols and
replace them by another one Thank You
point
there are interesting properties in the
compression that are not so important
here is our morphological experiments
that I'll go through quickly now let me
give you this example from parallel
ready here's one joint here's another
joint not only we have to get a grammar
here and there but we also have to find
out when things in different joints
happen at the same time because that's
very important these are the so-called
synergies so so here is the execution of
the algorithm and after some after they
at some point we start introducing nodes
for rules for variables that are
happening at the same time in the two
different joints now you have to realize
you have to understand that something
like that is going to be happening for
all for all the joints it's very
difficult to show but you built this
structure that is basically telling you
about the rules that are executed at the
same time in the different joints let me
show you quickly and more for syntactic
experiment this is see this bowl this
one of our action called bow here is
Kelsey crowds kick kick wall Neal limp
let's and so on and this is one join the
data for one join and now what we can do
is we can induce a grammar for that
joint out of all the actions the basic
point is that all the things that human
beings do they have components that are
very similar to each other this is where
the grammar is coming out okay and you
can see this in the trees this is one
rule don't worry about the fact that
this is a be
fatter than this this is for the scale
so that things can fit in the same page
but this is the application of the rule
the blue guy and now another rule and
the red rule and so on and we keep going
and as we keep going we keep building
this what comes out is they are boreal
structure of the human movement because
you have parts in different I mean you
have sub sub graphs sub trees in the
different verbs that are the same syntax
well this is what sort of blends in
linguistics class but in our business
here and now is either a body part or an
object a verb is the action an adjective
which basically modifies a noun is a
posture this is an objective for my hand
it's another objective for my hand
adverbs that are the most interesting
adverbs they modify the verbs so I can
walk I can evoke a sidewalk can walk a
happy wok can work in many different
ways all these different characteristics
that i have the specifics they are
adverbial information now the syntax
here is more complicated because you
have parallels in tax because you can
walk and wave is that two actions or and
you have sequential syntax where you do
an action one action after the other so
if you have parallel actions you cannot
do them if they share essential
actuators if they don't you can do them
now adverbs obvious is a very
complicated topic very hard
maybe I go through and come back later
parallel syntax is interesting because
out of the database you can build this
this map here you have the joint here
you have the actions these are verbs
here I'm sorry that they couldn't make
them bigger but every column has a 0 or
a 1 depending on whether the the
particular this piece of the particular
joint participates in the action so by
having the structure now you can do
interesting graph a unifying
subcomponents clicks various kinds of
aspects and find thinks that you
basically can perform in parallel
because they don't say actuators for
sequential syntax in order to go from
one to the other in the joint from one
action to the other you have to have the
appropriate kinna team like if I have
these two actions and I put them
together because they don't sell
essential actuators it's one of these
guys is an actuator as you see this is
easy to do but if I have let's say the
situation where I say these actuators
and I want to put them together now you
see I have be I can do it sobe will be
my transition point and I can start with
this one or the all 0 and jump to be
then go to X Y or this s etc and I can
go from here to there and then up or
down depending i can mix the actions
this is so this is a word now it's a
little actually I know this is not the
best language but at least it's a
language so basically the way to show it
is these are all the joints and these
are the grammars on the joints
but I wouldn't solve the stuff that is
inside here the simultaneity okay now
let me show you quickly something that
is basically following this is work and
it's based again on the ideas of my
friend a bit seat where what you would
like to have is you would like to have a
grammar of motion synergies what's this
energy like as you sit don't change put
up a little bit your right leg and start
rotating start rotating the food
clockwise and now as you do that as you
do that with your right hand try to
write the number six in the air you
cannot do it it's just kind of do it try
all day you will not do it why because
this synergy does not belong to your
repertoire don't do that kind of stuff
now the brain cannot generate a large
number of independent control movements
you cannot do that that's why we cannot
juggle you need to be a special guy to
be a juggler so after a lot of learning
of course a lot of effort you get to it
but it cannot so all these complex
motions that you do when you perform
actions is basically very simple the
brain has figured out a way to do that
so somehow
we have to develop a grammar of motion
synergies of these things and I you have
to see what the synergy is now if you
have such a grammar it would generate a
string of control symbols and then
applying in mechanism who put them
together and finally you will get some
coordinated kind of signal that you will
put into the particular efectos and the
cool thing about this which I think this
this is I have very high hopes for this
letting an experiment is you can do the
same thing you don't have to put this on
the actuators you can put them on
another space and in this case or any
much so that you can learn the
appearance of action and you can also do
to two things things in parallel and you
know they're you also have the the
property of the motor equivalence
because I can do this with my two
fingers I can also do it with my lips
same action different efectos so so the
idea would be to start with joint angle
data develop the synergies get the
control functions built the grammar so
let me go you show you an example this
is myself it's myself right where i'm
stationed are you jogging and i am
trying to move my hand like this in a
different frequency than my jogging you
know difficult to do you may you may
manage to so this is my data the joint
angles over time from the suit and this
is a similarity matrix okay so basically
what are we going to do every row is a
1d function
okay and a synergy is a set of roles
where this 1d functions are spectrally
similar if you look at these functions
they have the same spectral content it
seems a very similar you saw them in the
previous example so then how you going
to discover them one way is to you know
multiply their four-year Fourier
transforms okay you basically compute
the similarity matrix actually that's
like came before so I where was it yeah
here so when you have these angles
actually there's a an arrow here on this
but you can compute this if si and SJ r
2 of the series then you can compute the
similarity matrix replace hear this this
guy's would say for your transforms so
so what we can do is we can do this and
develop the similarity matrix and after
you do that you find you have three
groups the dark blue which is not moving
the red which is group one my jogging
and the green which is group to my
rubbing yes
these joint angles to assume yeah you
should have that you should have that
and I'll tell you later in the third
reincarnation of this how this is taken
care of but not here so this is group
one of the synergy and these are the
movements now
what does it mean it means that all
these functions are very similar to each
other that's what it means very very
similar so what we would like to do is
find one function that can generate them
all one function that can generate the
mall by changing a few parameters every
time okay and so that's that function
that's that function which basically
amounts to this wavelet that will be our
control symbol this is the other synergy
with the movements and this is the other
wavelet let me summarize your grammar is
going to put out control symbols these
are these guys okay out of this control
symbols you're going to make these
functions now this function can put it
can produce every function in the
synergy with this rule for example here
where you have parameters translation
scale amplitude this is shift out of
this control simple and you can get this
function these are of course always
approximations and now after you have
that your coordination mechanism is
going to give it to the appropriate
joins so that has a very big number of
advantages and well I'm getting premacy
okay I guess I got to hurry now out of
400 actions by cross correlating every
joint in any action with any other join
in any other action you get something
like 13,000 vectors now if you do a pca
of this space you're going to find about
500 miles
that's pretty amazing we cannot use it
yet it says says that the things are
very much related to each other and the
dimensionality is very low ok this is
the next thing that we're going to do
this you can buy this is a company that
actually you can rent it it's a it's a
model of Stanley Stanley is a 56 year
old male in California well maybe he's
around here somewhere that and it's it's
a model these guys are muscles so this
is a muscle skeletal model of a human
where they have measured all the masses
and a very large number of parameters so
if I have motion capture data I can get
that guy to do all these motions and now
you can attempt to find a grammatical
framework that relates the muscles
because this much I mean you have now it
would evolve forces because you have to
pull the muscles but it would be much
more realistic and generative this is
pretty good actually physical simulation
pretty amazing ok so now as we coming to
the end I'm going to tell you about
semantics little bit a little bit about
semantics and especially since my friend
Tom did is here i'll check the
opportunity because i have a number of
questions maybe he can give me his
wisdom well semantics has is related to
purpose and intentions you know there's
so much literature on these topics and i
won't go for it
okay here is to remind you about the
development of the praxic on through
these experiments and now I want to get
to this big experiment that we are
planning but we are very careful because
we are not one hundred percent sure of
how this is going to work out and you
will understand what I mean because it
has to do with how we learn the
conceptual system because if you look at
children and observe them although that
literature doesn't have too many results
the children learn some things before
they learn other things so if I have a
system and I want to teach it the
conceptual system I am I going to do I'm
going to give everything at once or do I
have to do it in stages anyway the
ground in experiment you have actions
whether actions actions are verbs where
do you find them you find them in the
lexicon in the dictionary they are there
as a matter of fact beyond the
dictionary now we have we have the
warden it I don't know how familiar you
are with it we have the frame net which
is like the word net on steroids as they
say that has much richer descriptions
and many models of actions but what you
have is Tris basically because of the
higher ethical notion of planning that
that we already know we understand that
now down here in the bottom layer you
have sensory model data and what you
want to do is you you want to make sure
that you have a path from these guys at
the top to some guy at the bottom if you
have a path then you have grounded this
thing if you don't have a path you
haven't grounded it you may have some
understanding of it like we have for
liberty and freedom and passion and love
but this is not the same understanding
that we have about apples and hands and
tongues
so we have given the little title of
behavioral experiment this just locally
just for ourselves to to communicate
with each other but the idea is that you
can imagine that you have a very large
amount of data this is the data what is
that data all these things I was telling
you before including video and you have
here the word net or the lexicon and now
you are notate this in some way by
asking people to give you I mean there's
many ways of doing the annotation and I
don't want to deal with that right now
but coming back to concepts as I was
telling you before the view that this
neuroscientist scarf today or many
neuroscientists have about concepts is
that they may be just the sensorimotor
correlates but the concept is is the
redness of the red and the smell of the
red of the Apple sorry i mean the the
concept of an apple is a set of its
sensory motor correlates okay yes the
one still claims emotions are just
sensible world Damaso claims that
emotions emotions are a very important
yeah I printed a central motor forward
but emotions yeah it could be I don't
know I saw an amazing video last
yesterday in pasadena ebay an umbreon a
fetus in reconstruction with to Shauna
beams I was moving its hand over its
face and the this guy's was studying the
development of you know haptics and this
and that but you could already see
emotions in the face of the three month
all videos okay these are experiments
from this you know scientist this is an
experiment that we have been doing and
I'll tell you about this and I will be
concluding here is two people in the lab
I think one of them is a digit is it you
maybe not okay that's no no no no it's a
much newer experiment okay so this guy
is going to give a book to this guy so
he comes folks boom it gets just the
book then he turns around and leaves you
have witnessed the intentional act of
giving now you can imagine that if we
have this data and we have that data I
was talking about before okay and we can
go and build this structure that for a
lack of better work will call it a
semantic network that you are familiar
with below it's one of these frames you
have a description of what's happening
like the spatial layer the p1's person
one right hand surface you know left leg
surface book surface and so on so
basically it describes the scene in the
in the form of a semantic net it's one
of these now what does what is give and
if you look up some AI books and stuff
like that where you try to find a
predicate forgive what is it give give
XYZ X gives to why the object Z when X
has e till sometime then for some time
t1 till t2 they both hold the book and
then after time T to the pest guy
doesn't hold the book anymore and so on
of course more complicated because the
face here is important because you may
give the book or somebody may grab the
book and so on but nevertheless if you
take this definition forgive then you
can find it inside here
because give this this is this part this
sub graph of the semantic net is the one
that says what I just told you so so the
possibility exists that you can go to
the sensorimotor soup which is up here
you can through formalisms of structure
in that data develop a description and
in that description you may find you may
find definitions of abstract verbs like
give ok so I hope that I have raised
your consciousness about the possibility
of utilizing sensorimotor experiences to
enhance our understanding of language
because this is the ultimate we have the
visual space the motto space in the
natural language space and in order to
be able to relate them what we have
decided to do is build languages for
this and that's the only thing I talk to
you about today I didn't talk at all
about this this is much harder maybe
next time but the basic idea is that if
we structure if we develop structured
descriptions of factions in the visual
domain in the motoric domain then you
can even use machine translation
technology as long as you can do the
proper alignment to go from visual to
motor from moto 2 vision for moto 2
language to just go around this basis so
I wish you good luck with your work and
I hope that at some time in the future
maybe i'll be very old at the time that
I'll be able to search the internet with
queries that have to do with meaning and
you guys will have this amazing software
that will go out there and structure all
the texts in the world depending on
their meaning because when you have this
big structure of the lexicon enhanced
with the practical it would be very
difficult to miss the meaning or you
know to miss the sources of information
that have that I mean if you try to you
know do specific things you know in
linguistics disambiguation for example
it's a field a topic that many people
are working on it can happen it can
happen with the praxic on many other
things can happen with the practical now
one of the things that I didn't talk
here is that the praxic on has also
information about the objects or could
have information about objects because
objects are participated in actions now
if you think seriously about the idea of
developing a version of the praxic on
that has also visual information about
the objects in the world then you are
elevating the lexicon and the praxic on
to a new level and that level is coming
closer to your business especially when
you try to put the whole world in a
structure and you know find it
so I think I have to stop here and I
want to thank you very much for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
