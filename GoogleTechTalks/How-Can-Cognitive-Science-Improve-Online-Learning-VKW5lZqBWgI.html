cognitive science so I'm really
interested in doing experiments to
understand young people learn and to get
a sense of where that fits in with the
sort of research landscape because
there's a ton of great research on
learning and many insights are you guess
the way it's built up is thinking in
terms of qualitative analyses so these
the kind of rich investigations that you
see from a sort of sociological
perspective education schools that will
take a student and really take a very
close look at what they're learning
um explore how the understanding of
algebra and all the different
misconceptions they can have then
there's also things that are much more
like a randomized control trials so
policy work where you might take one
bunch of students in the school and give
them a treatment where they undergo
training program and then you can see if
that has an effect compared to control
group and that's a very kind of large
scale there's long attitudinal studies
which again a very long time scale um
collecting measures like people's grades
or students sort of outcomes as they
progress through traditional education
and of course this working computer
science non educational data mining
where you take very large data sets what
it sums the observations then try and
induce what's growing with learners so
in terms of where cognitive science fits
in with this I think it's sort of in
between something like a randomized
control trial longitudinal study on
something like qualitative analysis
because what's the experiments we do on
a sort of short timescale and it really
involves sort of precisely controlling
what someone's learning in a particular
situation and trying out different forms
instruction and then assessing how
learning is occurring after that and you
know you might think that from such sort
of micro experiments you can't learn
much but that's actually sort of one of
the expert you know the expertise in
cognitive science I think it's really
insightful um it's obviously use a lot
of insights I think it's already well
suited for online education where often
you want to ask questions that kind of
intermediate between sort of getting
quality of assessment what's going on
and running a full-out randomized
control trial where you give people two
different versions of course they're
questions about how you should frame
instruction what kind of video you
should show someone the kind of
strategies you should teach them I'll
just let you kind of know where it sits
in there
and what's also nice about calling of
Sciences and approaches is pretty
interesting Airy intense you've got
psychology which is heavily focused and
experiments philosophy in terms of very
trying to do good conceptual analysis of
what form you're facing and classifying
different kinds of learning i'm
linguistics anthropology as I mentioned
neuroscience and of course AI and what's
also nice I think is that it's also a
bit easier for people in cognitive
science perhaps to talk with they can
every searches at Google who are ready
interested in often things I'm modeling
and machine learning ok so to give you a
bit of a preview of what is fine to
cover so I'm going to talk about two
ways you could think about learning one
that I think um sort of gives us a lot
of rich insights into how to improve
education I'm going to talk about very
quickly three finds and cognitive
science that I find have been
particularly powerful it's sort of
thinking about what can you do before
someone starts learning in terms of
framing their learning is an ancestor
problem what can you do during learning
in terms of requesting explanations from
the learner and then what can you do
after learning and your interesting
finding is you can actually use
assessments as instructional tools how
many people take a test can actually be
more powerful the for learning than
having them study material again and
then having sort of looked at some of
the what we know about how to promote
learning of a concept or some cell
knowledge it's kind of with us and well
what knowledge could we teach someone's
actually gonna have the biggest impacts
practically uh that's why I think
thinking about this idea of what do
people learn that's gonna help them
learn more so it's not just on this
concept but across the range of
situations I'm there I'll talk about how
you can change people's beliefs and have
a massive effect on their motivation you
can teach people strategies for learning
that then influence you know have
trickle-down effects on all the coins
that they may come across and then
finally i'ma talk about online search
which is something I really start to
think about we seriously recently since
looking into Google power searching
course and actually think this is a sort
of really um
fascinating topic that's right at the
junction of things that are really
important industry in the business world
and also really important is education
and I think that's actually a great sort
of place to focus because it allows you
get the benefits the sort of private
innovation as well as
academic work and also it means that you
can sort of use insights across areas
when instead of teaching a business
person about search you'll also need
something about how you could help a
child to be more inventive in the way
they discover information on the
Internet
how is my speed in terms of talking as
with an accent probably sounds like
twice as fast and I speak twice as fast
so a lot of powers being raised there
okay and one thing I'll cover at the end
is I put on the website just a list of
resources that I found really useful in
terms of knowing what the literature is
that has shown really good impressive
effects on learning you know when you're
going to Google Scholar I mean literally
there are thousands of papers there and
I think that can be daunting and it's
easy to sort of think that you could
it's just easy just sort of start with
your problem and work on that but
there's always tons of really
interesting relevant work I'm so try to
put aside some of the resources that I
found most useful so I have hyperlink
links to so many papers there and brief
explanations of what they're about and
also information about other things I'll
talk about at the end okay so in terms
of learning I think one kind of
challenge even after studying learning
for you know so much while all my adult
life I still think that this is kind of
intuition or this intuitive theory that
I have about learning that sort of holds
me back or kind of misleads me when I'm
making instructional decisions I think
it's something that sort of common
across many of us in the II sort of
Cambridge handbook of doing science is
they can refer it it's the idea that
when you learn something you just sort
of dropping it into a bucket you're sort
of just learning as transfer from the
teacher to the students so the thing
about some content for example learning
from a video like from a power searching
online video or Khan Academy video or
reading text which is how we absorb most
of our information or you can think
about learning from an exercise so
students solving a math problem or
someone attempting to process of
financial statements or do some
budgeting or solve any problem managing
relationships coworkers
anytime you can see those icons I mean
to represent you know you can sort of
stick your personal content in there so
if you have a favorite example of
learning or one that's particularly
relevant to you have really experienced
or your job just feel free to insert
that
and flashes out well I'll try to
illustrate with examples because again
there's good evidence that that's
important thing to do for learning so I
think this is an intuition that what
learning is about is just adding
information so it's almost as if we have
this model ready mind is a bucket and so
what does it mean to learn what it means
to take information and drop it in that
bucket
well it's videos text solving stuff just
put it in and you know later on you can
come back and get it but actually I
think I'm much better learning we are
thinking about learning is that it's
like taking a piece of information
integrating it into the Internet in the
same way that a web page so that
internet and you can guess what those
big um Giants fans are so how is how
might you think about this analogy
shedding more light on learning well
under this kind of view when you're
adding content to the Internet there's
actually fits all you have to think
about three stages well what do you do
before the content arrives or what do
you do instead of linking it to what's
already known so it's really important
now you know just drop in a bucket
you're actually like it's two web pages
that already exists by citing them
you're putting on a particular domain
and so I think since right now I'll just
leave to the search challenge we face as
learners of how do you get information
to link up to what people already know
and in what what kind of knowledge you
linking new concepts to and I think it's
something that's obvious when we look at
it but it's definitely not at the
forefront I think of a lot of
instructional decisions also if we think
now even sort of a process is people
engaged in while they're learning
you know everyone on internet time is
limited they're not going to read your
whole web page if you're lucky they will
even read the first few lines so you
have to ask questions like how do you
structure the informational web page so
that you really core concepts jump out
what are the key principles or depending
on the person is the web page structure
so they can get an image they need a
saying this is a now that's - when were
processing something like a video or
lesson a bunch of text it's actually it
just flat-out impossible to remember all
that information so what are the kind of
cognitive operations you're engaging in
to pick out some informations being more
important than others sort of some
relationships or some principles or some
details of whatever content you're
learning
and then finally what's the last part of
getting a webpage off of the Internet
again I think you guys have all have a
bit of advantage you know Anthony's
audience participation questions but
it's assuming you've defined it and this
is probably the most undeveloped part of
understanding how we sort of retrieve it
how we actually what own evolves because
any time you learn something it's only
gonna be learning if it influences your
mind in a way that at some point if you
show you're gonna have to flee because
of it so you have to retrieve that
information in some way so for example
learning is a lot the final stage of
learning is it's got to sort of be set
up in a way that is Scotty right cues or
the right connections the when someone
goes looking for that information they
actually gonna find it for example you
know I might learn really interesting
things about mathematics from a video
and you could say that I know it but
what I am actually faced with the
situation we have to solve or
differentiate something I'm actually
gonna remember that fact at that moment
or make me remember something else I
learned about differentiation or
something else about functions and so
really a key challenge in learning is
the instruction has to actually ensure
that people are putting information in
the right way
that they can access it later and
actually a key part of that is going to
be that after instruction takes place
it's actually really important to give
people practice in testing them and sort
of accessing that information what could
be call like retrieval practice okay so
one thing I wanted to sort of really
have a one on this point in terms of why
it's really important to think about how
hard learning is and why these two
models kind of matter is that there's
this phenomenon called transfer or this
distinction which is that learning might
just be getting piece of information but
transfer is when you take an abstract
principle for one context and use it
another one so transfer is extremely
rare and I think this is probably the um
biggest most important thing I feel like
I know now that I didn't know eight
years ago is that I assume if I'm told
something and I don't remember it well I
just forgot you'd have to practice a bit
more but actually it's a much more
performant problem than that almost
nothing I mean oh it's some people make
this statement that almost nothing that
we learn in one context is gonna get
transferred to a very different context
so actually the way we do most of our
learning is by really learning things in
very specific context and slowly
generalizing them out so for example
let's sort of think of a problem let's
say that your general trying to invade a
castle and you've got a hundred thousand
people and you know that you can take it
if you send them all at the same time
unfortunately the person accustomed
knows that as well and they've mined
erode secondly send twenty thousand a
time so that's just not enough
you can't um send twenty thousand people
who feel cheap acaso
so how do you solve this problem you
need a hundred thousand to arrive at the
car so but you can only send twenty
thousand along any single road at a time
okay yeah the mods were roads so the
idea is that you divide this up you
divide you for something they go and so
do it here's a separate problem it's
gonna use a different kind of technique
your physician and you need to kill a
tomb in someone's stomach and you've got
really high frequency rays that can
destroy a tumor but the source gonna
take out a large party person's flesh
and you've got low frequency rays but
they're not actually gonna kill the
flesh or the tumor how do you solve that
problem yeah
so here I sort of like give you guys an
advantage but what's shocking is that if
you have people you can bring someone
right in front of you they'll do the
problem to indicate you the next problem
twenty percent of people will actually
transfer that spontaneously um you could
even help them get them to a lab with
the principal do all kinds of things
when you're learning your first problem
they don't have to transfer
spontaneously if you tell them you know
I think we've won before its relevance
then they might stop and ready thinking
like oh yes ICO to solve it but that
kind of transfer I mean you obviously
can't have someone running around like
telling you what's relevant to what so
sort of I think it really in my mind
highlights something that seems so
obvious like the common principle there
it does not happen for people at all it
just doesn't come across it's almost
like they learn something about generals
and invasion and it learn something
about medical practice they didn't learn
that abstract principle and it's really
tough to get people to in fact I can bet
I could give you guys similar versions
of this problem embed in your life like
in a week and a few weeks and you'd be
surprised how
how high rate you'd feel it out um
they've even done really compelling
studies where they take business
students and they have them learn a
negotiation strategy for example we all
think negotiations about compromise but
actually one much better strategy is to
find out what the other person wants
that you don't really care about and
what you want that they don't care about
and trade off on that so we could have
an orange and if we're fighting you
could take half I could take off but
maybe I want the appeal because I have
to flavor up some food and you actually
want inside because you're hungry that's
like a different that's a sort of a
trade off negotiation strategy so what's
interesting is when you take MBA
students and teach them this strategy
they'd sort of do everything that
student that you want your students to
do they understand the strategy they can
explain it to you they can give you
other examples of the strategy they
already get it except when they actually
have to use it if you put them in a
face-to-face negotiation it fails use a
strategy so that's sort of ready
compelling because even in a situation
where someone's done everything that
we'd like students to do and students
almost never get there all the time it's
still the case that they're gonna feel
the transfer and so it never really
highlights sort of the importance of
thinking carefully about what sort of
processes you have people engage in
while they're learning and also having
assessments that can really help you
understand if people transfer or not oh
sorry yeah I'll clarify so they could um
tell the strategy to you I think it
writes out an explained in principle but
if like two minutes later they were then
in a situation where they had to
negotiate with someone like face to face
um I was part of a team they would I
mean there were twenty to thirty percent
would do it
twenty or thirty but it was very low
yeah exactly and it's shocking because
they really didn't sound a strategy but
face to face it was just it's almost
like you have a different set of
concepts when you're dealing with people
and different set of concepts when
you're learning something up in your
class yeah
um I guess I would actually it's
probably of both the true but I'll say
at lean 22nd one that it's almost I mean
the way some people write about it your
mind is not designed to transfer it's
not designed you've got concrete
concepts that correspond to different
things and if you want trance we have to
do something special with them um
actually this to this
that's the original paper that showed um
that show the general and the medical
study this is one that should with
business students and actually this guy
with a book that's sort of called
transfer on trial where he pretty much
argues he thinks transfer almost never
occurs and so what we need to do is
teach people specific skills and
specific context obviously has an
extreme position but that's just to let
you know the return of how people think
about this yeah oh sure the question was
are these theories of transfer also true
if during while in learning about the
concept they do mock negotiations and so
or if they try and the other point was
maybe if they do three different
negotiations across different contexts
and so those things definitely help and
they make a big difference
the ixora leaky pants Pliocene is that
there's a big focus in business and
medical education on ksps reasoning and
so on actually you know there's good
evidence that helping the structure
abstract concepts around the specific
ears is really useful but the experiment
um by Gantner lowenstein and tom sun
what this sort of showed is that even if
it helps to have a specific case you
still don't necessarily get the abstract
principle so what is really nice about
the experiment is they would give people
two cases one after the other as well
suggested versus given in two cases side
by side and actually tell people what
are the similarities and differences
between these two cases in this story
about I mean it was about business but
let's say story about general this story
about the medical doctor which agents
are playing what role and what's the
relationship that exists here and so
when you actually up that's sort of
pretty extensive process which is really
good as
helping people really like get
abstractions in a way that's telling it
to them in words just doesn't um when
they have to processes and align items
that up she makes a medium synapse
rupture but it's not necessarily enough
for them to just see kisses that helps
but you've already got to add something
extra on to it and comparison is sort of
I would say one of these super process
is that you we've seen for getting
people to really grasp an abstract
concept that they won't get in words
that they won't get just from examples
okay so in terms of thinking about if
someone's about to learn some content
what are things that we can do before
let me learn watch your video about some
training they have but were coding it
reads a text about mathematics so what
we typically do is give them that
information and you know they we can
might ask one or two questions or get
tell them what they're gonna study
you're gonna learn about math but pretty
much you give them the information
almost very much in line with putting it
into they had like it's the bucket but
actually this is really interesting set
of work on what's called problem-based
learning and so the idea here is that
with a very minimal change you can share
you can influence how people gonna
process that video or or lesson I ask
them a question before this is gonna
make them interpret everything they
learn as a solution to a problem instead
of learning for example reading a bunch
of texts about solving algebraic
equations if I was prefaced with um if
you have a variable if you have two
variables in an equation and you're
trying to figure out how to isolate one
how would you do it the student will
probably not actually know how to do
that they'll fail they'll try all kinds
of things that are wrong but the mere
fact that you sort of got them thinking
about that problem then means that as
they go through it less and they're sort
of encoding or that mission as a
solution to that problem for example you
can think of cases where people have
sort of told you something and you sort
of take it for granted or encode it but
if it first
you'd first been trying to solve a
problem and then got in that piece of
information response there have been
much more effective for learning and so
what's really nice about this
manipulation is that um it's very
minimal
that's all you've got you this take
whatever content you have and proceed it
with some questions for example if
you're about to learn let's see what
power search you could ask them since
well how do you find some this kind of
content or filling in mathematics is it
possible to construct this kind of
relation and then just how many people
think about that will then lead them to
sort of process everything they see
after differently it's also more
motivating for students in that they
sort of not just absorbing facts but
they feel like they're actually learning
with some kind of purpose in mind in
terms of thinking about what you can do
during learning and hey I'm gonna focus
on what I've done our next patient just
because this what I know best in terms
are presenting so the idea is that we
all have this intuition that you know
it's really good if we actively process
information or if we've ever tried to
explain a concept to someone else
some member actually explained to them
might have thought is something new but
despite that it's not so often that
instructional videos or text have sort
of questions in bed with them or
activities that forced you to sort of
generate explanations and so there's a
good bit of evidence that this does
actually help learning if you can sort
of prompt someone as the other integer
next patient's this or understand more
deeply and they're more like the trance
for the principle sound situation so the
question I was interested in is
understanding well you know not to be
too mad about it but why is it that
explaining why helps you learn and this
is really relevant in terms of thinking
when you're gonna ask learners for
explanations
you can't ask someone all the time or is
this certain kind of content you should
ask for or what kind of knowledge is
gonna be targeted when you ask for an
explanation so it's got really important
practical implications in that sense I
think I would contrast just throwing
someone into learning and letting them
sort of use whatever strategies come to
them with actually I'm prompting them
while they're learning to explain why
they're doing something to explain why a
fact is true instead is accepting it and
so we look at this in three contexts the
first was in terms of learning
artificial categories so even though
there's lots of work on explanation and
rich educational settings this is the
first study that
in a lab context artificial materials we
can really control things right
precisely even if we have a sense of
experience helping it's very hard to pin
down exactly what kind knowledge people
are gaining is it just that explaining
is making people pay more attention so
the mere fact that you have to answer a
question means that you've got to pay
attention to what you're learning
instead of doing off or looking at other
information you've got to spend more
time processing it um it could also be
that because you have to provide an
explanation you're more motivated
there's this kind of social context
where you have to produce information it
could possibly relevant someone else and
so if those are how explaining learning
works then that suggests one way in
which we could use it as an
instructional tool but the idea that we
want to test is actually experience
affects a lot more selectively that
there's something about explanation
doesn't just boost your general
processing or attention but actually is
sort of constraining you are forcing you
to search for underlying principles or
patterns for generalizations and so this
is a question we get tests more readily
when we look at a constrained context
like learning artificial categories we
also examined um explaining people's
behavior
so for example if you notice a friend
who needs to charity
that wasn't me right okay that's right
um if you notice a friend donates a
charity you could just include this fact
about them you might sort of make other
predictions from it like they're gonna
have less money in their pockets at the
end of the day and probably won't treat
you for drinks or you could try and
explain it well why did that person give
the charity and again that's a different
way of learning about another person and
so as it affects just to boost your
general attention to what they're doing
or is it actually gonna do something
deeper like make you search for an
online principal and the final context
we look at this in was actually trying
to learn something more educational so
the idea was that we had people learning
a bit of odd concept of variability and
this is the example motion to appoint
depth so I don't spend much time on this
part but I'll some of the main
conclusions across all of these domains
the basic form was for different
materials and different kind of
knowledge but the basic form is asking a
why question explaining category
membership
explaining why something that's someone
did something
or explaining is solution their problem
and now will be contrasted with letting
people serve choose their own strategies
so being able to sort of study freely
and we'll also contrasted with the are
some people say out loud what they were
thinking because they could be the
Nemean effects of explanation actually
having you clarify your thoughts you
know once you so state explicitly you
can see what you were thinking what was
missing what the gaps in knowledge were
and so we're sort of trying to pick
apart that effect from whether there's
something else to explain him driving
you to search for online principles and
then following study we gave people
learning measures that's apt exactly
what they've learned
okay so to talk about going into that
third one in more depth I'll just run
through the procedures you can get a
sense so the idea here is that people
have to learn a University's ranking
system from examples so you're told that
a university has a way of ranking
students from different classes and you
can see examples of students who have
been ranked by last year's officer and
you have to learn well what's the system
for doing it one information they're
using so for example you've got
inflation about something like their
personal score their class average the
class minimum score the class deviation
so for example this might be John you go
to 86% in history you might see what the
top score is what the class mean
standard deviation is then there's
another student then physics thought
about a 2% again you see the top score
the class me in class and deviation and
so you'd actually tall which one is
wrong tire so if it's now but you be
told the person leftwards
that's not trying to think about how you
can learn about this there are a bunch
of different ways you could approach it
you could sort of pay attention lots of
examples and then that would inform
future situations you kind of
automatically get an intuition for how
people around you could try and look for
different patterns so for example maybe
people around tire just if they had a
higher score the university is pretty
guards here and across courses you could
think it's actually how far they above
the class average so for example um this
person's 6% above the class average
where's this person's 4% so even though
they got a much lower score you might
still have
should be round tire I should say this
is consistent as kiss but it isn't
actually if the reason this Christians
wrong tires not because they got a
higher score it's actually cuz they're
far from the average you could also
think it's actually a matter being
closed via to the maximum score if you
closely tapash then user to be wrong
tire you no matter what
I mean finally if you think about what
statistics would suggest there's this
idea that you should actually look the
distance from the average but wait it's
by whatever this and deviation is and so
the idea here is that what you already
want to know is how far above most of
the other students in class was each of
these people and I'll be give you a
measure of whether you should rank
someone Hardy or not how many standard
deviations above were there what was the
z-score and so we give students a bunch
of these observations they sort of saw
five runs
he hasn't total and the actual rule was
using the number standard deviation
someone was above the average but the
other rules were pretty silly antonym
pre-testing we find that a lot of
students endorse them whoever got the
highest score should be should be round
tire whoever's closest to the maximum
and so on and so some of the
observations just didn't fit with those
rules so this might fit sometimes with
the higher raw score but sometimes they
don't they might match the close to
maximum rule but not always and so the
idea here was if explaining really
forces people to seek online principles
then explain these sort of observations
and the ones that sort of conflicted
with some rules this others should drive
them to actually find this underlying
principle this sort of robot deviation
that actually applies to all the
observations and so this one we found
this is showing you people's accuracy
and classifying Ram's pairs before and
after and how much improved and what you
see is that people who had to explain
how much big increase in accuracy what
forty percent compared to those who
writing their thoughts as interesting
because writing our thoughts is a pretty
elaborate of activity you know you have
to express what you're thinking about
the materials you have to process and
deeply explaining surgery of PEEP refine
this broader principle I'm not just an
illustration because across all those
contexts where there was learning about
categories
explaining how people find a broad
generalization the counted membership
for all the robots if it was expending
people's behavior again you're more like
discover like a general pattern like
young people donated to charities more
than other people so this suggests that
in terms of thing about educational
context when you want to ask someone a
why question it's not necessarily a good
idea to just always be prompting them or
just trying to boost the engagement you
actually want to be selective in terms
of when they're sort of given examples
that can point them towards an online
principal then you need to prompt them
to explain why or if you think they
don't have enough knowledge and use the
principle yet then it might actually
make more sense to engage in other
activities like helping them acquire new
concepts or have more facility with
understanding how different
understanding what the different facts
are and then they might reach a stage
where they can actually with prompting
be able to induce same line principle
what's another interesting thing is that
in the m/sec enlightening experiments we
found that explaining actually boosts
the extents which people use their
knowledge in finding online principals
so the idea was that in the absence of
explaining you might have a lot of
relevant knowledge that might suggest
the deviation is a good rule or
something else is but you don't actually
bring it to bear if you explain though
and you don't have that knowledge well
then you might find some pattern but
it's not necessarily correct one so the
idea is that experien prior knowledge
interacts a guide what people are what
patterns people are searching for what
they'd like to detect you mean in
general or with respective so we run it
online and we just ask people afterwards
how familiar were they were and it was a
pretty big range
some people had never heard of it before
but a decent number hard at least come
across the concept before um in those
people though they still did really bad
the only pretest so I mean in a lot of
sort of experiment situations you can
sort of look at interesting effects of
learning because the truth is that
learning just doesn't really accrue that
well the first time around so often are
they sort of relearning material and
even with extensive practice it's kind
of hard to get people to
Disko principal and we didn't find
differences between low and high people
who had low and high exposure but again
that might be because we need to broaden
example because it was online we might
just have gone people who were in some
who just didn't have a lot of knowledge
they wouldn't sign up for math expound
maybe also in terms of thing about
exhibitions in fact it really was
selective and actually what we found is
that it didn't help you remember
information better sometimes even
appeared it but especially if there
wasn't a reliable partner in present or
if you couldn't actually find it because
you just didn't have enough knowledge to
explain actually impaired learning in
some cases because it drove people to
keep searching for a principal that
didn't exist or one that was only
partially reliable and so this is
something you might think about in terms
of when people sort of make these like
mini generalizations or they make these
kind of bugs that sort of seem half
right I'm children do this a lot in
algebra for example and it might
actually be from trying to seek
explanations and construct some kind of
pattern but it's just the case that
that's not actually I'm gonna carry it's
characterized the cases they've seen so
far but it's not actually to help them
with future learning and so again that's
another reason to think about carefully
but well when you're prompt someone for
an explanation you need to do the point
where it's not gonna hinder their
learning or be worse um on the flip side
is not saying explanations part is just
saying it's sort of like a powerful
selective tool that if you use in your
own cases will actually be harmful and
then since most of the workers adult
with adults we also looked at the
effects of explanation in five years
learning causal relationships and we
found very similar results even though
they were young and their abilities of
your glides are pretty limited they were
still able to when Tom to to explain
discover underlying patterns and
especially to bring prior knowledge to
bear and actually users discover
patterns that they wouldn't if they
weren't explaining now in terms of
thinking how to take these kinds of
findings online one or any good context
thinking about things like online
mathematics exercises like the one the
Khan Academy has in their framework so
that's sort of a mini shrunken version
but basically people will get a problem
statements I mean I sort of try and
solve and type an answer on a long new
way if they want
clicking on a hint button gradually
exposes the actual solution and so any
let's call a worked example and sort of
infamous that sometimes they can be much
better for students learning then just
trying things out and not succeeding but
it's really hard to get people to
process and deeply it's actually not
just skim over it but sort of understand
each component each step and how it
relates to something more general you
sort of get the principal answer that's
one case to explain can be really
helpful and so they're not more
different ways waiting of approaching
this but it'd be a second or the
simplest version is something like when
someone enters a correct answer even if
they reach out they're sort of following
a solution you can prompt them to try
and think well explain why that solution
is correct explain why that person took
this step they did I mean even though it
seems of course you know you just saw
the correct answer you should be
thinking about why it's correct this is
actually not necessary that common I
mean oh it's not guaranteed a lot of
students may be trying to memorize the
answer they may be trying to explain
other aspects in the solution there are
sort of many things that people may be
doing and when you do so detailed
analyses of student strategies you find
incredible variation and so that I did
was having that prompt it sort of
focused them on sort of understanding
how that particular answer that the
solution is just an instance of a
general principle what's the sort of
general strategy that was used here
what's the key concept now one thing
that could be problematic is even though
this is promising because you can get
people to learn just by being prompted
so you don't know so you have to give
them feedback when people don't get
feedback they often tend to sort of feel
like they're throwing explanations into
the void they just talk and it's
disappearing and so one thing I'm gonna
try is trying couple is really close if
it's actually giving them an explanation
a correct one or almost correct one I'm
tell them there's another students or
teachers explanation
actually ideas not only change it tasks
from do something that the teacher
instructors asking you to do type
something in front to generate an
explanation and then you're gonna be
comparing it to what someone else said I
see the idea here is that at this point
you could ask them to do things like
once they've got an explanation
written down and they see someone else's
well what if you grade both of them do
you think that was a good one and scale
from one to ten
was the new explanation good on a scale
from one to ten um you could have them
elaborate on what they thought might be
better or worse about an explanation or
you could even just have them make
ratings like a similarity or
dissimilarity so it's not very common to
us for these kinds of ratings that's in
a MOOC or online and I think it's it
could be because often you know if you
just ask this question at random one to
ten rating people may not give
informative answers but if if you sort
of use the kind of assessments the
psychologists are really pulling down on
for understanding things like what deep
concepts people think are similar or
people's ability to predict when they
make errors I think there's already is
for information which we get out of this
and what's even better is you're getting
information about what students think
and you're helping them learn at the
same time the act of kind of preparing
what they generates it's what someone
else generates it could be really
powerful
oh there's good reason thing really
powerful for learning another thing that
what fits in really well here is that
this work by people accounting around
like Carolyn Rossi and David Adamson and
what they've got is they found a way to
kind of leverage the minimum amount of
EIU you can get into a web-based system
to get lots of student learning I'll see
the idea here is that when people might
type in something like this like explain
why you think that's correct
they they actually they get channeled
into a there is sort of place in a small
chart with a couple of the students so
then this is not embedded in the context
of necessarily account Cardini exercise
well it's embedded in the context of
trying to solve a problem together and
so someone has to provide an explanation
and then the chat pod can then say
things like well John what do you think
about that person's explanation how do
you say it in your own words you
disagree and so these are simple
questions you can ask people but they've
been shown to have a really powerful
effect on students learning
they sort of tuned for this cluster
strategies like accountable twelve moves
and the idea is that by getting people
to really think about what they're
seeing and how it differs from other
people's ideas you can get a lot of
learning and once you have that shot
bought in there it can also act as a
sort of instructor or tutor but one that
doesn't need a lot of attention a lot of
time because students will often Carol
or the conversation themselves and the
key thing is just doing things like
adding
to keep it going or matching a student's
explanation to something else in this
database and they're not saying I'm just
assistant is this what you meant and so
it's a great way that very simple
technology you've been given answer and
the answers probably not be totally
right because NLP isn't there but then
actually the students having a learning
experience because they're now trying to
sort of correct what you said and sort
of putting exactly what they were trying
to get across then it's really exciting
line of work to look at okay so in terms
the thing about the benefits of
explanation I think it's a great way to
sort of have instructure guide
instructor guidance because you know ask
people questions a guide how they're
thinking while the same time having
learners generates information or
generate knowledge so they actually
constructing it um it's also a special
online course is useful because you can
do learning without any feedback so you
might have to do things to get people to
actually generate explanations but it's
a great way of actually maximizing
learning without necessarily having even
if you don't have the resources to give
people individualized feedback and again
it's really key because as you sort of
mentioned your trance is really
challenging people so the fact that
explanations help them understand is
abstract principles can a very powerful
effect on their learning so in terms of
thinking of what you can do your
question or that's a plan study that's a
plan study yeah well so yeah I think
really exciting to look at um oh sorry
the question was um did we find effects
of having them great other people's
explanations I was just saying that
that's a plant study because we can
relate unns of things in the lab and
using software vorn but when you have to
do with a platform that has its
constraints unfortunate takes a lot of
adaptation
just on a side point actually one way I
think that sort of research
psychologists can be really relevant to
people actually doing sort of practical
work like in EDX and Coursera and Khan
Academy is they sort of have a lot of
constraints in terms of the system they
have to build houses scale getting
things done but actually I think
something like a sandbox in addition to
any of those platforms will be really
useful for example there's like 50 I
mean literally 50
software's that don't require a
programming experience you can author
experiment really quickly it won't be as
beautiful as glossy as maybe you think
Connie Collins perfected would be a
great way to test out very quickly and
cheaply lots of different strategies for
learning and then once you figure out
which one seems to work really well for
learners that's what you put your
development time into the interaction
investing in for example with Google
some open course builder maybe that's
functionality you're thinking of
implementing well before doing that you
could sort of try and add an addition to
a power searching course where some
people will opt in to sort of take in a
different software and then we can
manipulate tons of things in terms of
the questions they asked or the examples
they see or the format of video
presentation and then when you see which
ones are really effective that's some
functionality then built into the
platform so in terms of thing what
people can do after learning after sort
of study has done that actually has a
huge effect on learning
I can hear very interesting ideas to use
assessments as instructional tools so
normally we think of a test is just
being to measure what someone's done you
know it's sort of like an inconvenience
it's sort of taking me time from
learning actually you know at mckinsey
for example especially when they do
training of soft skills the
instructional designers complained that
when you spend twenty percent of time
actually testing people on this and it
actually seemed like it was a waste of
time because that was less instructed or
getting I think that's sort of something
that maybe needs pre-thought in some
ways because there's now really good
evidence that actually testing people
can have a really powerful effect on
what they're learning if you think of
the traditional model where you need you
lesson 1 lesson 2 + S + 3 and then maybe
do them again you sort of dropped some
more information to the bucket this is
actually after each of those you
actually add an assessment so this
actually tons of reason testing can help
learning for example if it gives you
feedback if it makes you more motivate
to study what I'm actually talk about
the effects of testing that I'll need
you to take me tests so there's no
feedback involved and you're not allowed
to reach study so the idea is something
like mnemonic or there's something
cognitive about having to generate the
information yourself even though you get
no new information when you don't study
and on a test you normally generates
much less than what was actually in the
actual lesson
so this referred to the testing effect
as you can imagine if you give a learner
the option to study something once and
then following that they had the option
studying it again versus they had the
option of studying it and then taking a
test most learners would offer this
first one and in fact there's good data
that they do and in a way it's sort of
strange to think that taking a test
would be helpful because you can't
recall the 200 foxes in the video can
recall a subset of them but what's
actually found is if you're getting
media testing so let's say you do the
two videos you do a video test and then
you that's into one more test shorts
after you actually don't find so much
for difference or you find a slight
advantage for spending extra time
studying but if you wait an hour a few
days or weeks well you are she finds
that studying twice is it's definitely
much worse than studying and being
tested in fact the most recent paper in
science found that you could have people
study four times in a row and it wasn't
as good as studying unmanned testing so
the key thing that's going on here is
thinking about the sort of retrieval
stage of learning where it's not just
what having information in your mind is
actually able to get at it and when you
do a test you sort of force to form the
cues or the traval pathways the
connections it will help you get back in
information what's interesting is in all
these studies even though they were
doing worse any study study cognition
they claimed that they were doing that
and they expected it phones to be higher
Oh
another really interesting finding
actually is I think it's gotten less
attention that's very powerful is what's
called the mixing effect so if you have
questions of type a B and C sorry if
lessons a B and C it's natural to put
the assassins for a whatever 3x says you
have right afterwards and so on for B
and C but the idea behind e mixing
effect is don't make a new exercise or
do anything different but just scramble
the order so after you linear you get
one question a after you learn B you got
a question B a question a and a question
or B and then when you finally finish it
out on C you get a mix of all of them
and so this is especially dramatic
because you haven't increased how much
exercise you have to make
Luna's do terribly when they're doing
this and they think they're doing really
badly but it has profound effects on
their build step she generalize because
the idea is that when you sort of do um
an exercise and then move straight into
having a bunch of questions it's really
easy to certain all which principle
clients when you mix them together it's
really necessary for them to figure out
what the correct principles on where
they apply and so even though they do
much worse and in learning stage to do
far better and generalizing and this is
something you can easily do in a
textbook right take all the exercise and
start mixing them around
yeah um let me think a second so there's
no study I can think of the Sun that
even though there might be one on there
by I think I hope I should look that
because I would definitely be as you
said a great point um yeah yeah that's a
really good point actually yeah so I'll
check the prison so this is the person's
expert mixing effect so I'll take a look
at the tape and see if it's enough but
that's true that would work really well
and it's not something I think that what
not so obvious in this perspective but
if you put together the palm based
learning work then it does make a lot of
sense so you know basically I think what
sort of really exciting about this work
is that basically when you have online
education you kind of have a real wood
lab we sort of have to be in a lab a
psychologist because you need control
and you have to measure people doing but
now that people have moved to online
you've got a real with the environment
that's exactly like a lab context you
can do experiments randomize assignments
precisely to have one control and you
can have really quantitative measures of
learning that automatically connected
and so I hope that in the future what
that means is that you get a lot more
cognitive scientists experiments like
I'll just actually indirectly in online
education platforms our way as normally
as incredibly difficult to do education
researcher you can't have a teacher run
a sign instruction to different students
they just can't do it you know ways you
can have two different videos show up
what's also really nice then is that
we're doing research in a context with
really rapid ecological validity and
you're doing research on a product where
when you're done with your theoretical
research is actually been improved it's
better for learning and so what you can
have as a lot of evidence-based
decisions you can take that product and
deliver it directly to someone so
there's perfect fidelity to treatments
there's a lot of research conclusions
even if they work really well when the
usage is carried out it's hard to
disseminate it because the way someone
else implements it isn't guaranteed to
be true to that there's great
scalability because you've got these
implements and online system and
especially body knowledge to really
wrapped up and meet precise things that
the researchers asked and of course the
true improvement where it's constantly
getting better so given that um all
these methods for improving learning and
coming to at the end so I'm gonna sort
of touch on these things really quickly
but the idea is if you've got
his ways of teaching a concept the scene
to be effective well what concepts you
want to teach they can have the maximum
effect and in kind of concept that
improves people's future learning as a
good candidate so quickly I'll go
through motivation learning strategy is
an online search and so in terms of
increasing motivation the idea is that
one really powerful video motivate
people is actually by tags named police
for intelligence so do you agree for
example that your intelligence is
something very basic but you can't
change very much or do you think no
matter how much intelligence you have
you can always change it quite a bit and
so Carl do I'd characterize that as
being a fixed theory with my ability of
intelligence and it's it's pretty
shocking what this predicts in terms of
people who start off with equal IQs will
sort of diverge because people have a
fixed theory avoid taking our hard
problems people with a malleable theory
always ask questions they're happy for
challenges they don't think it means
something negative about them and so
what are the effects of actually
teaching people a malleable theory and
so this is work that's done by pretty
project for education research the
scales at Stanford as they found a scone
charissa actually Chris was right there
she just want to sit in and so what they
did is trying distill down his insights
into a single lesson where people be
taught that the brain is malleable then
you would have some questions and made
them think about how it applies their
life and you can contrast such a control
condition where seamless and what teach
people body brain but not necessarily
emphasize yeah that's your brain changes
every time you learning you're fast and
the intelligence is constantly being
improved do exercises and then try and
take some measurements of what people's
mindsets are and so this is great in
terms of actually being able to see what
effect this has on students and it set
up this whole system faster on a given
high schools and middle schools and so
on
so it's got all those great features
that were real wood lab that I mentioned
but in addition to asking about mindset
they also just collect the students
grades and normally I wouldn't collect a
number of measures ambitiousness grades
because it's so hard to impact something
it has so many variables fitting into it
and there's a lot that goes on but
actually what they found in this
randomized control trial is that just
two lessons about 45 minutes actually
boosts the students GPA now you might
think raisin are the
best measure of things but if someone
knows how to change grades they really
understand something really deep about
the psychological structure what
students are doing and you can imagine
these kinds of effects apply in all
kinds of contexts for example in a
workplace in terms of changing people's
beliefs about hard work about what it
means to get negative feedback and so in
terms of how I was thinking it'd be good
to bring cogged in social psychology
together in this way is just sort of
applying these principles like
preparatory questions during the actual
learning of the materials have
explanations and after sort of questions
that repeatedly have apply the concept
also with the oppressor I develop some
initial measures of how people might
apply mindsets and we'd like to create
video versions for MOOCs and Khan
Academy and that you could sort of give
to someone but we haven't got to that
yet
well we're done is taken do ISM comments
wasn't applied into the text they had
and sort of try and take his simple idea
of a mindset but teach people that in a
way that they're more likely to remember
it and apply it to situations their
everyday life and so that's actually
running now but in so many labs sighs at
least it is having effect where even if
mindset is better than the control for
getting people to believe in a growth
mindset and make judgments about other
people that are consistent with a
malleable Theory the effect of the
additional content many patients is sort
of increasing that fluid oh well that's
bad but we have fingers crossed that
it's going to turn out successfully and
especially if it impacts grades another
thing that is really interesting is
there's so many ways of minds that idea
can be implemented in the course is for
example changing feedback and exercises
its natural to tell someone who does
well that they did great and even better
town they're smart but the performance
when you tell someone that they're smart
you're emphasizing something internal
and fixed about them equality and so
there's actually work showing that that
inertia and the mind children's
abilities by praising them for the
intelligence they can actually start to
become very resistance of trying things
out or being worried about thinking it's
showing that they're dumb wears prison
children's for their efforts or sure
prison for them for the way they've set
up a problem or approach something or
try to find out more it's actually a lot
more effective in the long run as you
can imagine Khan Academy exercises in
workplace evaluations so trying to frame
things from the perspective of
improving or people supposed to be my
but could have really powerful effect on
learning and so just quickly to go
through them okay I'll just skip of
these so basically I vite apply the same
concept to learning strategies and so
the idea is to integrate work not just
compounded psychology but also um ideas
about mindset and habit and behavior
change which is its own separate
literature to sort of get people to stop
thinking about learning in terms of
memorizing facts but now in terms of
understanding and in particular that
what it means to learn a concept is to
be able to understand it to be of the
teacher to someone else so that it would
be within a MOOC where they collect
grades automatically it's a great
situation to introduce training videos
on linear RFG is like whenever you're
studying something imagine you're gonna
be teaching it to someone or when you
finish something imagine if you had to
explain what you learn to someone else
and have technology can prompt people to
do this and then see if it actually does
have an effect on final grades and MOOCs
provide a great way to actually do that
data that kind of long as you don't
study that you just couldn't do before
what I'm sorry okay a MOOC is massively
a massive open online course so I
Coursera and Google PowerSearch you have
like twenty thousand people any teacher
course okay an online search I guess you
guys are all pretty much on board online
search be important but actually I think
it's everyone knows it's kind of good to
be able to search but often you know we
think of it as just like a tool like
it's for something like fishing this is
like a tool kit from solving an online
series I think is powerful for teaching
because if a student has phones the math
problem and they just only habits or
they have it still still define a source
on the internet they can find a site
that's better for them than maybe their
current textbook they can find a site
that offers free tutoring um if they
ever later on in life need to solve a
similar problem they can go online and
find those resources and so I think
online education and that teaches
students better search skills so
especially to search for knowledge as
opposed to just you know being able to
find product reviews online can be very
powerful in terms of learning if
Antelias Google Scholar instantly means
that if I in here medical claim and I
don't know if it's true I can go in the
country with Scotland just
what's up I I may not understand exactly
just the journal but if I find no
journal article relevant to it it tells
me a lot so these kind of shrubs could
actually be a great way to improve
scientific illiteracy even of course
being able to pursue project sort of
areas that are not under your current
interest it's also a great power of
getting students in the habit of online
search within you allowing it to be a
bit more independently driven if they
want to learn about a topic that wasn't
covered and you can even imagine using
online search to do things like what a
good learning strategies or how can I
improve my grades we don't think that
going to Google out online but it's
amazing if what you will find on Google
these days so in terms of just okay I'm
over but yeah the one point I'd make is
cognitive science doesn't just have to
use instructions I think it really in
the face is nicely with the machine
learning and AI work the people want to
do right now we've got like binary
answers or multiple choice questions and
it's true it's big data and that it's on
the order of you know tons of
information but if you have a narrow
bandwidth you just can't get that much
out of it and so I think subtle changes
that these things can make a big
difference in what we can get out of
machine learning and data mining for
example having people ready plausibility
of each of four months for choice
questions converts our binary score into
four numbers that each correspond a
different kind of concept just think
coolly knows our standard practice
example just have them read one to seven
it stars so many further if everyone
understands having people predict their
accuracy it's also a really powerful
thing because there was a study that
administer SAT to students and then saw
how it correlated with their later
performance on the ground and the S&amp;amp;T
correlated with performance but it
didn't call it with as well as how
accurate students were in predicting
which questions they got wrong and which
they got right so this study how do you
do nasty question and say how I'm ready
to get that right and the fact that you
were good at judging what you're getting
wrong or right was a much better
predictor of undergrad success than
actually the S&amp;amp;C itself and so if you're
looking for an individual difference in
learners that would be a great one how
good they are at understanding apps neo
knowledge
um rating similarity it seems very
simple but that's again something that's
just been shown across tons of
that used to reveal something really
deep about people's minds and I think
also creating explanations
so again that'd be a much richer dataset
then it's currently available for
actually understanding what's going on
and that's where you might see like Veda
turning to the best data you can get so
let's say I give you two concepts I
might say well how similar is this
mathematical concept to this math mark
on Sept or two explanations and I say
well how similar these how different and
that's actually a really powerful way of
like getting at what people think or
believe okay I'm I I'm also happy to
talk about this more but I try to put
together the resources they're been
useful for me on a website in terms of
citations and if you're really
interested in improving education this
is a great book in education policy that
sort of looked at all the systems across
the world and try to see what inside so
they have for us education I think
especially online education is different
obviously there's a lot that's already
known so we could benefit from a lot of
that all right thank you
do people have any questions
so they're a bunch of so the question
was I was talking about subjects to
explain we're drawing on knowledge they
already had and how did I measure it um
they're many different ways people take
to it
mostly past studies um like you said
administered a pretest the way I did it
was Akshay manipulated knowledge
experimental II so they explained or
Durant's unknown is another experimental
factor I give them extra training oh I
didn't and so that's a we can know
exactly kind of what they've been
learning so I think um yeah that's a
really good point I think that's why I
try to sort of look at seeing well what
is after the fact of explanation because
then once we have a bit of about a
handle on what explaining is doing like
if it's driving people towards
principles then we have a better sense
of okay it's not a good idea to ask this
to explain at this point in time we
should wait to ask them to explain when
they have more knowledge or it would be
a bad idea to ask them to explain why
these two problems are correct because
that might lead them to sort of like min
a local generalization to only applies
to those two math problems for example
you know with the statistics example
it's pretty reasonable to say people
highest scores would be ranked more
highly but that's just accounting for
the observations you've seen so far I
won't hold any general case so I think
features like that in terms of how you
set up environments in which cases you
ask people to explain would be important
variables to look at so I think then
more research or using a search that's
already there would be useful for that
another thing to keep in mind is our XI
that um sometimes it can actually be
helpful for people to produce a wrong
explanation and there's a paper that
sort of suggests this and has some
evidence from decoding they did but it
wasn't test experimental II which is
that once you produce any a
misconception and sort of codified it
its then a lot easier to recognize it
because then you know you're not just
sort of
implicitly thinking through things
you've actually sort of made a statement
like I think that that place is wrong
tie because they got a higher grade and
then you know when you see the eight
that actually goes against that you can
then revise your belief and for example
that's how a lot of children's learning
might work where you could say I'm not
gonna my iPod space is flat and I'm not
gonna do something if I know a lot of
date so you could say I'm gonna try a
lot of things out and then just be
really open to revise them quickly
yeah so on that sort of resource page I
have some reference that the Raavan
beginning in me and our alum let you
know some more but Eric Mazur who was a
physicist at Harvard has um sort of
pushed this idea of a sort of um the
flipped classroom but where every class
actually is structured kind of around
questions in a sense that he'll start a
lecture after five minutes he'll put a
question on the board and people will
start discussing it they'll turn to each
other and they'll see what they think
then they'll argue for they'll argue
against and they'll get back then he'll
pass her on and talk with I'm gonna get
back together and so I think that's got
her a lot of really good lessons in
there and also um this idea of I think I
mentioned reciprocal teaching trying to
teach someone a concept and have them
teach it back to you and I think that in
terms of online environments what would
be really powerful would be having
people generate free responses and then
again letting them sort of see other
people's explanations and use those the
base for comparison so that's something
where I think you get people to be a lot
more engaged first get the benefits of
generating information plus its benefits
of things that are like the right answer
so that's all really excited about so
trying that out a big thing that I think
that people do now is because they think
that they have to give someone
explanation there very few free
responses so that they cognitive tutors
which are these adaptive programs will
actually give people a month or choices
of explanations I really simple
manipulation of not having multiple
choice how many free responds and then
put any multiple choice can make a
really big difference in terms of what
people learn you had a question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
