one of your friendly neighborhood
product council and it's my pleasure to
once again introduce Jamie boil for his
second heck talk of recent memory his
first one on seven ways to ruin a
technological revolution was well
received here and in lots and lots of
repeat video views Jamie gave a great
overview of certain current problems in
IP and especially copyright law jamie is
gonna know your title you're some kind
of professor with a fancy endowed chair
at Duke Law School and that's the very
name and has all kinds of other great
credentials but the important thing
about him is that he's awesome he was a
mentor to a lot of the lawyers here and
he's training a generation of lawyers
who in all modesty are the lawyers you
want to work with their the the people
working on ways to use IP and other
areas of law to facilitate tech
innovation to facilitate sharing
information and not just constraining it
so jamie is here today to talk about
some new projects spinning out of
creative comments that focus on science
and I'm not going to step on his lines
by telling you what they are but they're
super interesting and with that let me
introduce Jamie Boyle thanks Daffy it's
great to be here there are
anthropologists search for universal
prescriptions universal norms that apply
across all cultures you know against
murder against incest there's a very
strong one which says you know that
don't play cards with a guy called doc
you know never eat at a place called
moms but the strongest of all which is
found in nearly all cultures is don't go
to google and give a talk about search
technology when I'm going to violate
that Norm here but I am a law professor
so that should be okay we are we believe
ourselves capable of doing anything I'm
going to talk about the creative commons
mission in the world of science the talk
is about an organization called science
Commons I'm one of the people who
help to find it it's a part of Creative
Commons an offshoot of Creative Commons
and it's the attempt to take creative
commons a--'s mission and move it into
the world of science so the Creative
Commons mission could be described a
couple of ways one way is that where the
legal rules were bad or poorly suited to
individuals dealing with the net then we
try to create hacks legal hacks
licensing hacks that solve that and let
individuals share their content with the
world under the terms that they wanted
whereas copyright automatically apply to
kind of default all rights reserved you
can't do anything with this except
perhaps read it mode and so one way of
looking at Creative Commons is that it's
an attempt to produce sane rules by
private agreement when the default rules
don't fit the rules the legal system
gives you just when you write something
or create something or take a picture
don't fit the world of the net very well
so that's one way of looking at what
Creative Commons does a second way is
the Creative Commons is an attempt to
create an enormous Commons of licensed
content so that if you're a
documentarian and you don't have much
money and you want to be able to get a
great soundtrack and to get maybe still
pictures of the new york-style skyline
if you want to get access to poetry or
to text and there are people out there
who want to share their material may be
with attribution that you can go out and
you can assemble all of that and you can
make you can make something even though
you've never met them Glenn Brown who
now works at Google put together the
first and still best explanation of
Creative Commons and in which the key
phrase was permission has already been
given and this is a phrase that is
actually which I think line came up with
which which has really become central to
the way I understand Creative Commons
it's a world in which you don't have to
have lawyers and you don't have to have
contracts that are other than the
commons d the the Creative Commons
license because permission has already
been given so the final way we could
look at Creative Commons is that it's an
attempt to reduce transaction costs
transaction costs sirs economic words
for all the hassles that actually our
everyday life right doing stuff talking
to lawyers filling in forms these are
all transaction
cost so how to take all of those ideas
getting rid of or customizing bad
default rules that the law sets up
creating a commons of licensed content
cutting down a transaction con problems
and move them to the world of science so
how do we do it the first thing we did
was to think about the research cycle so
this is the research cycle here are
materials in the top left hand box that
are actually being described that are
that are there annotated you've got
pubmed links but this is basically stuff
here's the actual physical stuff to
which they refer it might be plasmids it
might be cell lines it's more ambitious
it's zebrafish or genetically engineered
mice it's basically the raw material
that biomedical and I'm going to focus
on biomedical science here although
that's not our only charge in science
Commons it's the raw material that
science works with and as you work with
it and you come up you formulate your
hypothesis you end up publishing and you
publish over there in an article and
there's your article the article
actually says this is what I'm doing
this is the experiment that I ran here
are my results that produces some form
of innovation perhaps in the form of a
technology which might go into a
repository maybe adds to an actual
plasmid collection which then goes back
to the circle starts again the point
here is that what you've got is raw
material experimentation documentation
through literature and then scientists
saying I want to replicate that I want
to extend it I need to find it and I
want to move on forward forward the idea
is to say where each of where all of
these arrows are the moment when you're
moving from finding the existence of a
plasmid to getting it in your hot sweaty
little hands to do experiments on it or
when you've done your experiment to
putting it out there or somebody who's
trying to find the experiment or the
literature you did the description in
the literature each of these stages is a
moment where transaction costs that can
be added and the science Commons role
was to try and minimize them I'm going
to talk about two projects that we've
got going that I think are particularly
exciting where I think that some of the
minds at Google might be able to help
so how many of you know something or
anything about biology okay great that
puts you a little bit ahead of me but
but so this is a double area of
ignorance for me but let me describe for
you my rough understanding of the way
that we do scientific research
particularly trying to solve disease
problems this is as you can see a slide
representing some of the processes that
go on to make Huntington's disease most
of these are cell signaling pathways
proteins genes the Huntington signifier
right here is the thing that causes the
disease here you have a series of
processes leading to cell death the
question is how do you stop that process
from happening each line here represents
some process either of cell signaling
replication the creation of a protein
and each of these is a potential drug
target a place where you might try and
break the link with a drug right and the
idea is break the link stop the process
but of course the difficulty is when you
break these links what if you screw up
something else so using a metaphor that
I find explains it very well think of
this as an airline map some of these
nodes are like the jacksonville airport
you take it out air travel in the u.s.
is not noticeably affected some of them
are like Ordway or SFO you take them out
the whole system shuts down okay but the
trouble is until you do it you're not
terribly sure which is which and the
only large scale model which correctly
replicates what will happen is called
the human body and they're obviously
problems in working only inside a human
body here are the number of papers on
each of a few of the selected likely
targets 27,000 4128 thousand forty one
thousand ten thousand one of the first
things that we found when we started
investigating the world of science
investigating the empirical literature
talking to scientists is that the
scientists said for God's sake don't
give us access to more data we have data
coming out our ears now that's
scientists in the developed world at
rich institutions scientists outside of
the developed world and not a rich
institutions have a very different
attitude but let's just start with the
ones in the developed world
at somewhere like Berkeley or Stanford
or Harvard with full access to all of
the expensive databases and journals and
libraries they say we have a mass of
information and we have very very
primitive tools for figuring out which
pieces of that information are valuable
for example just one of these one of my
colleagues calculated it would take you
a hundred and eleven years to read all
of the available papers on the subject
so the first thing you're going to do is
to throw away ninety-nine percent of all
of the potential data out there because
you've simply can't afford to process it
you're going to do that according to
some rough heuristics that your mentors
and professors have kind of programmed
into you write like well we work only on
Huntington's so let's get rid of all the
rheumatology and all the cancer biology
what stuff that actually might be deeply
deeply relevant right but I don't have
time to look at it so we're just going
to move on I'll do some text searches
i'll use google ironically which is
hardly optimized even wonderful thing
though it is for searches like this i'll
use the internal search engines and i'll
try and come up with a better model what
would you do it on well this is an
abstract of an article in something
called pubmed pubmed articles are freely
available to everyone that the articles
they refer to often aren't but the
abstracts contain a lot of information
as you can see here's the key set of
insights study explores the hypothesis
that trans glued transglutaminase
catalyzes cross-linking of huntington
into intranuclear inclusions and then
goes on to say there that here's what
the data supports here's the hypothesis
the question is how are you going to be
able to find that kind of assertion how
are you going to be able to find that
kind of assertion and understand how it
was linked to the techniques the methods
I guess I should use the pointer here
the methods by which there we go the
methods by which the techniques the the
insights were generated and what are the
materials on which this was tested so
that if you wanted to replicate it you
would know what materials you needed to
replicate or expand the science and
what's the bottom line the conclusion
based on these and other studies
modulation of trans
luther manase activity could be explored
as a treatment for Huntington's disease
second problem you understand far better
than I the world of the internet and the
way in which websites and linkages among
websites provide a knowledge model which
search engines can rank usefully and
well albeit with secret algorithms this
is a discussion of a neuron these are
all of the places where you might
actually find out about such a thing
these are all publicly or largely
publicly available repositories in which
information which might be relevant to
the person who's doing Huntington's
disease is contained what we did was we
spent a long time talking to people
saying we think that if someone was to
go through and take all this publicly
available data all this publicly
available text all the publicly
available databases and run some text
recognition software on it which
actually understands in quotes here
which actually recognizes scientific
terms which actually understands
assertions of causation so X causes Y
inflammation upregulates this protein
for example like understand that that's
a subject verb object assertion that you
could actually generate a search engine
that scientists could use to mine this
vast agglomeration of data in a much
better way than they currently could now
let me tell you when this stuff actually
gets run there's a wii u's de
proprietary technology called timis and
ran it on this stuff it turns out of
course it produces lots and lots of
mistakes so you have lots of assertions
like hunger causes the absence of food
right where the it gets the basic terms
there but it reverses the causal arrow
but nevertheless it produces something
which is actually pretty good it can for
example understand some key points it
can understand that the same gene has
four or five different names in the
scientific literature and
see that gene in each place and say this
is the same as this is the same as this
is the same as this what I did what it
does by doing that is it enables
something that's probably the single
most important contribution of this it
enables a kind of rosetta stone between
other wise incompatible databases so if
you use naming structure one for your
database and he uses naming structure to
the two databases can talk to each other
because this software understands that
those two genes are actually the same
gene and that you're both making
assertions about the same gene so this
is a kind of query that a scientist
might want to run on this material which
so far as I know if they are outside of
a large pharmaceutical company there is
no really great available software that
actually looks for this in other than a
simple text search way right that is to
say it goes out and finds the word genes
single track signal transaction in
pyramidal neurons what does that mean
here's a human readable version of what
that query is finally potential drug
targets for Alzheimer's disease based on
what's publicly known pyramidal neurons
are apparently a key area for the
progression of Alzheimer's disease in
area that people think is a possible
area just like the Huntington's chart
that I showed you for interruption with
some kind of drug target so what our
first project went to talk to you about
the neuro commons did was took four
publicly available databases or text
repositories mesh which is a kind of
universal description of diseases
classifications neurons and so forth it
basically gives something a single ID so
that the same you could know you're
talking about the same thing pubmed
which provides the abstract to the
journal articles entre gene which is a
listing of all of these genes this is
the signal transduction repository and
what it does is say take all of those
and render that same query in what is
obviously extremely ugly kind of
early-stage code to say produce the
reproduce an answer and here is actually
the answer that it got which we're told
by some scientists passes the BS test
these are actually old genes which are
reasonably involved in this there's the
actual the way that the the search
engine works there's the the neuro
commons virtuoso rdf store
this is how we write the queries right
now as you can see it's kind of like the
early days of HTML where people coded
web pages by going into view source of
other people's web pages and taking it
out and like pasting it in it's all done
in extremely only coder friendly form
but obviously a human interface is a key
thing that we'd be moving on next and
the thing is that there you can actually
store your request and it produces a
stable URL this is that this is that
search and all of the components here
can be substituted so pyramidal neurons
you could say take exactly the same
query but maybe look for malaria drug
targets right so that it's the same the
structure is the same this is an early
stage maybe not even quite alpha stage
software project research engine so
that's the kind of thing that you can
produce out of it saved queries and then
the next thing which I'm going to talk
about a moment is once you've done that
how do you move on to developing the how
do you move on to actually finding the
materials that would label you to do the
science but I want to pause for a moment
and explain exactly why I think this is
important there's a war currently going
on about access to scientific literature
any of you who've been involved in
science know that there are open access
journals journals which are often under
Creative Commons licenses which are put
up on the web for free other journals
that most explicitly aren't science and
nature for example much harder to get
access to and there is a big debate
about whether or not when governments
fund scientific inquiry they should
require the scientific literature the
research that comes out of that to be
put out open access so that when your
tax dollars go to pay for research on
rheumatoid arthritis you don't also have
to pay twenty dollars to read the
article which comes out of that research
right so it's a fight and it's going on
and it's it will there will be a
solution sometime in the next couple of
years probably some kind of mandate for
delayed open access publication it has
to come out within at least six months
or a year if it's government-funded
that's going to be hugely important but
what I think this project in all of its
crudeness in all of its buggy you know
sort of basic text file with lots of
incorrect assertions shows is that when
we think
about open access to scientific
literature we cannot think about it the
way most people are thinking about it
now which is that the mark one eyeball
gets to see a picture of text on a page
and that counts as open access that if I
can read Glenn's article in nature six
months afterwards so long as there's a
JPEG of each page up there that should
be enough right because I get to read it
what this points to is the fact that
it's not just human beings getting
access to the literature that we ought
to care about its computers because if
that literature is not in
machine-readable form if that database
is not accessible to this kind of
activity then we will never have the
ability to build something of which this
is the very very very very very crude
first prototype what is that thing well
you could think of it as a more precise
search engine I've been told that when
you come to Google you're simply not
allowed to say Semantic Web so it's a
blank blank for science write a rough
draft of a blank blank for science
applying blank blank technologies to the
idea here by forming simple rdf blank
blank statements which coupled together
to form a blank blank network for
science you could think of it as I said
a rosetta stone but I think of it as the
demonstration project of wire ideas
about open access need to be much much
broader even if this is total nonsense
that is to say it doesn't work it's too
buggy it ends up making having too many
wrong statements in it like hunger
causes the absence of food another
version of it might be better so stage
one better search why is better search
important we can afford a grotesquely
inefficient science research process in
the United States because it's a wealthy
society but even in a wealthy society
some candidates for scientific research
are marginal economically orphan
diseases for example Huntington's
disease doesn't afflict that many people
which means that there isn't a large
chrome
Marshall market erectile dysfunction
don't you worry no matter how
inefficient the science ecology they'll
be research done on a wrecked I'll
dysfunction you know not to worry
obesity I think we can all sleep safe in
our beds and not worry about obesity
research being pursued Huntington's
disease and then when we get to the
diseases of the global poor even a small
level of friction can be enough to kill
the project and in some cases even with
almost zero friction the project might
not be enough so efficiency in search is
a human morally compelling imperative we
have to have better data retrieval in
the sciences where people will die and
they will die disproportionately when
they are poor or when their diseases are
suffered by relatively few other people
this strikes me as the kind of message
that a moral search engine company might
take to heart just any moral search
engine company not not like focusing on
any particular one it's something we're
fixing the problem would lower the would
lead to a better FDB index the FDB index
I get from my colleague how late will
send fewer dead babies right right fewer
dead babies right this is actually a
morally compelling thing so i guess the
subtotal subtitle of this talk is what
if we put the same ingenuity that we put
into allowing teenagers to to flirt on
myspace or for you to find just exactly
that tennis racket you're looking for
into finding the cell signaling pathways
that are crucial to Huntington's disease
to allowing people to do that at almost
zero cost right so compelling idea but
even if you find the data the articles
you find that one key article in a
discipline you would never have thought
of looking because you're a cancer
biologist so you didn't think of looking
in rheumatoid arthritis journals
although they both deal with
inflammation importantly and that's
actually an important linkage even if
you find that thing so what the next
thing you have to be able to do is
actually to be able to work with the
stuff the raw materials that scientists
have used in order to do
their experiments now surprisingly the
single biggest impediment to biomedical
research is the unavailability of
physical things you're all thinking okay
we're an information society right it
ought to be the information flows no
it's the physical stuff there's some of
our the results of some of our research
into the empirical literature here
forty-seven percent of academic
geneticists have been rejected in their
efforts to secure access to data or
materials related to research and a lot
of this was concentrated in the
materials again these are plasmids these
are cell lines these are mice these are
zebrafish why does this rejection happen
well app I think of a pie chart reason
number one it takes time to make the
materials you're sitting in your lab
you've got a bunch of cell lines I say
hey I want to do an experiment on it
you're going to have to take a grad
student and make the grad student go and
make a version of the cell line it just
takes time right it's a hassle the
hassle factor so that's a friction the
second kind of friction legal friction
every transfer should be accompanied by
a contract a material transfers
agreement here you get a great quote
from some to tech transfer officers who
work on these things one of your
colleagues at big AG says she'd be happy
to send you her transposon insertion
lines that saturate the right arm of
chromosome time you'll just need to have
a material transfer agreement signed by
your institution six months later the
terms of the agreement is still under
negotiation you missed your field season
your grants expired and there's now a
better resource if you just start
negotiating material transfer agreement
now um sie UNS is really important the
process of getting material across labs
is not even like web 0.5 it's not even
like buying a book pre amazon com it's
like ordering from the Sears Roebuck
catalog when you lived on the western
frontier and things had to come by
stagecoach okay I mean science hasn't
even made it into the 70s when it comes
to the process of facilitated legal
transaction between others because
permission should already have been
given
right so that none of that was necessary
now what's the third reason why this is
hard it's just hard to make the cell
line the process of getting the material
transfer is often difficult that the
tech transfer officers often customize
them they're supposed to be standard
agreements but there are customizations
oh well what if this is going to lead to
a new in fertility drug or a drug to
cure infertility or or stop hair loss or
whatever we want to make sure we get
enough money out of that there's back
and forth fights on all of this and all
of that just slows things down plus you
just have to sign things it just takes
time the third reason may be one of the
most important secrecy scientists are
refusing to share at an ever-increasing
rate the rate of denials is going up
which is a really bad trend line for us
to have why well you've got this cell
line you think you can get three papers
out of science or nature maybe a fancy
new grand maybe tenure maybe a fancy
chaired professorship of the kind of
daphne was talking about why should i
give you my cell line i'm just enabling
you to write those articles yourself
right now the credit economy favors
secrecy okay the informal credit economy
favors secrecy this is something that
web two point oh thought could be
applied to so there are the problems
massive set of problems at mtas what's
the solution well there's a beginning
there is this Universal biological
material transfer agreement this is the
first page of it there are nine pages
it's it's long even the short letter
agreement is quite long but it's a
pretty good agreement it's a good
working agreement it's hard to
understand even this part which is just
the listing here is relatively hard to
understand it gets more even though it's
a pretty simple agreement what it does
is pretty simple so wouldn't it be nice
if there were a Creative Commons for
materials in which you could just go in
and as easy as it is for you to license
your your photo on flickr or your video
creative commons licenses stick it up on
youtube on google video wouldn't it be
great if you could automatically put
things under the ubm TA or
the SLA and have them up there and
generate very simple common street which
just tells you what you're supposed to
do you can't use the materials for
clinical and commercial purposes that's
what it says right this nine page thing
is that's what it says and you can't
distribute without permission so that
the scientists could understand it this
is what we call the human readable layer
right and forget the lawyers right this
is the human readable layer the
scientists could understand it and
imagine a process where social
engineering that is to say pressure said
to entities like the NIH or Duke
University you know couldn't you get
your labs to pre-license all these
plasmids under this agreement just
automatically give permission right so
it's donna ready sure you can reserve
the patented stuff the totally
proprietary stuff but the rest right
couldn't you just make it a commons and
here's the really cool part once you've
done that every time that I go to
Glenn's lab and say I need one of your
plasmids then that's going to create an
electronic record and the electronic
record is going to say Glenn Brown's lab
produced three thousand plasmids last
year 3000 plasmids were demanded by
other people 500 zebrafish 20
genetically engineered mice knockout
mice kid mice that's more than anyone
else at Berkeley Stanford wherever by a
factor of five that Glenn Brown must be
a real hotshot scientist suddenly we
have a number we all love numbers
rankings right we all look at the awful
US News and World Report survey of
colleges look at citation counts lawyers
now academics nowadays basically check
their citation counts like every morning
like the weather you know it's raining
my citation counts up two percent right
citation counts are hugely important
they're the way that the informal
economy runs this is an idea to flip the
informal credit economy so that the
benefit is to sharing not to secrecy and
this is a second idea that I think
Creative Commons really got if you can
make sharing easy enough and get
benefits out of it and have those
benefits flow back to people then more
people will share the Economist still
looked at this stuff tend to look at it
as static they say okay
people aren't sharing they aren't
sharing for a good reason and the good
reason is they want to get benefit out
of the stuff they're holding on to they
never think I like okay should we could
we flip that system technically
illegally so that they could get just as
much or maybe even more benefit by doing
the more socially desirable thing so
again that's an idea which is
generalizable beyond this so that would
be the metadata that would travel with
the material so standardized licenses
permission giving advance allow
repositories to fulfill requests so now
imagine the final link remember we
started off with the journal article
what if in the journal article when Glen
Brown writes up his research in the
footnote it says and I used this plasmid
hyperlink and the hyperlink goes
directly to a description of the plasmid
with its licensed attached in a
repository that can provide that plasmid
now that could be a for-profit
repository the ebay or fedex or
amazon.com of cell lines yeah it's
certainly a business I'd love to get
into you know just you know all that
goop in FedEx container is flying across
the country you know it's just there is
a lot of it by the way that's the way
scientists everything is done by fedex
but imagine that process where the
article is itself the link to the
material needed for the next iteration
the thing is I'm describing this those
of you don't know the world of biology
will go well what he's describing is
like not even web two point O stuff
right this is like pretty trivial stuff
but we don't have it in science I really
want to stress this science isn't even
web 0.5 and these are just two ideas
better search and closing the cycle of
journal repository credit so that you
could say wow I like the sound of Browns
work click here hey it's available for
2495 from add gene their processing
costs maybe it's for profit maybe it's
not for profit I don't care I would love
for people to get into lowering the
price commoditizing cell lines it's got
to be an accredited repository of course
got to make sure that's actually
correctly produced because the
scientists going to have a vested
interest in making sure that cell lines
not contaminated so you know some safety
concerns there but nothing that we
couldn't possibly deal with and then the
cycle starts again
so basically thinking about lowering
transaction costs at each stage of this
cycle using some of the insights that
are jejune uninteresting mundane in the
existing world of CC licensed content
search engines web two point oh whatever
just taking some of that ingenuity
applying it whose job is that in science
right now kind of NIH kind of the
National Academies but right no one is
sitting here going how could we
transform this and the thing is in many
cases they're not doing it because they
don't see the opportunity for making a
profit the private from Pharma is doing
stuff like this but it's all internal
and good for them I mean I'm not putting
that down this is great they're doing
this versions but it's inside Merc Merc
has its own versions of this kind of
stuff inside mark right but those are
all walled gardens and the point about
walled gardens is they don't give you
the benefit of the large Commons it's
like again early early early day search
engines intra-company so these are the
people who've helped us with funding IQ
foundation tera node MacArthur this
whole thing that I've described to you
is being done on six hundred thousand
dollars which is trivial money by
science standards I mean it's actually
really embarrassing amounts of money we
have to not tell scientists because they
basically don't start paying attention
till you get up above the 50 million
dollar level it's it's too small so
that's the idea behind science Commons
it's an idea that i actually think
there's a culture the biggest problem
here is a cultural gap that we actually
have a lot of the tools that we need
conceptual tools licensing tools
metadata tools search engine tools
sitting over in the world of searches
for britney spears right and all we need
to do is drag and drop that stuff into
the side room all we need to do now
because it turns out that there's huge
differences we had to learn to deal stop
dealing with copyright licenses and
start thinking about licenses over stuff
when I talk to Daphne about it she goes
well what kind of intellectual property
right are you talking about over these
sell lights I said no Daphne this is
old-fashioned property like things she
goes oh
I've heard of that she said do you
remember the old day when we had like
stuff yeah physical property rights wow
that's so cute so there's lots of
customization there are lots of problems
that i haven't mentioned ranging from
patient privacy to bioterrorism fears to
right there's all kinds of stuff that
needs to be dealt with there are
enormous problems there's also
commercial entities some of whose
interests run along these lines and some
of whose interests don't entirely run
that run along these lines but
definitely a lot who do so all I'm
saying is that pursuing this kind of
thing would be a good idea here's a
second version of this that I just think
is a nice little end Lani app at the end
this is the the Allen brain atlas an
amazing atlas of mouse Braden's
developed by Paul Allen's funding from
Paul Allen one of the early Microsoft
developers and and it basically costs
100 million dollars to develop and it
has all these really really cool ways of
imaging and slicing mouse brains so you
can basically do virtual all kinds of
virtual stuff on mouse brains even if
you're sitting at a terminal in Kinshasa
or Kyoto or wherever so this was a we
got some of the publicly available
material from the Allen site and simply
made it a mash up in the lair of Google
Maps so now you can Lear it right and
again this is something just I didn't
think anybody thought about doing it and
this has already been picked up by one
of the big bioinformatics networks which
has a hundred million dollars worth in
funding this was done with basically
chewing gum and baling wire and 25 hours
40 volunteers time the point is that
stuff that on the level of traffic maps
or crime data all of you have thought
about a million times and said that's
trivial I'll never get anywhere by doing
that in the science world has not yet
been tried I just I really want to say
big frontier here really big frontier so
to be done what is what's needed money
smart people it is embarrassing to come
to Google and talk about search
technology particularly one that talks
about the Semantic Web
I'm sure that there are all kinds of
things wrong with the neuro Commons
model we've got we've got here I'm sure
that there's buggy it may be that the
process that we imagine which is that
going forward we have an almost like
Wikipedia like process of Correction
where somebody who's working on
Alzheimer's says to his graduate
students okay your job is to go in and
make sure that this incredibly bugging
your comments thing is right about our
area of science so we can use it in the
lab and that's your responsibility go in
and check it and since each assertion
leads back to an article right it's a
simple footnote that just refers to an
article it's easy for you to read the
article and goes wait hunger doesn't
cause the absence of food it's the
absence of food that causes hunger you
idiot and flip the causal sign and so
make the neuro Commons better that's the
way we imagine it getting better a
bigger and bigger community with more
and more people thinking about what they
can do that's the great thing about the
comments right is that there's always
someone who has something smarter to do
with your content than you thought of
all right that's the secret of the
comments smart people money more
experimentation and I think a conceptual
shift a shift that starts to look at the
world of science and say what if we took
everything that we have learned about
networks about the way that networks
function i think the world wide web of
networks about the way that search works
on networks about the way that
distributed creativity could work across
networks and let's figure out which of
those can be translated into the world
of science not all of them can of course
but some of them could and it would be
really exciting so I hope that you find
out of interest science Commons org is
where you can find a lot of this
information and that's my contact thank
you very much
questions
sorry is a software open source so
graceful cuz I've been asked to repeat
the questions it's just so the remote
audience can hear them so the question
is is the software open source right now
the all of the data and the tools that
we are developing is open source bsd
license the tools we use to do the
initial text recognition that is
proprietary although its output is is of
course available freely next stage would
be developing open source excellent
scientific text recognition software for
lots and lots of areas of science
because the proprietary software is
expensive interestingly we've had very
great very generous support from to
proprietary companies Tara node and
millennium pharmaceuticals who've
allowed us to use their systems and in
some case even to release their systems
under to release versions of their
systems under open licenses and they
believe I think I don't want to put
words in their mouth let me rephrase
this it may be that they believe that
there is a kind of open source model
here where there's room for a lot of
companies to exist on top of a giant
Commons of science information the same
way that say IBM or Red Hat exist in the
free software world right and this is
something we don't currently have in the
sciences that will obviously you know it
very well but in answer to your question
I think one next stage would be let's
not just deliver the stack that the
neuro commons kernel as open source or
even our search interface as open source
let's have the stuff that generated in
the first place and make that open
source to there are open source versions
of that search technology but right now
it's not as good the stuff that does the
text recognition in the first place
there any efforts underway to get
scientific researchers to deliver their
work product in the form of structured
data in the first place
yeah great question so are there any
efforts to get scientists to deliver
their data pre structured pre meta data
encoded there have been some attempts
and they've all failed massively one
reason why we went this route which is
trying to figure it out egg post hoc
with software is because it was
impossible to make it happen beforehand
now i can imagine one way in which that
would happen which is if the nih said
0.5% of every grant is for metadata
encoding of the results and you have
it's a deliverable right you don't get
your final payment until we see your
whatever it would be RDF triples
whatever it is that says the here my
hypothesis materials and whatever that
would definitely work like Creative
Commons this is the second best private
fix posthawk rather than the public
structuring ex ante
the graduate student power
secretary right right actual questions
validating the results of making sure
that
excellent so the question is suppose how
are we going to improve the results one
idea i had mentioned was the idea of
having curation by graduate students
after the fact to make sure that the
assertions were correct and one obvious
concern which often raised about things
like wikipedia is can we trust this
material and obviously in the sciences
you would say well this is maybe even
more important than knowing whether you
know someone song a particular song or
not right so does it need peer review I
think the answer of how we might end up
having various forms of peer review is
still TBD right to be decided will that
will be developed but here's the reason
why I don't think it's too much of a
problem each one of these assertions is
in the form of X causes Y or so says
this article right at this page or this
abstract right so that's what it is so
when that is being used by someone all
they are getting is what is effectively
a hyperlink to an article the actual
information they need is in the article
and it's not being given to you know
Joel a person who's going to go on and
do like brain surgery on himself it's be
its users are scientists who are expert
in their particular area so I think
therefore that while we would obviously
never accept one to accept any kind of
errors if there are errors they are
easily discarded by the person looking
at them and easily perhaps even you
would hope corrected at the moment when
they're discovered i got this in the
search page and it's wrong just as when
you scan a search engine page in an area
you're familiar with you rule out those
that's that's nonsense right that's just
garbage that's an accident of the search
and focus on the others so I think that
makes it acceptable to have a less
expensive level of peer review having
said that it might be that there are sub
specialties or particular areas where
people might want to say we want our
core of material and our scientific
field to be like beyond reproach with a
zero error rate and that would simply
require them then to come in and insert
their excellent validation structure on
top of it
of course the benefit of an open system
is they could and it would be
distributed and that would be entirely
up to them but that's me just guessing
of how it might evolve we've certainly
got some autism Alzheimer's and
Huntington researchers who seem
interested in doing something like that
excellent question so what beyond biomed
biomed we picked because the problems of
huge the human impact is obviously
enormous and there had been some
existing efforts particularly in the
form of open journals where we thought
we could you know maybe leverage some
stuff but we have preliminary contacts
with people in the geospatial data area
I think it'd be very important for
things like environmental science we've
worked in the past with people like the
people who are doing the the National
map where those sort of all these
different layers of data about the
country in there there's been a lot of
interest from anthropologists and
archaeologists who would love the idea
that everything that you have about a
site would be able to play together with
all of the other information about that
site so that researchers from other
disciplines could come in and actually
find the thing that they needed because
the the two types of data which are
currently incompatible would actually be
meshed together the model of the neuro
common strikes me as scalable across
many disciplines obviously different
text search mechanisms you need an
archaeology specific one anthropology
specific one but we have a lot of
interest for people in those areas in
physics and high energy physics there's
already much more of an going concern
that's working on these the high-energy
physics and astronomical people are way
ahead on this archive org has really
done you know excellent stuff on this in
the the Human Genome Project has
obviously released a vast amount of
material Sanger and welcome trusts and
the whole push behind the human genome
project and the Bermuda cord was to get
this kind of data out there so research
on evolutionary biology and so forth is
perhaps more
in certain areas but basically I think
it's just a matter of enthusiasm and
money to scale this out to other areas
seem to be more reticent to do anything
new so the
it's really good idea edition
students time on this instead of
right so the question is how do you how
do you get scientists to buy into this
because there they can be more reticent
and getting going which by the way I
entirely agree justifiably scientists
don't want to waste their time doing
something if it turns out that it's not
going to yield the first thing is you
have to give them something that's
already useful right so don't come to
them with an idea come to them with a
search engine that already yields some
results and ideally some of which are
wrong right because then they go well
this is right but that's stupid right
the harnessing of the that stupid
impulse is a very powerful idea you know
that needs to be fixed right you mean
this is the way open source software
works right it's like you the person who
reports the bug you know it's much more
likely to fix it so I think that's one
thing I think a second thing is for a
lot of these people are the abstractions
of the open source web 2.0 search
community are completely outside of the
frame of reference and they also
understandably are in a world which has
a prestige economy that's in a
particular way so they might be you know
very you know keen to share but they're
go you know I kind of weren't you I
spent all this time developing this
plasmid and I send it over to that woman
in the other lab and now she scooped me
you know I think it's hard for you to
convince someone to say no you'll be
better off if you share so long as lots
of other people do there's a scale
problem so the answer there is to move
at every level so for example the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute which is after
the Nobel probably the single most
prestigious prize instead of biomedical
research science and so forth fully
funds and I need fully every single
thing in the labs of the people that it
supports who are brilliant genius
scientists those people already operate
in a kind of sort of semi commons or
close carbons where they they're sort of
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute says
we encourage you to share among all of
the other people in this network right
so you find networks like that that
already exist that have already begun
the process and you find people like
funders who have some ability to say
this will lead to bigger grants for you
or renewal of your grants and you
encourage them to do it and finally you
work with the journals
so for example we've been talking to the
public library of science about plus one
which is a for putting up tree pier for
putting up journals putting up journal
articles in sort of a early stage or
without going through a complete it is
peer-reviewed but it's not completely
peer-reviewed in the way that their
flagship journals are and they're
thinking about implementing this so if
you talk about a material in here we
want you to use this system so i think
if you approach it at every level and
give people incentives to do it then
that will build the level of content and
it's very similar to what we did with
Creative Commons licenses at the
beginning how do you persuade people to
do it you know when there aren't any
other there's no other material you try
and get it embedded in Flickr right you
try and get it in you know companies
like magnitude you try and you know you
basic make it pervasive so that you see
it everywhere and then you get people to
uptake and then at that point the cycle
starts it's a great question
just a little lighter a lot of interest
internationally and we're only limited
by the fact that we we don't mean we
already have people who we want to be
working with internationally basically a
limitation of funds two kinds of
partnerships here I think one is that
we're a lot of foundations who have been
very resistant to fun science
infrastructure in the developing world
because they're focused on the developed
excuse me in the have been resistant to
funding science infrastructure in the
developed world because what they want
to do is build research capacity in the
developing world I think we're beginning
to convince them that if you fix the
problem globally then you fix the
problem globally which is like includes
everywhere and so that's a bridge which
has enabled us to get people in other
countries to work with it the other
thing is that their existing efforts
through things like the European Union
in the OECD where we've had a lot of
interest in these kinds of initiatives
and again it's just a matter of once
you've got a working prototype you're a
lot further along and basically these
two things that I described to you the
newer Commons and the MTA are ready for
launch in the next two months so we
think we hope work launched at a very
alpha crude buggy level but launch
nevertheless and so we'll be launching
with you know 5,000 plasmids already pre
licensed for example and lots and lots
of science scientists and labs
committing to so once we get that then I
think the international interest will
accelerate one more question and then
we're done
