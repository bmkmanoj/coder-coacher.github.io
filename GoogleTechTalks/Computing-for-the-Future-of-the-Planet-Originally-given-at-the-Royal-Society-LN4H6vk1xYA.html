been at Google about four months I work
on web performance so if you have a slow
website you'll be running into me soon
I'd like to introduce Andy hopper for
today's tech talk I'm gonna do a little
short bio and he got his PhD at the
University of Cambridge in 1978 in the
field of communication that works as
part of that he helped create the camp
Cambridge fast ring that had speeds of
100 megabits per second back in 1980
he's now the professor of computer
technology and head of the computer
laboratory in addition to his work in
the academic field
he's co-founded a dozen companies
including acorn computers and adaptive
broadband he's a fellow of the Royal
Society and Royal Academy of Engineering
and he's also a fellow at Corpus Christi
College in 2007 he received the order of
commander of the British Empire CBE
which is a distinction held by fewer
than 9000 people at any time he's
married and has two children and has an
airstrip next to his house in Cambridge
so he likes flying and so without any
further ado Andy hopper talking about
computing for the future of the planet
thank you
it's not best represent in central
Cambridge it's just just on the outside
so number one which is slightly
complementary to this we're having a the
department at the computer laboratory a
PhD show Intel to industry at the end of
September and I hope this is aimed at
probably a small group of CTO types from
industry primarily and so I very much
hope Google will participate and send
people who can interact with us and
judge for themselves and recruit and
talk to talk and interact with our PhD
students primarily and we have very good
ones and we're quite a big production
line of PhDs many of them work in Google
so there's a little
draft program okay what I'll talk about
thought about for several years having
been exposed to the more conventional
sustainability issues to do with civil
engineering water that sort of thing and
so this perspective on how computing
might have a role in the future of the
planet represents a sort of assertive
engineering approach to what is our
place in all this and what we can
actually do about this so it's a
framework it's a perspective and within
that there are many many projects which
go on and they can go to a level of
detail which even the most professional
engineer would find satisfying but today
I'll probably talk mostly about the
higher level things just to give you a
flavor of this and my own interests
range from the more academic type of
thing to business and P&amp;amp;L and they'll
cruise across this boundary and try and
point out things that are a little more
forward-looking and then I'll mention
one or two companies which already doing
some of this stuff primarily in the
Cambridge area because that's the one
that's the area I'm most familiar with
but it's all summarized over here we
believe that computing is a crucial
weapon it's the pacemaker of the planet
it will help optimize physical resources
and that there will be the use of
physical resources will be substituted
by doing things in a digital world
and we also envisage that the developing
world population growth in the
developing world will be enabled in
other words their wealth creation in the
developing world in cyberspace is
actually by doing stuff digitally and
I'll try and illustrate what I think why
I think that my talk
so there are four categories of things
that we think of an optimal digital
infrastructure
so that's your computers your networks
all that sort of stuff the notion of
sensing the world and then optimizing
something in digital space which
hopefully it's more energy efficient
than whatever you're trying to target
and then reacting to that thirdly is
modeling the world both short term and
longer term in a better way so we are
more confident in what might be
happening and finally these digital
alternatives to physical activities we
all go to cyberspace you're not happy
okay I'll mainly talk about one and two
I'll touch on three and four and then
I'll summarize it okay I want to go to a
key on biodegradable chips or recyclable
computers those are thoughts what I'll
just be sort of much more down-to-earth
I like to think
so let's start off with and I'll start
accelerating in a minute and go a little
faster optimum digital infrastructure
what do we think that might be with our
perspectives on that yeah one of the
biggest operators of digital
infrastructure on the planet here at
Google
so provisioning appropriate availability
is one thing then energy efficient
computing and then finally our version
of perhaps a slightly weird outlying
overall goal in all this so let's start
off with provisioning appropriate
availability and just start working up
so currently I serve something about
server farms the sort of things you have
in tens and hundreds of thousands let's
just take a look at what it looks like
now from a redundancy point of view we
have the computer equipment and we sort
of start doubling and tripling and
quadrupling up on the main supply the
Union interruptible / supplies all that
sort of stuff and in many situations
certainly the ones I visited big data
centers in the UK that are accessible to
be there is a large amount of support
equipment which substantially increases
the energy cost doubles the energy cost
so we need to at least start off by
reducing this redundancy level of
redundancy in is standby stuff in order
to reduce this duplication while at the
same time improving the restart times of
services which can be about four hours
currently so that's a that's the
beginning
but we can we can move on we can have a
look at the actual data centers
themselves the data center is becoming
much more of a programming problem
rather than just have a duplication and
start that up when appropriate so we
have this notion of adaptive more more
programmable data centers where we can
observe what's happening in different
modules of the data center and be able
to recover from many many more failure
conditions also have much clearer cut
service agreements boundaries for
functions to be done and in particular
we can start increasing the cost of
energy or at least accounting for the
cost of energy in this stuff in more
substantive ways or you know both in
terms of the hardware support the power
supply supporting all that and also in
the way you map some of these basic
modules processes software tasks onto
machines we can start running closer to
to the wire and that will be a good
thing and there'll be energy benefits
from that point of view in particular we
have a goal which is to scale energy use
throughout all this actually throughout
everything all digital infrastructure
that's one of the sort of goals with
useful emphasis useful work done at all
levels and by useful I mean is doing
something for somebody it's as an end
user essentially not in standby at any
level so we'd like this energy used to
be scalable in that sort of way and we
might wish to achieve that to you know
develop some principles which might be
switch it off if not in use that's sort
of more academic thing maybe low power
is enough but actually let's see switch
it off the switching things on enough
forces computing problems done send data
if not wanted it's that principle we
break that one all the time
designed by the networking know where
traffic is coming from the security the
energy cost of the security issues you
know spam
security problems all that has a you
know significant and then in due course
perhaps concentrate BAPS will have to
concentrate on whether photonics or or
plastics for for displays or things like
that on technologies which are very good
from the point of energy and scale
legally or even better the faster you go
the more efficient it is which is which
is the case to some extent with with
photonics so let's have a look at a
single server and let's have a quick
look at the power utilization and the
energy costs of a server these these are
spectrum arts new spectrum arts antigen
spec files Xeon processor and what we
have here are three loads and they're
just different but there's no meaning
really between this tree and on the
bottom you've got utilisation and on the
side you go powering what so it shows
you that the power consumption is
several hundred one two three four four
three hundred watts to three hundred
watts
when the thing is idle so it's the power
and then unless it's being used a lot if
it's either much of the time then the
actual energy use is is even even worse
so this isn't this isn't very good it's
not energy proportional because I'm not
switching it off at this point zero is
still using something and it's idle
quite a lot of the time so we need to
pack the jobs better and this is again
at all levels this is a
you know works workstation a motherboard
if you like one of my students has been
looking just as this dries you know the
energy you've seen detailer and this
Drive and reading consumes more than
writing and you do four times more reads
and writes and you can start factoring
that in the way you lay out a file on
the disk changes and even at that little
level you can get improvements they're
not going to double or treble your
improvements may be substantial say what
might be ten percent 15 percent actually
throughout the whole infrastructure that
might add up to something so server
consists of more than disks so now if we
got a server for a multiple server
situation this is what things might look
like along the bottom I've got a number
of servers again powering what's on the
left-hand side the spec marks are the
same but now what I'm doing is showing
in each case a red graph which is the
optimal situation where we start using
the first one up to 100% utilization we
switch in the second one move across on
that one and so on and so forth where's
the gray ones the same size of clusters
are safe five where you're not moving
things around so the you know it's five
times whatever the idols utilization
energy to isolation available
now if we stopped switching off machines
that aren't in use we approach the red
line and we start doing energy
proportional computing has been an
excellent paper from you at Google at on
energy proportional computing so we need
to move these tasks between machines we
might be able to delay some tasks so
that we achieve the red roots rather
than the gray one and there isn't much
in the shape of these sort of things so
how can we achieve this and you know
it's getting there so it's really not
too bad it depends what's your
computation you know what your framework
is if you don't mind the applications
knowing about this then there's a
technique called load concentration
which can assign the jobs to different
machines and you can get a 30 to 80
percent improvement something we're a
little more familiar with in the
complete lab in Cambridge is Zen which
is a virtualization system kernel where
you can move images around between
machines then it's the storage area
network context so the data copy is
faster because you have that sort of
assumption and you can move tasks
between servers in something like 250
milliseconds downtime perhaps a little
faster this is on 1 Gigabit Ethernet and
60 seconds elapsed time but I would give
it Ethernet
the measured elapsed time is around 10
seconds rot analysis it's getting better
so these are conservative figures you
can go further and the Zen source was
bought by citrix master cambridge
company and solar flare is a 10 gigabit
ethernet chip company with fed physical
layer and network controller and the 10
seconds is on on a configuration using
that network controller and you know the
numbers will keep on improving and if
kind of we can go back to the good old
days of almost batch computing or we can
categorize the different jobs between
indexing which is easily distribute all
this is what you are able to do
simulation so-called scientific
computing climate models then the way
you can actually delay these things and
restructure the compute task is easier
so you know it looks it looks it looks
doable we're approaching that sort of
thing so so far so good so far so
obvious in a sense although those
engineering detail and you know they
could be depending on your data model
whether you're doing computing PI and
that's what you're reloading or whether
you're taking your you know billion
photographs and you're moving those
around at three bytes per pixel and you
know 10 megapixels each quite different
but nevertheless so far so obvious it'll
be difficult so where can we go beyond
that so here is perhaps a little more
forward-looking academic perspective so
what we can conceive of is not just
moving the computer ops to where the
energy is cheap which is something you
google do already on the premise that
it's easier to move jobs than to bring
the energy but actually keep chasing the
so-called sustainable energy around the
world to where it's actually being
generated right now and quickly use up
any capacity energy capacity that's
being generated that would otherwise be
lost that's the important point so it's
kind of free lunch computing because you
can't use it for anything else and yet
you can move computing to where it's
actually being produced so on the Left
we you know windmill with a Sun
container full of servers and it's a
daemons up in the sea where you know
it's easier to get a fiber-optic cable
to the than to bring the energy out and
the sort of research questions are at
what sort of
regularity issue these jobs be shipped
what is your data model what do we
should program data both what what is
the application
and the these access patterns the size
of the jobs the data collections need to
be modeled to give us an answer to those
questions which is one of the tasks
being done by some of my research
students just to see how fanciful this
is but if it's actually not fanciful
then it will have two benefits it'll not
just have a benefiting that the
computing that gets done on systems
where the energy would otherwise be lost
the other way around the business case
for putting up a system say a wimp our
system improves because now you can sell
something and actually the economics of
doing it are potentially better so it's
you know if it works it's win-win and
this is computing so so let's now go a
little bit completely crazy if we were
redesigning the whole shooting match
putting service where that sort of
energy is could we do it so this is a
map of wind strength top is January
bottom is July white is lots and lots of
wind on average or bit of course this is
still going up and down and you can see
that you would want to put these
windmills in this case where the white
is but there are variations so they
remember the question do you ship it at
one second hundred milliseconds one you
know one milliseconds five seconds ten
second grand you'll arity I don't know
but imagine the world's computing so if
you have some huge number of server
farms you know some around here or
whatever and you know you just ship this
stuff there it's it's it's free-lunch
computing and providing you account for
the construction cost of the server
itself and you know all that the energy
component of that this might be a winner
so this is sort of wind related
we'd like to have a latency map of what
it takes a live latency map for the
world based on this when Solar is is is
of course also important and again do
you move things according to whether the
cloud is passing or not good question
and perhaps even more sort of
realistically combined heat and power
might become combined heat and power in
any computing I can get hold of so you
put a computer with the heat and power
plant right which is very mainstream so
generating electricity you're giving up
some heat so it's giving you heating but
you also have a computer that which can
absorb this sort of load and all of a
sudden you know you've got another
infrastructure you can place jobs on and
again if that can be sold and the
business case for having it combined
heat and power installation becomes more
attractive so you get an idea where I'm
going here improve servers make it more
programmable flexible and then we end up
with this overall goal and the other
goal is
in terms of this optimal digital
infrastructure is in extreme form switch
off components that are not in use and
achieve energy proportional computing at
all levels and then if possible do the
computing the energy proportional
computing in situations where the energy
can't be used otherwise that's the
overall goal and if computing you know
continues to it's only two or three
percent of any world what energy use at
the moment but if it ends up being
twenty percent a decade or two from now
then this might be a way of dealing with
it and let's sort of invert this and say
what does it mean in terms of components
server farms networks workstations and
terminals well I've mentioned what what
it might be in terms of server farms
redundant adaptive energy efficient and
then pre-lunch
the same thing can be applied I haven't
talked today but networks you can switch
off the networking parts and repackage
networks so that the utilization is high
and switch off the ones that aren't in
use so you know maybe this is time zones
where it's dark like in telephony old
days you follow the Sun around the world
and you read I mention the network's
workstations are banned in this setting
because they're absolute the pit right
so we don't have workstations are
centralized so they're deleted sorry
gone and terminals are thin so they're
thin stateless and there's low power as
you can when I say state is that means
you can restart them easily elsewhere in
other words you can reconnect its
virtualization but the other way around
you can connect your job wherever it's
gone rather than you running round
and of course there should be designed
in appropriate ways using for example
some of the plastic this place that are
coming a lot which inherently you know
flexible that sort of thing which
inherently are going to be very
attractive low-energy terminals low
energy consuming Seminoles and companies
like plastic logic in Cambridge are
commercializing that sort of thing or a
company called VNC is doing the thin
client stuff which might be appropriate
stateless technology that suction widely
as many of you I guess use that okay so
that's my at the end of section one and
we'll see come back you know I mean I'd
like to have a little more information
about the way you run your server farms
to compare this with the go with one of
the biggest installations on the planet
so maybe that will be possible so let's
go on to number two sense and optimize
okay
so Google Earth Google space-time Google
everything okay so we got that the idea
is we have the whole world send stuff
modeled and represented in a computer in
real time everything that moves
everything so the question is how do we
do it Google Earth on steroids with spot
song and pots on whatever but the
proposition is I remind you that you
sense you optimize in the digital world
which has an energy benefit and then you
react to that optimization at least by
publishing the data or perhaps more than
publishing controlling something so here
are the sort of things that you have to
come up with but on this huge scale okay
so they're sensing itself in my group
anyway we're not particularly gang ho on
ad hoc wireless sensor networks although
we're very keen on managed and properly
engine or fully engineered sensor
networks so one of my students beau has
a LM oh no no from the cameron has
designed and market microprocessor
architecture which is got this energy
proportional computing stuff but for
this sensor part of it and this
reasonably scalable anyway so sensing is
important and also how do you publish
the data how do you how do you again
give you a thought process here if it
was possible to know what everybody's
car satellite nav set things are right
now just because it was brought you put
it in you say you know marry it or
whatever and it's broadcast that would
be a publication of data which the
transportation system could use to then
optimize something right so that's what
I mean
you sense and then you you know you make
the data available that's a little
instance which could be done right now
basically and then all these lovely
lovely problems how do you make a world
repository what other computation models
where is the data where is the computing
done all the traditional sort of thing
how do you index things how do you make
it to spot things and generate events
and then how to interpret all that not
just observe and react classified
optimized but predict something and
hopefully do something good as a result
of that
now in Cambridge both in the university
in various companies we've been immersed
in this sort of sensing indoors for
years and years and years you may recall
Xerox PARC had a project where they wore
badges and the one knew where people and
equipment were active badges well I sold
those badges to them and we've had them
in Cambridge since 1989 so in terms of
indoor location there is a tremendous I
mean a hundred and hundred hundred
people have lived this for many years so
the world model outside its kind of
inspired by what we can do indoors so
another company called UV sensors a
product an indoor fine-grain precision
location system whose precision is about
10 centimeters most of the time based on
active tags little tags you wear with
the battery and ultra wideband as the
time measuring component to give you the
location but just to give you a little
flavor of what would have to be repeated
on the world scale I'll show you some of
the things we do on the on the on the
inside building stuff so top left is a
picture of the real world with people
wearing sensors for wearing tags which
are being sent and all the digital
infrastructure being monitored as well
and here is this and putting to the
world model for indoors and then here is
a visualization a synthetic view of the
same thing and if I plugged you the
video this people would be moving around
and things would be changing color
according to the digital status of that
equipment so achieving good coverage
there is itself problematic and then you
can start interpreting that world model
just to give you a little flavor of this
sort of thing what what you might be
able to do on the world scale so this is
a room the yellow things are sightings
of a tag in different places and you can
stop doing algorithms which for examples
observe whether the tag moved from one
Square to the left or up or down a
linkage diagram you can prune that tree
and you can end up with representations
of these sightings which are like this
which sort of indicates where people
might have warped
table may or may not have been scanned
in it observed these in some other way
so interpreting this world model on a
world scale or other indoor scale is
interesting and making sure it's right
and up-to-date is another issue
consistency and dependability so here is
a room this is a picture of a room where
a table has been moved from the middle
of the room to the side of the room and
because you've got sort of side effects
of the location systems you can pick up
inconsistencies and bring them to the
attention of the appropriate authority a
sort of autonomic computer we've been
doing some interesting work on outdoors
as well it's mainly based around the
notion of a sensor car so we've had this
sensor car for several years now and
basically I don't know when you're
recruiting Google do you show that and
then when you turn up you get one of
these I don't know that's that's the way
we did with PhD students so you come and
work on this project that's what it
looks like but in practice it's about
anyway it's got all kinds of networks so
the automatically dumped stuff
and in particular it's got sensors
camera out camera in pollution of
various kinds of course GPS all that
sort of stuff so that's our platform
which we sense Cambridge basically and
throw things in but towards the future
we'd think for example of the digital
farming stress structure with sensors on
those digital phones as something that
you could have worldwide fairly quickly
possibly because the backgrounds exist
feeding into a federated in other words
an open a public in some sense global
repository and here are some results
from the outdoors that we've been doing
so this is mapping this spectrum
justing the scale this is Cambridge and
these are roads and the different colors
represent 3G signal strength and
coverage so it's a map of 3G coverage
and when they cannot cÃ©vennes up because
it can be quite a lot of data this is
all uploaded to the repository and we
have that and yet another cambridge
company c RFS is doing the hardware
which actually will put in a again a
countrywide botany course perhaps global
spectrum sensing system for you know the
cost which is possibly affordable more
generally we doesn't also forget humans
as sensors because all very well this
automation but that's not the only
saying much of the planet in
particularly the developing world may be
covered by human sensors and here are
some examples of the sort of thing
that's been done this is a human sensor
now is put in by hand map of Cambridge
and you get you know different kind of
information about the pub in this sort
of map than you do in the Ordnance
Survey are sort of mapping agency and
perhaps being able to do this in the
developing world use human sensors in
other words with the appropriate
incentives will help us have a global
eco repository which doesn't just
incorporate Google Earth here but
elsewhere but how to make the data
consistent how to have perhaps voting
systems or reputation systems to make
sure that this sort of thing which is
done Joleen Eisley by some group of
people in Cambridge actually scales as a
human sensor system worldwide who knows
there is something that I think is a
little more specific or be the huge
project for the future so in one of the
London boroughs the London borough of
Haringey is the narrow plain area
further to produce infrared maps of
streets and most energies gone go
through the roof from heating
countrywide so if you can observe that
maybe you can influence actually it's
who's growing pot is they have the
application because you know maybe it's
in that house there or whatever never
mind all that
so this is an example of one of the
layers that might be shown in a you know
layer the series of layers are that
interpret and present the world model to
you and there is an interesting question
you know what would happen I would be an
enthusiast of this if this sort of data
was made available and people could
write whatever applications they want I
think that would boot strap it up
substantially
now let me just say a few words because
it's important and unavoidable about the
ethics the security all this sort of
stuff so first of all I'm assuming that
it's just goes forwards we will measure
whether individual behavior is affected
by the data being presented generated
and presented and let's assume that from
an engineering point of view with
designing are the dangers is done
sensibly there are control mechanisms
gates and if the failure modes are
taking care of both in these sort of
straightforward sense and in direct
sense now this picture is of a queue
voting for voting in South Africa some
years ago and the question is why do we
kill you I did these people queue up why
do they choose to actually do that and
what does that tell us anything about
the dilemmas that what I've talked about
presents because this sensing
observation reaction is Big Brother on
the one hand but on the other hand it
might be positive so there are various
dilemmas I helped write a report for the
Royal Academy of Engineering on this on
this topic so there are value dilemmas
which are between what's valuable for a
community versus what's valuable for an
individual there are privacy ones which
are things like control versus
convenience and non limited versus
crime-prevention
they're dilemmas and we make our call
but you know it's not all one way or the
other
dilemmas of the stake holding couric so
privacy versus efficient and and
governance in the sense of is the
business model driven thing market
driven thing is it a non market driven
saying that big cap driven thing legal
thing again yeah so there dilemmas and
I'm very keen to communicate with the
average person so to speak the man or
woman in the street to present this
thing and you know have a refill of you
and on this Big Brother issue what is
this surveillance scenario at the moment
it's a big mess
it's who knows what it is you can think
of some of this as being Big Brother but
in the other hand actually the you know
part of this you might be that we're big
brothers of each other that this is a
citizen's themselves when you take a
mobile phone photograph you're being you
know a big brother as a citizen yourself
one principle as a result of all this
work we've done with the indoor location
and knowing or having data which
indicates but where people are without
this notion of reciprocity watching the
Watchers is key to this that is very
important to put that in what I can do
to you you can do to me right everything
else has to have special permission but
providing that's the case actually at
least in the benign environments that
we've worked this seems to seems to be
okay all right so that's this sense
world model optimized so let's just move
on briefly to the predict and react and
cyberspace so predicting react if I
could remind you that's about
essentially using computer power to
optimize something and then optimize the
energy and I'll talk just briefly about
shorter term and then longer term stuff
so in the shorter term other Cambridge
forgive me about all this Cambridge but
that's the world I'm familiar with
canvas is a company that does routing
software you know at the moment so it
tries to know what's going on whether
whether traffic is at least where the
roads are and does your routing and you
know how irritating it is at the moment
if you want to change your it slightly
you can put an intermediate point and
another intermediate point and might
take it and you don't quite understand
what's happening and then any kind of
perturbation in data you don't have that
normally too much but you will in due
course if you have Road charging or
carbon data front you know there'll be
perturbations in the data which means
those algorithms current algorithms are
pragmatic so what these lot have come up
Alan Jones and his colleagues is a set
of algorithms which give you
for any two places they're substantially
different routes that are available and
are not too sensitive to perturbations
which might be as a result of some kind
of carbon charging or carbon measuring
or some measure like that they build a
tree out from each source to each
possible destination they build a tree
out from each destination to each
possible source they overlay those two
and it turns out that you get plateaus
of maximal overlapping of those trees
which turn out to be the substantial
different roots brilliant absolute super
but going forward is exactly what's
necessary to make the average consumer
understand what's happening with Road
pricing or common in terms of their
choices they're real just choices so
that's predict reacting the in the in
the shorter term and predicting react in
the longer term meaning more substantial
computing looks something like this so
this is the current worldwide
standardize this picture weather related
infrastructure well there are standards
measurements are taken to a standard
computing algorithms are agreed and
those shots and optic charts we get are
produced on a rotating basis in in three
centers around the globe so that's a
good example but actually the so called
scientific computing by enlarge in my
humble opinion has not encompassed the
best computing computer science
principle it's been mainly concerned
with the result and how to get there and
throw more computer power at it rather
than how the computation is done and so
I think we need to at least improve
possibly restart on these so-called
scientific high-end computing tasks
which might be predicting global warming
for example in order to make sure that
the underlying things are accurate and
correct in terms of the model in the
formal sense possibly
that they use the latest data and in
particular work to a deadline not just
finished when the time comes for example
an application that we think of might be
in the computational ecology area where
you've got bird flu for argument's sake
you've observed it here you've got some
model which is running where it might go
and then you get a new observation and
you can't ignore that it's happening
right so it's no good carrying over that
computation so you've got to have a
quantization of the applied mathematics
for starters that'll learn the computing
tasks in order to take that in okay and
then of course I want to run all this on
the kind of infrastructure I talked
about earlier so I can accelerate the
computational parts bring the results
sooner by throwing it at server farms of
the type I've described but in an energy
proportional way
and the last one digital alternatives to
to physical things so this is a lovely
shot which is in the computing chart is
a ecological footprint chart for
different continents so on the left
the scale is hectares per person on
average
in terms of its ecological footprint
that's being used and the bio capacity
I'm told in in equivalent units and you
can see that we in North America Western
Europe up here so how do we deal with
this how do we especially in the
developing will make it possible for
them to have high standards of living
but without forcing that footprint so
maybe its life in cyberspace so this
this is this slightly rhetorical slide
it ends up saying good news or bad news
so we've gone from physical to digital
in in a number of many things so when
you buy music these days you do it
digitally don't tend to go and drive to
get the plastic to get the CD to come
back you download it it that may be good
news I'm not actually sure this is this
is I'm not sure I'm going to try and
have a view on this but say well is
buying CDs or doing shopping or
electronic media the newspaper online
that seems to be the possibility that
there is more wealth in inside the space
how might we calibrate this so here is
the sort of flagship thing which one
might wish to do and I'm looking at this
from a real computing point of view but
we've would like to have a personal
energy meter which tells me how much
energy I'm using both direct indirect
that's the galactic goal right so my
proportion of leaning on this lectern
here you know there'll be a tiny little
energy cost because I've used it a
little bit let's let's go extreme now we
can try and approach that and try and
measuring things you know traditional
stuff and I've hope that buying being
able to present to users what their true
personal energy uses are direct and
indirect we would at least have an
effect on their behavior
and of course we want to break it down
into different things there's a lovely
effort open-source effort in the UK
called carbon hero where they basically
use location information about mobile
phones they work out whether you're on a
train because of your doing 60 miles an
hour and it coincides with a railway
line you're on a train so that's your
energy cost so they give you a attempt
or a figure which is an attempt that
your personal as years and even if it's
not far aback chily just getting people
to think in that way I think is hugely
important but from a computing point of
view again it's a lovely lovely set of
challenges research pragmatic
engineering theoretical kind of stuff
because I want to upload my own use I
want to incorporate all these things and
their energy component for this measure
I want to index it cash it all this sort
of stuff a little bit of prediction
secure the privacy and possibly you know
social networking has is very popular
now but I would like to participate in a
social network which affects me one way
or the other as a result of these
readings being shared or talked about or
whatever here review peer pressure and
have you fast forward to the developing
world where they to have such a thing
again that will inform the choices about
this sort of infrastructure as they
build because if you drive a car and it
goes down the road and you can for the
road you cancel the car in terms of
energy and you compare that to doing the
equivalent thing digitally it may be
that this indicates influences is a
method of accelerating the cyberspace
version of some of this informs the
cyberspace version of some of this in in
their choices as as you go forward
so we'll see whether we can shift to
cyberspace in some subtractive way on an
ultra cheap platform that everybody
around the world has many skill power
and so on and so forth
pragmatic issues today are just and you
just announced some stuff about sharing
data and being kind of the middle ground
for some of the social networking
activities and profiles so how to scale
up virtual worlds is one of the sort of
main things going on right now some all
of us finished in summary the computing
for the future of the planet perspective
is the proactive engineering context
within which I my group my department
and I hope many others will do their
projects it tries to list and I
mentioned the problems and certain
numbers to them for example you can do a
back of envelope computation and work
out how much data it would take to
represent the whole world for everything
and that's doable I think to the general
public it may be a good way of
presenting what we do because at the
moment energy use isn't desperately high
but it's growing and at some stage we
might be surprised by a more critical
perspective on us and this is a good way
of indicating representing and why we
should exist and why we're important the
National Academy of Engineering has
published some of this and Google
participated and it did have a lot of
press some you know very pleased to that
but this is the most important comment
here this whole thing contemplates the
unbounded upside of computing right
let's come to you you can only build a
certain number of roads so to speak but
computing the digital divert role is
essentially unbounded and the changes in
a Google twenty years ago not existing
just the very first indexing systems
really being done think for 20 years
it's unbounded so it may have
substantial changes there and I hope
I've given you a template for those and
this finally thank you very much is part
of the motley motley crew but this is
these are some of the faces including my
daughter and my son but it's just by the
way and the other end of the spectrum
top right professors maurice wilkes who
is head of the department in the past
was head of department in the past and
still comes in many days and tells us
well he thinks what i've talked about is
sensible or not thank you very much
Russians comments disagreements
I like your idea of dynamic computing
following power
would you think that we would
it's sub-segments happening radius and
the power with your own speak for them
you better actually have distributed
power generation as well
which power generation yeah yeah okay so
that's what I meant combined heat in
power look so the academic perspective
is let's take this to the limit let's
switch it all off and let's see if we
can have a single windmill which is so
big it's completely the way drives the
world's computing power that's absurd
but you know it's an endpoint of the
spectrum yeah exactly right so that's
fine and you know a PhD students will
look at that and we'll have models and
we'll have a comment on it as well as
wonderful PhD reality is probably going
to be one step back from there but I
don't know quite how far this might go
because you know it is back to
centralization back to that sort of
stuff
and in many ways not just energy just
making this stuff work right dealing
from a professional point of view with
infrastructures that might be a good
idea however in practice is going to be
an evolution because actually this is
going to end up as product and you're
going to be say I'd be surprised if it's
diktat I mean unless the whole global
warming scenario goes completely nuts
bad nuts it'll be here is a bit of
software with rearranges jobs on a farm
and here's your immediate return on
investment mr. customer because you're
going to save some energy please they'll
say yes thank you very much I'll buy
that maybe there'll be some regulation
which says you have to have at least an
audit trail you the company of how you
use energy before so the government of
California the state of California buys
from you for argument's sake just and
sort of another version of the you know
standby power kind of perspective so I
think it's likely to develop somewhere
somewhere in between whether you know
whether combined heated power provides
enough over five I don't know we'll see
probably
you see be focusing on centralization
distribution
so for example we say workstations are
bad double recisions apparently
our central grid but it's a drawing
local power
I certainly want to use up all the
energy that can be used elsewhere and
there will be many situations where the
energy cannot or won't or just doesn't
make sense to be transmitted out for the
you know heavy stuff it probably does
make sense that my energy friends will
say you know we can put in a big energy
cable what's your problem and it's it's
a hugely you know huge pipe of energy
and I say fine fine but I'm trying to
find space and I think we found space to
evaluate where the role of this
computing which is unique in terms of
chasing a job and how it you know how it
finds out then that will have a place
now I don't know exactly where it'll end
up
there's lots of safe computing right now
southwest solar thermal makes sense yes
that's it that's a lot of the biggest
challenge is not actually yeah and
remember I'm making the point both ways
and for having power Jen here being the
person who putts
there's a small West Coast College
Island where they got this wonderful
windmill and they you know have 50
phones there and they're saying I never
so green but actually the cost of all
that in Energy's much worse than having
a very efficient diesel generator yet if
you have this sort of stuff it actually
might be that the cost the true cost if
they can export energy services sorry
computing services using that energies
is is business wise more sensible any
other cop disagree many disagree that's
gone
so I talked to engineers and other big
companies
of interest at work in addressing that
difference with me
power consumption of idle servers versus
off servers but if I read a right linear
bullet said that that power curve is
less important the large server farms
needs
the proposition there is that you can
more easily map the load on to the
resource you have just because you've
got more servers and more jobs which as
a proportion of the compute resource you
require are smaller and therefore is
just a easier as smoothing function if
you like
any other sir
with love which seven-course
one thing that I wonder what you are
respective insisted
thank you mentioned sort of Buckman's
it's on television right when offenders
you know Pepe so extent by surfers he
was very thin
Kotori Dadaism
historic systems that makes it
convenient very easy everything's hot
the fact that locality is absolutely
good right people do that many
if you actually store your data the
simple my place is sort of this model
County
storm system infinity
signifies wealth would be ideal
right incentive yes exactly absolutely
7:30
some physical things are on the world
that gas is not
yeah because of localities
yeah okay well you know criticize myself
a few and that's alright so there are
flaws potential flaws in this I don't
know it may be that the true energy cost
by the time you've shifted data isn't
that much better so that's flawed or the
performance doesn't work because you're
too distant from the computes and
therefore the network actually isn't
fast enough or in the digital space you
could in the cyber space you could say
of a webcam makes it travel more other
than less right so I know I know
so vlog vlog however in terms of
intellectual perspective you know there
is a line more pragmatically on its in
client stuff I just divided up into you
know realistically I say thin client to
me means stateless so I can restart it
and redo it but I might have all sorts
of graphics and visualization all sort
of local state which is for the purpose
of performance and I might cache all so
that you know and that's right a
difference so I think of stateless but
for all sorts of reasons when I need it
I might wish to have local thing which
might even go you know so having some of
the computer tasks closer but you know
discuss are one of the things I had is
latency map and how does this work does
it scale globally and that's you know
that's exactly the sort of thing I'm
trying to get a feel for and it's sort
of the boundaries of the problem reality
is going to be probably somewhere in the
middle but yeah so you know
but also you know you folks are very
confident in this company but you don't
do physics right you you so for example
displays will change the way we have
terminals with with flexible stuff and
you know the way we are presented with
data will continue to change it so
that's another interesting perspective
exactly how we take advantage of the new
physics then you send the plastic the
the you know channel all that sort of
stuff which will kind of a effect this
any other folks
one on your sensor this idea of sensors
and
open-source data sharing of sensitive
data made that's trying to actually do
exactly that people that you mentioned
that was an idea where is there somebody
working on creating an open source well
sensor networks have as a concept and as
sort of initial experiments have existed
for a long time so you know there all
sorts of things the most complete thing
I think is this hip and sensing and maps
actually kind of thing we will see which
one of these activities scales but you
know you know that to this is serious
this is not you know we the perspective
here is we depend on this so the way the
data is collected what the sensor was
was it calibrated was it timely was the
provenance of the data is it the true
data or is that phony one to do that
properly requires some serious
coordination so I think it's early dates
and all these efforts are great I mean
wonderful this way
duplication of effort is some of the sex
efforts you have to know the sweet
babboo
just an important idea the open-source
data sharing absolutely
I mean you okay we've got you know all
sorts of curious things you know rather
better up in United States so even
things like the Ordnance Survey map data
is you have to pay for that let alone
anything fancier the culture there isn't
to make that possible
again we'll see how this turns out one
of my former PhD students did a project
PhD where the answers to the questions
of how was it sensed what was the object
interface up from the module was very
computer science approach so you know
had modules you could place them all
over the place you could export data the
data was defined in the interface so it
was very computer science II kind of
thing maybe that's one approach to
standardization of this you have had the
other extreme just Rahl sort of sense of
facts plus a little bit you know
basically a number plus something about
what it might have been it it's early
days but III agree
right now thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
