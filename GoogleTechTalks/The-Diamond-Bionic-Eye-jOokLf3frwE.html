this Tech Talk I I went to Australia
over Christmas and I met Stephen power
who works on the Bionic guy and I and it
turned out he's coming in to San
Francisco for conference and I said well
I'd only come to Google because it is
really the most amazing thing I think
that's happening like in in medicine
these days and so he agreed to come and
so we get up to talk to you Louis thanks
very much and thank you all for coming
those who are here in person and those
who are here by the miracle of
teleconferencing I love being
interrupted so please feel free to ask
questions as we as we proceed now I
imagine that everyone in the room
recognizes this person from Star Trek
Geordi who is blind and you'll recognize
his visor which is sensitive not just a
visible light but to things like
tachyons and all sorts of interesting
particles but having the sensor having
detected those things he has two neural
implants on either side of his of his
temples with direct connection to his
brain and with the aid of this device he
has better than 20/20 vision because he
can see in the infrared and tachyons etc
but the basic idea is that he is he's
blind but he can see perfectly well by
bypassing the eye and going directly
into the brain and although we're not
quite at that level yet that is our goal
to make Geordi a reality and as you know
many of the things in Star Trek had been
made realities and about four years ago
the Australian government decided that
they wanted to build a bionic eye and
and started a big national programme
which is 42 million dollars for
Australia that is a lot of money for one
project and we took - with great
enthusiasm - trying to build this and
really turn Geordie into a reality
now in order to do that you need a big
team and one of the things that you
learn about trying to build a by only
guy is that only by having everyone
working together can you hope to
actually make something that actually
works and so one part of the team is the
is the people who build the sorry the
people who build Bionic ears and I don't
know if you are familiar with a cochlear
implant but this is a very very
sophisticated and successful device it
is pictured here with the with the
little coil that goes into the cochlea
and to make a long story short this
device has been implanted in 200,000
people across the world now 80% of those
devices are made in Australia and deaf
children who have this device can
actually grow up in the hearing
community and hear perfectly well
remarkably many of those children now
have a second implant when they turn 18
they're having a second implant which
enables them for the first time to
appreciate music the directionality of
sound and be able to detect sound within
a within a group of people in a busy
party or or a noisy environment
it's truly a fantastic technology that
attests to the importance of signal
processing which is what's really
happened over the last 20 years but also
the plasticity of the brain that is able
to learn how to interpret a very limited
amount of information there are only 24
electrodes on this device so 24 channels
and information and yet people can
understand speech speak on the telephone
and unless you're an expert talking to
someone with a cochlear implant you
could never know that they were actually
that they were actually a deaf from
birth and of course you need a team of
surgeons who are capable of sorry of
implanting the device and you also need
electronic engineers to build the
hardware and you need very importantly
people that can build the electrodes the
interface directly with the retina and
that is an enormous Liebig challenge and
that's part of what we do in the
university of melbourne so it's a very
large team of people again for us
about a hundred scientists and my part
of the team is pictured on the right
hand side and in the background of that
picture is the diamond reactor where we
make the electrodes and I'll have more
to say about why we use diamond for
making the electrodes in a minute but
but let me start off by talking about
what we're actually true with the
problem that we're actually trying to
solve so there are two classes of
blindness that affect a huge number of
people worldwide one of them is
retinitis pigmentosa and to explain how
this what actually is happening here I
have to go back a little bit to the
function of the retina now the retina is
designed in a very unusual way at the
front of the retina are the ganglion
cells that can be thought of as the
hardware pick up of electrical signals
down the bottom here
those ganglion cells join eventually
into a bundle that goes into the optic
nerve and goes into the back of the into
the through the back of the eye and into
the brain but the actual receptors the
things that turn light into electrical
signals are located at the back of the
brain now if you were designing a CCD
camera this is the last way you would do
it you wouldn't have the light passing
through the electronics to get to the
photoreceptors only to send the signal
back to the electronics and off to your
detection sister off to your electronic
recording system but that's the way the
retina is designed I've spoken to the
designer and but he refuses to change he
says that it's that the specification
has been fixed and we just have to live
with it so indeed we do have to live
with the design limitations and it's
really important to understand that
we're not on a blank canvas here that we
have to design the electronics to fit
the biology we can't alter the biology
to fit the electronics so in these two
diseases retinitis pigmentosa and
age-related
age-related macular degeneration and in
both cases the the photoreceptors have
died and so light no longer gets
transduced into electrical signals but
the electronics is intact so the
the electronic pathway is still there
but the transduction system is gone and
it's like a little bit like a CCD that's
been that you've irradiated with a laser
the actual small pixel that turns the
light into an electrical signal is burnt
out but the electronics are still in
place so our job is to to actually
stimulate the ganglion cells directly
with electrical signals rather than and
replace the function of the rods and
cones in the back of the either turn
light into electrical signals the two
conditions age-related macular
degeneration is the macula is the
central part of the of the eye it's the
part that helps you read recognize faces
expressions etc it's where the highest
concentration of receptors are and very
sadly in in older people that part of
the retina degrades and what they get is
what you see on the left-hand side of
the image the central part of vision
goes and gradually that grows bigger and
bigger that blurry part until the person
can't see at all in retinitis pigmentosa
the opposite is the case the peripheral
vision disappears so gradually the
person gets tunnel vision which gets
smaller and smaller until all sight is
lost so light comes in we're going to
replace the light by direct electrical
stimulation
so having directly stimulated you might
ask the question where would you put the
output from geordi's visor where would
you connect it to and there are a number
of places that you could connect it to
well in one case you could connect it
directly into the visual cortex the back
part of our brain is the two sides a
huge amount is devoted to vision and you
see in your brain you don't see with
your eyes actually you see with your
brain the brain is the is obviously in
the visual cortex where all these
signals that transform did something
that is actually meaningful and so you
might ask well like why not put it
directly it elect electrical stimuli
to the visual cortex well the
manufacturer has failed to supply us
with the appropriate manuals and we
don't actually know how to stimulate the
visual cortex effectively you should not
interpret this these these lines as
being one-to-one connections it's not
like a CCD in which one pixel turns into
one what one see one picks on a CCD
turns onto one pixel on your screen it's
far more complicated than that mainly
because the whole of our visual
processing system has been designed to
detect patterns we are very very good at
detecting patterns most of us can
actually detect a face within billions
of faces and it's only now that facial
recognition is starting to be effective
and even then it can be fooled in ways
that human beings can't be fooled and
that's because the pre-processing that
takes place here is enormous so you so
even though we could put devices in the
visual cortex and some people are trying
that we don't know how to give effective
vision to people by stimulating that
I'll tell you I don't think it will get
better unless we have a system which can
both stimulate and record at the same
time so if you're thinking about this in
physics terms in physics terms you like
to map out the response function to map
out the response function of the brain
you need to stimulate and record rather
than simply passive recording so people
have tried to do that to some extent but
the problem is the visual cortex is very
big very big as in terms of brain so in
order to do that and I believe there's a
talk this afternoon that's talking about
mapping the brain you need to be able to
record a huge amount of information at
high spatial resolution and a high
temporal resolution in response to a
very well-defined input signal as soon
as we can do that we may be able to the
other the other problem is the images
that you actually do is showing our
images that are constantly moving at
constantly changing
and how is the brain going to learn to
use those signals so yes I think so but
not in the first instance so we have
chosen to put the our our implants at
the retina and the reason for this is
that everything we know about successful
operationally successful implants would
indicate that the closer you are to the
origin of the natural origin of the
light the more of the natural circuitry
that you can keep intact the better your
chances are of getting an operational
effect so the cochlear for example is a
minimally invasive and minimally
invasive implant it's a wire that that
basically goes into the cochlear
replaces the hairs that do the
transduction but all of the other
circuitry is left untouched so even
having chosen to put the Sabbath put the
device into the into the eye next to the
retina you have a number of choices
about where to put it and one of the
places that you could put it is in the
inner pocket called a super coronal
pocket at the back of the eye
which is a sort of between the back back
of the eye and the retina there's a flap
of skin where you can put a device it's
excellent place to put it because the
flap closes and keeps the implant in
place it's not in the gooey stuff in the
middle of the eye where there's say line
etc however there is some physics here
once again if you want high resolution
you've got to be very close to the
receptors you know if you're if you're
doesn't the current sheet here right if
you're you know if you're looking at a
car that's very far away from you it's
got two headlights doesn't matter how
good your optics are if you're too far
away the two headlights look like one
headlight and that's exactly the point
so although the suprachoroidal space is
great from a positioning point of view
the best place is to put it here
epiretinal e and you can imagine the
difficulty of that we have to actually
get inside the eye and put our device
right next to the retina this is no mean
feat but I'll tell you how we have tried
to do that nevertheless the first thing
we wanted to find out was whether or not
we could divine a design a device that
would actually give people
a sensation of light and the first
device that we have actually designed
does go into the suprachoroidal space
and it basically has an array of
electrodes that look something like this
this has 98 electrodes the device I'll
actually showing you only has 24 but
what are the things you can see here is
that again to go above about a thousand
electrodes he just 100 electrodes just
becomes impossible because if you're
limited to two dimensions
you just can't fit more electrodes in
even if you make them smaller dealing
with all the wires becomes an impossible
task and it's at and it's a it's a
problem that we've solved but anyway in
the first instance our first device very
very first device is works like this and
I hope the movie works it's basically a
a an array that does go into the
suprachoroidal space and it's only got a
smaller number of electrodes it's
designed for patients with retinitis
pigmentosa and there are there are a
number of pixels here and the signals
come from the outside via a cable into
the back of the eye and I want to show
you the results of the first oops
the first patient that's been fitted her
name is - Werth and this is a little
video clip about her experience a vision
impaired Melbourne woman's been able to
see again thanks to a world-first while
she can only see shadows and colors it's
changing her life in putting melbourne
scientists at the forefront of bionic
eye research Amy Parkes has the story
the eye disease retinitis pigmentosa
began destroying died Ashworth sight
nearly 30 years ago but this was the
moment scientists began to turn back the
clock Wow you know cuz I just didn't
expect it at all it just yeah but it was
amazing we were all very nervous
perhaps the calmest of all was died
electrical impulses are sent to a
prototype implant behind eyes retina
which are then recognized by her brain
as vision and I will be able to see a
number of spots in different locations
and we'll be able to see things like
shapes and
edges of doorways and objects like that
seemingly small but it could be enough
to light the way for researchers
developing a bionic eye and to give hope
to thousands of vision impaired patients
it is possible that later on we may be
able to use the devices for patients
with age-related macular degeneration as
exciting as this development is it's
just the first step the holy grail for
researchers will be a bionic eye with
ten times the power of this first
prototype which will allow patients to
recognize faces and to read large print
but even in these early stages it's the
realization of a dream I've always
believed always believed that there
would be something I mean exactly
exactly so dye comes in every every week
and has a session in which in the first
instance the voltage on each one of the
pixels is individually I'm sorry in the
first instance each one of the pixels is
the voltage is increased until she says
yes I see a flash of light and gradually
we then join two pixels together to try
and make a letter or a line or a shape
and we ask it do you see a line do you
see a vertical line or a horizontal line
and the learning exercise is all
important which is why we wanted to
start with even a simple device to see
how well the brain would actually
interpret the signals and that's a
really central point cochlear implants
for example people have been given them
18 years ago or even 30 years ago still
using the same hardware the same implant
hardware but the software has improved
as we know more and more how to
stimulate it's a very complicated
problem in two dimensions because
there's timing there's proximity should
we be giving the letter L for example in
all the pixels
sited at the same time or should they be
excited in some form of with some form
of temples separation and we just don't
know the answers to that question but
Dai is learning rapidly now I so in
order to determine what we would need in
order to be able to get people to read
large print and see faces we have to
determine what the minimum number of
pixels would be so what do you see there
there's 16 pixels 64 pixels and here are
a thousand thousand pixels or a thousand
of what we call phosphenes which are
dots of light artificially generated
dots of light now who can see what that
is
yes what is it sorry
Melbourne tram very good are you from
Australia so there's that's something
really interesting a lot of people can't
see that when the resolution of the of
the projectors very high and they're
close but you're all pretty far away
from the screen and so you can see it
and I can see it very clearly so there
you go a thousand pixels is enough to be
able to recognize a shape of something
and and okay of course it's not at the
same you know megapixel but enough and
what you see here nothing 64 nothing but
by the time you get to a thousand
phosphenes you can easily see large
print and so for a person running around
outside who wants to be able to for
example read a street sign which is
something that blind people can't do at
the moment then a thousand phosphenes
would be enough so how are we going to
produce a thousand phosphenes i showed
you before the devices you can well
imagine that trying to scale that
technology up to a thousand dots is not
going to work because you just can't I
mean there's just a physical limitation
geometrical so this is our device it's
called a high acuity device and it
basically consists of a thousand pixels
directly put into the eye and there's a
picture I'll show you many more pictures
of this but that's basically there's
of the device it fits at the back of the
eye this is the business end of it this
is a piece of plastic if you like that
holds it in place with retinal tacks and
there's a lead that comes out either to
a coil in the back of the head for
wireless transmission and power so but
before we get too far ahead we need to
define a material that is able to
actually stimulate the the retina and
this is surprisingly difficult because
it's got to do a lot of things it's got
to be mechanically durable electrically
conductive core and an insulating body
in order to have a differentiation
between an on and off it's got to be
biocompatible chemically inert it's got
to last a lifetime right you're gonna
put this thing in it's gotta last 40 or
50 years it can't degrade it's got to
have high thermal conductivity because
you're going to be putting in a power
signal and you want the heat generator
to rapidly dissipate and it has to have
a high charge injection capacity which
is a technical term in neuroscience
referring to the minimum amount of
charge that you need to inject in order
to cause a neuron to fire and that
combination of properties in a package
that's about three by three millimeters
with a thousand pixels and can cope with
the electronics is no mean is no mean
challenge so that's the challenge and
here's a material that you probably know
of but perhaps don't know of its
properties in the biological sphere so
diamond has the following exceptional
properties it's the most thermally
conducting of all materials which is not
commonly known often used as a heat sink
for high-powered electronics it
obviously is biocompatible it's been
used on heart valves and orthopedic
implants for a long time it's chemically
inert we clean our diamonds by putting
them in a mixture of sulfuric perchloric
and and nitric acid at 350 degrees
boiling and the diamond says or this is
a lovely warm bath nothing happens to
the diamond so it lasts a lifetime it's
certainly chemically inert it's also has
amazing electrical property
I'll show you in a moment and it's
obviously very hard and robust so you
might think the diamonds are very
expensive and yes I continue to let you
believe that but in fact we make
diamonds in our lab every day in a
reactor that is no more complicated in
principle than your microwave oven at
home and basically the recipe is put in
a container containing a methane and
hydrogen put into the microwave oven
press hi leaf for six hours and remove
and admire your diamonds and here on the
left top left hand side you can see the
a picture of the microwave you'll you
recognize that foil is the same foil
that you have inside your microwave oven
at home that's to stop the microwaves
getting out and you may be able to see
just inside there's a there's a
hemispherical dome and inside there
that's a very bright blue glow and
that's a glow of a plasma that is
breaking up the methane into its
constituent carbon and hydrogen
components and under the right
conditions that carbon deposits onto a
substrate as diamond and on the right
hand side you can see some lovely little
diamonds that have been created and that
that reactor that I show you there is a
toy reactor this is a more
industrial-strength one that we have in
the laboratory that actually produces
diamond and we set it cooking for not
just six hours but maybe 24-48 even 72
hours and the diamonds slowly grow that
might be considered to be a long time
but considering that most of the
diamonds have formed over billions of
years we figured that a week to make a
beautiful diamond isn't too long but
actually the remarkable thing about
diamond is that there is a huge amount
of variability you can go all the way
from single crystal diamond to
polycrystalline diamond and nano
crystalline diamond and ultra nanika
there's a whole range of properties and
one of the most remarkable thing about
the properties of the diamond that's not
commonly known as you can adjust it from
highly insulating from ten to the ten 10
to the 11 10 to the 12 ohm centimeters
all the way down to only 0.01
leaders and all you do all you're doing
is changing the nitrogen concentration
in the reactor by adding nitrogen you
can create material that's highly
conducting and that's a remarkable thing
and we don't know of any other material
that has that property of being able to
change the same material from being so
insulating to so conducting silicon of
course could be doped and that's the
basis of so much of our technology but
not not over that range at room
temperature so this is the difference in
the microstructure now for the
neuroscientists who apparently have made
the transition from neuroscience into
Google it may be interesting to note
this sort of fine structure here and it
turns out that neurons love this
structure it just has the right the
right morphology and neurons love
growing on this stuff and I I'll just
say something about that point and come
back this is a complicated slide
visually but really the the point to be
made here is that the second column is a
column showing neurons growing on nano
crystalline diamond without any of the
normal growth mixtures that are at the
promoters that are usually made to
promote the adhesion of neurons to
surfaces these two that this third and
fourth columns having them traditional
growth methods with those extra growth
factors but the first the second column
is nirodha nanodiamond without any of
the growth factors a remarkable thing
that the diamond that the neurons will
grow on it without any additions so
going back to then how we actually make
our devices I'm sorry I'm flicking
around a bit so we start off or we start
off with a piece of solid diamond in
which there are which we cut holes with
a laser you can't drill the diamond with
anything those holes are about 50
microns in size and then we coat the
entire diamond with the pollak with the
conducting material and then we isolate
with the laser and this is a side view
so we get something that looks like a
bar of
each one of those squares is conducting
material and the important thing is that
the conduction goes all the way to the
back which means that we can have a
dense electrode of array dense electrode
array which has contacts at the back
electrodes at the front and this gives
us the technology we need in order to
get both high-density and in a package
that is implantable into the eye and
I'll show you the complete package as we
go through but and now the importance of
this from a design perspective is that
all the body ceases carbon diamond it's
just diamond and in fact in this picture
here you can see the diamond had the
ultra nano crystalline diamond growing
into the hole that we've drilled and
there's no gap here right and now if you
if you know anything about electrodes
for neuro chemistry there's always
interfaces right you've got in turf and
those interfaces are always the points
of failure in this case there's no point
of failure because it's all one material
it's true some of its conducting and
some of its insulating but it's all one
material diamond and indeed when we've
tested whether or not there are any
holes in here cracks etc this is the
these we do this test just by having a
squirt of helium seeing if the helium
can get through to our detector and in
this case there's a hole and you see
that helium immediately leaking through
but in our devices there's no hole and
the blue curve just shows you what
happens when we try to see and there are
about a thousand holes and a thousand
drills so we're very confident that we
have a hermetic seal now the importance
of this is this is ultra important
doesn't matter if you have an Android
phone or a iPhone if you drop it into
the toilet it's game over right it
doesn't take long drop it in toilet
three minutes later it's it's history
unless you're very lucky and you know
maybe you can get it to recover but
basically get it wet and it's game over
and that current and we're going to put
this electronics into the eye and wanted
to be there for 40 years and the eye is
37 degrees in a concentrated sail
solution so you've got to make sure that
it's hermetically sealed otherwise your
chip which you've spent a lot of money
making and developing is just going to
give up the ghost straight away in short
out so hermiticity is very important and
what about biocompatibility well in this
experiment we took a slice of diamond
and compared it to other materials which
we slid into tissue and they took out
some time later to see what the reaction
is now in this picture blue is bad and
red is good blue is tissue that has been
damaged and is and has died red is
tissue that's still alive so silicon is
the standard material that's used all
the time in all Bionic devices it's a
plastic plastic of silicon plastic and
you can see that a slice of silicon
creates some damage around where it was
implanted but there's no adverse no big
adverse reaction but here's the diamond
and you can see that the diamond
actually has a smaller reaction that
even the polycrystalline silicon and
this is Stannis octo 8 which is known to
generate an inflammatory response so
that's our negative control and so the
diamond is doing really well there's no
compared to any other material the
reaction of the body to the diamond the
body says I'll quite like you and
there's no problem you can stay here as
long as you like
well we don't actually have a
vasculature in the retina right that's
the in the ganglion cells the the the
blood supply is at the back right no no
there's no very little blood supply
actually going through into the ganglion
cells and this is just a histology
histology the blue curve in the the blue
lines in here are the response or a
response to a bad response if you like
and basically the response of the diam
it is almost non-existent compared to
the control sphere sorry
yes the question is what happens to the
effect of the diamond on the blood
supply effectively on and well don't
forget of course that well your question
is basically what happens to the the
retina
underneath the device in terms of
longevity and I'll show you some
pictures that that that indicate that
there's no adverse reaction look yeah
I'll show you the I'll show you the
picture of that it does not appear that
we have a big problem in that regard
what what actually I will say is that
what we don't know is what happens after
we stimulate for a long period of time
and whether that causes any neuronal
damage that we don't know we do know
that the device is perfectly safe for a
short period of time we don't know if
it's safe for a long period of time
because we haven't been going long
enough in our project to have that data
but but we certainly don't see any any
damage locally
No then smaller than the cochlear
implant because of where we are in the
body okay so getting to your discussion
what are the now there's not just a
design limitation in terms of space it's
also designed limitation in case of
voltage now I'm sure most of you have
once upon a time put a couple of
electrodes into a bath of salty water
and watched bubbling away of the at the
electrodes in which one electrode is
producing hydrogen the other one is
producing oxygen and that's the basis of
course of the hydrolysis of water that's
something you do not want to happen
inside your eye right so there's
something called the safe limit for for
for neural excitation you must say away
from going above the max or the min
because if you exceed the max or the min
you're actually going to be generating
little bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen
and that's going to be a disaster inside
the eye so any neural stimulator has to
stay away from that and it turns out
that once again diamond nature's been
kind to us in this case and diamond has
this extraordinarily large window of if
you like stability in which you do not
generate oxygen and hydrogen so we've
got to play from minus one and a half
volts to one volt and that's a very wide
window most materials do not have
anywhere near that wide window in order
to stimulate and this is getting more
technical but basically there are two
voltages that are important one of the
voltages the compliance if you like so
what you do is that you put a you put a
pulse on to your electrode there's an
immediate rise in voltage and in that
case you're just overcoming the series
resistance and then as time goes on you
are actually charging effectively
charging up a capacitor and you want the
capacitance to be as big as possible so
that the voltage you need to apply in
order to get a certain charge is as
small as possible so actually what you
want is for this curve to be as flat as
possible and it's this v2 that cannot
exceed that one volt because if it
it's the one volt then you you will
actually get up sorry you will actually
start to get that effect of hydrolysis
of water so in the idea absolutely ideal
electrode this would go up and then it
would be completely flat
of course it's never like that but you
want this v2 to be as small as possible
so to our actual results so the first
result that we that we did is was this
we took some retina from an animal and
we laid it down in a dish over our
device over our diamond device and then
we you know then we stimulated I put a
voltage on to our electrode and we had
what's called a patch clamp which is a
method of detecting an ER or a neuron
firing and so we apply a voltage to our
electrode and we see whether or not
neurons that are far away are actually
firing and can we get a response and it
turns out that we get an outstandingly
good response from this to just this is
basically when the voltage goes on and
every time we put a voltage onto the
onto our electrode we got a a than
neuron firing and this is sort of a
histogram of the effect so obviously we
need to put enough charge into the
system to get the neuron to fire and so
this is actually the blue line is
actually telling you that depending on
how far the neuron was away from the
from the from the stimulate stimulation
source the probability that you will get
actually the appropriate number of them
of stimulations so obviously what we
want is for there to be a high
probability that every time we put a
voltage onto the onto the electrode that
we will get a neuron firing that's the
point and and basically without going
into a lot of the detail these results
indicate that we have that within the
compliance the safe limit we can easily
apply every time enough voltage onto the
electrode to get the neuron to fire
without any danger of having that
electrolysis of the water
I'll learn I'll get to that in a minute
this was to ask the question can we get
this material which is not the
traditional material for putting inside
the eye which is platinum or soar or
perhaps iridium oxide okay is it good
enough so so then we did the next thing
right next thing is in fact can we get
this to actually respond and here is the
acid test so what we did again in a test
animal is we put now in this case the
electrode is actually in the eye and on
the retina so this is the real point
this is the real pointy end of the
system so we put in the back of the of
the head of the animal a array of
electrodes that are designed to see
whether or not the visual cortex is
firing so now you're talking about
testing the entire circuit and then what
we did is we put a voltage on to our
electrodes and the electrodes here are
different sizes and shapes and ganging
together of electrodes and we put a
voltage on and see if we get signals and
indeed at the back here this is when we
stimulated and these are the signals
these stars represents the voltages the
spikes inside the visual cortex so this
is really working right because you're
putting a voltage onto the electrode and
these spikes are occurring at the back
of the at the back of the of the back of
the brain now we can't tell what the
animal is actually seeing but we do know
that the circuitry is in place and that
the the system really works so this is a
very important graph for us this was the
question what is the how many spikes do
we get in response to the current that
we put on to the electrode because that
current is really important we need to
keep that current as small as possible
and yet have a high probability of
stimulation and so you see here that a
ten point eight microbes we've got four
spikes
per per pulse and it turns out that
that's that's fine in terms of both the
compliance of our stimulator chip which
I'll show in a moment and the biology so
this is a really a nice result for us
and and and gives us also some window
for contrast if you like yeah any
questions so is it clear what that graph
is is showing so just to say this is the
number of spikes actually in the visual
cortex in response to the current that
is being put on to the electrode in the
eye that's gone all the way through the
neural system to the back and if we put
say 20 micro amps then we'll get eight
spikes in the visual cortex electrical
stimulation
I mean if you put a flash of light into
the into the eye you ensure you'll get
you'll get signals in the visual cortex
and so I don't know how many spikes you
get per pixel of light but that's been
that's well established that's the lower
the lower the current that you can that
you can put in and still get the spikes
at the back the better the the bed of
the device is going to be the lower the
power the higher the resolution etc and
this is just a histogram showing that of
the different electrodes and the ganging
of the electrodes just to just indicate
that it wasn't just a one-off now um so
so the electrode array works but of
course in order to get our thousand
pixels we need to actually we need to
encapsulate the device in a way sorry we
need to have a stimulator chip which has
all the electronics on it and we need to
encapsulate this in a capsule that is
going to be
to keep the electronics safe for the
lifetime of the patient so here we've
got sort of although this shows
penetrating electrodes here is the here
is the chip and here er here are some
indium dots to give us the bonding I'll
show you more pictures of that in a
moment
but the important thing is that this
entire thing needs to be encapsulated
now the way that encapsulation has
worked in the past is with the titanium
can basically you this is if you have a
pacemaker you get the same thing you put
all the electronics into a titanium can
and you seal the titanium can with with
with a laser but of course that's not
ideal for the thing that we have in the
body
our tiny did all device that has to go
inside the body and titanium isn't the
ideal material for for this if we want
to stay true to our design principle of
the body only seeing diamond but before
I tell you about the fact that we can
use diamond the the thing is that you
need a barrier that lasts a lifetime
that's biocompatible you want it to be
an insulator you wanted to allow
wireless signals to come through so
titanium is not the best option you have
to have the feedthroughs
it has to be sterilizable as well before
it goes into the body which and it's got
to be heat-resistant what this means is
you can't just bake this thing at a
thousand degrees because of course the
chip will just die so this is our
solution which is basically to have a
diamond box so not only is the electrode
array made of diamond but the box is
also made of diamond and then it is and
then we put a special material between
the two boxes and then we seal them shut
and in fact and in fact this shutting is
a very important part and what you see
on the left hand side well firstly what
you see on the right hand side is a
diamond box with a sort of an optical
picture of the diamond box and along
this red part is where the braze goes
and in this picture down on the left
hand side you see two diamonds let me
you see this is diamond this is the
material that's being used as the glue
here's another diamond this is the
material that's being used as the glue
and this is what happens after you join
the two of them together and basically
the point of this picture is to show
that the braze line is continuous and
there's no leakage so if I can show you
how it all sort of fits together here is
the diamond box it's got some feed
throughs mainly for power and that
diamond box is drilled out of a single
monolithic piece of diamond here is our
array with our in this case thousand
electrodes although the first device
will have 256 here are some isolating
capacitors here is now the chip that
I'll show you in a picture the
stimulating chip which is ball bonded
down onto the onto the electrode array
and then the final thing is that the box
comes on the down on onto the device and
is then sealed with a laser and here are
the actual devices so here is a device
with with our chocolate each one of
those squares is the electrode this is a
more sophisticated device that has some
shaping so that it fits a little bit
better into the space here is the actual
size of the device here you see the the
spots which are for power fee throughs
this is an SD card so this is gives you
the length scale those are the
electrodes on SD card and here is the
entire device here it is in its silicon
housing ready to be implanted into into
the eye and here is a flexible cable
that comes out the back of the eye and
the stimulator chip is actually being
just delivered to us I must say I am
very impressed by our electronics people
because the entire real estate of this
is the electrodes because we've only got
three by three millimeters to play with
and that relates to the fact that we've
got to make an incision in the eye and
the
virgins want it to be a tiny incision
very flat very small so they can seal it
up afterwards so this is the actual
stimulator chip in this case 256 all of
the electronics control electronics is
underneath each one of those electrodes
which I think are about 80 by 80 microns
each and each one of those electrodes is
independently addressable and
controllable and can produce voltages
from minus 3 to plus 3 volts I think
it's quite an accomplishment at this
extremely low power and it's also very
safe because there are no DC voltages
the only minus is that we've got to put
onto this chip our it needs some
capacitors and we have to put that onto
the chip onto the onto the electrode
array as I showed you before and here is
some technical stuff about the about the
data and and I think it's a very
impressive accomplishment to have a chip
that's so small physically small and yet
so flexible and here is the entire
device here is a picture of why we need
some shaping just to match the curvature
of the retina and here is our now going
to be a picture of what it's looking
like as we actually put it into a into a
person we're not quite at the point of
putting it into a person we're still in
the in the preclinical trials and the
animal trials but nevertheless some the
devices is ready to be put is really to
be extensively tested so here you see
the device which is the little the
square in the middle is the diamond
device in fact we only use one tack at
the moment those are the retinal tacks
that hold it in place here is the now
the sort of blow-up of the device here
you see it in more detail and if the
video actually catches up with my
computer there you'll see the various
components which are the chip the cap
and
and the driver electrode in the middle
yes sounds like there's a large area of
connection back there there was some
sort of breakthrough surgery and you
have a larger area there was a clearly
if the retina goes most of the way along
the back of the eyeball we there are
some limitations you want to avoid the
optic nerve but the the answer to your
question is that we could happily and
for for example a neural implant at the
back of the head which we could use a
very similar technology for where we
don't have the limitation we'd be very
happy to make our devices centimeter by
a centimeter but the but it's the
surgery because if you've got a device
that is a centimeter by centimeter you'd
mean to make an incision in the eye
that's too big at the moment too big
connections to the brain that you're
just not using yes yes and one of the
reasons for that also is that it's
actually quite rare for people to be
completely blind so we want to be
careful not to affect any residual
vision and so the device is naturally
relatively small but in the fullness of
time we will either make bigger devices
or put more than one chipping it depends
on the patient in AMD the central part
of the vision is gone but the peripheral
part is often still working in retinitis
pigmentosa by the time patients are
often in their 30s they've lost nearly
all their useful vision but it depends
on the individual patient which probably
which means of course the patient
selection and a detailed appreciation of
the exact state of that particular
retina is going to be very important the
design of the device is eventually
so is it definitely I think Thanks so my
background actually is I have slow RP so
I'm thinking ahead than 30 or 40 years
when I I might actually only have my
central vision and be able to read and
not want to lose this or I may be like
like you're probably candidate patient
who's lost all their vision from Rp so
I'm wondering if there's a possibility
in the future that this that I might
have an implant like this
and preserve my natural central vision
if those are the photoreceptors that are
healthy so in principle there's no
reason why we can't make an annular
implant to retain the central part of
the vision and do the peripheral part of
the vision the surgery is not obvious
that's a major challenge and so we need
to be able but but the question is then
can we place the retina in the right
place I think the where we're working to
now is taking photos using Oct of
individual retinas and then designing
the holder to match that particular
retina so it is it is certainly
conceivable that we won't be implanting
all patients right on the macula but
rather on the peripheral peripheral
vision not really a breakthrough
I don't know about advancement I think
practice practice and and also some
materials because the size of the wound
that needs to be then fixed you can't
have the kind of the eye leaking out
fluid after the surgery so and there are
there article II I mean surgeons go
inside the eye with remarkable dexterity
so but clearly they haven't been asked
to do this so getting the exact
thickness of the silicon and its shape
and its size right is is an iterative
matter but yes I don't see any reason in
principle why it can't be put not in the
macula which of course will be an easier
easier ask at the moment from an ethic
point of view ethics point of view we
would only put these devices into
completely blind patients okay so that's
a yeah spoken like a true biologist
that's a that's a real a real issue
where was that picture so oh by the way
sorry I just just I just show give you a
hopefully a half a bit of a picture and
so this is a fundus image before the
device was put in and here it is
actually inside so you can see we've
avoided the optical disk here is our
silicone ring here's the tak and here's
the diamond electrode sitting actually
inside the eye so it does work now your
question is is this in the right place
well there's no reason in principle why
you know this can't be shaped a
different way and that this can't be
placed in a different place so I think
that would be highly dependent on taking
these images and not just in one
dimension but in three dimensions
creating and creating a particular mold
for a particular eye now your question
was with regard to the
the fee through I think and yes that
well firstly I'll go back to hopefully
where yeah you're worried about this
lead yeah so firstly the lead that we've
developed uses the same sort of
technology as the lead in the cochlear
implant it's a very clever spiral that
has both flexibility and and strength
and we've actually tested some of these
devices on a sort of artificial eye
moving around millions of times and
making sure that the electrons don't
break but more particularly the question
is with regard to the relative motion
between the outside and the inside now
in order to overcome that we actually
try to make the the final device will
have a will have the coils that are that
there won't be any relative movement
between the inside and the outside there
will be the everything will be internal
inside now that's not where we're at at
the moment but that's certainly a design
consideration more particularly one of
the issues for vision is where people
are actually looking so you know our our
vision processing it's not just the
signals that coming from the eye from
the retina it's also where the eye is
looking that goes into the into the back
of the brain our ability for example to
determine whether we are moving or the
object is moving or it's a combination
of both is quite remarkable so there are
a lot of inputs going in and one of the
things that we need to also be doing is
tracking where the eye is looking in
order to get the maximum and that will
go into the vision processor that
information will go into the vision
processor to alter the picture that is
actually the the stimulating you know
our eye I mean when I started doing this
its enormous accom care for example I
didn't know that our eyes are constantly
dithering because if you continue to
stimulate the same new
again and again and again it stops
responding so our eye is dithering
constantly so that the image isn't on
the same neurons and then the back of
the brain gets rid of it it's sort of an
anti shake software that's embedded into
the eye and we won't even begin to talk
about how the brain integrates
information from vision and hearing
that's even more that's even a more
interesting story did you have a
question no so yeah so we are very well
aware of the mechanics I will say as a
final comment is that although we've
made enormous progress with regard to
the hardware and and getting all the
bits and pieces the real real challenge
will be the software and the processing
to be able to give signals that patients
will be able to interpret in terms of
vision now in the case of the cochlear
implant there have been a couple of
breakthroughs one of them was for
example that sounds are delivered
sequentially in time that the electrodes
are not all stimulated at the same time
they're stimulated with in as a sera a
series of Peaks now that's not how we
know people normally hear you normally
get all the frequencies all at the same
time but there seems to work very well
for cochlear implants now the trouble
with the vision is that we've got too
many because so many parameters we've
got time but now we've also got space
and how are we going to try to optimize
these electrodes so in the beginning
obviously you're going to test every
electrode and see what voltage you need
in order to ask at a spot but then how
are you going to start to get
optimization of shapes and then how will
you get optimization of movement so
there's going to be a really from a
computer science perspective this is
going to be a really enormous ly
interesting challenge and my personal
belief is we need some sort of dynamic
genetic algorithm because I don't think
that we are going to be able to do this
with an a priori algorithm I would like
to see some method the patient's can
actually be carrying around a processor
that's worth
all the time rather than having to come
back into the laboratory to to be
optimized each time but that's a work in
progress and come back to one of the
very first questions about you know the
mapping it seems to me that with this
device one of the exciting research
opportunities is because we now have and
will have a thousand electrodes and we
can test this and we can also be
recording what's happened in the in the
visual cortex we can actually start to
map out that response function I think
that from a research perspective that's
probably one of the most exciting new
tools that this technology is going to
be able to contribute to the
neuroscience community
so with that I'll I'll I'll end and
thank you very very much both if you're
looking in in virtual time or in virtual
space and for those in the audience
thank you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
