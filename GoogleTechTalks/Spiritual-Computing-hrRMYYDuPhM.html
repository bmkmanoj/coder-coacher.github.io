privileged enough to make credit from
tampering
for work
tomorrow
if they're any proportion
thank you it's always interesting to see
who would show up in a in a meeting that
bring these two words together it's
pretty weird right spiritual and
computing you may be here just because
you're curious about what could come out
of those two words but you might have a
more specific idea yourself so I'd be
interested to know what connections you
see with what might be spiritual
computing or what you're doing here at
Google that might be potentially
connected with that topic I just really
like to hear from from you just any
ideas yeah
well yeah
this
yeah so ray kurzweil the age of
spiritual machines yeah it's definitely
something i'll talk about anybody else
about how this topic may relate to what
goes on here at Google yeah
sir
Robespierre
right there's an ethical dimension of
this surely okay well let me just start
but first of all to say something about
myself has Leslie requested I I put in
about a decade exploring how to how the
technology sector might be contributing
to humanity or harming as digital
technology takes over in its network
spread what's the social impact of that
what's what are the net pluses and
minuses as we get from the first to the
second billion network individuals I
explored that by helping to create a
movement to close the digital divide I
organized a conference in 1999 on the
eve of the Seattle World Trade
Organization leading they've brought
world leaders together around that topic
since then I've been teaching that topic
at Harvard and advising governments in
Asia about how to spread networks into
their countries and it led me to
understand that this issue of how to
bring out the potential for you for
digital technology for human benefit is
not something that's going to be worked
out by government leaders it is so deep
the issue is so pervasive that it does
have to be worked out on a spiritual
level essentially the issues that are
arising as digital technology can
is its impact on human culture is at its
heart a matter of affecting the very
nature of what it means to be human and
what it means for humans to shape
reality that brings out the potential of
the human condition so all those issues
are essentially spiritual issues and so
I spent about ten years looking at the
social impact of technology and now I
see that it's led me to this spiritual
terrain but this is not the first time
that an that an exploration like this is
taking place I could draw your attention
to a situation that happened 2,500 years
ago when someone was born into a wealthy
family and offered a lot of material
rewards for group sort of going along
with the father's agenda but instead
this guy dropped out sort of totally
rejected his parents solution for what
would bring happiness and he decided to
launch his own investigation into this
question himself and he essentially
ended up developing a technology called
openness in which
he explored the methods of actually
cracking the code on how a human can
achieve sustainable happiness or
empowerment user empowerment and once he
made this discovery he didn't feel a
need to patent it he did because he
wasn't motivated in that way and yet the
discovery he made might be considered
the ultimate original open source
discovery that there's a way for the
mind to work out how to be happy and
then he began to tell others about it so
this person you might guess by now is
who what
the Buddha right but now I'm not but
having said that I I don't want you to
think that I'm you know pushing a
Buddhist agenda on you guys the Buddha
lived at a time that is now being
referred to as the axial age or the age
of transformation it's a period that
began about 800 ad or BC and continued
to about 280 and this is a period where
most of the significant ideas in the
realm of spirituality were really is
presented in the form of individuals who
revisited their own traditions whether
it was sort of Greek rationalism or do
Judith the Hebrew tradition to whatever
and they they began to explore how these
traditions can be become form the basis
of technologies that generate
empowerment human and Tommy so they
these people Christ Mohammed Confucius
Lao Tzu you know some of the Greek
thinkers all be all lived around the
same period of time and they all came up
with complementary answers to the
question of how humans could be
empowered and then religions grew up in
their way but these religions didn't
always do a good job as stewards of the
spiritual experience of
these of these great spiritual adepts
but we do have religion sort of trying
to carry forward the legacy of these
great great leaders and we've seen that
since the time of the axial age the
spiritual impulse that that desire to
crack the code on how to achieve how to
adjust your mind in such a way that you
become happy that tradition has been at
odds with the tradition of technology
technology is wedded itself with
authoritarian governments and Pyrenees
and and with commerce in such a way as
to lead people away from that pursuit of
happiness so we took a human culture in
the last several years several thousand
years have had technology moving in one
direction and spirituality moving in
another press an example
pretty impressive usual as
this there have been counter-examples
and that's a good point that even though
these trends have existed that over time
gradually we've seen the technology
world in the spiritual world beginning
to hint that there might be a convergent
point a meeting point between these two
worlds and as digital technology was
born about 40 30 30 plus years ago you
know that terms like icon or avatar or
names like Oracle you know these
suggesting that there's some kind of
spiritual underpinning to what might be
going on here in digital technology
began to emerge but i think it's only
now in the year two thousand six where
we're the preconditions exists for a
real alignment between the word worlds
of technology in the world of
spirituality and it relates very much to
what's going on here in this room and in
this incredible place called google it's
the search business right so search what
is it it's about aggregating information
but is that the end game how does
information get us to meaningful
information and how does meaning get us
to to wisdom and how does wisdom get us
to empowerment it has become central to
the search business so search by itself
is exists in a larger context of what is
it that people really want and what does
it mean for people to embark on a search
process to get the answers to questions
that they don't think they already have
and how does that then lead them into a
dynamic where they actually find that
what they want is what the Buddha wanted
sustainable happiness is there some way
that through the search business that
that can be aligned with this historic
effort to find true meaning in life it
seems that that yes it wasn't yeah if I
have to have a hypothesis yeah that
there is a this is a complete
my hypothesis on the equity into my
sentence they say no that's wrong so
much as there is much as there is a
natural ecology I think there's
information ecology that exists in a
changed landscape is it historically was
his biological metaphor historically our
ancestors had to I had to punch it's
great for enough calories to survive
where we are evolved to taking all the
categories we possibly can because
there's never been enough and now of
course that there is too much you know
where calories everywhere we all have
dietary railroads and we need
nutritionists historically
information has been powered there has
interpreted enough of it it would be
really useful to know whether that
there's a leopard over that useful to
know you know all of these things and I
think intellectually we have evolved the
same mechanisms or this hunger for
information that our bodies have evolved
hunger for cowardice essentially the
more we can get the better more likely
we are to suburbs right and we have our
brains haven't adapted in these last 20
years yeah I need the equivalent of
information nutritionists mistake yeah
go token clicking on the original quote
of the day 15 times isn't good for you
good point be very good fight well just
kind of set up this discussion further
I'd like to just refer to some of the
precursors for this alignment between
technology and spirituality to see what
might can help us get some indication
that what might come out of the space in
which these two worlds come together for
example think of the experience of
George Lucas the filmmaker 30 years ago
he was I don't know I think of a
roommate of Francis Ford Coppola out of
the USC film school and they were
dreaming his young idealistic men about
creating an alternative to the Hollywood
studio system but Lucas understood that
he also needed to know a lot about
technology and what technology can do
with film so he brought a lot of those
tools with
to the Marin County where he established
his base away from the Hollywood star
system and he began to work on the
script for Star Wars and he worked on
several versions of it we couldn't quite
get a compelling story because he knew
he wanted it to be about search but he
knew that had to be searched for what we
read this book he found called hero with
a thousand faces written by who Joseph
Campbell Joseph Campbell is one of those
people who himself is an innovator but
in the other world the world of
spirituality and he has seen a kind of
alignment between what's been going on
in these spiritual conditions and and
say Union psychology concept of arc type
and he he began to see a pattern here
that humans have intrinsic Lee the
desire for search search for meaning and
it's called a hero's journey that one
begins to search with some kind of sense
that sense of renunciation that you
don't have the answers you have to go
out to find it you go out with questions
you get those questions answered but at
the same time in the process you get
power you become empowered and the
empowerment that you find is ultimately
about letting go of your
ego control and opening to the larger
potential for for good so he got from
Joseph Campbell the story that became
Luke Skywalker's empowerment and how he
then Luke Skywalker himself understood
that defeat the dark force out there he
had to find the basis of his own
confidence had to find a balance between
being focused and aware of the context
his experience and of course I the star
wars franchise became an enormous
commercial success if it actually is one
of the still probably the most
successful commercial breakthrough so
it's not as if this spiritual quest
ideas and medical to network effects but
it does seem to involve design
principles where you factor in spiritual
wisdom in so that that begins to
dominate what you do with these tools
that digital technology has created so
30 years ago we had a conversation
between two individuals that was kind of
like a blip in the film industry it
didn't actually create an alternative to
the star system maybe Robert Redford has
who knows but the time wasn't right in
30 years
to go but there are two other men whose
lives I want to mention that have
actually brought us right at the
doorstep of this convergence that we
find right here happening in Silicon
Valley now one of the man was working on
the spiritual side of the equation and
the other on the technology side first
for the spiritual side there's this guy
named Francisco Varela everything you
heard his name of Chilean well he he was
a student a young student of the steam
biologist named alberto mcdonough who
came up with the notion of autopoiesis
which is a concept of self-organized
systems it's that that based on the
biology of the cell but the cell exists
a sort of semi-autonomous parts that
form a kind of ecology this this notion
Frank became the basis of questioning
for Francisco and he had felt he had to
leave Santiago and go study with
spiritual masters he found Tibetan
Buddhism he found the Dalai Lama he
began to see that in Tibetan Buddhism
one can begin to see how brain systems
can come into convergence effective in
cognitive dimensions of one's brain
could sort of come together through met
so in a dialogue with the Dalai Lama he
eventually brought that dialogue
dialogue into neuroscience this led to
and he brought it to he revisited the
French existential in phenomenological
condition he lived the last ten years of
his life in Paris unfortunately he died
rather young about five years ago but he
articulated a notion called first-person
science the notion that experience
itself is a kind it could be the basis
of empirical inquiry and it could lead
and it could inform design principles by
by becoming an expert on experience and
he also talked about how the third
person science of neuroscience could be
could generate good studied meditation
atoms and use fMRI technology the visual
kind of scanning technology to indicate
what empowerment actually looks like is
a great image and and measures could be
developed to delineate the Empowered
brain from the lesson power grain so
right now in neuroscience labs like
University of Wisconsin Stanford
University of California San Diego we
have meditation becoming a serious
objects of inquiry so that we're
beginning to see what optimal brain
health looks like we're beginning to see
what it is that these spiritual
conditions have been aiming for these
terms of of brain system
and and surprise surprise we're
beginning to get measures that the
technology labs can use as they seek to
optimize user experience so neuroscience
has made a connection with spiritual
traditions that has great implications
for technology and it's because of the
spiritual quest of people like Francisco
Varela their own seeking process has led
them to this so that Francisco at the
end of his life was able to tell his
mentor that he helped carry that
tradition of autopoiesis that and that
wonderful tradition of jillians like
Pablo Neruda he was able to kind of
bring the jewels back to chill a and
return to his own people the insight
from his own journey now we also have
another person who lived right around
here at Stanford palapa Xerox PARC you
probably do know of Mark Weiser anybody
know Mark Weiser who he is tell us in
please mark weiss who was he was the
head
xerox
it was computed
right so he was a contemporary Francisco
and he died about it about the same age
rather young both of them died of cancer
about several years ago Marc weiszer
came out of this incredible collection
of people at the Xerox PARC lab in Palo
Alto and there was an ink that this was
a time in place where design principles
were emerging that are still now that
are changing that are bringing out the
potential of what digital technology
might contribute so wiser never
developed a lot of books or anything but
he wrote two articles that have become
that it had enormous effects one of them
was on the concept of invisible
technology which was basically the
notion that computing isn't essentially
a matter of me sitting here in front of
this machine and this sort of carbon
lock between this TV like box and be
over here in which all my energy is very
kind of visual and you know we're trying
to find a solution it's not about that
necessarily but he talked about a world
in which technology can become invisible
get out of the way become embedded in
objects and the whole body becomes sort
of free and it's in the way that it's
mediated by technology so wiser form the
basis of what is now both by several
names one of them is ubiquitous
technology pervasive technology loganton
technology a world in which the world
the real life physical world of atoms
converges with the virtual world
and out of that comes an enhancement of
human freedom he articulated this
potential even as the commercial forces
around him we're still focusing on
technology as a Productivity tool he was
looking ahead about how technology could
be an empowering tool he also wrote a
book called calm technologies did you
have any of you heard of that article
you might want to google it it calm
technology is an amazing big visionary
piece of work it's just a few pages long
but he in carm technology he said that
the fundamental challenge of computing
is to restructure the relationship
between focus and what's at the center
of your attention and what's at the
periphery so and this of course is a
really fundamental note
meditation or spiritual traditions is
how you keep focus and still let in
context you know it's it's it's also
relates to spiritual search right
because you have an idea of what you
want you want to hold on to that and yet
new things arise that you didn't count
on coming in from the periphery so wiser
explored this only at a primitive level
by thinking about how objects could
remind you of things gently in the
periphery how you could be given gentle
reminders of things but this notion that
technology couldn't help you manage
attention so that you were not
overwhelmed by information overload but
that you be that it actually helped you
achieve mindful focus while at the same
time in an appropriate way open you
context this is like a fundamental
insight that will be working within the
next 10 years in innovation in
shooting all this is from the work of
this guy at xerox parc and many other of
the other his protege xerox parc are
doing incredible work now so this is
their been if you look on the globe
you'll see different points of
innovation some of them up in Finland
with linus torvalds and some of them out
of MIT and some here some there little
hints of what it might mean to bring the
world of spirituality and technology
together and hey this is new this hasn't
been talked about we don't have the
seminal book on this and speaking of Ray
Kurzweil who was it the men who were in
1999 he was lose an inventor is an
engineering guy and he can be forgiven
for taking the approach that he has
because he's been in this self enclosed
engineering world where he hasn't really
known that there's a realm of expertise
called spirituality so he can write a
book called the age of spiritual
machines as if he almost invented the
word spiritual and that's what he did in
1999 and he he talked about a world the
law of accelerating returns predictable
innovation where we will get to
three-dimensional semiconductors and so
forth and and essentially will get to
machines that are smarter than humans
and so out of this he thought that maybe
we all might make choices to download
parts of our brain when they start to
wear out and will achieve some kind of
immortality
and we can call that spiritual machines
it will all become spiritual machines
voluntarily I'm sorry that this is this
doesn't sound like spirituality to me
because that guy Joseph Campbell the one
that inspired George Lucas the first
thing you said to George was George you
know what spirituality is about it
happens as soon as you realize that
you've only got so long to live and you
want to make that period of time
meaningful and so it pushes you into
questions about the nature of your own
existence so that by the time you die
you can really let go this is not the
cruise while Ian vision of the future
I'm sorry so when spirituality meets
technology it's it's it's a space that
really hasn't been opened yet so I guess
I think I take issue with the argument
that that mortality this leads to
spirituality I think there are just as
many issues raised by question of okay
I'm you know I'm going to live forever
what I think it's it is give somebody
that you were going to live forever I
think that raises just as many questions
I'd exit spirituality to me feels more
be any form of interest on anything that
any forbidden of introspective
introspection selfie unconsciousness
and existence yeah and I guess whether
they do get sort of like flipping a coin
you flip it quite in either guess you're
going to die someday or yes you're going
to live forever just flipping the coin
that love is an act or knowing that
there's going to be
okay okay it's a spirit why not that's a
good point and I think that the
implications of your point is that that
technology is being forced to ask
fundamental questions in order to
address its own future questions about
the human condition which have been
outside the field of engineering in the
past you know engineers have been those
people who didn't have to ask those
fundamental questions they could just go
ahead and do practical things without
having to get too deeply into philosophy
but now maybe we have to begin to
inquire more deeply and I think if we
draw expertise from spiritual traditions
of all kinds they will tell us that
facing one's own death is a part of the
equation but
you have to call it a serious question
what is you
and I think that okay
what would I be my body take away my
yeah Chris like this bedroom she's very
fashion and
it is interesting and I and I think
you're right that the question of what
is you you know is is at the core and
you know maybe being just a trickster
provocative to get us thinking about
what what is who we are and essentially
another framework here we could think of
is web two point oh we're all familiar
everyone here is familiar with web two
point oh pretty much you know how the
concept someone defined web two point O
for us
with two point O unfortunately is mostly
a parking term that means whatever
saying it means
so I think if you're going to talk about
it okay well obviously came out of Tim
O'Reilly interactions and his
conferences and so forth and trying to
to look try to find a framework to
explain why some websites have really
taken off after the.com bust and others
happen and then they tried to somehow
articulate the principles that define
which sites have been able to achieve
great Network effects in what could
explain that and so they've been
aggregated a few trend areas in this
field like social computing and the kind
of notion of that what seems to be going
on here has to do with freeing the end
user to become more active and
participatory and sites that the trigger
the engagement of the
sort of architectures of participation
and of course that notion then seems to
have struck some kind of court obviously
there's it's been used as a marketing
tool but it's a notion that was simply
mentioned in a roundtable conversation
like this only a couple years ago and
now if you do a Google search on it
there will be a hundred and twenty-six
million references to that term so
there's a suggestion that maybe I mean
if you put quotes around it maybe
there's something there that the notion
that sites that aggregate user
experience users and lead them into
meaningful experience might be really
central to the future of computing
indeed most of the laboratories that
I've been visiting are seeing that that
they're ultimately in the experience
business not the device business or the
software business and that that their
challenge is to develop more compelling
experiences than their competitors and
compelling can be meaningful and
meaningful meet can mean empowering so
it may be that the technology sector by
the dynamics of technological innovation
itself may be leading into the
spirituality conversation about what
empowerment might mean what the nature
of experience might mean and these are
topics that have been the subject of
intense empirical investigation
for thousands of years so maybe there is
a meeting point in which definitions of
things could be worked out and
hypotheses and ideas could emerge as
those two notions can now be brought
into the same two cultures really can be
brought into the same conversation yes I
was suffering you have any women
any what women that were dominant in
this
you know I think it's a field that is
yet to be born but in terms of
precursors to it certainly on this
spiritual side of the equation some of
the great spiritual innovators have been
women on the technology side nothing
right now comes to mind but it's a good
question important question so there are
several streams of research that I think
are coming together in a framework for
spiritual computing one is gaining so
the notion of spiritual quest has
incorporated into gaming and how gaming
the experience of gaming could lead to
more meaningful and empowering
experiences where we'll probably see the
first applications of spiritual
computing there's also ways in which
different user groups like healthcare in
healthcare systems as users education as
users how they will incorporate
technologies that engage users for
example biofeedback that uses the
targets attention of a patient so that
they can begin to heal themselves in a
very targeted way using new interfaces
this will certainly arise in healthcare
we will as affective computing matures
and as computing computers are able to
sense the emotional state of users and
intend users are able to influence
machines to detect their own emotional
state we'll see more opportunities for
conveying empowering experiences in all
types of of technology so as I've gone
I've been going around the world
beginning with Nokia and Finland and
having these kinds of conversations and
in each company in each laboratory
sometimes academic labs sometimes
corporate labs sometimes no lab at all
like this but just a corporate
conversation the it seems that when you
open the space to bring these two terms
together ideas seem to arise people seem
to have ideas that can come to the
surface so for the most part what
spiritual computing is is just a way of
structuring that conversation so that
ideas can emerge in that space and women
and men can begin to formulate
applications design principles processes
that could lead to new technologies
products services and experiences that
come out of the convergence
the world so this this process is
involved in formulating a spiritual
computing research group nokia is the
first partner microsoft is is coming
involved kicking and screaming perhaps
but there one finds in a company like
Microsoft several streams of research
that's leaving them in two concepts like
sacred space building and built into the
home of the future religion how to reach
out to the religion religion as a kind
of user category and create technology
that bring religion that address these
spiritual principles embedded in
religion for the spiritual experiences
in religion so right now I just like to
open the discussion up any questions any
notions about how any of these ideas
might relate back to what's going on at
Google and your own work your own lives
this understand a distinction night
an inkling an apartment vs your
productivity and
technologies
where is there a puzzle out there rockin
distinction is there I don't see that
well you know going back to Tim O'Reilly
and web two point oh I think one of the
common themes he saw in the sites that
were compelling to users is if they're
not based on productivity enhancement
but on eliciting creativity or
engagement you know that's behind the
blogging phenomenon flickr and so forth
how it's addressing aspects of one's
life that don't directly involve
productivity enhancement is the primary
driver that could be questioned perhaps
but clearly we're seeing a potential for
digital technology to affect lives in
ways that go beyond productivity as the
end game so you know with spiritual
traditions clearly one has to have a
certain level of economic continent of
development of confidence in order to
shoot embark on these questions of human
human
quality of life but yeah we're mostly
talking about looking beyond
productivity as the purpose of
Technology when we talk about spiritual
computing yes thank you
associate behavior last week and
displayed
although now the internet search
capability we have a vast array of
information
he's noticed that people now search out
for information that they already agree
with that reinforces their 3d cell
release and that instead of empowering
though they're just simply reinforcing
that they already believe which is
probably how at all so I want to get
your thoughts about yeah yeah you know I
don't have the solution to that but I
would be very interesting just to know
what you guys think about this that is
there some way that design refinements
could come to the searching industry so
that information gathering could lead to
meet meaningful learning that might go
beyond simply you know how you go from
aggregating information to aggregating
intelligence or meaning I any of you
have ideas about that
perhaps you do
I'm still
there's something I'm still uncertain i
mostly focused and i think it's maybe a
week raising your question of just I've
seen a spectrum in fact
what let me see if I can drag things
back a few thousand years where what is
One Direction is making well I'll say
making technology service spirituality
vs
making making technology or spiritual
Oracle or more holistic so for making
technology serve spirituality for
example it Islam gave us modern
astronomy because they may need to
predict exactly when the new moon would
start and not require the developing
math understanding a lot of
understanding science technology that we
just had and that essentially made it
possible
for really puzzles to figure out what is
this would happen new when is it that
problem Seneca sunrise is going to
happen and that was that I was taking
technology and make essentially making
it serve that particular spirituality
versus as you say we call computing
which is canals
essentially this is taking cold hearts
technology and making
maybe this seemed to be
very fundamentally different
ask some not sure in here
I don't want to
i well it's it's opening a space in
which all can be considered and to going
beyond it's not essentially about
serving religion as a user group and
figuring out how technology can reinvent
all the various functions that happen in
religion but right it's it's more about
trying to understand what the the
experiences that the that have emerged
from spiritual traditions that are
relevant to the technology sector and
how a dialogue or interface to be
developed between that realm of
expertise and what the technologists are
trying to do now out of that could come
concepts like the democratization of
spirituality the what may emerge as a
definition of spirituality could be you
know meaningful spiritual inquiry could
be more widespread as Network effects
take over in ways that affect religion
and well as secular expressions of
spirituality so effects could be seen in
the spiritual realm but they also could
be seen in the design processes that
affect the next generation of
technologies even if the effect isn't
spiritual the effect may be simply too
bill loyalty among users or to lead
users towards experiences that they
consider to be meaningful and helping
them manage information overload for
example like if you look at the future
of technology where digital sensor
networks will be distributed everywhere
individuals for consumers will have an
incentive to manage information and to
address information overload and to find
their own relationship to this issue of
of how they can be empowered to shape
the way in which they process
information and finally need from it so
the effects can be fell on us on both
sides of that conversation ways that
influence the direction on both sides
but maybe the other answer to your
question is that it is totally an open
space what comes out of a way of
structuring a dialogue can bring brings
those two ropes together
a couple things I
and
what
sample
you have to go
issues
like this like either spaces that
remember by grapple it's the one
but also want to say about search one
thinks it's nice web searches listening
relax
otherwise you
he was in oncology
the extent you already know you want to
see
you're searching you
google light beige
it's not
like
for the stuff question
love
thursday
natalia tomorrow
and our kind of state law
you don't think push and pull can come
together oh i do but i think that okay
okay that's kind of just like I think i
was looking you're setting out I think
there's a desert valley has this source
of love breakaway
conversation
oh right
here
but eventually you
you might say well
very acceptable
where that
bring back together
yeah I think that's more that highlights
the
spirituality
between technology spirituality we put
that comment
a bad thing
heartbreaking
ought to life
I I think that it the partly what's
going on is that we're speaking without
we're speaking as sort of modernists to
have been very much each of us who have
stories to tell about our dealings with
religion and we've also had a sort of
new-age versions of spirituality that
we've been affected by but if we look at
say what is emerge out of 5,000 years of
spiritual inquiry in India this is a
rigorous empirical tradition where there
have been people arising in that that
are more iconoclastic and and artistic
than anything the West is seen these
guys have been disruptive of what has
come before and there is the innovation
that has emerged over those 5,000 years
has been very radical so because it is
driven by this desire to get to what
humans want and to find that out without
creek without necessarily beginning
without priorities we've got an ethical
framework but it's it's an empirical
tradition so it's a matter of our
learning what that is and just mixing it
up
and challenging yeah back and forth
because i think what stuff this is cool
it doesn't really solve the Western
problem i think it has problems where
this came up and we solve it and cool
about other cultures it is kind of C+
example enduring all put together
words that are you
or studied using some great things from
that
resigned that
constructed but certainly back
our stuff
like morning somebody else's tradition
necessarily a replacement
this technology is maybe they're
slightly what
that means behold
technology what
we
the processes are right
lesson
would like to continue this discussion
over lunch with that
served in Charlie's
