very happy to see you here and remote
participants also i'm elizabeth
churchill and i'm here to introduce
Margaret Burnett who has kindly agreed
to come and talk to us about her work on
gender diversity and software
programming etc this is a the issue of
diversity in particular gender diversity
is huge and google has been putting a
lot of effort behind this as of other
companies and Margaret's work over the
last 10 years or so has been really
looking at the diversity of programming
practices gender being just one and
that's the one she's focusing on today
so I'm not going to say too much more
except that she's been researching and
publishing for quite a long time on this
topic for at least 10 years she had a
strong background in the psychology of
programming interface group interaction
group way back when pping right and that
was actually where I met you a long time
ago anyway thank you so much for showing
out she will be taking us through her
research and we will have Appalachian
Trail open for the afternoon for people
to follow up to come and have
conversations and talk about gender mag
one of the things she's going to talk
about today hi Thank You Elizabeth I'm
Margaret brunette here to talk to you
about gender inclusive software itself
so this is all about software so clued
problem-solving tools actually serve
males and females better that's the
question that we've been asking
ourselves for about 10 years and the
short answer is yes there are many years
of data both from my team and a lot of
other teams that have helped to
establish that and will be kind of
talking about a few of those just in
time as we go along but here what I want
to talk about is well what's a step to
do something about that what can we
actually do as software builders and
software evaluators so I want to talk to
you about five facets of gender
differences that can appear in software
tools mostly for problem-solving tools
like say for example debuggers
spreadsheets decision support systems
any situation which the user is trying
to solve some kind of problem let's say
for example privacy settings and the
system's job is to support that fat
activity that's that's the scope of this
work anyway so i'll be talking about
five facets of gender differences and a
new method called gender mag which i'll
tell you what that stands for in a
minute which is an emerging method to
find gender inclusiveness issues in your
tool and if there's time for questions
and answers a few feature changes that
you can make that make tools more gender
inclusive ok so why would we care about
gender differences in using software
anyway well that's kind of obvious but
let's go through three reasons the first
one is that ignorance is kind of a bad
solution so if we say oh gee this is
politically hot we shouldn't even think
about this then you know that's the sort
of burying your head in the sand
approach and we did that in computer
science education for a long time and as
a result computer science education
became a fairly unfriendly place for
females to show up and so I'm not going
to say that the number of the drop in
females in computer science is all the
fault of computer science education but
we certainly had a role in it so let's
not do the ignorance is bliss thing
second studying ones population segment
that somehow become marginalized turns
out to be a great way to find ways to
help everyone this is a very well-known
practice in the design community they
call it transfer scenarios and a classic
example of this kind of thing is curb
cuts so you know what curb cuts are
those are those little cutout places in
sidewalks so way back when there weren't
any and people noticed people like this
in wheelchairs saying wow this is
terrible we should do something and curb
cuts were born and when curb cuts were
born it did help people in wheelchairs
see and it also helped people in walkers
and it also helped people pushing their
babies in strollers
and it also helped people on bicycles
and it helped people pushing heavy bales
of hay on these wheel dollies and it
helped the few people in the world that
have suitcases on wheels okay none of
these benefits were anticipated but by
studying one population people in
wheelchairs they found features that
helped everyone and the third reason is
kind of a business case it's definitely
a business case the target customers so
here is an email that I got that sort of
changed my life came from a software
product manager whose name is not John
and he doesn't work at company X and
this company which shall rename remain
nameless create software for medical
people in a particular segment of
medicine to program medical devices for
their patients needs oh and by the way I
want to encourage questions as I go
along so do feel free anyway the problem
that he wrote me about is that
eighty-five percent of their target
customer base are female but the trouble
is females hate their software so this
is a problem he wanted to do something
about it but he didn't know what to do
what should we change what should we fix
its development team which happened to
be all male had no idea what to change
but it's been our experience down the
road from this that adding a few female
often still doesn't shed the insights
that you need so what should they do
that's what they wrote me about and they
wrote me because they'd seen about all
of this foundational work that my team
and I had been doing over the years
establishing that there was a problem
with gender inclusiveness of problem
solving software so they said great
you're the expert tell us what to do and
that's when I realized we didn't have
anything for those people instead all
that foundational research was very
usable by people with strong research
backgrounds in gender differences but
what could ordinary software
practitioners do and you act people if
they didn't have that background so
that's what led to gender mag dinner mag
is intended to be a bridge from our
research and other people's research to
practical use
non researchers it's a method to
identify gender inclusive issues in
software and there's a get for you x
practitioners and software developers
and we're iterating on this so so far
just a few people are using it and we
want to continue to study a little bit
longer before we sort of go worldwide
with it so what is this method well the
mag start part stands for magnifying
glass and so it is a gender specialized
cognitive walkthrough and I'll show what
that looks like in a minute well a few
minutes and magnifying personas what it
does is it enables you to evaluate
software features and tools through this
gender lens if what you're interested in
is features for helping people
problem-solve or for supporting them if
they problem solve as I said like
debuggers like customization things like
spreadsheets things like that and what
it looks like is a set of personas with
five theory based facets of gender
differences and then this gender
specialized cognitive walk through that
refers to those five facets and these
two bits are really intertwined so they
sort of shake hands all the way along so
here's what it looks like there are
persona and so in case you aren't
familiar with personas those are like
archetypes of assistance intended users
including their goals motivations and so
on so far we've created two of these we
eventually plan to create more as we
continue to refine the method but right
now what we have is one male and one
female named event him and we focus on
five theory based facets in which these
gender differences have been
statistically shown and we show the
statistical position of these
populations the male statistical body of
work in Tim and the female statistical
body of work and Abby so I'm going to
let a be introduced these things to you
don't try to read this I don't expect
you to but this is the entire persona
of a bee and we're going to let a be
introduced you to these facets one at a
time this one you're allowed to read
this one is facet number one Abby's
attitude toward technology in particular
her computer self-efficacy Abby has low
confidence in using computers she has
low confidence in in performing
computing tasks she often blamed herself
for problems that she encounters so what
is this self-efficacy thing anyway
somebody named bandura started this
theory of computer self-efficacy gosh
it's been about 40 years ago now and
it's very well-known and very highly
respected it's a specific form of self
confidence in some particular area if
the task that you're about to perform
it's pretty well known though I'm about
to cook a meal do I have high cooking
self-efficacy or do I have low as 15
self-efficacy do I think I can do this
okay so a lot of of literature shows
that females tend to have lower computer
self-efficacy than female than males and
by 10 to I mean statistically
self-efficacy is very important because
it's quite predictive of somebody's
willingness to try if things get
difficult their perseverance their
willingness to try different approaches
so it's quite a predictor in that sense
of how well somebody can eventually do
so a group that that I was part of did a
study on features and computer
self-efficacy and we did this in
spreadsheets so we we drew this notion
of computer self-efficacy from the
previous research and we asked ourselves
so how does that play out how does that
affect the way people use features in
problem-solving software so we divided
the features into three piles the type
we called familiar that was formula
edits now this is a system called forms
three you've probably never heard of it
oh maybe a couple of you have and in
this this is a prototype spreadsheet it
looks a little different from Excel
but you'll notice do I have a mouse yes
I do okay you'll notice that filling in
a formula is just a text box in our
study we recruited people who were very
experienced with spreadsheets and so
obviously if they know how to do Fred
sheets they also know how to do text
boxes and so indeed everybody found this
to be a very familiar form of interface
so that was the type of feature that we
called familiar then there was the kind
we called taught that was a checkmark
and an arrow we knew they'd never seen
this before because it was only an our
research prototype which hadn't been
released and so this is something called
with you it which you don't really have
to understand it's just a spreadsheet
testing thing and so if you check
something off if you're a user and you
say gee that value looks right can't
find my mouse anymore oh well then they
can check it off and that causes some
reasoning to happen behind the scenes
and the system figures out how tested
all the different cells are in colors
them according to definition use
adequacy so okay that's the checkmark
and the arrows follow the same border
color or the same color scheme as the
border colors so we taught them that we
knew that they didn't know it before
they came in because it's not publicly
available and then the third feature
which we called untaught is an X so you
might notice that instead of a value
being right it's wrong and you can exit
out and if that happens in the system
does some reason in using slicing and
dicing about where the the faulty
formula probably is we did not teach
that we mentioned that it exists oh
there's this X but we didn't tell them
anything about using it or try to push
using it and all the features were
supported by tooltips so now you know
what the setup was what were the results
everything I show you is going to be
statistically significant unless I say
otherwise so this pink line is
statistically significant the blue one
though isn't so what this shows is this
is plotting computer self-efficacy
against the success using the fancy new
features the untaught ones and the top
ones and so
what it shows is that the females
computer self-efficacy was highly
predictive of their effective use of
these features so what that says is
you've got low confidence females and
you've got high confidence females and
their confidence really was a strong
predictor of how much they were willing
to use these fancy new features for the
males you also have low confidence males
and high confidence males but it had no
relationship between their willingness
to fiddle around with the new features
no relationship at all and this
particularly matters because there were
a lot of females at the low end of the
confidence scale whereas not so very
many males in fact we had statistical
differences there too so there are a
couple of other ways in which we
measured their interest in the new
features here low is best so this is how
long until they first tried though all
of these are statistically significant
the females were the first to start
editing the males were the first to use
the checkmark and the arrows and the
males were the first to use the exes
here is another one generate genuine
engagement tells the same story hey the
females were sticking around the
familiar feature the one they were
familiar with and the males were much
more interested in using the fancy new
ones yet another measure telling us the
same exact thing now the goal in this
particular experiment was to fix the
bugs find them and fix them by the way
we we had harvested some bugs from
previous end users and that's these are
the ones marked seeded bugs here and
look no difference the males use the
fancy new features the females didn't
know difference ok so there you know
pretty sharp with or without the thing
but look at this new bugs introduced the
females introduced significantly more of
them now these are new bugs that stayed
put they never went away so the bottom
line is the spreadsheet was more broken
by the time they were done significantly
higher here so hold that thought because
I'm going to have an explanation for you
about why that happened
so let's go to facet number two Abby is
risk averse with new software features
she worries she's going to spend time on
them and not getting any benefits okay
so if we put that together and by the
way this risk aversion that I'm telling
you about for Abby this is extremely
well established in a lot of different
studies on females versus males so we've
looked through an incredible amount of
literature on gender differences with
risk aversion and every study we've ever
looked at either finds no difference or
finds females more risk-averse in any
kind of risk situation in physical
safety in health and financial decisions
in fancy new features you name it either
the females are have been shown
statistically to be more risk-averse or
there's no difference we've never found
one where the males are more risk-averse
okay so if we come back to this feature
thing using those new features actually
is good formula editing is actually
dangerous because it is the only way to
introduce a bug you can't use those
other features to introduce a bug so it
makes sense the females were using more
of the familiar features which they
thought were safe that we're actually
the most unsafe so of course by the laws
of probability they have to be entering
more bugs so hold that thought because
facet number three is going to tell us
more so Abby doesn't particularly like
memory she prefers to follow
step-by-step tutorials and wizards over
tinkering and she avoids troublesome
features now tinkering is defined in
much of the literature as playful
experimentation you're playing around
with things to see what they do in our
study the females tinkered less and this
is some well let's see here that's going
to be this top line here males are over
here the females are here but when they
did so that
pause Phylly so what does that mean well
it turns out that pauses are really
important in education literature it's
been shown that pauses for reflection
just tiny little ones between the time
you do something and you get some sort
of response or question the just small
process can greatly improve one's
critical thinking and so we borrowed
from that literature and we used the
same thresholds they do in that
literature their threshold is three
seconds and what we found out is that
almost all of the tinkering that the
females did was were was possible the
male's when they did that when they were
possible they learned as much from the
tinkering as did the females but males
have this tendency of going nuts
sometimes they went crazy so a plausible
tinker looks like this tink her tank oh
okay there's a pause and some of the
males were doing tinker tinker tinker
tinker and the females were not doing
this now once again this is all
statistical so lots of exceptions to all
these things but that's the way the
numbers lined up um okay and when they
did go crazy it hurt the male's
performance so it actually got in the
way of them being able to learn the new
features and succeed with them so turns
out I've been showing you several
studies in spreadsheets so let's get out
of spreadsheets for a while let's look
at something else I got access to a
whole bunch of data in a whole bunch of
problem-solving settings with a whole
bunch of people's job titles and in
essence I found the same thing so here
this was a survey that had been given to
a whole lot of people with different job
titles and this was one of the questions
on the survey I didn't write this survey
but I inherited it and was lucky to do
so because it's all about tinkering and
says I only use the technology I have to
know these are box plots in case you
aren't familiar with box plots this line
in the middle is the median and then the
the boxes above and below are the
tile above and below and then the line
through the rest and if you see little
dots those are outliers anyway you can
see that the females were significantly
more likely to say that they only use
the technology they have to know than
the males now the females are coming in
at neutral okay it's not the highest
thing but it is significantly higher
than the males that's overall we also
broke it out by job title don't bother
you read all this the bottom line here
is it doesn't matter what job title a
half we find the same thing these are
administrators over here on the left
then we have you X and designers over
here we have bosses of professional
developers here we have professional
developers every single job title
significant differences there were two
other questions about tinkering on that
same survey we got the same answers so
didn't matter how we measured it all
right then let's look at motivations and
strategies so Abby learns new
technologies when she needs to but she
has little desire to learn new functions
she uses methods procedures she's
already familiar with and comfortable
with to achieve her goals so let me just
show you one example of what this looks
like this is something from one of our
studies again but we're certainly far
from the only ones who have found this
and what this we had introduced this is
end user to something called a guard
which I won't bother to explain to you
and she's using it and she says so zero
to a hundred is the guard I'm entering
ok ok hmm so it doesn't like the
negative five so she's raising reasoning
about this she's very businesslike very
purposeful really you know getting into
this thing and what it can do for her
here's what it looked like for one of
our males he starts out the same way the
first thing I'm going to do is go
through and check the guards for
everything just to make sure none of the
Android values are above or below any of
the range is specified don't
work one actually i'm going to put
guards on everything because i feel like
it i don't even know if this is really
necessary it's fun it's fun we never
heard any of our female say that it's
fun but he goes from there to the
businesslike attitude he gets the same
he gets into the same mindset the female
had okay so it doesn't like my guard and
okay aha so we find the problem this way
so what this is showing is that the
paths the motivational pathway was very
different statistically between these
males and females here's what it looked
like in a work that's classic but some
of you may have heard about it so that's
why I included it from bardic barbie to
mortal combat this was really one of the
seminal works on this kind of subject
matter and in this work there was a
study in which males and females
fantasized about technology and so this
again has a lot to do with motivation so
here males for example want to use it
for control females want to use it for
communication males are impressed with
this potential for power females are
impressed with its potential for
creation these are different motivations
for using technology yes rose some of
these differences might just be what
kind of assurances to have visions are
okay very good for the remote people the
question was perhaps these differences
weren't so much about motivation maybe
they were just linguistic differences
and this could be particularly likely if
the men were say for example more
engineers and the females weren't so I
wasn't part of that particular study but
as I remember it those people were not
engineers they were asked to fantasize
about future technologies that they
weren't part of but but I think the more
direct answer your question
triangulation is kind of a classic thing
that usability and HCI researchers do
they take some result from one situation
if they find some identical results from
an entirely different situation
different population then it forms a
triangle to the same conclusion and the
more triangulation you have the more you
can trust the outcome you have and this
motivation finding we did well we didn't
include any facet in our in our method
unless it had at least five different
independent empirical and and well
established bases so we can trust this
because a lot of different people are
finding the same thing um okay let's see
I think I yeah I said what I wanted to
say about that okay facet number five
and this is the last one I'll be going
through is information processing style
so this is work that's had a huge
influence on our work somebody named
Meyers levy well I'll get to that in a
second I think okay so Abby first
gathers information comprehensively to
try to form a complete understanding of
a problem before she tries to solve it
so what this says is she doesn't take
action yet she gathers gathers gathers
gathers gathers and then takes action
okay this this was called comprehensive
versus selective by Myers levy quite a
long time ago and it's been another of
these highly influential theories
although we in computer science haven't
take
as much advantage of it yet as we should
hear the comprehensive is as I kind of
describe sort of and everything first
approach whereas the selective which is
the kind that's statistically associated
with males is more of a depth first
approach so there it's like you follow
some path of information that looks
promising and do something about it
that's depth first and then if that
doesn't pan out you backtrack and then
try the next one so it looks pretty much
like depth-first traversal whereas as I
described before the comprehensive is
gather a lot do a lot of stuff gather a
lot do a lot of stuff so here's what it
looked like in one of the spreadsheet
studies this is on data flow and so a
male described what sounds exactly like
the depth-first approach systematically
go from a formula that realize holy on
data sales progressing to formulas that
rely on other formulas data flow of
formula cells so he's basically
following some data flow chain and and
working on a problem that way in that
study males followed the data flow
strategy significantly more than the
females did and data flow was a lot more
helpful to the males that used it than
the females who used it not in this talk
is the fact that code inspection which
is much more of a comprehensive strategy
was the one that was much more
successful for the females who used it
anyway here's a graph the males this is
plotting data flow instances against
successful bug fixing and the males you
can see there's is nice 45 degree line
and the female as you can see it's just
a big cloud of points here's a really
complicated diagram that I don't want
you to try to sort out yet I'll tell you
what to look at this one is an example
of one male who is at the top and one
female and what this looks like just one
person at a time these different
information processing styles so here's
the first thing I want you to notice so
here's a male this is using what's
called the sense-making loop and so all
you really have to know to understand
this is that the bottom half of these
diagrams are about
gathering information and the top half
are about doing stuff so here is this
male climbing up the sense-making loop
gather gather gather gather gather and
then right here he takes action and then
gather gather gather gather gather and
he takes action here and here and here
and then gather gather gather so these
arrows are the maximum amount of time
that male spent gathering information
before he did something about it five
minutes these arrows show that the
minimum amount of time that the female
spent gathering information before she
did something about it was bigger than
the maximum amount of time the male
spent and look at this long arrow so
what she's doing is gathering a whole
lot of stuff at this first arrow and
then she goes up and does something then
she gathers a whole bunch more stuff and
then she has a whole little burst of
activity and then she gathers a bunch
more stuff and does another little
activity so what are these thingamajigs
at the top well the crosses are when
they found a bug and the stars are when
they at least tried to fix a bug let's
look at those hollow stars those are
where somebody made a mistake when they
tried to fix a bug I want you to compare
the number of hollow stars that I've
outlined in red for the male versus the
number of hollow stars I've outlined in
red for the female oh gosh I didn't
outline house there weren't any okay and
so what's that showing is it's just
really illustrative of this of this
depth first approach so they're
gathering a little information you go up
and he goes up and try something maybe
it doesn't pan out you backtracks try
something else it doesn't pan out yeah
there's a little more try something else
it worked ok that's just that
problem-solving style and you can just
see that it's very different from hers
neither is better or worse they solved
and fixed exactly the same number of
bugs ok it's just different and by the
way spreadsheets mainly support the
first one okay the male style
so now you know this now I know this
isn't that great but where researchers
or people researchers are talking to
gender meg is supposed to let John know
this so how can he do that because he
needs this so that he can fix his
medical technician software to be
generous so Fox mod okay so I am a huge
proponent of theory based methods and
that's what gender meg is I've shown you
all those ties to prior prior theories
and empirical work and so the great
thing about theory based results because
that they enable you to connect the dots
you can connect your findings to prior
theories and so you know what pieces of
your findings actually matter and if
other people also come from those same
Theory basis you can connect the dots
really well between those things too so
this is this is my soapbox now I'll get
back off of it again returning to our
story so to remind you gender meg is
five theory based facets of gender
differences set into a process which is
this gender specialized cognitive
walkthrough Abby has some more stuff the
stuff is mostly exactly the same as Tim
so one of the things that we've strived
really hard to do is to take extraneous
gender stereotyping things out so for
example Abby is very good at math she
likes working with numbers she likes
puzzle games this is the same as Tim so
we're trying really hard to keep those
things from entering the picture we want
evaluators and software developers to
focus on the things that are
well-established and not bring a whole
lot of other stuff to the table so the
specialized cognitive walkthrough for
those of you who aren't familiar with a
cognitive walkthrough it's it's an
inspection method so you have a task
that you're hoping some user can do with
your software and you ask yourself you
would describe a user and and that task
quote ideal set of sub goals and actions
that you wish the user would have and by
ii ideal i mean it would work and then
you ask yourself questions about each of
these will the user notice it will they
actually do it right will they know if
they made progress so that's the
standard cognitive walkthrough it's very
well established and we specialized it
for gender meg in the following way so
the red stuff is what we added
everything else is standard call you'd
walk through so if they're using a be
for example if they're doing the female
side then instead of will Val user we
say well Abby have formed the sub-goal
so we just substitute in the persona
name and we also substitute in the
relevant facets of those five facets so
that they really go back to the persona
and really think about those five things
so that's all that's gender meg so I
wonder if it works I wouldn't be here if
I didn't think it works but I'm going to
try to come in to you of it so so far
we've done a formative capes case study
at company X a formative workshop event
at the LHC c-13 and a lab study with
professional UX practitioners in London
and our results bottom line was Jenner
mag works it identifies user usability
issues that research says are likely to
affect female problem solvers and it's
usable by ordinary us practitioners and
software developers with little or no
gender background so I told you that but
you probably say well how do I know that
so I'll just tell you a little bit about
the lab study we did this on Gidget
digit is a system from University of
Washington it's Michael Lee's
dissertation project he's working with
and eco on it and we used this as our
setting to evaluate the brought in 10 UX
professionals five years gender mag with
a b5 used a standard car you walk
through but we felt bad not giving them
or persona to even though
cognitive walkthroughs mostly don't we
thought you know it's got to be fair so
we gave him tell everyone found issues
but the gender matters found more issues
that the Google team is actually fixing
sorry the Gidget team is actually fixing
and more issues that they tied to the
five facets interestingly both male and
female you Xers tuned into the persona
more with gender meg than with the
standard cognitive walkthrough I think
I'll skip what Gidget looks like yes
question okay I'll show you right now
thank you so are the findings real and
that was by the way for the remote
people that was pretty much the question
are the findings real so the UX the
professional UX folks identified
14-issue types many instances of some of
the same type of the types were 14 and
after they did that and none of them
were connected with the Gidget project
at all we independently took that set of
issues to the Gidget folks and said are
these real and the Gidget folks
validated ninety-seven percent of them
and we know they weren't just being nice
because they had already independently
notice some of those and started to fix
them further of the 14 issue types 10 of
them they also gender validated the
gender differences that were discovered
so to just give you an idea here's one
of the issue types I don't want to try
it regarding some some feature so twenty
four percent of the Abbey issues that
were turned in by this using gender meg
or about that only twelve percent of the
Tim issues using the standard cognitive
walkthrough were about that the Gidget
folks said yes that was a real issue and
furthermore that they had noticed it
especially with females over there many
studies that they had done they haven't
yet fixed it but it's on the plate they
want to the second one fault
localization was something that the UX
in the study turn in equally for the
males and the females the Gidget team
said yes that's a real issue and they
had already fixed it and they said and
it's our experience that it's both
genders and they'd already fixed it by
the time we even had this interview the
third one here you know you can see they
fixed it the gender difference here was
not validated so there are a few that
weren't the last one here we have
assertions it wasn't a big one in terms
of the numbers of the UX people who
noticed it but the the Gidget team
validated and said they too had noticed
the same kind of gender difference and
they had already fixed it so there are
14 of these and as you can see they're
real and they mattered enough to the
Gidget team for them to fix it before we
even interviewed them so this is kind of
Awesome and after that and after those
fixes a couple months after that the
Gidget team went public and they
released digit to the world and since
the time they've released it they keep
track of people who declare a gender
when they download it and forty-seven
percent of the people who have chosen to
download this programming game that's
what it is its programming game our
female which is just awesome see here oh
here's something that you can barely see
it says love you gadget there's
something one of their female users
wrote on a survey that they asked about
digit so future work featuring
opportunities for you so we're working
on field studies we want to know whether
this method works really and truly in
the field when we're not part of it when
we're not giving people instructions
when we don't have a controlled setting
when people are evaluating it on their
own software and they have no access to
the gender difference research we've
also started to teach it and our HCI
classes so I've taught it at Oregon
State which is where I'm from and it's
also been taught at City University
London Harvard maiya University of
Nebraska at university of washington and
there are more people that are talking
about using this and they
classes the method / kit have been under
iterative refinement for about two years
we would like to continue to refine it a
bit more we already know some things
that we want to change we change it
usually about once a month and actually
we have our we have one of our very
first field studies tomorrow at ODOT
which is the Oregon Department of
Transportation and so they're going to
be using it so they'll be the first
government agency to start using it
Google could be the first big-time
company to use it so far we're limiting
distribution because we don't want it to
go worldwide until we actually have
finished evaluating it and seeing how
well it really works in the hand as good
as it can be but if you'd like to
consider using it here I'd love to talk
to you I'm going to be in this
conference room just down the hall the
Appalachian Trail available to talk to
anybody who wants to drop by from 2 30
to 3 and 3 30 to 4 30 so please feel
free to come by and we could talk about
that so conclusions you've seen the five
theory-based asset facets encapsulated
into this method gender mag aims to find
help John find real gender inclusive
issues in his software and the goal is
we'd like to take down inclusiveness
barriers one at a time because it's been
our experience that doing so helped
everyone so I'm open for questions more
questions yes
okay the question that I got was a
nature versus nurture question please
don't be ashamed of that I get that
every time I give a talk like this and
so for us we're agnostic to that we
don't we don't actually care because our
philosophy is this if if you have a male
and a female working on some kind of job
that requires problem solving and the
boss says here's your problem solving
software and here's your table get the
job done I expect you both to be able to
do equally as well then what we'd like
to say is we sure hope that table is
level so whatever they bring to the
table if the output is supposed to be
the same then the table has to be level
and we don't care why the output might
not be the same yes yeah I know that's
terrible oh yes okay very good point so
the question that he asked has to do
with other things in the education and
workplace environment that also should
be addressed not just software and the
answer is absolutely our researcher
right is not about that but there's a
wonderful resource called NC with org it
stands for National Center for Women and
IT and they have wonderful resources
about the workplace climate the
educational climate things you can do in
the classrooms helping address
stereotype threat all kinds of wonderful
stuff all available free and so highly
recommended they're an awesome
organization yes
yeah that's a really great question so
the question was do the personas
actually have to have genders or could
they somehow be gender-neutral because
the real point which which you've
grasped really nicely is the facets it's
not really the gender um it's an
interesting point I don't have an off
the head kind of answer for you but one
of the things about personas is that
they're intended to really help engage
the the evaluator in that user and so if
we turn them into cartoon characters or
somehow you know not people people I
fear that we might lose that but I'm not
sure I mean it really would require some
study to find out yeah we haven't now we
have not it would be worth doing odd the
question was have we tried them flipping
the names and no we have not yes yes yes
yes yes you're absolutely right so the
question was despite everything you're
trying to do to not reinforce
inappropriate stereotypes despite things
I'm trying to do there's still the
danger the people will see all females
is like a bein all males as like Tim so
the question was do we have plans to
have more personas that do more of a mix
and matching and the answer is
absolutely because we're just as afraid
of that as the questioner was we really
don't want that to come out and yeah and
so but we needed to start with these
endpoints because if you're going to
start with only two and if your burden
is to try to show effectiveness of the
method then you really need to take the
extreme extremes at the beginning so
just to reinforce the point also that
nobody is exact
well that's not true it's not true that
nobody is exactly like these personas in
fact we've had some in our labs but a
lot of people are not exactly like those
personas I for example although I'm very
risk-averse in most things there are a
few things that I'm I'm very happy to
accept risks on and I love risk in
certain areas computer self-efficacy oh
that's not me I'm a computer science PhD
so there are some differences you know I
mean everybody everybody has has some
value along these facets they're not
just true or false they're all kind of
on a continuum and as I've tried to say
before there are very few well there are
no actual typical females or typical
males out there and so what we're not
advocating is a pink version and a blue
version because if we did that of
software then what we'd have is software
that fits nobody because there's nobody
that's purely pink and nobody that's
purely blue so what we instead intend
for this to be used for is to find
barriers at that granularity one at a
time and take them down and say oh for
example tinkering males prefer tinkering
as their learning style females don't so
we have to give more than one learning
style okay so that that's what we're
intending it for yes in the back yes it
could so the question is does the scope
really need to be limited just problem
solving software so we're trying to be
conservative in our claims of what it
can be used for so far but we suspect
that you might be right that it may
apply beyond problem-solving software
the examples that the questioner gave
were for example editing a photo but
actually editing a photo does tend to be
kind of a problem-solving activity so a
lot of software sometimes you're in a
problem-solving mode and sometimes
you're not so for example in facebook
sometimes you're just doing light
posting and browsing but other times you
might be fiddling around with your
privacy settings and then that's problem
solving anyway the long the short of it
is yes this probably does apply at least
in some ways beyond problems
solving software but we want to first
establish its working there because
that's the area that's been the most
studied let's see I'm going to take you
because Rose has asked a lot of
questions so far yes yes okay so the
question was do we really even need the
gender labels because the facets are the
big deal and so I agree with you that
the facets are the big deal the gender
labels this is kind of similar to the
answer I gave the previous questioner on
this on this topic the gender labels are
there for two reasons I guess number one
is to motivate the evaluators and so for
people like John for example you know
he's saying we're missing the females
how can we get them and so these gender
labels are helping to answer the
question that he has in his mind and a
lot of people have that question in
their mind so in a way it may be helping
us and then of course from a personas
perspective we may need it anyway but
what I hope to do is add these mix and
match kind of facets for the genders
later so that you know so that we avoid
propagating stereotypes that we don't
want to propagate see yes okay that's a
very good question so the question
really was are these facets well I'm
going to make the question bigger are
these class 'it's just linear and and
that was the the real question and then
i'll add to that and are these the only
facets so what we ended up doing for are
these the only facets and this will help
answer the question you actually asked
to is we wanted these facets to be
usable
by people that were not researchers not
not gender researchers and so we
actually started with a slightly
different set and we there was one that
was just too hard to explain and so we
dropped it but it's there but we just we
just felt it wasn't going to allow the
method to be usable so there's that
they're probably facets that need to be
that could be considered that aren't and
that's another criterion that we used we
said you know how many facets can we
expect an ordinary person is trying to
use this to keep in their head and so we
said okay we're going to go with five
just like the big five from psychology
do you know because you know how much
can we expect from one person in an
evaluation session and then yes to your
actual question are these indeed linear
no they're not we're just taking the
ones that we feel like are really
well-established you know from other
people's research and that'll fit into
this list of five and go from here but
obviously there are a lot of
improvements and changes that could be
made that would have both positive and
negative effects you know on usability
and thoroughness and you know so there's
there's a lot there's a lot of
groundwork still to cover yes okay very
good question so the question was do
these facets apply across different
cultural groups and we can add to that
different nationalities and that sort of
thing too I'm pretty sure that the
answer is yes to a lot but not every so
for example in the country of Namibia I
believe that some of these results would
be the opposite for genders this is this
is what some people from Namibia who are
very knowledgeable about this kind of
thing are also thinking I suspect that
for minorities versus majority ethnic
minorities in this country that probably
they are on the facet side of the
statistical females a lot of times
especially for things like computer
self-efficacy and the majority group
would be closer to the male style
statistically so there are a lot of
other
inclusiveness situations that this could
be applied to but so far we just want to
make sure it works with females and
males and a great thing about that
particular division is it sits very well
studied there are a lot of females and
nails out there that are easy to get our
hands on and for us to validate things
so we don't have to we don't have to say
where are we going to get people like
this and right now gender diversity is a
huge deal and so people are willing to
pay attention when we're talking about
this but I can certainly imagine
extending it to other accessibility and
inclusiveness issues are you trying to
cut me on Elizabeth no okay yes in the
back okay very good question so the
question is about fixes and about
situations in which we might end up
having to trade males against females or
to choose just one gender because maybe
it won't always be a win-win situation
and the question was have I thought of
that uh-huh and the answer is I thought
of it but it's a real problem I haven't
just got a band-aid for it among the
real problem aspects of it are the fact
that adding yet another feature means
you're spending more time programming
which is adding to the cost of software
development which businesses really care
about another minus for adding another
feature or another option is that it's
actually making the software more
complex with even more features which
actually works against the statistical
females in our study so so there are
nuances like that on the other hand
there are
a lot of situations surprisingly many in
which you make the change and it helps
everyone so I can tell you about a
couple of examples one of them is the
classic work that Disney Tang tan and
Mary sure winski did a while back this
is a hardware one this had to do with
navigation through virtual worlds and so
what they found out is that due largely
to the physiology of the eye among other
things females were much more likely to
become disoriented in navigating through
virtual worlds if they had a standard
size screen than males but as soon as
you increase the screen size the
difference went away and so this was
awesome there was no trade-off happening
here you were just basically removing a
barrier another example from our stuff
is we've talked to you about this
computer self-efficacy a thing and the
check mark so the check mark was a way
of saying this value is right ok let me
exaggerate it this value is right so
it's kind of a dogmatic thing we were
asking the users to make a judgment
about formulas that somebody else wrote
the rightness or the wrongness so in our
society at least in the u.s. females are
kind of socialized not to be dogmatic
you add this to computer self-efficacy
and they may very well have felt sort of
not really in a position to make that
kind of a judgment and that could be
part of the reason they weren't
particularly attracted to those check
marks furthermore kind of complicating
the issue we have these these males
going crazy checking things off and
unchecking them checking and off
unchecking them and going kind of nuts
on that and so we made a very simple
feature change that solved both problems
and so in the original thing you check
something off and the colors changed and
you uncheck it and they change back it
makes tinkering very low cost click
click click click click click we
increased the cost of a tinker and so
what what we changed it to is when you
were ready to check it off you clicked
and a
brought up a for couple that you then
had to choose between and one of them
was a check mark it's right one of them
was kind of a gray check mark seems
right maybe one of them was kind of a
gray x mark seems wrong maybe in one of
them was a bold X is wrong and what we
found out is that it solved both
problems and it helped everyone so what
happened is the females tended to use
the more nuanced ones more than the
males but everybody used both of them
and when you really think about it it's
just kind of better because if there's
some judgment that you're making that
you might want to go back to later and
say wait a minute you know well I
thought it was probably right but now
you know it's got to be this one I want
to go back and rethink it so both the
males and the females liked it better
they used it more and furthermore the
cost of a tinker had just doubled and so
all that all that crazy tinkering that
the males were doing and not getting
anything out of it all went away but the
females tinkering didn't go down so what
we had was not tinkering enough for the
females tinkering way too much by the
males and what happened is this okay and
everybody liked it better so sometimes
it's just a small thing and and it can
make a huge difference yes okay so the
question is can we use this at the
design stage two or is it only at the
evaluation stage and the answer is kinda
sorta so it doesn't require an
executable prototype you can be doing
this with paper prototypes and get the
same kind of benefits out of it so in
that way it does help with the design
stage but it's not I wouldn't say it's
prescriptive enough to where you can go
from a blank screen and say what do we
do so there's room for that kind of work
but we haven't done it okay Rose it wait
a minute but I cut her off Rose do you
want one last question
distribution okay so the question was
for these things what's the distribution
look like is it is it really and truly
bimodal or is it more you know sort of
right around the middle and because I'm
talking about so many studies and so
many different peoples work I can't
really talk about any distribution
overall but in general yes we have found
a very bimodal distribution but not on
all five facets together so for example
the computer self-efficacy thing we see
this bimodal thing but then if we look
at risk we also see this bimodal thing
but it's not exactly the same people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
