to present the word learning many
planets it works this is a giant work
between the university of oregon telugu
tanuja group and the music downloading
group in return
let's see so we let me put you in
context the melodic analysis the melodic
analysis is just a part of the of a what
we say journal analysis we can say that
tolerance is a mean to better understand
the thought of haagen-dazs when writing
a piece so in a news in a musical work
we don't have a just a sequence of notes
not all nodes have this an important so
we don't want to play as a robot but
beta we need to discover the points of
tension and relaxation in the one in
order to have to give this message S&amp;amp;P
due to the Sun this can be done by first
defining thing in the courts then as the
courts had a mission haha we say a
turn-on function we can build this kind
of curve the case of of the new Tony
courts we have been the lower level set
of pensions the highest level of
Taxation and in the case of the dominant
court we have the highest level of
operational the two we represented here
was designed to preserve us some
learning tools so one of their meetings
together a high grade level but also one
of our additives actual to be able to
explain the rules applied to the student
has used in the system their power
however some other direct applications
of the tool for example will be using
especially operating performance or to
be integrated in any other music
information retrieval system to do
automatic composition to do is
correlation with speech telling or to be
used as the system that outputs a
sequence of courts to be used to compare
Harmon Harmon Holly and works there soon
these are some of the more
important works regarding the deal with
with tonal analysis none of them focused
specifically or medic analysis there are
two ways of analyzing sins from the
tunnel analysis a point of view what is
the classical vertical grouping of notes
that compose named chords giving this
kind of of sequences and the other one a
more classical academic approach does
that you use the Roman number analysis
with tonal functions and all the
telephones this is our words let this
take a look in an electronic analysis we
have several steps that had to be
combined so no one can be applied one
after the other so we have to take in a
to have in mind all the parts but I will
tell you that in in order the first past
Pat would be the new devices in the
melodic analysis we try to turn each
note as harmonic on your hand non
harmonic tone there are some clues that
say to us that for example this node is
not part of harmony for that this node
is part of the harmony we have put some
red spots for a 22 difference then
having the melodic analysis we can make
vertical groups of the notes just taking
the harmony harmony notes and taking out
the harmonic notes and then we can meet
the sequence of pots then using us
feature the accident was founded in the
in the song we can imagine which is
there which is the kid and the
tonalities and with a key internal it is
and rocker progressions we can get the
degrees of the chords on also the
terminal functions in previous
conferences we have presented a system
that that solves this problem more or
less and first by computing a melodic
analysis then featuring out invalid or
non possible electron LEDs given the
accidentals of the notes and and we then
we build a layer waiting that's it
basically the graph that contains all
possible combinations of tonality
squirts stoning functions and
corporations and from that we compute
the best part 1 in the in the RAF and
get the most probable tone our immune
system from this in global system we are
focusing now only on in the respective
verdict analysis wait it's important to
note that the relic analysis interacts
with all the other parts of the of the
analysis so we cannot decide just using
a meddling features the correct melodic
analysis because there are some
interaction between everything so the
question do some here this work possible
we wanted to know how well we can solve
the network analysis without taking into
account all the other parts so far in
the previous Beltran analysis system we
used a we applied first a simple even
else will chain using Java programming
based on basic musical fruit and then we
use a bit more sophisticated system
using some rules Mayweather physiologist
regarding the first one the simple in
the nerves
two editions chain and we were very
simple a pretty simple condition like
this one we made conditions for the
passing tone for example is this example
for all these all these non harmonic
Jones this approach was very very fast
but it didn't give a high success rate
because it didn't government so the next
step we took was to try to write using a
set of rules this knowledge of a Miss
colleges so we will assert a rule the
covers many of the fragment situations
found in melodic analysis the problem is
that so far we have we have 40 roots and
and each ever found sent another k is
not covered by the by the root system so
it it seems that this approach has not
not no end so we have a new case for
every new error so the next natural step
was to try to learn everything among the
machine learning approaches we can use
we have discarded as testicle approaches
because as I have said before we want to
be able to explain with human natural
and musical language to the user work
with the system does so we used with we
chose to use a real systems among the
older root systems and we decided to use
river by coin because we have a an
imbalance that I said we have many more
harmonic tones that Nakamura terms and
the river considers first day is more
classes so is that we have to say that
the this
if I has given to after this success
right now let's see how this pyramids
and using these machine learning
approach seems too soon to show that
that is suitable by now we are focusing
only on Barra period and we are working
just in furthering the 10 and as a
harmonized chords and we have used these
curls because from the academic point of
view they seem to be a kind of first to
know the ability of the weaker river
according to children learned amid the
musical rules we trained the system
using the whole purpose and then the
nice ecology then consistent output as a
series of roads and then then a
mixologist analyzed all the rules
applied in there in the other rules
structure from the end for the grounding
system and he taught each each status is
probably Aurelia green in evergreen and
so on and this would these are probably
the results from the extractive rules
only one was for him Marlys perfect 20
holiday of the rules were acceptable so
he agree with them and half of the rules
were not dating no megami make sense
let's see some representative cases now
for example the strongly agree this is a
correct Rowan but it has access
residential sample in that case in for
the Ibaka druuna we all need to have
this motivate them a way to meet that
this is a less require it to be equal to
2 in the interval
for the real rules please this is the
case for 20 of the structure rules and
in that case in many cases there's a
missing condition the next interval
pasta too I did this seems to happen
because it's not this is no time a
discriminant content untested and so
it's not in nearly any any of the rules
in that case it has a missing condition
and also there are there is another
irrelevant understand and so the
psychology decided to agree or disagree
this case the initial it is a great
because it's amigos and besides it
contains some strange rules like this
one finally this feature languid notion
and get now into the death of the hitter
but for something in this case you can
see that he has a vision 13 so it used
to be an effect of the object of the
river otter in person it's somebody was
this one okay in order to to be able to
to tell the accuracy of the system we
have to take into account that mmm the
melody system has not enough information
always to up with the correct act
because it depends on the melodic be
depends on the harmonic the harmonic
system so for us we take that as
successes is when the expected time was
among the answers of our system now I'm
going to switch to the graphical user
interface will have developed in javafx
for letting the musicologist work and
analyze everything that has he has
wisdom that's in sorry because ok
eyewitnesses to the assistant
not as I knew knew that these are some
some snapshots and this is a system we
have developed you open the work sorry
in that case a here we have the tax the
tax for then the denisha colleges has
given 22 inch of the node then we choose
the system we have we want to apply and
then we have like a the three systems
here we have the success rate here the
musicologist sees I can can analyze a
which rule has been applied he had he
knows which are which rules are not the
correct which starts I'm not currently
given a he knows the features the
decision has been the consistent has
taken to tender decision and besides he
also knows their owner has been applied
in this case using that this is the
evaluation of the system and from the
research we can we can see that the
repeal of 10 is consistently successful
taking into account account again that
some of the devil's done a hand release
on just using feat nelly features how do
you like a question yeah it's what i
have said with them what the definition
never sees that the the number of times
that the output of the system sorry
expected value is among the outputs of
the system so we have said before that
these are three because in the three
systems okay they knew that and here
this the success rate in this case in
the correct it's a hit when is
respective values among the dell
pathologist
okay and these are high this binding was
almost everything this are harmonic that
you guys hear that rigor is able to give
a price acoustic sizes right but the
saxes break is not the most important
for us the most important for us is that
that the system he said 12 to export a
meaningful roof so and one or another
application of the of the system and
this is our system by the disability
Motorola and they have used the output
of the mitotic analysis and they have
been used these these these these tags
as input for their their automatic
performance system and they what they do
is just to modify the onset of the nodes
the length of the nodes to give some
expressiveness and they have found that
by applying the inputs of the verdict
analysis when using that as features for
the automatic performance system the
system a place more as a human that than
can without using them so it has been
useful okay so compute I can say that
that we have seen that it's possible to
learn the melodic analysis using a
machine learning approach another you
see few rules have no generate be
consulted defined without specific cases
but if we merge of the rules sported by
the generated by the automatic learning
system we get more or less the same
rules nevertheless we can't we have to
say that we have to say that the
exported rules are valid to explain the
user why a decision has been taken now
we are extending another set we are
tagging all the worst weekend and from a
money for us by back and musicologist
now is investigating this is taking all
the all the errors down by the system to
know whether we need to add more
features to today to the input of the
system we also I we are applying also a
Hindu p logic running to be able to
capture some short and long-term
relations between children and we plan
to apply this kind of of setup to all
the other phases of the end all that
analysis system and that's all thank you
