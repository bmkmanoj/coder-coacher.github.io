company located in Boston and that's
exactly what we do we work with
customers to help them measure what's
going on with media and and optimize it
it's very interesting to see the huge
advances in neuroscience that have come
basically in the past couple of decades
we're getting the point where we can
actually measure the brain while it's
operating and see how it works
and certainly the traditional tools do
not work all that well so if you look at
you know the number of product
introductions per year and the total
about 70 between 70 and 80% of them fail
meaning people are launching the wrong
product targeted at the wrong market
they're not understanding how people are
actually thinking let me talk a little
bit about Interscope research Interscope
Research was started about two years ago
actually originally by a psychiatrist
from Harvard named Carl Mars a very
smart guy he's a Rhodes Scholar and he
was studying empathy between doctors and
patients an empathy between doctors and
patients is really the study of is the
doctor emotionally matching what's going
on in the patient and he came up with a
whole bunch of techniques with that
started working with a guy named Sandy
Pentland who's at the Media Lab at MIT
actually on a smart badge technology so
that so it's a badge that you wear it
listens to what you say it doesn't
actually look at the words but it
actually measures your your emotional
state and the goal of that project was
to detect depression in people so people
who are prone to depression using the
badge to actually see whether they were
becoming depressed or not and they
bumped into another guy who got an MBA
from MIT named Brian Levine and he
actually was one people behind
developing the major league baseball
website so by putting together the
neuroscience the emotion and the study
of websites how to make effective
websites they put together a company
about two years ago
and started working really on the
hypothesis of can you use these neuro
marketing techniques to measure people's
engagement to media and if so can you
use that to optimize to make
more effective and fortunately they
found the answer to that question was
yes now let me show you kind of the old
paradigm of decision-making this is
really straight out of Descartes and
it's called we call it the thing do feel
model so you think about what you want
to do you make a decision you do it and
based on the results of what you just
did you said that was a good thing to do
that was a bad thing and you learn now
it would be nice if this were the case
but it's it's actually completely wrong
now that's not to say our rational mind
can't influence our unconscious mind but
what is about sixty percent of Americans
are overweight you know ninety percent
of people who try to lose weight fail
clearly if thinking about something was
enough to influence your behavior we'd
be able to do a lot of things you know
if your boss is saying something
annoying to you you want to be nice to
them I'm the kind of person I always
have to speak my mind it hasn't always
been to my advantage I have to say it's
very hard to break the habit of my my
emotional mind and yet when we're
developing products we use cognitive
instruments to try to measure people's
satisfaction with them and this always
takes me to an experience I had a while
ago so we're designing a product
actually a company where they called
cyber gold it was the first
pay-for-performance advertising product
on the internet back in 1996 so that was
a long time ago and we're designing
product try to get people as efficiently
through the process of doing something
in the advertiser wanted them to do so
we could get paid and we're running a
focus group and I'm there behind the
two-way mirror watching people use our
product and the guy sitting there using
the product and and he's stuck and
there's a bright yellow button on the
screen and we we knew a little bit about
usability back in those days right I
mean I've you know I've read Donald
Norman book I've sat down with Jakob
Nielsen I know who tog is and
it's new who that is and so it's
something that's important to me and the
guy sitting there and I asked him otter
I say is this glass soundproof and he
said he said yeah sound / offensive no I
mean really is it really sound poof he's
yeah that's really found proof and I was
so upset I'd like push the button press
press the button is a bit you know big
it was yellow is right there in the
screen the guy was sitting there
confused about what to do next
now obviously that is not the users
fault and as a product designer and
someone who's run my fair share of
marketing campaigns I realized when
someone doesn't get the message you're
trying to deliver to them it's not their
fault it's that you haven't built the
product you haven't written the right
messages in a way that it gets through
their brain and a lot of times the
mistake is you're trying to appeal to
their thinking brain as opposed to their
feeling brain and that's something we're
going to talk about soon and so but
people continue they run focus groups
they do surveys they do a person with a
dialed as a diol test for for TV ads and
video right you sit there and as you're
watching you supposed if you like
something you turn the dial up and if
you don't like it you turn the dial down
these are all cognitive measures these
are all measures that require your your
conscious thinking mind to work and they
do not do very well for most questions
around changing people's habits and
that's really the key so there's
actually a great book by a guy named
Neil Martin called habit it's a pretty
short book and it's about how people
customers get entrenched in the habit in
their habits and it's very hard to
change their habits here at Google you
guys are developing a great habit in
people which is the habit of going to
Google for all of their searches that's
a great habit and as your competitors
know it's very hard to get people to
change that habit but one thing he
noticed is that if you survey people
right after they changed their cellphone
service
85 percent of them say that they're
satisfied or very satisfied with their
prior cellphone service you know that
sort of blows me away he actually did
his PhD thesis and he noticed that when
you survey people their satisfaction
with a product as they report with their
thinking brain by filling out a survey
that only represents 8 percent of their
actual repurchase of that product so in
other words saying I really like
something explains less than 10 percent
of actually buying it again and this is
the kind of thing that advances in
neuroscience have really helped us quiz
with this is a someone with their head
stuck in an fMRI scanner and so an fMRI
scanner can actually watch people's
brains while they're working now this
stuff is all very early I mean really
just now starting to tease about the
tease apart what parts of brain the
brain are responsible for which things
how they work how they work in concert
to make decisions and those kinds of
things but there are starting to be
practical applications now one of the
challenges is for most people who are
developing marketing campaigns they
really can't afford to stick people in
fMRI scanners it's just way too
expensive you can only do one person at
a time and so what we've come up with at
Interscope is a way of reading people's
emotional brains very inexpensively and
that's something that is very important
because what neuroscience has figured
out is that emotions are what drive us
I put the dog up here because in a very
dramatic circumstance it's it's obvious
that your emotions drive something right
if you're walking down the street and a
dog leaps out at you and starts barking
you stop you hunker down you might run
but whatever conscious thought you were
having goes out of your mind
but what neuroscience has really shown
us is that in fact everything we do is
filtered by our emotions first so
literally what you see
and what you pay attention to is
filtered by your emotional state an
example I like to use is you're driving
to work you're tired you're mad you got
a meeting you're late you're upset and
someone comes to cut you off on the
highway you're going to have a certain
behavior and a certain reaction to that
if you're feeling good you're
well-rested you're happy if someone sort
of cuts in front of you you'll have a
very different reaction
and so actually what you see and what
you experience is a hundred percent
influenced by how you're feeling and the
interesting discovery in neuroscience is
that this happens on a second-by-second
basis and this is exactly what we can
measure it interscope is on a
second-by-second basis essentially what
is your emotional state now I won't do
too much brain science here but I
figured it's worth doing a little bit
this is a diagram of your brain of
course and on the outside is your cortex
and the coordinates does a lot of
different things but part of what it
does is cognition that you're thinking
brain is wrapped around this old
reptilian brain I just showed the limbic
system here actually kind of down toward
the bottom is the cerebellum that's also
as part of your emotional machinery um
this brains is the limbic system was
actually very successful system is
became - came to prominence in reptiles
and if you remember dinosaurs ruled the
earth for about a hundred and
thirty-five million years this is the
system that influences what you remember
what you pay attention to and and
they've done all kinds of great
experiments with mice showing that for
example in the amygdala which is the
part over there you can actually inject
chemicals into a rat as they're as
they're performing a task that will make
them remember that task better and you
can also inject chemicals in there to
make them not remember what they just
did and if you think about it as someone
developing a new product or developing
an advertising campaign
what you want people to do is remember
and to change their behavior and so this
is the part of the brain that you have
to engage to get people to change their
behavior and again just going back to
the weight loss example thinking about
it doesn't work for habitual behaviors
like buying things like using products
things you want people to use every day
that's a habit that is not something
that happens in their thinking brain it
happens in this part of their brain so
let's move on to what we do at
Interscope so we measure something we
call engagement and engagement is
attention to something that has
emotional impact and we'll tell you what
emotional impact means but there's
really two components of this one is you
have to be paying attention to it and
the other is that it has to have an
emotional impact on you and we measure
this using a very simple system excuse
me we put a vest on people it's a very
lightweight vest it's wireless so it's a
little box on the front that wirelessly
transmits data to a PC and it measures
four things it measures how fast you're
breathing
basically the change in your heart rate
so is your heart rate going up or your
heart rate going down measures how much
you're moving are you leaning forward
are you turning around and it measures
what's called galvanic skin response but
how much are you sweating and this is a
system that can very accurately measure
your emotional engagement of things and
there's a very concrete reason for that
which makes this superior to a bunch of
other brain measurement technologies
they're really focused on the cortex
things like EEG you know that's
basically measure around your head those
are measuring your cortex this measures
your deep brain because it turns out if
you look at where these outputs go they
go out to your peripheral nervous system
so and you know feel free to read this
yourself but but basically all of these
measures are things that are reflected
deeply by your emotional state and this
is something that is very logical
so if you heard a gunshot behind you
ever in this room we'd all turn around
we'd all start sweating our heart rate
would go up and we might stop breathing
for a little hold our breath and we'd
all do that that's something that we'd
all do pretty much at the same time but
it turns out again going to this point
that your emotions are driving you all
the time it's much more subtle so in a
second-by-second basis for example these
parameters are changing so for example
if you're looking at pictures of
something that's pleasing so people
smiling babies things like that your
heart rate actually goes up slightly and
if you're looking at pictures of things
that are unpleasant
so someone frowning rotting food things
like that your heart rate actually goes
down slightly and so this really is
something that on a second-by-second
basis you can figure out people's level
of emotional arousal now you guys have
an algorithm here and we have an
algorithm - and this is our our
algorithm so our measure of engagement
which is the thing on the far side
that's composed of two things it's
composed of something we call synchrony
and intensity now it turns out when
you're measuring emotion it's not very
reliable to measure it just in one
person so what we do is we measure
groups of people experiencing for the
most part the same thing at the same
time so they can be watching video they
can be paging through a virtual magazine
and will time sync when they're all
looking at the same page they can be
doing a web experience and hackers here
at the inside Google and so it can be a
web experience and again we match up
when they're looking at the same thing
at the same time I'm not doing anything
wrong here okay good nice to meet you
and and and what we've done by doing a
bunch of scientific reaches we forgot it
typically takes a group of about 20
people
- reliably measure on a second-by-second
people's emotional engagement to media
and and how their signals go together
that's the synchrony component so again
if there's a gunshot in the back of the
room at the same time we would all do
the same thing if people are watching a
video experience that's engaging their
parameters will tend to change at the
same time now the reason you can't
measure it in one person is because you
could be sitting here looking at
something on the screen and think oh
I've got an appointment 15 minutes I
have to go suddenly you know your stress
level go up you're you know these
parameters start to change and that's
because you're obviously your brain is
working on a lot of things all at the
same time but if you do it across a
relatively small audience you get a very
very reliable reliable signal in terms
of this emotional engagement piece and
let me show you how it works in an
actual product so this is a this is a
video of a Heineken commercial and it's
called the weasel and the blue bar over
here is the audience's level of
emotional engagement so this was 20
people sitting down and watching this
commercial actually as part of life as
part of a television reel so the way we
test things like video commercials is we
just people basically sit down and watch
TV they put on the vest we get them hook
up the machine we establish a baseline
and they just sit there and watch TV
they only have to be exposed to this
once and it's a completely natural
experience the vest is wireless so
people can you know get up and go to
bathroom and sit on the couch and
actually when we measure the Superbowl
people got one beer quarter they sit
there eating potato chips and that kind
of stuff so it's you know it's a very
relaxed environment so let's see if I
can get this to play here there we go
your fries
so pretty interesting right I mean you
know as it goes as the story progresses
people's engagement in the ad goes up
gets to the height of the story when he
does the refrigerator opened he takes
the beer and and then really nothing
else goes on in the story so down
engagement goes again
um now this was an ad that we analyzed
as part of a big study by the
advertising Research Foundation so they
took a number of advertisements from a
bunch of different companies and they
had all different people look at how
measuring different ways of how engaging
the content was and that included doing
post test surveys on these ads so so how
memorable the ads and what was people's
attitude to him so so this particular ad
had very high likability people liked it
but very few people remembered it and it
has a decent pattern of emotional
engagement but if it and and that's just
the pattern of engagement through the ad
right it rises to the joke and then it
comes back down but there's a there's a
very interesting reason if you hook
people up to eye trackers and have them
watch the commercial you can see why
people don't remember this commercial
very well and let me just show you I'm
just going to show you I tracking data
from the height of the joke which is
over on the left-hand side of the screen
at again at the height of the jug when
people are their maximum emotional
engagement they're looking at the
generic beer and that's why this ad does
not work because when your engagement is
high you're not paying attention to the
important message and this is what we
see and honesty this is a this is a
place where I tracking data can lead you
quite far astray and I'll show more
examples of this as I go through but you
can you can spend time looking at
something but have no emotional reaction
to it and therefore you won't remember
it or obviously you can be looking in
the wrong place at the wrong time
so let me talk a little bit about
validation I mean it's great you can
measure this stuff it's cool that you
can show an example of one but it seems
a little bit far-fetched to think okay
let me get this straight
how fast my heart is beating how fast
I'm breathing whether I'm moving or not
that really is going to measure how well
I remember something deep in my brain
that seems a little far-fetched to me so
so we've spent a lot of time doing
validation studies and these are all
things that we're happy to share I think
that's one thing is very important in
the new and emerging industry is to be
be out there and show that your stuff
works and that's something we're very
happy to do um we actually recently
finished a joint study with TiVo and
TiVo has a panel of 100,000 users who
have opted in so they they allow TiVo to
look at their what they're viewing and
on a second-by-second basis when they're
fast forwarded you know what they've
chosen to record sort of all the
relevant TiVo parameters again this is
an opt-in panel the TiVo has and so we
had a hypothesis and our hypothesis was
that if an ad is really engaging people
will watch it and if an ad isn't very
engaging based on our measure on our
algorithm
they'll fast forward so that's the
supposition so so this is a graph of the
TiVo data so what we had people do is
they sat down and they watch TV for an
hour and a half that's it that was their
experience so they didn't know they
would be testing for ads or for
emotional engagement or whatever they
put on the vest they sit down and they
watched live TV so and of course our
panel was watching the same Channel what
we did was we took the people at TiVo
who were watching the same Channel at
the same time and match their
fast-forwarding behavior to our
emotional engagement measure so this is
this is taking that this is doesn't show
the show this is just showing the
different ads in the different ad pods
across the show and this is this is a
measure of TiVo fast-forwarding so it's
the number of people who watch the
entire ad so so if the number if people
start fast-forwarding the number of
people viewing the entire ad goes down
and if people stay the number of people
watching goes back up
and and I'll just lay over our measure
of emotional engagement so that's again
our second by second measure of
emotional engagement for these
commercials so it is the case that when
people are not engaged in an ad they
pick up the remote and fast forward you
had a question completely independent
and they just happen to be watching the
same channel at the same time we also
did a study with NBC looking at channel
changing behavior so when were people
likely to change channels basically the
same results so if people are highly
engaged they're unlikely to change the
channel if their engagement is low
they're highly likely to change the
channel another one we did and this was
an example where we can compare against
some of the other ways that data is
collected is with the Super Bowl so we
had people watch the Super Bowl as I
mentioned they got if they wanted they
got a pool you know they could have a
beer quarter no more than that and we
picked the top five most engaging ads
from the Super Bowl what are the ads
that we thought were most engaging and
USA Today does a they do a diol test so
they have people sit down and watch with
the dial that's the one in the middle
and they pick their list of the top the
most engaging commercials this is a
Super Bowl in 2008 and then there was an
eg company that published their data on
what they thought were the top five most
engaging ads so the hypothesis here is
that if emotions matter the emotional
measurement should be more predictive of
online buzz than the dial which is a
cognitive measure and of EEG which is
predominantly as I understand it a
cognitive measure so that's the
hypothesis so what we did this was 2008
so what we did was we looked at the
number of views of these commercials on
MySpace and again the hypothesis being
that the most emotionally engaging ads
according to the Interscope measurement
should get more views and more comments
than the diol test or the
and in fact that is the case so this was
this was over roughly a nine month
period looking at total views now there
are a couple interesting things about
this one is that the dial test is a
market mover so USA Today advertises
their results right there reported in
all the papers they're New York Times
they're obviously in USA Today so people
go and see the ads that they think are
the top ads automatically so it is a
market mover and the other thing that I
think is really interesting about this
is their sample size is more than 10
times our sample size so our sample size
for 2008 was only 20 people and that
really is a key to this emotional
measurement technology like with TiVo
the way we create value is we say we can
measure a small number of people and
that measurement is going to reliably
scale up to a large number of people and
that's the really the key to the
emotional engagement piece is that is
that you do a small study that scales up
to behavior in the large and if you're
really interested in sort of the more
sort of techie version of it this is
basically the correlation so what's the
correlation between online views and
online comments and our measurements the
dial test we also compared against
self-report so this was a study and I
actually I don't actually don't remember
what the N on the self-report is of
people rating the ad to themselves which
ads did they like the most and again
this is the one where your cognitive
brain is not a great predictor of your
behavior so asking if you liked someone
this is just like repurchase this is
just like switching your cellphone
customer this is just like sitting
someone down in front of your product
and saying did you really like that did
you know are you going to buy it are you
going to use it those things those
things are very poor predictors or I
mean there's somewhat predictive let's
let's be fair they are somewhat
predictive but they're not as good as
your emotional system and again the
reason why sir
it's this huh yeah question yeah would
be to it's typical to measure whether
people remember an ad right yes did you
do that yeah we do we do do post-test
recall and it's it's very highly
correlated so
back to the the Heineken commercial
again we would do post-test recall do
they remember behind it can add but
really what you want to get to again is
their behavior and actually another ad
that we did in that series was a Burger
King ad or it was actually to Burger
King ads and the in market performance
of those two Burger King ads was known
so it was known ahead of time which one
did well in the marketplace and drove
behavior and which one didn't and our
measure of emotional engagement again
the one that we said had the we measured
high emotional engagement in was the one
that had better in market performance so
so and actually recall can be import
right that's kind of this interaction
between your cognitive brain and your
emotional brain meaning if your
cognitive brain doesn't remember the
features and the brand and that was you
know the phone you saw at the 18 t store
it's going to be tough your emotional
brain to get you to the 18 t store to
buy so you definitely need both of those
things together and really what we're
saying is that this measure of emotional
engagement from your from your kind of
more primitive reptilian brain is
actually what drives your memory meaning
if you're not engaged you won't remember
and if you are engaged
you will remember that's really the key
to all this um let me talk a little bit
about print advertising because that
ties right to the web right the web is a
relatively static content it you look at
a page you try to figure it out and
something happens so this was this was a
Honda commercial Matt or this is a
Saturn commercial now now this
particular one we did ourselves so
Saturn we didn't do this in conjunction
with Saturn and the next one I'm going
to show you is a Honda ad and we didn't
do that in conjunction with Honda these
are just things that we measured
independently ourselves and you can see
the ad on the left-hand side of the
screen so it's this ad it's rethink
safety so the message of the ad is I
would say Saturn makes safe cars and
what we do is we put together eye
tracking data so we take the heat map
from the eye tracker and when people are
looking at certain spots on the screen
we can measure both their cognitive
engagement to the content by looking
essentially at their pupil dilation
because that's a measure essentially how
much cognitive processing are you doing
are you thinking about something and the
read is is what comes out of the vest
are you having an emotional reaction to
what you are seeing or reading and what
you want to see an infective ad is you
want to see both cognitive processing
and you want to see emotional processing
you want to see those two things
together and that really gets to your
question right you want if you want
something to happen in your conscious
brain but your emotional brain is going
to drive that ability to remember what
that thing is and so this ad sort of
down here over in this part of the
screen people the white circle is what
we call is what we call a disconnect
that means you're looking but you're
neither having a cognitive reaction nor
an emotional reaction and typically we
see that in two circumstances one is the
copy is very generic right so it's a
flick it like if you if you do phrases
that are trite that people have seen
before
they'll just disconnect right they'll
just zone over and that's actually what
you see up over in the corner with the
Saturn logo right people have seen it
before it's not in any kind of context
they see it they recognize it but
nothing happens and when they get down
to rethink safe some cognitive
processing is going on but there's no
emotional reaction to that somehow that
content is not resonating with them now
hopefully in another 10 years you know
with advances in brain science we'll be
able to tell you even more about that
going on but this is something where you
can see that there is a problem and in
fact where people ways either the red
circle overlapping the blue circle over
there and the lower left of the ad it
was with the miles per gallon so not so
the message they want to get through
this is a Honda ad and this is a very I
would call it a cheap emotional trick
and I'm not sure they even knew they
were doing it but it uses chocolate so
chocolate creates an emotional reaction
in a lot of people and in this case it
works so you can see them you know
people look at the ad they take in the
cupcakes they have a very emotional
reaction to it you know some of the
cupcakes it's really just emotional I'm
really not
you know they're not having any sort of
cognitive reaction to that and so
they're essentially primed when they get
to the word crave they have a very
strong reaction and this is something
you see all the time and advertisers
kind of you know they really know how to
tap into stuff already right I mean
celebrity endorsements are a great
example right if you're a golfer you see
Tiger Woods you see him with the golf
club you're going to have an emotional
reaction because that's someone that you
that you like there's been a lot of
controversy actually as people look at
this stuff and whether using attractive
people sells product and and actually
it's interesting cuz that's that's a
question we can start to tease apart and
let me show you some catalog covers we
did these are not the actual catalog
covers because because the client didn't
want want us to use their name and
everything but these are we created the
synthetic catalog cover behind it it
looks very much like the original so so
this is one using two attractive women
now you know they probably didn't do
this consciously but they're trying to
essentially create an emotional reaction
and you get you to pay attention to the
copy by having someone attractive and if
you look at the one on the Left where
she's sort of in the fitness outfit
you'll notice that well the first thing
you'll notice probably is that you look
at her face right people who are viewing
this stuff always look at faces and
that's something we have a special part
of our brain for processing faces so
anytime you put a face in something
that's above a certain size people will
look at it and people will almost always
have an emotional reaction to it and and
so you can see that happening right
people look at her face and they have an
emotional reaction but they really don't
make it from her face over to the
content but in the other ad what has
happened is they've wrapped the the
content they want you to read around her
face and so as your eye moves to
processor face you become engaged you're
very close to the copy and so you
actually have an emotional reaction so
although it's the same copy right it's
not a copy problem it's a way of
designing and ad so that you have
more emotional engagement to it and this
is kind of a best practices thing and we
see this in video ads you know we talked
about this in video ads and print ads
and and those kinds of things but it's
very interesting they're a whole bunch
of techniques that you can learn from
emotional processing on things to do
like a great example is if you're
watching video ads anytime there's a
relationship between people something
happens between people people's
engagement always goes up so you know
we're analyzing some videos with cars
and this is actually I've been this
company about three and a month so I'm
pretty new here at Interscope but this
is literally my first week I was looking
at some of our results and we were
analyzing some car commercials and every
time a bunch of people went and jumped
into a car together people's engagement
would just shoot through the roof and
I'm thinking that is not the interesting
part of the ad right there are people
dancing there people singing and
suddenly it's like the end of the ad and
get in the car and that's when people
suddenly become engaged even though
there's great music and celebrities and
all these kinds of things and it's
because we're programmed to pay
attention to relationships when
something's happening when we see two
people talking when we see people get
together we pay attention and so that's
something that you can leverage in terms
of your products and your advertising to
create an emotional engagement let me
talk a little bit about the the web we
do we do some stuff with companies on
kind of user experience where it's it's
something that we're really focused on
more in terms of people who are doing
launches of big products and things like
that and that's that's another thing to
take away from this emotional processing
stuff is you can optimize things by
sitting on a pile of data and analyzing
it but a lot of times if you're say
creating a new ad or a movie or
something or a new product you're
investing a lot of money in developing
that product and so you you know you
need the launch to go well I mean with
advertising that's very true right I
mean people literally spend millions of
dollars developing commercials and then
they have to go place them in the market
and see how they do so the cost of
making a mistake is expensive tweaking
your text ad on Google AdWords not so
important I'm sure you could learn
something about that from emotionally
from
emotional engagement research but but
not so important so most of the work we
do with clients on the web is when
they're going to launch a new site and
they're really curious about how people
are interacting with the content and is
it resonating because because you can
have people engage in behaviors but when
someone clicks they may click because
it's something they want to do or they
may click because they're confused and
they don't really know what's going on
and that's really the kind of thing that
we can determine so this is this is
again a synthetic ad that is very
similar to the actual content that we
did for an actual it was one of the top
three consumer packaged goods companies
and a site that they have and so the
first thing we looked at them was was
the navigation so as people read the
navigation what was their reaction to
the words and this is really a copy
question right are the right words being
used or words being used that that
emotionally engage their target target
audience because that's another key to
design these studies right you need the
right target audience the people who are
actually interested in using this
product if you take you know this one is
not for the Heineken I think we did you
know beer drinkers you know 21 to 28 you
know male beer drinkers that was who is
viewing the Heineken commercial that's
their demographic for this website you
probably wouldn't get good data out of
using that same that same demographic so
so what you can see from this is that
you know some of the navigation people
cognitively process but they don't
really react to it some of the
navigation people don't really
understand what it means kind of like
this stuff some people are having an
emotional reaction to it but again
they're not really cognitive processing
so so we recommended that they basically
tweak the actual words they were using
on the stuff to make it clear which
sections of the site people were going
to this is the this is the heat map from
the eye tracker and so if you're using
the eye track you're thinking well hey
we're actually getting pretty good
coverage people are reading the various
areas of the site they're looking this
thing will probably perform pretty well
but if you look at their emotional
engagement at the same time in
and look down here where it says you
know maximize your style look look what
happens when you see that they're
looking but but you're not seeing the
blue circle and the red circle
overlapping you're not seeing those
things so they're looking they're having
some some reaction to that copy but
they're unlikely to go there and then
this part which was about kind of the
goals in your life people kind of don't
get that what that's about but you as
you can see they process her face they
like the content over here and this part
of was actually about swine flu and very
effective something the target audience
was interested in and that they had a
good emotional reaction to let me talk
briefly about a study we did for YouTube
in Europe so they were in answering a
number of questions I would if I had to
boil down the core of their questions I
say it was down to how was the how were
the videos on the site playing off
advertising content and this is a
problem that television networks have
also which is when you have content
that's engaging alongside advertising
there's a huge concern with advertisers
that people are not paying attention to
their advertising and that's that's a
obviously problem that YouTube has right
we're going to put ads up and everyone's
gonna be watching the video and not
going to pay any attention to what we're
doing so so we did a bunch of analysis
for them and we created something we
call a spotlight video so this is a
video that puts spotlights where a
certain number of audience members are
in fact emotionally engaged in what's
going on
Morris the stage one
coarser with mp3 connection discover
voxel so this is good news right which
is people are scanning the site and
looking for the videos they want to
watch the advertising placed alongside
is actually as compelling enough to get
people to come over and have a reaction
to to what's going on on the screen and
and this is this is sort of to layout so
you can see it it actually does have
have good balance but there's actually
was another interesting finding about
this and I'll just throw up the data and
that is that people watching YouTube are
more engaged so their average level of
emotional engagement is higher when
they're on YouTube than when they're
watching television and that makes sense
because if you think about YouTube it's
a it's a lean forward experience right
you're navigating you're clicking you've
got to be there you've got to be active
it's not it's not a Leanback experience
when you're sitting on the couch but
what that means is and I'll sort of
decompose this for you this is this is
basically the emotional engagement of
people watching a particular ad I'm only
going to show one trace but this is a
pretty common effect which is so the
blue one is they're watching on YouTube
and the orange one is they're watching
on television and what it is is first of
all you can see they start higher right
the blue line starts higher people are
starting out more emotionally engaged on
on YouTube but what happens is they can
dip lower and this is again with
something we saw across ads in fact at
least one of the ads performed extremely
poorly on YouTube even though it
performed decently well on television
and so it would appear that what happens
is you're much more distractible on the
web right you have it you're more
engaged you have higher expectations and
so when things are not good you tend to
fall off a cliff and my guess is you're
they're looking at other things and
they're sort of thinking about what they
can do next and so that really creates a
higher bar for what happens on the web
and this is just you know again just
kind of reinforcing that point that
that when people present on the web the
creative needs to be frankly more
compelling I'll just briefly put up a
summary of the points that we got out of
that study and or maybe perhaps I'll
take a question first sir okay I
actually I'm working with YouTube
monetization excellent without giving
anything away do you find that
advertisers really want you to watch the
entire ad on YouTube or are they happy
if you watch 25% or 50% Oh what what
they want is they want their branding
moments right the question was the
question was you know do they want do
advertising want people to watch the
whole day typically they do because they
have some trajectory for the ad that
they want you to go through I think
advertisers are becoming more
sophisticated about understanding
especially in a fast forwarding
environment that they need to nail you
early like it was interesting looking at
the data from the TiVo study right where
people were fast-forwarding basically if
people are not engaged in an ad within
the first three to five seconds they
start fast-forwarding and it's the kind
of thing where you basically lose about
20% of your audience if your levels down
20% you lose about 20% of your audience
I mean it's a very striking effect and
so they want you to watch the whole
commercial but I think they're getting a
lot smarter about realizing you may well
not and therefore they need to get their
engagement in upfront and get their
message across okay
did you have a question um yeah you
should show a strong emotional
engagement with faces directly have you
ever measure the difference between
faces of people you already know and
strangers faces is that something you've
looked at at all um I haven't this is
where I wish our CEO was here at the
psychiatrist because my guess is that
they have
I actually don't don't know that but
usually things are more familiar with
you have a you have a higher engagement
with but again I don't know the answer
to that question so let me just let me
just tell you some some of the results
now one of things is is we did this we
did this research with a company called
otx so we did the emotional engagement
part of the research and oh
did all of the other parts of their
research including doing surveys of
people after they watched surveys before
and surveys after and these were the
results from a whole bunch of studies
and I don't have time to go through them
all but I thought this is very
interesting which is you know people are
more attentive to YouTube that was
something we measured and that this
engagement leads to higher recall so
part of the test was testing people
watching ads on television versus ads
that they watch on YouTube so this goes
back to the CSIs if you're more engaged
in something you're more likely to
remember it
the third point really goes to this
point of ads can have an impact in the
context of other content and if you're
someone who sells advertising this is
very important right advertise you want
to know that their messages get is
getting through and then the fourth
point was something I didn't talk about
much but this was just one where
essentially being on YouTube had a halo
effect where when you measure people's
attitude toward towards the ads
afterwards if they'd seen them on
YouTube they thought they were basically
more high-tech more Internet friendly
and all those kinds of things so so so
there's definitely some things going on
there but period stuff and in really a
good example of how you can use
traditional research and emotional
research together to really get a much
broader perspective on what's going on
with your consumers I'll just sort of
wrap up here first of all if you're if
you're interested in this topic there
are a couple books that I recommend the
book habit by Neil Martin is really
about how consumers get entrenched in
their habits and potential ways of
getting them out of their habits now
what we would say is the way to get
people out of their habits is to create
something that they're emotionally
engaged in you really have to push their
emotional triggers you've got to get in
there in the limbic system and get them
engaging both attentive to what you want
them to do which is new and different
and actually engaging in that behavior
but that's that's kind of a short read a
good book if you're interested in a much
deeper view of how emotions play in the
brain and actually a lot of very
interesting case studies on how people
with emotional
Harriman's have a huge amount of trouble
with decision-making I mean they
literally have people where the
emotional centers of their brain are
damaged and they'll go into supermarket
and and they'll spend hours and never
buy a single thing with perfectly
wonderful recall of what they saw why
they were there what they were doing but
but essentially your emotions create a
space where you can make a decision
right if essentially what happens is you
you have an emotional feeling that I am
making the right decision and you do
something it's like a shortcut and so
people who have emotional impairments
actually have a huge amount of trouble
with decision making um the other thing
I'll say about what we do is that we do
a lot of stuff that is earlier stage so
so if it's if it's basically where
you've already spent the money now now
we have worked with advertisers to
rescue broken ad campaigns so ones where
they're in the market it's not going
very well they're not seeing to pick up
they're not seeing a change in behavior
bring it back and we work with them and
we've actually gained some great
insights from that in terms of what
needs to be fixed and put stuff back out
there that's pretty interesting but it
really is working at these early stages
and one of the nice things about
emotional engagement as we can work at
these early stages we can work at the
the animatic stage we can work at the
storyboarding stage at the rough cut
stage as long as your copy and you know
the design of your site in things like
that a representative what's going to be
in the final product we can gauge
people's emotional reaction to that and
those improvements really go right to
the to the bottom line so so so what's
the value of all this you know
neuroscience stuff today it's it's
really a focus on changing people's
behavior that's really the bottom line
if you want someone to adopt your
product if you want someone to pay
attention to advertise and get the
message you need to emotionally engage
them one of the big advantage of the
system is its cross-cultural so it
doesn't require that you create a survey
or surveys in multiple languages or
those kinds of things we've done testing
all over the world and there are
certainly cultures where asking
questions people will always say you
know for the scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is
the best though you know say everything
is a 4 they don't want to see you know
they don't want to say that they don't
like things and this is something where
you don't ask questions you litter
just measure their brain as it's working
it's very useful for best practices
again how can you create use faces use
relationships things like that to get
people emotionally engaged the real
focus here is on optimization we don't
come up with brilliant advertising
concepts we don't come up with new
products what we do is we help people
optimize the ones that are there and
make the very best of it again starting
from these early stages we allow you to
show value if you're someone who sells
advertising allow you to show value to
advertisers that people are emotionally
engaged in the content picking it up and
likely to change their behavior based on
what's going on and it really it's a
first step of getting to why you know
why is a product going to work why is a
marketing campaign going to work and why
is it not and and neuroscience is at an
early stage but through this lucky
accident of the vast and your limbic
system and the changes that we can
measure very efficiently and very
inexpensively this is the kind of stuff
that can be available to people on a
regular basis as they create new
products and new media campaigns and
launch them and that's it thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
