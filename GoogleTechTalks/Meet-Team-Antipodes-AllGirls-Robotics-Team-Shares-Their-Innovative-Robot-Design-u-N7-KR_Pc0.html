and I'm Emma and we're Team Antipodes an
all-girls team from Pacifica we recently
went out to a international competition
in Istanbul Turkey and competed there
and today we're going to be sharing with
you some of our experiences there as
well as other tournaments and also a
little bit about our robot and other
aspects of FIRST LEGO League
competitions so the first tournament we
went to was in Santa Clara there weren't
very many people but we still got first
so we then from there went on to a
qualifying terminen in Sacramento which
was a bit larger and there we took third
place which qualified us to move on and
then we made it to the Northern
California championships where we got
third place again and we were able to
move on to the open european
championships so they were scheduled in
mid-april but the volcano erupted and
covered europe with a giant ash cloud so
it was postponed it's called I Jeff
jolla Joeckel so just last week on the
second and third we participated in the
tournament in Istanbul with over 50
teams from all over the world we did not
place but we still did very good okay so
you may be wondering how this got
organized and such so FLL FIRST LEGO
League is the competition that we
participated in and it is it is one of
four that is organized by first first is
an organization sponsored by Dean Cayman
the inventor of the segway it stands for
for inspiration and recognition of
Science and Technology there are four
programs organized you first the first
one is junior FLL it's for ages six to
nine year olds it also uses mindstorms
robot the one we were in FIRST LEGO
League is for 9 to 14 year olds
the next one is first tech challenge
this uses a bit more complicated vex
robots which are metal pieces that you
put together and as for 14 to 18 year
olds and then there's first robot FIRST
Robotics Challenge which you basically
make your own robot and that is for also
for 14 to 18 year olds so on the course
the robot remains completely autonomous
and so if you touch it while the robot
is outside of base you get a 10-point
deduction from the 400 total points you
can gain from doing all your runs there
are 11 loop set up around the course
like this and if you bring each one that
you bring back to base is worth 10
points so you can get a total of 110
points from getting the loops but
there's also a bonus involved if you get
three gray loops you get one free red
loop and if you get all three red loops
you get one free loop of any color so
that means you don't have to physically
bring all the loops back to base you get
some of them for free if you release the
car from the ramp look right here you
get 20 points if their access markers in
the corner and if you knock each of them
down they're each worth 20 points you
can get a total of 100 points if you end
on either to the top of the bridge or
the target area you get 25 points
there's a crash test dummy that if he's
kept in or on your robot the entire time
you get 15 points if there you have four
passengers and if they if they end in
the target you get a 10 extra points
there are also some obstacles in the
corner there are four red walls and if
at the end of your at the end of your
run they're all standing you get ten
points for each wall so total of forty
points and then there's also access or
warning beacons that are set up all over
and if by the end of your run they're
all standing you get 10 points / beacon
so you can go to a total of 80 points so
each robot has one cpu which is the
brains and helps control everything that
it does
you're allowed to use one ultrasonic
sensor up to three motors which have
built in rotation sensors up to two
touch sensors and up to two light
sensors along with this you can use any
other product that is built by Lego okay
so now that you know all the tasks that
this robot has to accomplish and all the
parts are allowed in the robot I want
you to think of a robot that you would
design that would reliably get 400
points every run in two minutes and 30
seconds which is the time limit for FLL
so close your eyes so everyone to close
their eyes and I want you to imagine for
30 seconds what you would make okay so
not exactly 30 seconds so I want so as I
know as probably all of your ideas are
very different from each other similarly
all the FLL teams have very different
robots so here's one of them and as you
can see they all have different
attachments different strategies and
they're completely different so here's
our what no there's our robot so one
thing a unique about this robot is that
it's very simple in its attachments we
want to spend as little time and space
as possible and more time out on the
course completing their tasks so we have
a touch sensor with a plate so that we
don't have to actually touch the sensor
we have two light sensors rear guide
wheels so we can run along the wall the
CPU of frame on the bottom to hold it
together and a block extra light a fret
touch sensor to drive motors to drive
wheels two front wheels another set of
guide wheels a arm and axle I mean a
motor and axle for our arm sides
a front frame support for the motor a
roof and a sensor activation plate and
an arm and this is it together and blown
up so after you've done designing the
robot it's time to program it there are
we use a programming language called
mindstorms NXT G which is an icon based
programming language that is it is much
easier for younger users to learn and
there are simple blocks such as the move
or motor block shown here that will just
make the robot go go straight turn or
something like that but there's also
more complicated arrangements of blocks
such as the line follow program shown
here within which you use a lot more
complicated blocks and so once you get
into more complex programming you can
use loops which the line follow is
contained in if then switches and you
can also use your programming to orient
yourself around the course so for
instance you can back into a wall and if
when it from the touch sensor is touched
or pressed it will it will stop the
robot and so that way you know exactly
where you are on the course in relation
to the rest to everything else in our
robot does that a lot of times and so
now we can show you just what it does so
we're going to run robot for you now
usually before we do runs we do a light
calibration because during the line
follow program we do a line follow or we
do we use the light sensors and if the
lighting conditions will change and so
if we just had one light value for
though for all of them it might mess up
and so we have a shroud on the bottom as
well as doing a light calibration in
which it reads the value of white and
the value of black and our line follow
program finds the average of those two
and stays on the gray so it stays right
where the black meets the white instead
of only on the white or the black
so since now that we got all three gray
loops on we can get the red blue and
since we got all three red loops now we
can get the blue loop right here
oh so sometimes our robot be a bit
unpredictable like that instance right
there and sometimes the sensors are a
little bit off so it'll run into
something and you'll have a collision
like that so not a real competition the
referees would come over and they review
everything with us and we'd get get told
how many points we got so first we start
with the loops we got 10 out of 11 loops
so that's 100 points we got the car so
that's 20 we caught all for access
markers so that's another hundred so
we're up to what 220 and then we
actually did not land in the target and
but we did have Buster so that's 15 so
that's 235 we did not going to knock
over any access markers so that's 315 we
also didn't knock over any walls so
that's 355 and but we didn't land in the
target and we didn't land with the
people in I said that and so that is our
run so this whole experience of doing FL
the FLL season has been an adventure and
quite a learning experience actually we
now know more about how the engineering
process works how to make our ideas
become reality and how to work as a team
it has also helped us decide what
careers we want to pursue in the future
um if you know any anyone adults or kids
that are interested in FLL please let us
know because it's such a great
experience and there's a lot of kids out
there who would love to be a team but
they just don't have a coach to get them
started so now we invite you to come up
closer we can run again if you have any
questions we can answer them and you can
take a closer look at our robot yes I am
personally a 1b robotics engineer I
would love to work for NASA one day
build satellites and Rovers and such you
and I want to be a vet
and in doing this you have to present a
lot and teach what you've learned to a
lot of people as we're doing now and
through this experience I've learned
that I definitely want to become a
teacher any other questions yes one of
the big challenges of building it is
that we chose to go under the bridge
here instead of see if I can go over
here and you can go under here and cross
over these and it's a we decided to go
under here so our robot had to be a
certain height and also over here in the
corner sure she wants point um eight
there's a very small space we can turn
in so our robot can only be that wide so
our robot is as big as it could be to do
the task as we have and also programming
mine follow was difficult the line
follow we did was called a PID line
follow program which is proportional
integral and differential and so
basically what it did was at the
beginning as I as I said it we have two
light sensors and one of them would read
the light sensors detect how much light
is reflected back off of the mat when it
shines a light on it and so they assign
numbers and so for instance white would
be 50 and block would be 100 except for
it would probably be block is 50 and why
does 100 and so what it would do is one
light sensor would read 101 would read
50 and so instead of staying only on the
white and only on the black it was day
one light sensor would be on the block
and one would be on the white and so
really it would be staying right in the
middle so if I could find the average
and stay right in the middle of the
whole time but as you saw it's not it's
easier to say than to write the program
for and it's a very long program and its
its most of it is math and calculating
we had a lot of variables that we had to
make which are
numbers that are repeated throughout the
program and it's all calculating
calculating Calculon to the very end
there about three move blocks and so it
just repeats that over and over and over
again to do the line follow that took me
about through two to three weeks to
write any other questions yeah well
there's I I was basically the only
builder but they definitely had input I
think the main differences we had was in
the strategy which definitely influenced
how the building of the robot went and
also in building the arm one of the
things about our arm is it stays
parallel to the ground the whole time
due to the state there's a stable gear
and the other gears rotate around it at
some point we wanted a few of us want to
just have a sore arm that stuck out and
just went like that and others won the
parallel so there's definitely
disagreement in that any yes
well it's we kind of we had to get the
basic build of the robot and then we
started programming but then at the same
time we would be building more and
changing things so then we would have to
change the programming and it's a little
bit difficult especially for the
programmers I mean it's difficult for
the builders too but the programmers
will write a program that they like and
it's all working and then the robot will
be different and they have to rewrite it
some other way and so it's a little bit
it's a little bit difficult to just keep
going through that but in the end it
works but both of us um we had a lot of
time constraints as a team she was doing
theatre I was in marching band and Emma
was on track and so we all had after
school activities and it was really hard
to get as a team and so most of the time
what we would do is we would meet as a
team on monday and we would decide as
many strategy decisions as we could make
and then we would the program you would
program and then the designers would me
a designer would mean and and she would
design and because what would happen if
we were all together is that she would
be trying to build the robot and we
would be trying to write the program and
you can't do both at the same time we
would be fighting for custody of the
robot so we ended up working we will
work to get there on important strategy
decisions but then we would separate and
work independently for the building and
developing yeah
um so you there's a main theme for it it
changes every year that is released like
May so we found out well yeah the theme
is released in May and then the course
and the mission and the mat and
everything is released in September and
felt mail out everything to you and
usually the first real robotics meeting
you have is putting together all these
pieces on the mat they just send me the
pieces in the instructions and you have
to put everything together and then once
you have it all set up you can really
start strategizing so that's all in
September the first competition is in
November so you don't have a whole lot
of time yeah yes I think one of the
things we didn't realize you can do for
this blue loop here we didn't want to
get it because it has beacons all around
it but what something the other teams
decided is that oh you can bring the
beacons back to base and stand them up
in your base and you won't lose the
points we didn't think of that until we
saw someone else do or like oh my gosh
that would have been great we want we've
had so much trouble that orange loop
back there that it would have been a lot
simpler I think that's something I
personally would change yeah yeah we had
our last competition the first day our
robot can't run straight or just like
what is happening and actually two
things were sort of going on one when
the motors was completely breaking down
and another is that we have these
plastic wheels on the bottom there are
front wheels I guess there and um they
were rubbing against this other plastic
piece and so they're making these
grooves and we didn't realize this until
later and so there's these giant plastic
grooves that we would did not expect it
all and that was completely affecting
the straightness of the robot that was
something on next
did also one time I put the slide on
backwards and we realize that actually
works better so we just changed it and
it yes we have a coach Ken filer it
you're a lot you can have many coaches
and you can have mentors which are
generally kids older than yourself who
helped you with strategizing and
everything and the purpose of coaches is
not necessarily to like they kind of to
help you along and if you get stuck they
can give you suggestions but they they
try to not interfere with like your with
you building it it's supposed to be the
kids not the mentors and also we along
with this in the competition there's
also a project part where you you have
to pick something this year it was about
transportation so you picked something
in your community that you wanted to
change about the transportation and in
that you could get a lot of like outside
help to for research and whatnot they
actually encourage you to yeah um well
this is actually my first year doing
this competition but I've always loved
robotics like they have just robots of
always I've always wanted build
something like that and so this is me
and 60 second year and the year before
we were on a big team that was just kind
of randomly put together we got dead
last at the first competition I think
our high score was 40 points um and our
low score was like 20 which was pathetic
um and so we definitely made sure she
learned a lot the first thing we did was
we decided we wanted a much smaller team
with people who actually were going to
work and care so it became us
one thing we learned from the previous
year is that the previous year we had
spent all our time and base and putting
on different attachments and changing
little things that really took a lot of
time out of the mission and is part of
what caused us to only get 40 points and
so that definitely helped us this year
was one of the first things we decided
was that we were going to spend as
little time in base as we could and we
practiced over and over changing out the
doing our base time to make sure we got
it to as little based time as we could
because we didn't want the same thing
that happened last year to happen this
year is there a question um it didn't
change that much actually we have a
shroud on the bottom that we built
because at one of our competitions our
line follow just didn't work and it's
because there's these big skylights at
the top and the light level would change
during our run after we did our
calibration so that's one of the major
things that changed I think basically
everything else did the same a lot of
programming differences we yeah um
getting the orange loop in the corner we
went through many many trial and errors
and trying to get that there was but we
ended up going back to the same thing
that we had at the first competition so
if there wasn't a whole lot of
difference but there was a lot of
progression and learning and trying to
get that to work and also from the first
competition at the first competition we
didn't have in running it we didn't have
a high score four hundred we had a high
score of about 370 because we didn't get
the gray loop on there which means that
we didn't get three other loops and her
two other loops and so throughout that
we've gradually gotten in we've gotten
more and more points also as the thing
went on yeah yeah are we didn't we
didn't try to get that at all we just
left it out and hope to get 370 yes
at the first competition it was in Santa
Clara's we just drove there and there
were about like 16 teams maybe which is
a lot fewer at the second there were
maybe 37 about and at the at the norcal
tournament there are about forty eight
and then at Istanbul there about 52 I
think from all over the world and to get
to Istanbul we had to do a lot of
fundraising from local businesses and
more corporate businesses to get the
money for plane tickets and hotel and
everything but due to the volcano um a
lot more expenses came up so we're still
trying to fundraise we're still short we
built a website to help get funding so
we have a website and you can go to and
just like ten dollars helps o is a good
fundraising opportunity we've gotten 400
multiple times yeah we didn't get any at
the Istanbul tournament but at the
norcal tournament we got 14 hundred and
we've gotten for hundreds in practice
many times our robot is unpredictable
you never know one's going to be a 400
and you never know when it's going to be
like at 300 any other questions yeah me
and Emma actually me and Emma in the
fall we're going down to Tasmania
because we have a sister team actually
down in Tasmania they vied this down so
we're going to do FLL down there since
it extends to 16 and all the other
countries except the US and then after
that I think we're going to do FTC and
we decide to frc was you need like a 20
person team and we're not going to be
able to recruit that many people yeah so
and any other questions ok um you can
come take a closer look at a robot see
how it works we can probably run it
again a field like so yeah come on so
off to the side as our research project
which you can take a look at
which is mad clubs we have working my
cliffs somewhat working necklace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
