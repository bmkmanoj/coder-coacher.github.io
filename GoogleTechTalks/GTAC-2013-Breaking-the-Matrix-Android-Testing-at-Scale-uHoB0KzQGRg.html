speakers are from Google they're gonna
come up to have a nice interest I'm just
gonna quickly let you know that they
tried to invite Keanu Reeves to to kick
off their test talk it turns out GTECH
tickets sold out so fast it couldn't get
them one so sorry canno with that I'd
like to introduce Thomas Kinch Stephon
Rams our and Valera zakharov who are
gonna talk to you about breaking the
matrix Android testing at scale
I imagine that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice tumbling down the
rabbit hole hmm you could say that I can
see it in your eyes you have the look of
a man who is executing all these tests
by hand now ironically that's not far
from the truth do you believe in manual
testing you know why not because I don't
like the idea that people should do the
same thing over and over I know exactly
what you mean
let me tell you why you're here you're
here because you know something what you
know you can't explain but you feel it
you've felt it since 2006 that there's
something wrong with mobile you don't
know what it is but it's there like a
splinter in your mind driving you mad
it's this feeling that has brought you
to me do you know what I'm talking about
the manual testing matrix do you want to
know what it is the testing matrix
covers everything
it means testing on all phones on every
API of them now even it means testing on
your glasses
soon you'll have to test on your watch
you already need to test on TV you need
to test on cars you need to test on
different networks
it's the spreadsheet that has been
pulled over your eyes to blind you on
the truth what truth
that you are a slave you know like
everyone else your manual tests are
catching bugs that could have been
caught with automation or emulation
immediately a prison for your mind your
life is being wasted installing up in a
hundred different bones you know you'll
never prevent a regression
this is your last chance after this
there is no turning back
you take the blue tablet the story ends
you go home test however you want
you take the red tablet you stay at Qi
tag and I show you how deep the
automation goes
so we're here for the blue tablet are we
just gonna give up
go home test however we want to test I
don't care or are you guys gonna take
the red tablet stay here find out what
me and my team do and see how deep the
automation can go red that's great the
blue tablet sucks I have no slides for
that you'd have to leave so I'm Tom
pinch I'm a staff SCT at Google with me
today are Stefan and Valera and in the
audience is Yvonne and Ashwin together
our team focuses on making the lives of
Android developers at Google as awesome
as possibly can be so we want to share
some of our efforts that you might be
interested in that area so first off why
are we talking about automation and
mobile together what really makes this
special or interesting well I kind of
put on the slides here terms that
everyone can understand so what's the
computational complexity of this
function how fast is it going to start
growing it's okay this isn't an
interview I was hoping for some answers
and then you know maybe get some people
for my team but basically let's say you
know for every test we have for every
device that we want to test on for every
API that device supports that's another
test and we can kind of visualize that
more like this actually there's a
problem here we're gonna need to clone
each one of those devices for every API
level let it support send that quickly
leads us to another problem the desk is
like really crowded right now and
they're just not going to fit so I'm
really excited to announce today the
launch of a totally awesome new product
Google desk it is a desk that can holds
literally 100,000 devices so no actually
I'm not gonna announce that it got a
can't because apparently it was gonna
mess up our carbon offset so we'd have
to like chop down something like 20
acres of forest per desk so
unfortunately most developers s actually
don't look like that they might have one
phone they might have a smart tablet
they share amongst a team but when their
talk about testing they mean they're
gonna push the app and press some
buttons and yeah it looks good to me
the core problem seems easily
parallelizable we have basically the
same test we have the same device a set
of devices we want to run on but we are
really getting tripped up on how to
automate those tests and you know
honestly I haven't seen too many teams
that have got it right there's more than
a few problems that are blocking them
first off you know just having a place
to run your tests is painful you got to
have those devices on your desk you got
to have the right ones that once the
users are having problems with or that
you think might be interesting so you
know you constantly see someone running
around who has a droid razr who has a
Nexus One they're in museums now
actually but somehow there's someone
complaining about Play Store saying that
their app isn't running on their Nexus
One and they don't want to buy a new one
and the other like core problem is like
it's not really fun to write tests on
Android and we've been talking on and on
about developers needing to write tests
and there's lots of benefits to that but
if it's a painful process you're gonna
face lots of resistance and it is a
painful process but does anyone think
it's painful great I was worried that
like you know we might have to have an
intervention here
so let's go back to our first problem
you want to develop an Android app you
have no idea how to do it
Yuriy developer.android.com and you'll
read this lovely statement that I pulled
out of there that I always mess up when
I say it but I think I'll get it right
this time cuz I'm reading it right on
the screen when building a mobile
application it's important that you test
your application on the real device
before releasing its users and I've seen
this be twisted so many ways but
eventually boils down to this we can
only test on real devices there's no
other way to catch bugs in our
application and I hear very smart
technically competent people saying this
I'm sure you guys hear it too and I'm
sure there's someone or maybe yourself
that you know that hears this statement
and then is tasked with you know
building a lab of those devices and I'm
sorry you know you're probably thinking
something like back to your web testing
days where your tests are running on a
nice austere piece of data center
hardware no problem you just send some
tests there start your server start the
test they run everyone's happy
no big deals it can't be too much harder
right with uh you know your smartphone
so you just need some USB cables a hub
you know and some cool looking phones
unfortunately you quickly start to
realize that there's a lot of
differences between this piece of
consumer hardware which was made to be
cute and really enjoyable and this piece
of boring data center hardware first off
the data center hardware there
manufacturers have you know published
numbers of you know the mean time
between failure like when is this thing
gonna break you can plan like when you
need to replace them consumer hardware
has a similar concept you're going to
the store buy a new one every six months
it was not designed to be running 24/7
365 executing your tests and if you try
to do that they will probably fall over
and break in very interesting ways when
you want to go buy a new piece of data
center hardware it's pretty easy right
you know you have a con
at HP IBM compact something you can
easily walk call them up get the device
into your data center it'll be rackable
easy to support consumer hardware's a
little harder actually a team at Google
realized that they needed this a couple
phones from AT&amp;amp;T we didn't have and how
did they get it
well the PM went down to the mall with
her credit card and she bought like $800
worth of phones and the guys like why
are you buying all these and she was a
little awkward and said yeah you know
they're their presents and you know if
one of those happen to break you know
she would have to walk back slip back to
the mall and like return it versus like
maybe having a vendor come on site so
you're sitting there you know with your
Hello Kitty phone trying to wonder if
it's the phone that's not running the
test that's not running that was running
code you think was bad that's why you
were testing it is it the phone it's the
USB cables its batteries it's a hub you
say you say I wish I was like Google I
bet their device labs are like totally
awesome like they totally solved this
problem why aren't they telling us how
they did it well this is actually a
Google device lab I spotted in the wild
a couple of years ago and for you poor
souls that are building a device lab I
have one major morning and I saw in a
previous presentation someone else was
making this mistake don't try to break
the law of gravity if you doing so many
difficult things here that's a bad idea
in this picture like those phones are
attached by a little bit of glue on the
whiteboard which looks totally cool you
can watch the phone's execute the test
when you're in the room you're like oh
wow these people got it down but what
happens is the phone gets hot because
the CPU is constantly running and the
glue gets a little you know melted and
then the phone's hit the floor break and
there's much upset
gnashing of teeth and yeah so flat level
surface people you know it's expensive
hardware I could go on and on listening
all the problems that you are gonna have
to solve if you are building a device
lab earlier I saw you know some people
have gone to the point where like they
make their own red boards and you know
rack them up and wow that looked really
difficult you have your security
concerns you know I saw some of you
people looking at my Hello Kitty phone
you're not getting it it is super cool
their maintenance burdens the phones you
know constantly need to be upgraded
they're not the hardware is flaky they
are all like weird shapes they have
different power supplies they generate a
lot of heat you get a lot of them in one
room and then all of a sudden the Wi-Fi
stops working all in all you're gonna be
syncing some pretty big bucks into your
device lab very smart engineers it's a
big hole and it's something that like
you know normal companies I don't really
expect to be able to solve the problem I
mean why spend that time and effort when
you could be doing useful things so at
this point you're shaking your head
you've been tasked with building this
device lab and you just realized that
there's so many you know issues you're
gonna hit and maybe like it doesn't make
sense like if we can't even get a place
to run our tests why are we writing them
you know I mean it seems kind of silly
but um why are we hung up on real phones
like what bugs do you guys expect to
catch on a phone or device that you know
would only happen on my Galaxy Nexus or
Hello Kitty phone anyone timing issues
hardware issues Bluetooth and GPS right
yeah battery issues UI issues okay I got
a good collection here but you know all
in all I don't know about the bugs you
guys right but when I write bugs I very
rarely in doing GPS work or Bluetooth
work the majority bugs you're gonna find
in your code don't care if they're
running on a Galaxy Nexus or you know a
Hello Kitty phone they will reproduce
anyway we have a lovely little
song-and-dance number over here button
off by one error concurrency buffer of
affairs these problems they don't care
you can reproduce them on almost
anything but we're falling over
ourselves to get real devices to make
them happen and you know when you can
say like you know most of your bugs boil
down to using less than instead of
greater than you know it seems kind of
silly to expend all that engineering
talent and you know what you know beyond
those trivial logic books that actually
aren't trivial they make up the bulk of
bugs and sources of user dissatisfaction
you know what we if we could replicate
the OS version we're running on the
screen size and memory constraints we're
catching even more and more bugs that
our users might hit and we're starting
to really narrow the class of the bugs
that could happen on physical devices so
it can write targeted tests for the
pieces of our code that interact with
Bluetooth or GPS and after all of our
functional test paths and our code looks
good from that standpoint we can take
the code and then run those targeted
tests on our precious physical devices
and if those test paths then we can take
the app give it to a very good and
talented exploratory testers and have
them use it like a real user and not you
know executing lines on a spreadsheet
but actually testing the app creatively
and the best thing about this is you
know we can do this with emulators and
emulators let us go back
home to the data center it's really
beautiful when you can scale at the rate
of a data center and you know we have
our Google data centers but there's
Amazon data centers and you know you
might have your own in Google we've been
able to run 82 million Android tests in
March in our data centers does anyone
know how many seconds there are in the
month of March it's about 2.5 million so
I'm thinking we're scaling reasonably
well we're running in the data center
it's a beautiful reproducible
environment I'm not running on your
phone versus his tablet and it's like
having a bug I can't reproduce it's all
like relatively hermetic most of the
time area it's not totally hermetic we
sometimes mess up with that but it's
good right so wait we all know emulators
aren't realistic so why should we use it
to run our tests we believe in testing
right actually the Android emulator is
different it is just another device
which means it emulates real phone
hardware if you take a look at the entry
source code you will find a device
called goldfish and goldfish represents
the emulator hardware if you are
compiling the source code for goldfish
we get a count and we get a system image
for emulator which is almost identical
to a image for a real phone but what we
are compiling we are compiling the
android architecture but don't worry I'm
not going into details only this if you
look at the lowest part this is the
device dependent part I have a question
here where do you think most of the bugs
occur on this chart no idea you're right
actually it's not on the chart you know
where the bugs are right so it really
doesn't matter if you're executing our
tests on an emulator or on the phone for
the test code it is the same environment
but at Google we didn't stop here
we made a few improvements to the
molecular views internally at Google we
create configurations to match device
specifications like RAM size screen
resolution screen density orientation
and so on we make modification to the
operating system it's easy because all
molecular images are routed by default
we overrode system properties like model
name so it reports Nexus 4 instead of
SDK so we get realistic user agent
strings we install some test friendly
services to dismiss system dialogues
dismissed in ours and now all about this
it makes your test flaky and at Google
we have more more locking information we
don't stop at just having snippets from
locket I would say we pick up every last
drop of lopping information we can get
out of the emulator remember this scene
what a poor developer right see all
those cables and with our solution it
could look like this isn't this nice you
can launch any of those devices with any
available API level within seconds use
it from eclipse or any IDE you prefer
there is really no need for real devices
oh yeah it's slow right I remember when
I first tried honeycomb I was
downloading the images installed
emulator and it was in the boot screen
I killed the process because I thought
hey it's broken I download it again
started same situation right grab a
coffee come back to my desk and the
login screen was there but it was really
not usable
so what should you do give up
should I get home no hey we're in genius
right we never accept the status quo
so let's investigate why this slow first
off as you know it is a real device so
it has to boot this is the Android boot
sequence quite long right but if you
take a closer look it is similar to
desktop operating system boot sequences
and on the desktop we have a solution to
fix it it's called hibernation and you
know what the Android emulator has the
same feature it's just a different name
they call it snapshot so let's take a
snapshot here and save some boot time
but it is not only the boot time right
after I got my coffee going back to my
desk it was not usable I try to log in
sliding does not work clicking all this
really slow and here we have a real
phone and we have an emulator quite
simple right and rich running on phone
hardware and Android running on an
emulator on your host order so where is
the bottleneck right look somebody throw
this nice yellow rectangles there right
so it is the code execution on the
emulated CPU typically this is way way
slower than running native code what
about if you just remove this part
running directly on our host CPU what we
need is just two things right typically
our host hardware is x86 so we need
Android system for x86 and we need a
feature called VM acceleration and both
of them are available with the current
SDK so just go home download the current
SDK use x86 use we arm acceleration when
you get a really really lightning fast
emulator so now we have a place where we
can run reliable and fast our tests what
I'm going to show you now is a demo
where we run a UI test suit on a nexus 4
and on an emulator what do you think
could you buy disgusted
the Nexus 4 did it I guess we need
faster devices right okay seems to be
done right we have a place where we can
run reliable our tests is fast it is
cheap it scales and for our developers
you know any device with any API level
it's just a fingertip away so it was a
lot of work and I would say let's go
home let's have a beer so yeah I mean I
really like beer but so we have a place
to run tests let's see our developers
have really cool devices at their
fingertips are we missing anything oh
yeah that part don't be that guy be this
guy instead okay Jackie Chan really wise
man but let's analyze the situation I
mean why is it so hard to write tests
for Android you know every time I go to
a developer and I say write test for
Android they there's this huge
resistance and you know let's take a
step back and think in the web
development world where everything has
long been figured out right you're told
you read books like X unit test patterns
and they say stay away from UI testing
it's slow its flaky and the way you've
sort of bypassed that issue is that you
separate your business logic from your
presentation logic from your UI logic
and you can use that one of the very
popular patterns and VC MVP so in this
in these patterns the business logic
lives in your controller or your
presenter the view logic is trivial and
everything is great you just write lots
of unit tests for your controller
presenter and you are very happy and
then you start you know you move to
Android you follow the Android
development guide you write your first
hello world activity and everything is
awesome you're running on emulators and
then you think okay I'm good now right I
need to start writing some
I mean actually you should have been
writing toughs first but you know most
of us don't do that
and then you think well what is an
Android activity is it a view or is it a
presenter and the answer is yes it's
both and unfortunately the Android
architecture couples business logic and
UI logic together packages
really nicely for you and this activity
you know there's this great context
object being passed around and so here
as a developer you have a choice either
you're going to write lots of
boilerplate and you are going to
artificially go against the grain of
what the development guide is telling
you and you can separate your UI logic
from your business logic or you arrive
at a place where you actually need to do
some UI manipulation to actually get at
some of the complicated pieces of your
code and thankfully the Android arc at
the Android SDK provides you awesome
tools for that and if you've written
test for Android I'm sure you're aware
of what Android instrumentation is and
under intern patient's awesome okay it's
this layer that sits in the US and gives
you hook it's inside your application
and you can do amazing things like you
can inject motion events whatever those
are you can click on particular
coordinates on the screen you can type
text you can inspect the state of your
application and do amazing things but if
you don't know how to play this
instrument correctly and then you're
gonna sound really bad and your
neighbors are just gonna hate you and
there have been some attempts to solve
this problem right and there are
actually very popular frameworks out
there that are built on top of
instrumentation that make it more user
friendly for example the one that I have
experience with is rhuebottom and when I
got to Google actually I was working on
the Google Wallet team and you know we
explored our options and we went through
the bottom we even went a step further
and we made it much more user-friendly
for specifically to write tests for
Google Wallet
so really developers had no excuse and
to my surprise they adopted our
framework and they wrote hundreds and
hundreds of tests UI tests
and it was amazing I was really happy
and then we submitted those steps to
continuous test execution and we got
this yeah and there were not a lot of
presence there and it's just really
unfortunate right because something that
should have been a great tool to do
test-driven development and a great
quality signal and you know you're
catching your bugs at the time when
you're actually developing it turns into
this nightmare it turns into a huge
maintenance burden you have these build
cop rotations and you know people are
just you know just chugging along and
you know eventually they say you know
what
as a developer I get paid to write
features right I don't get paid to write
tests I don't have time for this and we
give up and we go to the beach but you
know does it have to be this way
everyone just assumes that UI is you
know the UI testing is flaky but why is
it well as Tom mentioned earlier in
their presentation you know one of the
main classes of bugs is concerned
concurrency and in the UI you know this
is also the case if you know whatever
you see as a user those are events that
get processed on the UI thread and your
tests actually your instrumentation test
runs on another thread and so even
though you a developer as a developer
are thinking procedurally you know I'm
just going to do a click and then I'm
gonna wait for something to happen on
the screen and then I'll assert that you
know that side effect has occurred what
that actually gets translated to in the
system is the click actually generates a
motion down animotion up event and that
gets in queued in the UI queue and
likely there's actually work happening
already there right I mean especially if
you've been doing testing previously and
so you get a failure and so the solution
to all our problems right well yeah
that's that's an easy one
hey it's gonna work right but remember
we're running in data centers right I
mean it may work locally like even 99%
of the time
but in a datacenter you don't have these
guarantees I mean your job may get
paused then you may get resumed later on
and you know what we're back to square
one it just doesn't work so earlier this
year we got together with the team and
we thought you know what if we wrote a
framework that handles all of this these
issues can be handled okay they're there
you know they're a little bit difficult
they require a deep understanding of
Android and concurrency but it can be
done with lots of boilerplate you know
what if we wrote a solution that
actually took care of that and you know
made you just think procedurally like
defining your actions finding that UI
element that you want to interact with
and then doing some assertions and so we
went ahead and we made it possible and
so we called this espresso after having
lots of beer so Ari I think it's
actually possible to have beer and
coffee at the same time and I'm going to
stop right there because actually later
today there's I'm giving a lightning
talk on this exact topic so if you're
interested in it please come and check
it out so with espresso I think we have
the final piece of the puzzle okay we
have a place to run our tests lots and
lots of tests actually we don't have to
be enslaved by physical devices we don't
have to chase you know our co-workers
you know to grab that last Nexus 10 and
testing even UI testing can be fun and
easy but as a wise man once said one
cannot be told how to break the manual
testing matrix you have to see it for
yourself Trinity please roll the video
great thank you well I was fantastic I'm
sure all of you took a lot away from
that I took two things away one I think
I want a Hello Kitty phone and two
gluing your phones to the wall as
perilous at best so I'm sure most of you
got much more than that out of it now it
was truly fantastic work so what I'd
like to do is there's lots of great
questions up here on the moderator so I
will read them off also if you want to
ask questions in the aisles that will
also work and at some point I'll have an
Android up here that I can hand out so
first question up for you guys those
automated testing against a range of
devices give developers confidence to
release without further manual testing
if not what else is needed yeah so
that's a good question and it's actually
kind of very specific to the app you're
talking about and the team that's doing
the development because certainly if
your team is not writing tests first and
you know writing tests for each of those
features yeah you're not getting
coverage in you ought to do manual
testing so you're gonna have to track
that also believe we talked about this a
little bit during the presentation but
if your app is using features like you
know sensors and you know Bluetooth and
things that are very manufacturer
specific because they might choose
really cheap hardware you should be
writing very targeted tests to exercise
those pieces of code so they execute
very quickly but you should also have
subs for them so that you can test the
overall logic of your app on emulation
because our goal is right to make these
tests execute quickly and reliably
and have something that's good push it
on to a precious physical phone do
further testing and then give it to a
precious human being who can you know
finally validate it so and I actually
just wanted to add to that I think that
you know these precious human beings
don't have to be just manual testers
I mean some of the best testers out
there I find are for example VPS and
executives right because when they find
bugs they get fixed but but you know I
think that if you have really good
automation and you know I think that
yeah you can like push the apk onto you
know your own phone you can hand it out
to your team and you know that's sort of
alpha stage dogfooding and you know you
can go from there you know you're truly
mastered this whole bug finding thing
when you actually start leaving bugs for
the executives to find makes them feel
good you know yeah we just leave a few
out there yeah so uh live question I
think you're up first so who you are
where where you work if you want to and
your question please
does your matrix cover the entire whole
coverage of Android devices and how how
much percentage of results are reliable
and the follow-up question is does the
matrix cover the Kindle Fire because the
Kindle Fire is customized Android mm-hmm
okay so first off just some information
about our test flakiness like for
example in the slides or a video you saw
at the end that was a Google Shopper
which I thank them for volunteering
their tests but those tests run
continuously at every CL so there's lots
of seals a day that affect them they are
1 5 % flaky so that's a lot of Mines I'm
very happy with that so they are very
reliable now one thing that I really
want to highlight is the bugs you're
gonna find the majority of them are
going to be in your own code and they're
gonna reproduce you know on any device
it's important to catch those bugs early
and fix them quickly because you don't
have a lot of time and you're under a
lot of pressure so when those tests go
green and you need to support some crazy
person that decided they were gonna fork
Android like I don't know
like Zhaan you can target your test for
that specifically and know that you're
not gonna find something stupid like Oh
a nullpointerexception happens when I'm
not logged into the app there's no
reason to find that out with a human
being so I'm gonna summarize this next
question maybe just a fun you want to
take this it says what about bugs that
are device specific you know we've run
into issues where the automation works
we put on a physical device that doesn't
work so first off what we our
experiences it's more the combination of
a screen resolution RAM size an API
level so this gives you their testing
metrics right and with automation
running in the cloud it's really easy
you can execute in parallel as we have
seen on all those devices at the end of
the day I would say be catching 99% of
all bugs with our solution and there
could be that you know some vendors have
a special UI
modification etc and we cannot catch
them in an emulator because we are
running on Google experienced Android
and I think you know we want to we kind
of want it to be a little provocative
here and get the thinking going because
I think the most of the thinking so far
has been on the device specific side
we're not saying that there is no place
for device testing at all right we are
there is there is still a place for it
but you know you need to do it when you
have done everything else you know start
easy start with the easy stuff first and
I would also like to point out one thing
the version specific issues for some
reason developers are well paid mostly
and they might only have the latest
phones at certain companies and maybe
like only the release engineers aren't
paid enough and they have the old
gingerbread phone somewhere we pay our
artis good so I think we hire for that
too in case you're interested
but with automation we're able to run on
Gingerbread in the cloud we get a
results right away for every API level
so we don't wait till the last minute to
find those problems great question I
think you're up next
sure I'm still Alec Munroe Stefan you
showed a screen that had all of the
different devices or several of them is
that an actual tool that
you guys have and maybe we'll release
that will like you know if I want to run
I can say run this test on all these
devices and actually get a view like
that so what I showed in my presentation
I mentioned we have configurations to
match device pacification so in our
environment we have a command line
script and I just type in launched a
nexus 4 API 16 boom and this since here
Google yes you do have access to that
tool and you can use it today like a
visualization tool that actually looks
like what you show oh I shared it
internally and the Google+ if you want
it on your desktop you know I it looks
really cool yeah I yeah it's there the
other way work on the eye candy but
actually you know I I spent about half
an hour
you know lining up all these emulators
on my desktop so so in other words for
those of you that can't get it well that
sucks yeah sorry guys
what you can do is you can start
requesting it in the you know the stream
like crazy and maybe they'll pick it up
really you know yeah so we probably have
time for about one and a half more
questions so please go ahead hi I'm
Steve I'm an S et at Google I mostly
have experience with browser automation
not Android anime automation so can you
explain what you mean by API level yeah
so every device well the latest devices
are running Gingerbread
it's the OS level maybe there's more
common and the API is available to
developers have increased pretty much
with each new version so you have Eclair
Froyo gingerbread honeycomb ICS jelly
bean and each one adds a little more
features they might tweak the semantics
of an API and you can get bugs that
reproduce on Gingerbread but not on ICS
and even vice versa so it's easy because
you know they call it Ice Cream Sandwich
Ice Cream Sandwich master released one
jelly bean jelly bean rest necessarily
spawn and so on but what they do what
they really do
good and they can count they say API
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and
then it's easy for us to reproduce right
if somebody call me I say bitch API
level right I can't remember and I can't
match those names I really you probably
can if there is a person who can it's
you we have time for a very quick
question so please hi i'm craig western
salesforce.com I'm the lead engineer
well we see a lot of times is automated
tests catch functional problems with the
program and that's fine but the devices
themselves carry a lot of state and so
we find our users get into weird things
they don't upgrade for a while and then
something bad happens to the device and
user experience gets hurt even if you
were functionally correct and writing
your tests can snapshotting help that
you know when people are on a very old
version and upgrade there's some
metadata there some session there's a
lot of weird things that happen in the
real world that ultimately I think we're
all in this business to help users have
a good experience we're supposed to
catch it first so how do you address
that
so snapshotting is actually an emulator
specific feature it's a dump of RAM CPU
and hardware registers so it's a little
more low level than your upgrade
problems and that actually backwards
compatibility is in difficult issue it's
something that we could like reproduce
on an emulator with an old apk and a new
apk it takes a lot of effort to get
there and what I would suggest first is
to get better coverage around your app
before you start tackling these
scenarios but it definitely is a
difficult area to work in yeah and with
that thank you guys it was fantastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
