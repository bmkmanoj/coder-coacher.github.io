it's wrong clip from has two masters
degrees one in mechanical engineering
from the Nicole central de Lyon and
France and another in aerospace
engineering
University of Michigan
that Google since July makes your old
timer on us and you said it's a lot of
experience relevant and otherwise work
about dead edge is a nuclear engineering
is a great enthusiast of astronomy and
there's a lot of optical spectroscopy
background there
to talk today about ray tracing problem
thank you dick so today I'm gonna talk
very very briefly on its kind of quite
quite as simplistic approach of lenses
in mirror in order to be capable of
doing a geometrical ray tracing by by
hand so I'm going to talk first of all
about the notion of real and virtual
object as well as real and virtual
images and we'll need to do a couple of
assumptions to in order to do
geometrical ray tracing and it is called
stigmatism then we'll go through a
couple of example of for a tracing of
four lenses and mirrors and at the very
end I'll go very quickly on the case of
thick lenses because in the previous
case we'll talk mainly about the case of
thin lenses so talking about the notion
of principle planes point as well as
nodal points and if we have time which
is something that I've doubt i will talk
about common since optical systems such
as the eye or refraction and reflective
telescopes so the goal today is is quite
simple it's given a set of lenses and
mirror to be able to trace the minimum
amount of rays so that we can from an
object locate the position of the image
and therefore compute the equivalent
focal length of the system or the
equivalent magnification of the system
so we won't go in too many details
looking at what's happening at each dr.
level of the lens or of the lenses or of
the mirrors we will simplify all this so
the principle of mirrors and lenses is
really simple it's
the principle of reflection and
refraction reflection occurs for when
we're using mirrors and refraction
occurs when we're using lenses actually
we have two successive refractions so
let's take a first media with a
refractive index on and one and the
second media with another refractive
index seven and two if we're looking at
an object a in the media and two it
seems that the object is located in a
prime but if we're again on the other
side of this and to medium which could
be a window for instance this object
seems to appear from another position
which which is a second so as we'll see
later actually a prime in a second are
what we call images but they're they're
not they're not located at the same at
the same position I mean a and a prime
are not coincident which is not a
stigmatic system so the lens works about
the same is it's about the same arm I'm
sorry the lens worked about the same the
only difference is one of the two dr. if
not the two are actually curved which
will tend to deviate a little more the
Rays so if we look at the cross section
of a lance it looks like very much as if
we have two prisons whether these two
prisms being centered around the optical
axis and so array will coming from an
object will be deviated or refracted on
the first opera which is the first
surface of the lens
and then again will be refracted on the
second surface of the lens and if if
we're lucky this to raise will intersect
where and we will be able to see an
image i won't go in too many details but
the analogy with prism is quite accurate
to when we're using lenses because one
of we know that prisons are so used
sometimes to scatter the light and to
analyze the light and this is actually
also what's happening with real lenses
and that's the reason why we have a
Beretta chromatic aberrations so I think
most most of us know that there is
mainly to type of lenses concave lenses
and convex lenses convex lenses has the
trend to make the incoming beam of light
more converging whereas it's the
opposite for concave lenses and usually
we can if it's not necessarily true um
usually lens with thin n jizz edges will
have a convex behavior whereas lenses
with thick edges will have a much more a
concave behavior oh but again we will
not study at each dr. level what's
happening we could be an aspherical
reference and looking at what's
happening for all the race for each
doctor but we will simplify all this so
first first notion of real and virtual
object real and virtual image if I look
at this first first of them example at
the bottom I'm sorry at the upper left
so considering a an object a real object
so per se a bulb with a usually a mask
with for instance a letter in it so that
I have light emerging from from this
object
if I put a lens so in this case that we
will consider it as a convex lens if I
put a screen at a given distance on the
other side of the lens at the
intersection of all my race I should be
able to see the object so in this case
we're talking about the real object this
is this is a about my mean this is
really something that i put for real on
one side of the lens and i have also
real image because i'm able to see it on
the screen now if we look at a case of a
concave lens so same configuration i am
putting precisely the same object at a
given distance and as previously at the
given distance of the concave lens if i
put a screen or for a CCD on the other
side of this concave lens ah so i'm
unable to see a picture and actually all
this emerging beam of light seems to
come from a point which is on the same
side of my object so on the left side of
the lens in this case so this point is
called the image but because it doesn't
have any physical existence we'll call
it a virtual image so we've just sin but
again we will do a lot of different
different example just just to highlight
all the different configurations so
we've just sin in this case that from a
real object I've been able to show or to
see a real image I haven't been able to
see for real a virtual image but I've
been able to produce a virtual image and
strange as it may seem the thing is we
can also have virtual object which are
going to be able to create real images
as well as virtual images so i
understand it can be quite confusing at
that point but we'll go in a lot more d
Jensen will built all this different
configuration later so the same thing is
occurring for four mirrors if I take a
case of a concave mirror so with an
eight with an image of a be armed so
first ray will be reflected on my
surface and then converse this two-way
will converge to a point B prime which
will be my image so I'm on I mean all my
raise our remaining on the same side of
them of the mirror for for real so I
know that if I put a screen or CCD at my
point at my point B prime I will be able
to see my object a be in the case of a
convex mirror so using again an object a
be my reflected beam of light will be
scattered as shown here because I have a
convex surface so but so all this
emerging or reflected beam of light
seems again as as for the case of the
convex comes our yes come concave lens
seems to come from a point B prime which
is in this case located on the other
side of my convex mirror so in this case
be prom is also the image that it's
called a virtual image so we've seen in
this to example for concave and convex
mirror that we in this both case we have
a real object but we are able to find a
real image in the case in the first case
in case of convex mirror and a virtual
image in the case of the convex mirror
and again strange as it may seem we can
also have a virtual object which will
which could create a virtual image that
is a real image
so stigmatism so it's basically the
conditions the assumption we need to
take into account if we want to be able
to do geometric rate racing or it's
under the assumption for which geometric
ray tracing are relatively correct so
regardless and non regard stigmatism um
so system is known or cold stigmatic
when for a couple of porn a in a prime
if all the way raised passing through
the point a go through the point a-prime
so it's the case for a plane mirror as
we can see on the right so in this case
so a prime is the image but again it's
on the other side of the of the mirror I
cannot sit so in this case a is a real
object that a problem would be a virtual
image if I take another example very
very simple just a media and one and
then a doctor with a another refractive
index of n2 if I take an object and if I
just trace 33 rays which are going to be
are refracted on the doctor I'm enable
in the medium and two to find the object
so let's trace the race backward but
then I have a couple of problems what is
my image is it a prime a second a third
and I cannot define I do not have a
point where all my through all this
three rays will intersect so in this
case this system is not stigmatic so the
big problem is that for spherical lenses
spherical mirrors which are quite common
optical component it
they're not stigmatic by nature so as we
can see on the on the sketch at the top
right if I'm taking up so this is a cone
cave mirror if I if I take a point B and
if i trace a couple of rays emerging
from this point B my the intersection of
all my arrays are generating as line and
into DS or a surface in 3d but it's not
a point so it is not stigmatic actually
there's two point where it works for
four mirrors it's the center of
curvature see of the mirror or the
summit of the mirror but it's not very
very convenient to if we are only
restricted to use these two points so
under the ghost assumptions that I will
show you on the next slide we can
consider that spherical lenses or
spherical mirrors our nail estic matic
or quite okay but this is related to the
let's say either the quality of the
image that you want or the resolution of
your sensor so it could be the size of
your CCD for instance so under this
assumption the goose assumption it's
quite okay so basically a point a for
instance located on the optical axis if
i trace a couple of point a couple of
rays emerging from this this point a
they will all converge at the same point
a-prime so the guns assumption for
senate system and we will only you
remain study centered system here I mean
no rectangle lenses or rectangle mirrors
the first assumption we need to consider
is that the incident beam of light is
centered around the optical axis or in
the optical component but also that it
is not too large in other way that we
don't have raised close to the edges of
the lenses and if it's not the case well
just just use a diaphragm just just to
pupil
so in the second second assumption is
that we consider that the incident beam
of light is is pretty small so 10 15
plus or minus 15 degrees again it
depends on the quality of the of the
picture that you that you want so the
consequences are that under this to
assumption our system can be considered
as relatively stigmatic um but again
it's related to this sense of spatial
resolution and the second thing is that
the lenses and will simplify again these
two thin lenses they have approximately
quite a symmetrical behavior in other
word if I have an object and if I take a
lens with the ones the first surface is
flat and the second one is convex if I'm
looking at the distance between my image
and my lands and if I flip my lens this
distance will remain the same and well
it's it makes life easier let's say or
at least we can we can do ray tracing by
hand just with a sheet of paper so yeah
before during retracing just a couple of
convention so we'll use in this case
oriented distances this is this is not
something I've ever found in any
American or British book so it's it's
like a vector but let's say that just
from a mathematical point of view you
can divide
an oriented distance or you can invert
too darn or into distance so it's the
advantage of this is that the you don't
need to pay attention or to know where
your image is or object is relatively to
the lenses it is so it fits a distance
is it positive on the left side or the
right center lens no you're just doing
all the computation and the position
will appear very very easily so again a
couple of definitions so if ever I
forgot in all my drawings to mention the
direction of light it's always coming
from the left to the right and so we
have a couple of points to let's say
specify that the different mirrors or
lenses the first one is see the center
of curvature of the mirror so uh upon on
the surface of the mirror is at a
distance R are being the radius of
curvature of the mirror and so see the
center Oh in the case of lenses is the
center of the lens so basically any
incident theme coming or going through
this point is not deviated by the lens s
is the summit of the mirror so this is
the intersection of the optical axis
with the center of the mirror f is cold
so there's a couple of different name so
what an object foyer it's also called
the first focal plane or object focal
plane so this point is didn't mind so
that any incident beam going through
this point will emerge on the other side
of the Lance parallel to the axis out to
the optical axis
and the prior and the second point so
second focal point or image foyer or
image focal point is that in mind so
that any point paul l to the incident
beam parlo to the optical axis will go
through this point so in any example a B
will represent the object a being
located on the optical axis and a prime
B prime will be the image will talk also
about the magnification of the system
which is just a ratio of the image over
the object and under so under the ghost
assumption what's happening is that
actually the distance the focus lenses
are symmetrical so the distance Oh F
prime is equal to all F and therefore to
the focal length of the lens and the
image a focal point as well as object
focal point for the mirrors are located
in at the same same place at their
coincident and last but not least four
mirrors for spherical mirrors the image
focal point is precisely at the help of
them is located precisely a half of the
radius of curvature of the mirror ok at
last let's do the first first example
arm so here we have a convex mirror with
an object a be so sine of curvature see
image focal point F Prime and the summit
of the mirror and a concave mirror is
known to have or what we call a real
fire or real image a focal point so in
order to find the image there is for
Ray's we can trace the first one is that
array going through the centre of
curvature so C is not deviated by the
system so this is what's happening so in
other word we have a first n
incoming beam which going in this
direction it's going to be reflected in
this direction but it's going to keep
keep going in this direction remote
maybe continue on this side the second
rate array going through the summit as
prime of the mirrors reflected
symmetrically to the optical axis so
symmetrically to the optical axis so
this is the first one the second one the
third one is an incident ray parlour to
the optical axis goes through the image
foyer or image focal plane which is f
prime so here we are then the fourth ray
is so the rate which is going to the
object foyer which is also the image for
so f prime will be reflected and will be
parallel to the optical axis like that
so where's the image oops yep that's
right so in this case if I I have a real
object and I have also real image
because if I put a screen I'll be able
to see a bi mean my rays are converging
on the same side of my of my mirrors
here's the equation so either way I mean
one over C a bar or one over is a bar
it's the same it's precisely the same
equation depends on the reference that
you won't either the curvature a set of
curvature of the mirror all the summit
of the mirror in this case gamma is
negative because the image is upside
down compared to the the object but the
absolute value of gamma is negative
because the the size of the image is
smaller than the object and yeah so the
expression of a mirror for I'm sorry for
yes former for my magnification is so
many say say
a prime bar / SI and you will see that
this equation are are the same precisely
the same for convex mirror as well and
you don't need to take care about the
sign of the focal length oh yeah very
important detail two out of the four
rays were sufficient so let's do now the
convex mirror so now i have a convex
mirror so the curvature among the center
of curvature of my memories on the other
side of my mirror and it is known as a
coal as a virtual voice so same
configuration I have an object a B and I
want to find the position of the image
so first rate the first ray going
through the center of curvature see is
not deviated so I'm going through the
mirror where the center of curvature is
C so it's on the other side of the
mirror so let's not joy as a plane ray
that same thing what's happening is the
light is going this way is reflected
this way and we'll keep going this way
so I don't have light on the other side
of the mirror hopefully i mean it's it's
not for ya so second-rate going through
s is symmetrical to s prime but it
doesn't seem that i will be able to see
an intersection of this to race so let's
just plot this this ray for instance so
i have a first intersection but just to
be sure let's keep going and do the
third one parallel to the optical axis
will go through the image focal point
that the image focal point for in case
of the mirror is the same as a name as
the object for Coke appointment so this
is f prime so I'm going through F prime
but this is on the other side of mirror
so let's draw it this way so where's the
real
I mean for real where does the this
green ray goes it goes this way so again
now have a intersection but let's keep
going and trace the 4th rate just to be
sure an incident right going through the
object foyer so f prime so I'm going
through f prime right here goes power to
the optical axis so it's reflected this
way for real but if I keep tracing this
ray what's happening is oh I do have
this intersection so in this mess
where's my image right here right here
so precisely the same expression as for
the concave mirror in this case gamma is
positive because the image is in the
same I mean it's not inverted gamma is
negative because apparently my image is
smaller than the size of my image is
smaller than my object but so in this
case I have a real object in a virtual
image because my images on the other
side of the mirror where I obviously
don't have any light at all and again
two out of the four rays were sufficient
yes
education
and the second case we also put an image
facing the mirror
and you sort of see
you see
most like there's an image back yes but
that there is there's you in this
configuration you will never be able to
see any image on your sensor you put the
sensor left side and
no because so I have my images is is on
is on this side of the mirror but I mean
this is a mirror so there's it's black
on the right side of my of my of my
mirror so if I'm looking on on this side
of the above the mirror I've just have
an emerging a beam beam of email fly but
I don't have a point where own my rays
will converge it's only when all my rays
are converging to a point and if i put
my screen or my CC on this point that i
will be able to see no yes it will see
let's see search several example with
with an association of different
different component so convex lens so
it's a convex lens so we have enough JK
b so we have an image for complain focal
point f prime we have a knob ject focal
point f and a setter and a set of my
lance and in this case we have four mins
or three raise that we can trace so the
first one is the reg going through the
optical center is not deviated so it's 0
it's not deviated the second one is an
incident rail parallel to the optical
axis like this will go through the image
for you so we'll go through f prime so
we have a first intersection but let's
do the third one to be sure an incident
ray going through the object fire so f
goes prologue to the optical axis right
here so where's my image here so in this
case I do have an intersection of my
beam and it's it's not a mirror anymore
Attila it's a lens so if I put a screen
at my location a the location of a prime
V prime I will be able to see an image
and it up with it will be a real image
so you have the equation of four lenses
so at the main difference with marriages
you have a menace here the reference
being the center of curvature I'm sorry
they the optical center of the lens and
in the case of a convex lens so the
focal length is is positive again or so
gamma is negative the image is upside
down and it seems that the image is a
little bit smaller than the objects of
gamma the absolute value of gamma is
inferior to one and two out of the three
rails were sufficient in the case of a
concave lens same thing three raise the
same raise and the only difference is
now that the image focal plane is on the
I'm sorry okay okay so gamma is the
ratio of the image size over yes so yes
it's it so there's two information in
game Oh what did I say yeah no no it's
correct there's two information in gamma
there's the sign of gamma and there's
the absolute value of gamma so the
absolute value of gamma is imported to
one because the in this the size the
hate of the image a prime B prime is
smaller than the object a be that this
this hate a prime B prime is smaller
than a be
yes yes yeah okay yes it is this is just
in this case yeah I'm sorry no no no no
no no no no no yes yes the in you know
in I'm sorry jason has me less of one
thing
um I'm honestly not sure I'd rather
trace the trace their ages just to just
to be sure yes in the most important
oops yeah I mean I don't want to confuse
you but this is not always true this is
just the explanation of this particular
case the best in order to know the
position of the image in order to know
the magnification of the system the only
thing you need to know are for in case
of the lens is the formula of a lens
this being determined by either if it's
a convex or concave lens and then it's
the expression of gamma which is the
ratio of the image over the object so
let's it always start from the
definition do the math and realize if
it's bigger main positive negative
bigger than one smaller than one if I've
just added this it's just to show in
this particular case what's happening
but it's always start from from the
definition of magnification and and for
the formula to get so compute the
position of the image so in the case of
a concave Lance as opposed to to the
convex lens then now what what's
happening is the image focal plane is on
the left side of the lens whereas the
object focal point ism is on the right
side so same three raised first-rate
going through oh not deviated parallel
to the optical axis go through the image
focal plane so the image focal plane on
this side is on the left side so the
real race is doing this third ray an
incident ray going through the object
fire or object focal
prologue to the optical axis so here we
are so it where's my image in the in
this case right here so again I won't be
able to see the image for real so this
is a real object but this is a virtual
image and same expression for as for the
convex lens the only thing right here is
that F prime is negative but again if
you're just using this expression Oh F
prime it will always be true it can be a
convex or concave lens it's just better
reason why I'm using an oriented
distance and so just in this particular
case gamma is positive and but the
absolute value is inferred 21 and again
two out of the three or sufficient so
now i think it's it's sufficient you
know that for will is need to raise four
mirrors or four lenses no no more so I
took another example here's same thing
to go a little further into real and
virtual object real and virtual images 0
so I have a convex lens so because I
problem is is on the right side and an
object a B but now my object is between
my object of focal point F and my
optical center oh so if i if i trace the
first ray going through through the
setter is not deviated if i trace the
secondary power to the optical axis
going through f prime well before when i
was using a comment convex lens starting
from a real object it was able to have a
real object a real image but I don't
have an intersection on the on the right
side of my lens so let's go a little bit
let's draw the third one just just to be
sure so going through f is
will emerge prolong to the optical axis
and the same thing there's just no no
way I'm going to have an intersection of
my three arrays on the on the right side
of my lens so let's go backward now so
this is the case of the convex lens
where I have a real object that my image
is now not only on the same size of my
object but behind my object so this is
really really confusing that this is a
real object and this is a virtual image
and this is a convex lens so just to
highlight the fact that a real object I
may not have a real image because I have
a real convo because i have a convex
lens or something like that is really
not the way to think about that for
mirrors as well as for lenses it really
the fact that your object or your image
will be real or virtual virtual only
depends on the position of these two
related to the image for complain or N
or the object for smoke oakley a focal
plane or focal point or the image book
called plane or focal point so there's
no rule of rules of thumb just use the
three rays and and or just do the mess
the math and you'll see with what's
happening that you would do a pretty big
mistake by is considering that from a
convex lens if you take a real object
you will always have a real image so
let's do an association of a couple of
lenses so in this system I have a first
convex lens and I have it second lens
which is concave so as you can see f 2
prime is is on the left side of my
concave lens because it's gone cave and
I have a distance D between my two are
two lenses and of course enough JK be so
I will only trace to Ray's relents in
this case because we know that the third
is
dungeon so the first one going through
or one is not deviated parallel to the
optical axis will go to f1 prime so
where's my image right here so this is
the image of a B through a so but now
but now a prime B prime which is the
image of violence and no my convex lens
number one is the image mm sorry is the
object for the lens number two for my
concave lens so let's consider it now
that a prime B prime is the object for
the lens number two and trace the to
raise so the race b prime going through
the center of curvature I'm sorry this
the son of glance 02 is not deviated and
the second one product or the optical
axis go through the image will complain
so like this so where's my imagine this
case here a prime prime B prime prime so
I started with a real object which
produced a real image for my lens number
one which was also a real object for my
lens number two but my lens number two
produced a virtual image a prime prime V
prime prime which is on the same same
side of of my concave lens and st.
same size as the as the object aim from
V Prime so if i do the math i will apply
the formula for my first lens and my
second lens so for my first land the
center is a one for my second lens this
Saturday's 02 the only difference for my
second lens is now that my object is a
prime and my image is a prime prime so
let's say that I want to know where a
prime prime V prime prime is
located on the optical axis so that I
want to know the distance Oh to a prime
prime so I can extract when I can
express the distance Oh to a prime prime
as a function is 0 1 a prime and by
shaking the equation here's the what I
like what I can come up so this is of
just copy the previous previous equation
so let's play a little bit with this so
first thing is what would be the
equivalent focal length of this system
and I'll have a certain degrees of
freedom here I can let's say that I want
to determine my focal lens as the
starting from the form of the point 0 2
so starting from the back of my of my
association of lenses so from the
starting from my last let concave lens
02 so the definition of the focal lens
is if I put if I put an object at
infinity the image of this object will
be located in a plane and the
intersection of this man with the
optical axis is difficult point so let's
put the image at infinity so 0 1 a 0 1 a
bar is that Menace infinity in the far
left of of the system so I come up with
this this expression where so 0 to a
prime prime bar which is what I what
I've defined as my equivalent focal
length depends hopefully upon the focal
length of my two optical component as
well as the distance Oh two or one bar
between mighty optical components so
let's keep going and play a little bit
with this like this expression what's
happening is now 0 2 0 1 bar is equal to
0 so I remember you that we're used
very very thin lenses so we just put
this two lenses very very close together
we nearly merge them well they expect it
turns that that the so 1 over the focal
lens which is called the Virgin's so the
equivalent virgins of the system is
equal to the sum of the Virgin's of the
the all the focal length and are you can
generalize this the only restriction is
that again we're using very very thin
lenses so and for real I mean each
lenses of it has a certain thickness but
you can do a couple of experiment where
it works pretty well if you put all the
lenses together the equivalent focal
lens is is is the sum of the virgin so
the sum of 1 over the focal length of
all day of all the lenses now let's go
back a little bit and let's assume that
the distance Oh 2012 distance between my
two lenses is equal to minus f1 prime F
2 prime so in this case the mass tells
us that the equivalent focal length is
equal to infinity so what's happening
let's let's draw what's happening for
real so as you can see I've in all the
computation so far I've never assumed
the sign of f1 form of age f 2 prime so
that's which allows you to be to be
extremely flexible let's say to put
particle case at the very very end of
your computations so in this case I
assume that F 1 bar well well let's say
that in order to have this infinite
focal length you need to have F 1 bar
sorry F 1 Prime and F 2 prime to be
positive so in other word that your two
lenses are convex so in in in this
configuration what you have what's
happening is
the image focal point of your first lens
so f 1 prime is precisely located at the
object focal point of your second convex
lens so if I draw the first ray the Ray
parallel to the optical axis go through
the image vocal play a point f 1 prime
so I'm going through the image focal
point what's happening for my second
lens is given i'm going through my
object focal point we know that the
emerging beam of light will be parallel
to the optical axis so this system
produced from a parallel beam of light
Apollo beam of light and this is let's
call an o focal system which is which is
quite convenient or let's say this is
the type of system we this is this is a
type of system for instant or the
configuration we want when we're using a
telescope for instance because we have
nearly an incident in parallel leave a
flight from a star and and it's a lot
more comfortable for a human being to
look at when in order to not to tire the
the eyes to have an emerging parallel
beam beam of light so um if yes this so
that's the reason well so we're adding
some optical component at the very back
of the telescope to be a lot more
comfortable for for the eyes and yeah
notion of equivalent focal length that
you use in the
of the three cases seems logically
different from the other two in the
sense that the equivalent focal length
if you if you just measure the distance
from the last optical element the
distance 028 prime crime is that
necessarily correspondent to the
divergence of the beams coming out of
the system seems like only an accident
yes yes he gave me a Europe you're right
the thing is you need you need to take a
convention in the case where you're
assessing associating lenses do to you
need to say ok I will reference this
distance as so this point as the
reference to perform for my football
system of lettuce is a camera lens we
quite consciously
dissociation the equivalent focal length
from the distance from the last L yes
so yeah what's also very convenient is
in this case is so that the
magnification yeah the so the second
interest of this local system is that it
allows me to vary the diameter of my of
my beam and so the diameter of my Bemis
is proportional to the ratio of my 24
point yeah i'm going to track them
nearly I'm nearly done so this is just
another example now so convex lens and
concave lens but now what's happening is
that my image focal point of my concave
lens is before my image focal point of
my first lens and so if I draw the first
image which is right here so this image
m prime V prime of a B through the lens
number one is now the object for my lens
number two object which is already on
the other side of the lens so quite
confusing again but let's draw the image
sao paulo going through 02 is not
deviated yeah so yep this race should go
through B prime going through F 2 Prime
here's the image so it's just another
another example a lot more confusing
than anything that we've ever done
before but what's happening in this case
is I have a real object a be my first
lens create a real image a prime B prime
but this a prime B prime object only
image is now really virtual for violence
number two because I already have an
image on the other side of on this side
of the lens wearers the light is coming
from this from the left to the right and
building the thing it turns that that
the image am prime prime B prime prime
of this of this object of this virtual
object is also is also virtual
so from the lens number to a point of
view it's completely counterintuitive
because my object is on the right side
of the lens but my image is on the left
side of the lens whereas the light is
coming from the left to the right so
yeah so just if I go a little more into
details about lot real real lenses so
what's happening is so the focal lens it
depends upon the radius of curvature of
the first dr. the radius of courage of
the second doctor as well as also the
thickness of of the lens and if we
cancel to think lends the thin lenses we
can get rid of the thickness of the lens
and under the ghost assumption again
it's even simpler Rick use the nonce is
symmetrical so it's getting a little
much more complicated because the sign
of the radius of curvature not only
depend if it's a convex or concave
surface but also if the surface is the
first or I mean the first outer then the
light it will we'll see or the second
second second dieter so in the case of
the thick lenses it's a little much more
complicated because in real life we can
have access only to three distances the
first one is the thickness of the lenses
second one is the what we call the front
focal length so the distance from the
focal the object focal point to the
first surface of the lens and same thing
for the back focal length so the second
surface with the image focal point and
so the object focal point is defined as
usual as
if Oh when all the rays which are going
through this point will emerge Paulo to
the optical axis and the image focal
point is about the same but what we like
is to be able to nearly go back to what
we were using before we're balances are
quite symmetrical and that's the reason
why we're defining a front principle
plane and a back principle plane so that
the distance between F and my front
principle plane is equal to the distance
between my back principle plane and F
prime so I'm nail it back to the
configuration before with thick lens
thin lenses where my assistant was where
symmetrical the only thing now is I have
a certain distance between my principal
glennon back principle plane and there's
just an additional thing which is the
notion of nodal points so this points
are defined so that an incident beam of
light going through the the point n will
with with an angle theta will emerge on
the other side with the same angle as if
it was going through the point and Prime
and let's in the case where the medium
on the left is the same as the medium on
the right hopefully the the novel point
n is coincident with the front principle
plane as well as the second and prime
nodal point is considered with a pack
principle plane so yeah this is just my
conclusion just giving Monica's
assumptions it's you need to be under
the assumption you know to be relatively
correct there's three possible raise
four lenses for possible arrays for
mirrors but two are always sufficient to
find the position of the image and here
is all you need to know so forget about
the gamma positive gamma negative or
gamma absolute value supposed to 1 or
negative 2 1 go always back to this
equation and
and you in everything you do will be
well you will be correct so I guess s
plan I didn't have I don't have any time
to talk about any telescopes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
