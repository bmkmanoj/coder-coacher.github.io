the sense that when I step up the
workshop one question I I heard a lot
and that is why should Google why would
Google be interested in quantum biology
that is a valid question and I will just
answer it sort of very selfishly from my
own perspective you might have seen the
recent bloomberg businessweek article
that was a reporter concluded that the
largest artificial intelligence
operation in the country meaning the
most employees is probably here at
Google and I'm sings this may be true if
you look around we have a beautiful work
and translation and voice recognition to
image recognition because our core
business of pulling from ten thousands
of web pages is the most relevant ones
that people show to you is sometimes
just z1 cell phone then placing an ad
next to it that you might find useful
and and click on so all these operations
are because based on
artificial-intelligence methods in the
widest sense machine learning graphical
models and so on now if you do things
like this for example my field image
recognition then you realize that
underlying AI is a plethora of what
mathematicians would call formally
np-hard problems and then if you look
how we solve those I will draw the one
and only picture for this introduction
so
many of these problems and solving your
the eye problems amongst to finding
lowest spot of function now you just
look at Jessica physics
what would you reach it yeah but start
with the water somewhere that would go
down cause II probably would have not
yet sucka sun opening even after
servicing of simulated annealing give it
a little bit of noise that you pushes
forward then you slowly reduce the noise
temperature and then every not bored by
they found it however second different
data but otherwise but the recording sin
sorry so the second mechanism is
tunneling so you can cut right through
an energy barrier and you have no a
second way a second pathway to reach
this lowest point so the depth is
interesting and there's a resource that
we can use and the last heart today my
tartlet in the afternoon I will make
this notion more precise how you can
employ quantum annealing to solve hard
problems in AI better so this should
also take away with the first argument
you're often hear from very smart people
why the brain can or sorry before I say
this once you realize and in experiments
we have bounces that you can gain an
advantage solving such problems you
wonder if cause on the brain is pretty
good in doing things like face
recognition face detection recognizing
speech does the brain use similar tricks
at this point we don't know but at least
now there is a motivation because what
you often hear is the first argument
wise there shouldn't be quantum
computing in the brain is now the brain
doesn't have to factorize large numbers
it doesn't have to calculate as a
quark-gluon plasma we are not known to
be good at these things so there's
really no use for quantum computing in
the brain and actually was funny we had
once he has a guest Mariah
the Nobel Prize winner and he gave a
talk about creativity and he had this
very picture on the whiteboard and said
your creativity can really be modeled
mathematically as finding these loads
his lowest point then later in the
question and answer session somebody
asked him Marais what's your view on
recent developments in quantum computing
and he said huh just a few years ago
everybody was thinking quantum computers
would be great to have if all these
ideas what to do with them but they're
impossible to build and now the view has
changed to a quantum computer can
probably be built if we really don't
know what to do with them because
vectorizing numbers as a few other
prominent problems they're not all that
interesting unfortunately i was on the
video conference from the other side i
couldn't and the connection didn't work
I was waving hey hey marais you own what
you wanted to do build something more
creative that very task can be done
better possibly by quantum computing and
of course we have to be careful at this
point you may say but you have already
technical systems they do things like
face recognition pretty well why do you
want to move to do you need to move to a
quantum computer it's true we have made
nice progress but that isn't to say we
couldn't improve plus to train just to
give you an idea to train a phase
detector we keep 10,000 computer cause
busy for a week roughly as an order of
magnitude so that is a lot of jewels
that you burn there so there may be also
the hope to find some mechanisms to do
this in human brain does it essentially
on a spoon of sugar a day and that's
something eventually you start to
appreciate if you have hard time
building your next and next server
center so and one other things that you
probably don't have to be a prophet to
see this coming is that as we try to
build quantum computers we learn of more
and more ways and tricks how to keep the
Quentin resources intact so that the
environmental interaction will not
destroy what may be needed coherence
entanglement so as we learn more tricks
from topological quantum computing to
adiabatic quantum computing to error
correcting codes to or just rent the
other day into John Prescott he was
talking about new works are doing
connecting a qubit to an oscillator
which to be honest I didn't furlough
quite the details but the notion was to
make this cubed inherently more robust
against the noise and this is just one
other example of more and more tricks we
will find and as we will develop these
techniques we will develop a different
appreciation for oh maybe a system like
this may happen in the cell or we get
maquina I for biological systems to see
whether maybe similar mechanisms take
place there moreover we don't really
know what is the minimum set of quantum
resources we need to do a quantum
speed-up eric is sitting here is always
a proponent of the notion of dirty
Quentin computing a little bit of
entanglement here some coherent there it
doesn't necessarily have to be all
qubits involved coherent and entangled
all the time to still see some advantage
in systems like this and of course we
should not forget that even I'd say the
disappointing result were to be set an
engineered systems we just get a few
percent improvements in highly evolved
new equilibrium ecosystems evolution if
it's worth its salt would very much
bring out those few percent so if we
build a detector say a phase detector
our car detect and it's a few percent
better if you translate this in a
biological setting being a few percent
better in detecting predator or prey
this may be all it needs to for
evolution to reward such my
you know but so far as is just setting
the motivation is it really there and
say I think we have to turn our
attention to I think what is the poster
child of quantum biology at this moment
this is a work on photosynthesis and
there between correct angles greg shultz
many others amazing work has occurred to
show at cryogenic and later at room
temperature that where we are now fairly
sure and you guys will talk about this
in much higher precision is that Quentin
coherent phenomena are involved to bring
the high energy efficiency of
photosynthesis and of causes the
importance of establishing just one
system of course enormous because if for
one system in biology at normal room
temperatures we can show quantum
phenomena then it's of course not a
Libra phase to say okay if biology has
used it once and may have used it at
many other places mm and accordingly
right now we have people looking into
various direction so the avian compass
and magnetic reception is a good
candidate look at Orion also one of our
speakers today he pioneered see notions
that affection a sense will or may use
Quentin mechanisms into its advantage
Elizabeth will talk about or look at
quantum effects in DNA and long my sense
is there will be a floodgate if the
initial steps proved out to be correct
then there will be a floodgate of other
systems that we will study and including
interesting things like central nervous
drugs that has always been my suspicion
that some of these amazing effects
brought about by my certain and drugs
will need or to explain those you will
need to appeal to Quentin biological
effects to explain them better and
actually I'm delighted that Luca would
present a completely new material today
talking about Quentin pharmacology if I
may
memorize it this way so um maybe to do
one more jumpier and that is as soon as
you put the words and Quentin and
biology into one sentence then people
will say I you're talking about
microtubules and consciousness aren't
you so I guess we owe it to you are
sitting here and Penrose to have solar
market analysis and that's right words
they have brought this connections that
today when you say quantum biology most
people who are not really in the field
next thing they will think as
consciousness and then people look at
you I'm serious like as in the sense of
now you go on to some please now the
things the year I will have to say two
things x is this now that you us one
that I wanted to say at the very end but
one thing we will see today and that was
also the impetus for holding this
workshop we will not solve by things
easy consciousness question here today
but as saying the stewards general hunch
that microtubules are something special
in the sense of not just the scaffolding
for the cell but they're from a hard
core material science perspective they
have amazing properties is that we are
going to see today and Anya bond will
and present results there a couple of
Jack that a couple of giri who will talk
about the properties of microtubules I
think this general honge to take a
closer look at those amazing structures
will prove out pretty very much to be
have been the right hun chin in
retrospect but going back to the more
philosophical side I think as soon as we
start to talk about first person
attributes of experience such as
conscious awareness free will then of
course we are in danger of leaving what
is easily accessible to experimental
science so
basically we have to be careful there
but that doesn't mean that it should
let's spoil the fun I think quantum
mechanics has a lot to offer in terms of
constructs that can be introduced to the
philosophy of mind and as long as we are
sort of aware that we are now in the
area of consciousness sorry of
philosophy maybe religion it's saying
fair game to introduce models inside
language that deal with that are derived
from quantum mechanics or quantum
biology in particular let me just name
to the notion of free will as we well
know in classical mechanics there's no
room for this thing's can look from the
outside pretty indeterministic but
there's no everything to the end is
determined 20 mechanics at least offers
the possibility of genuine free will to
be there Brody sorry running many of you
may be familiar what's called see free
will serum by coffin and inspector
essentially stating that if in the
universe is just a small modicum of free
will then this propagates through out
and we will have to conclude that pretty
much any particle is free to choose the
outcome of measurement experiment and so
let me switch to the last area in this
room set its consciousness itself again
a nice example where you can take a
notion from quantum mechanics and apply
it for example if we if you generalize
what Penrose and Stuart are saying is
maybe consciousness is just how it feels
to select one component within the
wavefunction just one reality within the
multiverse strands so this is an
attractive notion again I'm pretty
pessimistic that we will be able to ever
show this for systems with which we
cannot communicate
that isn't to say that we could include
this into our vocabulary of the
philosophy of mind and just maybe
stating what i find currently the most
attractive ideas there they come from
the British philosopher Galen Strawson
who gave this spellbinding talk at
stewarts towards the science of
consciousness and conference where he
was simply stating a logically very
clean pass he was saying me as a student
of nature I have to accept that raw
experience is a material on which any
theory of nature is based and I happened
to know by first-hand experience that
this making those experiences comes with
conscious awareness so at least I know
it's true for me and so logically most
parsimonious view then would become that
any physical existence is endowed with
experiential qualities comes with
conscious awareness and this and she
cannot be disproven it might just be
wrong but it's nevertheless an
attractive picture because now if in
summary we put those things together
home and picture of the universe of
realities that mind reside from this
it's a following the fabric the physical
fabric of reality has mental properties
that we had previously only prescribed
to higher mammals so if you look at this
it's pretty intelligent it has the
ability on the potential for genuine
free will and it's may be equipped or
this at least no reason to deny it the
possibility of conscious awareness so
the fabric of reality itself in this
view would have to be regarded as a
substrate physical existence itself has
mental properties again we are here in
the realm of philosophy but I find this
a pretty attractive picture so to
conclude and sing quantum biology is a
worse while intellectual endeavor we're
from hardcore engineering can we get our
voice the
language translators to do better things
to a higher energy efficient system to
the design of new drugs to giving us a
richer vocabulary to build our
philosophy of mind I think there is a
rich plethora of things that quantum
biology has to offer and I think it's
currently one of the most attractive
areas of science we do this ok so I hope
you guys enjoy the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
