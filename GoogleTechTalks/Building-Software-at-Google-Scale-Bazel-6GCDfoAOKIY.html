joining us we're really excited to see
you here and yes as Chelsea said I I was
looking forward to getting all 500 or
600 that wanted to get in because part
of what really gets our so excited here
at Google and within the Basel team is
getting a bigger community involvement
this is an open-source product so we
would love for all of you to know what
it is try it use it learn and by the way
we have a table at the end there after
the talks should you have questions or
would you like to join our user group
that we can do more regular meetups
about specific questions on Basel feel
free to stop by that table so I'm Helen
Altschuler and I'm fairly new at Google
just joined five months ago and prior to
Google I was a CTO of a FinTech a
startup called pra kaew and also spent
most of my career at JPMorgan as a
software engineer and afterwards as an
executive director for the risk
technology and big data analytics teams
but today we'll talk about our
experience here for me what's what's
been really interesting and unique to
notice about Google during my first few
months was that there's a huge focus on
developer efficiency productivity and
Happiness and not the fake focus that
I've seen in in Prior places where it's
more about scorecards and metrics and
dates but more about tools and tools
built by engineers for engineers to make
them love what they do and more
efficient in the best type of
technologies that they're working at and
that's really what what makes makes this
company unique and today we want to talk
to you and share that experience that
the company has built over the past 10
years about making its build system
available for everyone so so why would
you care well first I will tell you a
little bit more about why we care and
that's because Google has obviously a
big scale to deal with so we've got two
billion lines of code across nine
million files we've got 25,000
Engineers that was at the end of at some
point at last year and now it's going a
lot more than that and something around
45,000 changes per day and about a third
of those changes are actually by
engineers and two-thirds are automated
changes by our automated packaging tools
but certainly from compare for
comparison we we looked at some of the
published data and ms windows overall is
about 50 million lines of code so we are
dealing with a tremendous scale and when
you have tremendous scale you need to
your systems to be efficient and fast so
for you why should you care about built
as a built system so you need one when
your team is more than two to three
software engineers and also when you use
one or more well really more than one
programming language because at that
scale is becoming more apparent that you
need some structure and some
effectiveness you can't just rely on
linking everything by itself and of
course Google has been doing this for 10
years and it helped us to grow and it's
scaled really well and now with the open
source development of basel which was
released last year you can all take
advantage of this and it is a tool
that's platform independent it works on
pram or on any cloud platform and it has
a lot more flexibility so for those of
you sorry should be before we get we get
to to talk about the build system I'd
like to learn a little bit more about
the audience so how many of you are
software engineers ok pretty big group
here product managers smaller
enterpreneurs startups
ok so so we're so we've got a pretty
pretty pretty good group here of people
that care about building and releasing
software and making changes and
developing products so but for those of
you who are not familiar with the build
system so build system is basically a
software that helps to build your
software it's a it's this more
structural tool that allows you to
translate between machine code and your
source code it also allows you to create
and understand the dependencies so you
don't have to manually inspect different
kinds
files and figure out what order your
different types of sources need to be
working in so they're multiple build
tools out there many of you may have
heard or used make maven there's there's
there's tools available for almost every
language your Gradle and but today we're
gonna talk about basil and what is basil
how it works it's real internals and
that's what Ulf is going to tell us
about Thanks I'm off first of all thanks
for coming here I'm the tech lead for
basil or one of the tech leads to be
correct
I've been with the team for seven half
years there is basically no one who has
been here for longer than me and I I do
a lot of technical stuff I am I'm an
engineer by heart I now also manage the
the Munich team the Munich part of the
team we're in two sides we're both in
New York and Yannick and so we're doing
a lot all right that was the wrong
direction
where are we okay all right so so what's
special about basil and why do we even
have our own boat system and how is
basil different alright let's let's look
again it's a challenge that we have you
know Google at some point in our history
we decided to keep all of the source
code in a single repository and I don't
want to talk about why we do that but
about what's involved with doing that
and so what does that actually look like
we have two million lines of two billion
lines of code now
if you think of Google you think of good
search maybe or of Gmail so maybe you
can think of some things that this that
these services do what does Google
search - what does Gmail anyone search
an email excellent
what else do these things do index yes
profile what all right ads show ads okay
all right so so Google Mail and the
Parsis email and and speaks SMTP and
sends email and handles email and your
Google search which quotes a lot of web
pages and has a huge search index and
then you have login and it turns out
Google search needs login as well right
Google search gives you a better
experience if you log in and can is able
to search or your private data as well
and now you know coming back to the big
codebase there are libraries that do
this right it's not a single big binary
a single big you know thing that we just
put in our data center but it's actually
more like a collection of micro services
of services and micro services and and
then in turn a collection of libraries
right so we have libraries for
everything and a lot of these libraries
are shared between services not all of
them but many of them so there is really
a lot of structure in the codebase and
basil uses this structure to run the
bird and the structure is explicit in
the basal configuration files let's take
it let's take a look at an example so
this isn't well a made-up example but
this is what it would actually could
actually look like right you have a
build fire you have a java binary rule
in it I do a lot of Java work so that's
what I use for an example but it could
be anything really then you have a
couple of source files in this case we
actually look for all the source files
in the current directory
three and you've dependencies and you
have a main class and then you know your
Java file looks like this so what does
basil do with that all right
so it looks at the boat file it loads it
and it says this is a package and this
package contains one rule and it also
contains one source file and it contains
the generated files or if the output
files a Java binary and there is nothing
else in this package so basil doesn't
actually go out and look for all the
source files that you have in your tree
but it only looks at the boat files and
maybe you know listed a directory or so
and the key idea here is that if you
have such a big codebase you need to
make sure that you can make sense of the
codebase very quickly and efficiently so
you only want to read the parts of the
code base that actually needed for your
boat if you compare that with make for
example make reads the entire make fire
and note ever if you have a single make
file for your project make at the end of
reading the make file make notes
everything which is great except if your
codebase goes beyond a certain size you
start having just reading the make file
can start to take minutes that's
actually what we had we were using make
before we started using basil basil and
it took a long time and so this is one
of the things that we definitely wanted
to do and so one key attribute here is
that we also know about all the
dependencies of this rule so the rule
depends on the source files and it also
depends on you know the dependence is
declared here in this case it's bar and
then the rule itself the java binary
also depends on tools like the java
compiler and java packaging tools you
know that sort of thing but there is no
other dependency there is no implicit
dependency on something else we don't go
out and try to figure out what you want
to do but rely on it everything being
explicitly specified so when we look at
this build file we know exactly what we
need to do we read this build file we
read the build files for the tools for
the dependencies and then we start
building
and so I want to give it sort of a walk
through to to how basil builds stuff so
you tell bail basil please build through
all right
so basil starts with that now in order
to build through it needs to read the
boat files for fou okay let's do that
and then it needs to list the direct
list the directory right to find the
other source files in this case okay so
now we have the package we know what it
is okay we know that there's a
dependency and bar so it reads the bar
build file as well in this case there
isn't a glob someone said explicitly you
know this depends on Bardot Java in this
case bail doesn't go out and look for
files all right so we've got the rule
now we know what it is we've analysed
the dependencies now we want to build it
so we sort of go back up to that that
first node and say okay now I want to
build it so what do I need to do to
build it all right I need to do a
packaging step all right that's the last
step in the process and this packaging
step depends on having compiled the
files so we see that that we now have
this dependency on the compiler and then
we start compiling the files in the
right order and then we're done all
right so that's good now what happens if
you modify a source file let's take a
look at that modify full main dot Java
and then basil knows because it has
tracked all those dependencies exactly
which actions it has to re-execute it
doesn't have to look at anything else
and so you can imagine that if your if
your software is small you know it
doesn't really matter but as your
software gets bigger it becomes more and
more important that you only do the
minimum amount of work absolutely
necessary for whatever changes you've
just made right so I for those who don't
know it most software developers you
know type text in a text editor or an
IDE and and you usually don't change
everything at once right you change one
file you want to fix one bug you want to
add one feature so you go to the right
file and start editing it and then you
rebuild and then you rebuild and rebuild
you want maybe you want to run some
tests on it or you want to run it on
your computer and so so this this cycle
needs to be as fast as possible for you
to be as a software engineer to be
productive alright so let's take a look
at the more complicated example adding a
file let's say we edit a file now this
this foo note here with a slash at the
end that sort of represents the
directory or the directory listing and
we can figure out that the directory
listing has changed on Linux systems we
use the inotify
API for that right the Linux kernel has
this API which allows us to ask you know
tell me all the files that have changed
in this directory you know tell me every
time something in this directory
structure changes and so that fires when
we add a file and so we know that this
directory listing is out of date so we
redo the directory listing and we know
exactly which actions have depended on
that and then we reconstruct the package
we create the new new actions and then
when we execute it of course we take the
new file into account we're done
and again we're doing the minimum amount
of work necessary to update from you
know your change from the previous state
you plus your change to the complete new
change and in any case we've never
looked at bar we've never even
considered the existence of bar all
right so how do you make sure that this
is correct we need to know all the
dependencies we need to know exactly
what all defenses are and then when we
run an action we need to make sure that
you don't accidentally or intentionally
accept files that you didn't declare as
dependency and so we use sandboxing on
all the other major platforms to do that
and for us we've always seen that
correctness
equals performance if we can ensure that
the boot system is sufficiently correct
that it gets this right 99.999% of the
time then our developers never need to
do a claim they never need to restart
from scratch
they always get an incremental boat
which is fast because we can make sure
that we do just the minimum amount of
work necessary and so if you if you look
at our code base you know forty five
thousand changes per day is a lot and we
build everything after every change
that's not true
what we actually do is we only build the
stuff that was changed but you change
the may parser we only rebuild the mid
server everything else we don't even
touch and so we can do that with that
you know number of changes because we do
the minimum amount of change of each
edge each step alright I want to talk a
little bit more about time and space
complexity and I hope that everyone will
be able to follow even though this is a
bit technical let's say we have let's
say we have a Java program I'm sorry for
everyone who who doesn't write Java but
my most used language all right so we
have a sequence of libraries library a
and library B depends on library a
library see depends on library B and so
on up to our binary and so for each of
these we have some source files that we
want to compile and so in order to
compile the source files you need to
know the dependencies so when you
compile a you only compile a oh that's
easy when you compile B you you need to
make a available for the source files
for the compiler to be able to compile B
when you compile C you need to make sort
of the libraries a and B available and
now if you look at this you know the
first library has one thing that it
looks at then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 and
if you sum that up in general 1 + 2 + 3
and so on + n is n times and plus 1 over
2 which is something something N squared
and in terms of complexity and squared
that's not that bad except if you have a
large code base the larger your code
base the worse this gets not
it and it's it's not just two times the
size of the code base is two times worse
but it's actually four times worse and
so this is a problem that we've been
struggling with for four years and we've
been working on this I it sounds weird
if I say we work on this for years
because it seems like a simple problem
but you need to apply this to every
programming language you support and you
need to make sure that you don't you
know we have hundreds of people
contributing to the code base we need to
make sure that everyone is aware of this
problem and that they follow the the
coding patterns that are needed to solve
this all right so so this started the
solution right instead of story you know
making a copy of everything before you
just give a pointer to whatever it was
before here we don't really care it's
just something and so that solves a
space problem but at some point you
actually run the compiler and you need
to make all of this available you have
to iterate eventually all right let's
take another example
you don't have one binary but you have
many binaries you have many tests
hopefully everyone has a lot of tests
yes
okay and so sorry what what can happen
here is that at each of the tests you
iterate over all of your dependencies
and then if you have an N and over 2
dependencies and over two tests you have
n over 2 times n over 2 and you get
again to quadratic regime which is again
problematic so I wanted to give an
example of how this can kill you
because it can and it does this is the
C++ compiler this is GCC this is the
performance of GCC there is a specific
case where the C++ compiler runs into a
quadratic regime and then this happens
the the numbers on the left are seconds
right so this is the time needed to
compile a single C++ source file and as
you can see it goes up like this if you
do it wrong
that if you do it right it looks like
the green line on the bottom so so in
Basel we've been working on this and
these are sort of our times this is not
the full build this is just what we call
analysis these are the the lines for ACC
library and Java library and PI library
the numbers are not quite up to date but
I checked that there are still you know
quite close right if this is on the
bottom it's a number of dependencies
right if you have a thousand four
hundred libraries in a row in your
project I don't think anyone will do
that it not even us but if you had basil
would still be able to analyze that in
under a second because we make sure that
we don't grow quadratically but only
linearly in the number of dependencies
build systems can't avoid this
there is no build system that can get
around us the only thing you can do is
sort of try to push it a little more
towards linear and away from quadratic
now for us we don't just build stuff you
know we've data center voice of machines
we don't need a single machine let's
just distribute it across the data
center and that helps us a lot because
it gets it gives us a better factor
right let's say you have a hundred
machines and you distribute your your
builder across 100 machines and your
performance creates this case
quadratically but you only have like a
hundred libraries then if you can do it
right you can paralyze all the comprises
all in parallel and get much better
performance obviously all right so I've
talked about Java but what about binary
lambda calculus anyone using that I was
looking for the most unusual programming
language I could find no okay all right
what about Scala anyone using Scala here
all right so so you've built system we
do a lot of language specific work right
Google we use like the Mae
for languages like Java and C++ then go
and Python but you know if you want to
use the build system you might want to
use a different language you might want
to use it for Scala for Fortran or for
Haskell and we support that we have an
extension language that allows you to to
extend Basil's for any land pretty much
any language you can think of we have
literally dozens of examples of
languages that we can support with this
extension mechanism it's this extension
mechanism is a little bit unusual it
doesn't allow you to freely program
because we want to make sure that we can
still know all of the dependencies that
your software has and then we can do
incremental builds correctly in all
cases so we've intentionally restricted
this so that you can only do things that
we can that are safe right we can make
sure that whatever you do we can
correctly do incremental builds in our
cases and also correctly paralyze your
but this is a brief example you know I'm
not gonna go through this but you can
see that it's reasonably easy to add
support for something in this case that
runs share comments right so in some
cases you you have like a case where you
have a file and you want to do something
with it and the easiest way you can
think of it's shell and when that
happens you can use a general alright
and then this is what your boot file
looks like so it it looks similar to
what we had before and this is an
advantage because it means that if
you're if you're a company and you have
multiple people working on your projects
and maybe they work with different
languages you know the build files all
look very similar and they've all
similar in ways that make it easy to
pick up you know a different part of
your project we we talk a lot to two
people who would like to use basil and
they often tell us well they are
currently running with a combination of
make and maven
she'll scripts and Gradle and so one of
the advantages of basil is that it can
handle pretty much all programming
languages I mean not maybe not literally
all I don't know we haven't tried all of
them yet but a lot of them and it makes
it very easy to move between different
parts of the project in between
different languages and we have SCADA
roots actually and go roots and rest
roots and you can go to github and see
the full list of languages that we've
already have support for all right
talked about that talked about that
workers now workers are pretty cool I
want to talk about them because they
were so cool so in some cases you want
your builds to be even faster and now if
you look at your compiler your compiler
has to do all sorts of things before it
can even compile your code you through
though the standard library and
initialize itself and so on and so forth
and what we support is we support
keeping a process a hot process around a
hot compiler process around so that it
can cache the standard library and other
things in in memory and then especially
for incremental builds is particularly
interesting because then we reduce the
the pass on incremental bills by quite a
bit we of course we have IDE integration
and all of them yet but we're working on
that and all right so build systems
what's special about Basel well we try
to make sure that we do it's a minimum
amount of work necessary every time and
we make sure that we know all the
dependencies that go into it so that we
can do that correctly we sandbox actions
so that you can't accidentally depend on
something that you didn't declare in
build systems we believe that
correctness is driving performance we
need to be very careful to avoid
quadratic behavior otherwise
you end up like C++ compiler and we have
an extension language so you can support
pretty much any any language any
programming language you want alright
thank you and over to David thank you so
there's a giant clock here screaming at
me saying dude it's late everyone wants
to get back to drinking and eating so in
true basil fashion I will not repeat
anything you've already heard I will
only tell you new information my name is
Dave I'm the product manager for basil
I've been at Google for about three
years and prior to that I worked a lot
of different teams a lot of different
tools and languages and what really
struck me when I came to Google was how
productive and happy the engineers were
and of course these are mutually
reinforcing things and the tools that
they used is a really big part of what
makes them so engaged and one of them is
called blaze which is basil is built on
so it's really exciting for me that
we're able to take this and extend it to
the community and offer that
productivity to everyone across
languages across platforms bass was a
little funny as a new product in a sense
because it's been around for over 10
years from the genesis in 2008 it became
the default at Google so it's really
very mature but of course relatively new
to the open source world and so we're
looking to rapidly mature it in the open
source environment into the something
that can provide that same productivity
as it has at Google so our current
release is version 0.4 point one we're
not at point two yet right and what
we've introduced in that release is the
persistent Java compiler so if was
talking about the ability to maintain a
persistent compiler in memory and that
makes your incremental builds much
faster look now I'm repeating
information we've introduced and boxing
for OS 10 so sandboxing means that we
won't rely on assets from the underlying
operating system and that's really
important for our story around the
repeatable reproducible build so when
I'm building something
my next-door neighbor is building
something we wanted to behave the same
way for the same codebase and even
extending that to cross-platform builds
a couple things that are recent one is
Windows we've added support for Windows
you can build on Windows we support
Windows 7 plus 64-bit variants
relatively new but maturing very rapidly
and the IDE support that Wolff mentioned
we have is a framework for IDE support
and then specific implementations for
popular ideas we'd love to see that
continue to grow so what's coming next
in the next few version some here are
some of the highlights we're going to
keep working to mature windows support
there's still work to be done on OSX we
want to really and step up the mobile
side of things again you know our goal
here is to make it so that basil can be
the only build system you need and so
therefore we want to have really solid
support across all the platforms and
Android and iOS are supported by basil
as of today but there's work to be done
there we're gonna bundle the JRE and so
basil depends on Java and what that
means is then to install it you have to
have a running JRE on your system we're
going to run though that in make it
easier to install easier to port across
systems we're adding support for code
coverage and you run that locally it
spits out this really nice graphical
report of how your coverage is some
caching things like all folks about and
then the one I think is the most
exciting here is a fourth down I
should've put these in order the
searchable community repository of
skylark rules so the idea that we want
for basil is it's not a C++ build system
it's not a Java C Java build system it's
not a Fortran build system it's all of
them and that's within the impetus for
skylark is that as the community of a
given language for example rust is a
great example where that community said
we want make work for basil they got
together you can go on and get up and
find a full set of basil rules and you
know we certainly were aware of that I
may have helped them I'm not sure but
this is something that they as a
community were able to do with basil and
we want that to continue to grow and
make it so that whether it's a new
language or creating trying to support
an older
language basil is the place to go basil
gives you all that plumbing gives you
the engine and you write your rules to
make it work
we had a great example we're talking to
someone earlier who uses a bunch of Java
and a bunch of Fortran and the beauty of
basil is you can use both Java is
supported out-of-the-box Fortran
something you can write rules for and
you're good so then we get to basil 1.0
and basil one point it was not so much
defined by features as it is defined by
approach to process we're going to make
github be the primary core source for
where everything happens we really want
to engage everyone we need help here and
we're gonna have that formalized process
for how the software is developed which
leads to being able to have a long-term
support policy so that we can
communicate deprecations we don't expect
that basil is going to be changing
versions frequently we want this to be a
really solid platform upon which you can
build those skylark rules and iterate
those at the speed that you need them
then from there we move on to basil 2.0
which really is just the evolution of
that basil vision at that point we want
it to be completely language agnostic so
we're going to take those core rules
right now some of the language has
built-in rules where you take those and
move those out to skylark make the core
really small and performant so that
everything happens through the extension
framework and these things can then
mature at their own appropriate
Cadence's we want it to be big we want
basil to be widely used and loved so we
hope everyone here will try it out
experience it give us feedback help it
mature and we want it to be fill in the
blank this is something that we as
Google feel like it's important that we
work with the community evolve the
state-of-the-art of software development
so whatever it is that we as a community
need from a development tool please you
know the forums are open tell us what
you're looking for proposed changes and
and let's make this new approach to
building software the incremental the
parallelizable there's something that
supports huge code bases you
