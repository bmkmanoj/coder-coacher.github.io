have either advanced meter reading
metering infrastructure smart grid
projects already underway using wireless
mesh and feel free to jump in at any
point and ask questions I'm here also
with with Narcy Macari who's a founder
and CTO of Coco's and Rob pilgrim who's
the VP of biz dev so if there's anything
that I don't know i'm sure they they can
fill in as well so what is the smart
grid I think there are a lot of
different opinions and definitions but
this is this is sort of a paraphrased
list from the Department of Energy the
characteristics are that it needs to
self-heal and that's that sort of
contrast with the self destructing
nature of the of the grid in 2003 when
we had the big black out of the
Northeast and even you know right now
the Northeast there's there people
without power partly because a lot of
the problem what happens with the
transmission and distribution system is
is manual then not a lot of
communications built in so that that's
self-healing is something that that the
planters are really looking forward to
in the smart grid it enables active
participation and that can be either
manual or automated for the end users of
the electricity it can be displays in
people's homes that give them real time
information about electricity pricing
that allow them to modify their their
behavior or it could be talking all the
way down to the machines to the your
your dryer your water heater or your
plug-in hybrid and telling it when to
charge when to give energy back when the
electricity is cheap and clean or when
it's expensive and dirty smart grid
needs to be secure so it needs to both
be protected against physical and cyber
attacks and be able to heal itself again
for the first point when something like
that occurs needs to accommodate
distributed generation and storage we
certainly see plug-in hybrids coming to
an example of distributed distributed
storage things like ice energy
a SI units that can freeze freeze water
at night when energy is cheap and and
then use it during the day to do to cool
a building but certainly wind power and
solar power things that are that are
generated not in centralized locations
and that puts more strain on the on the
grid to transport that power around and
finally those those transmission and
distribution assets need to be used
efficiently so that they're not wasting
that power and the the generation as
well nice be these as efficiently as
possible in the cleanest cleanest
generation facilities need to be need to
be used and coordinated so um the smart
grid really is more than just meter
reading as I've described there there
you know if you look at this top petal
of the flower there am I stands for
advanced metering infrastructure so
that's not just reading the meters
that's sending information back to the
to the meters and the consumers but
there many other aspects of the smart
grid outage management demand management
load shedding etc etc so you know all of
these things require basically
communications at their core in order to
to make the grid more resilient more
efficient and greener if we look at the
components or the are the devices that
are part of a smart grid we have on the
on the left side here the either
consumers or generators of the
electricity the distributed generation
storage demand response so as I
mentioned the displays in people's homes
or smart thermostats smart meters
sensors in the in the distribution
system and even the the linemen and the
workforce on one side on the right side
you have visualization software and all
of the servers and management the deal
with running the grid but in between
the fast bi-directional communications
infrastructure and that's where that's
where we feel wireless mesh down there
so we've broken it down into several
different several different segments
here nobody's claiming that there's a
single mesh technology or wireless
technology or communications technology
that's appropriate for for every piece
of this this communications
infrastructure on the on the right side
here are all of the servers and control
systems and then you know one
implementation is to build an IP mesh
backbone that that ties everything
together in the field here so it's it's
supporting the metering and the home
area networks as well as the
distribution automation and and work for
it for course applications and that's
the part that that tropics networks is
involved with building for the meters
themselves often a more appropriate
technology in but involves lower
bandwidth lower frequency communications
often the meters are hidden behind homes
they might be in the basement of an
apartment complex and if their water and
gas meters as well as electric meters
they may be battery operated so you need
a technology that's they can sleep send
signals very infrequently to conserve
battery power so often a 450 or 900
megahertz solution that has better
propagation is more appropriate for that
layer of the system and then finally
within the home you start talking about
smart thermostats and you know there's a
dryer and a water heater they're shown
in the diagram you want to you want an
open standard system so that devices
from many different manufacturers can
talk to one another and get that
information about pricing or about load
shedding and so one of the emerging
standards that's becoming popular zigbee
for that that that layer of the network
so let me focus in on the on on the IP
mesh back
and that's that sort of the section that
we're then we're working on we're
experts in until you guys more about
that so a tro post wireless mesh is it's
certainly a fast and high-capacity
technology we're estimating around 100
megabits per second per kilometer
squared standards-based so we benefit
from accounting economies of scale there
are millions and millions of Wi-Fi
devices out there that can connect up
it's fast to install we've had networks
that are where 500 notes have been
installed in in a week but as you've
seen this in this picture here this is a
familiar sight for people in mountain
view it's a small box sitting on the on
the end of a streetlight it's powered by
a power tap right on the top of the
light there's there's no no electrical
wiring that has to be done install one
of these things so literally the longest
part of the install is parking the
bucket truck raising the arm up and then
raise it you know lowering it back down
again it uses open spectrum secure
scalable self-organizing and
self-healing and that that
self-organizing and self-healing part of
the technology is something that will
can look into a more detail here so this
is a simple example of a mesh here
you'll see there three devices we call
gateways so they have some some form of
wired or wireless backhaul it might be
fiber or Ethernet or it might be a
point-to-point wireless link but somehow
they're connected back back to the back
end but the majority of devices are
untethered so they're just sitting
sitting on poles or wherever the
mounting assets may be and they're just
getting power all of them are sending
sending out beacons periodically so they
can discover one another and what
happens is they'll determine where their
neighbors are and they figure they'll
figure out each node will figure figure
out independently the best route to get
back to the wire or get back to the to
the back end
if a new node is added it will start
transmitting and listening for beacons
figure out who its neighbors are so
that's right over here is where a new
node has been added and again it'll find
out the best path that it can take
either directly to a gateway or may take
multiple hops if that's if that's a
faster and lower latency path that it
that it can that it can choose the you
know I've colored it here so you can see
that the system naturally segments
itself into what we call clusters so a
cluster defined as a gateway and the
devices that are routing back into it
and in the case of us of a single radio
card where each of these clusters can
then operate on it on it on a different
channel to maximize spectral reuse and
get more capacity if there's an outage
or interference the so this link over
here on the right side goes down for
whatever reason the node will rear out
and find another path to keep the keep
the keep the mesh working so again over
here on the left side in this case the
link over here to its old cluster broke
but it will scan channels and join a
different cluster if necessary to keep
to keep operating and many of our more
recent products and and some of the
equipment in Mountain View actually is a
is a multi radio system there there's no
restrictions on which radio can be used
for which purpose so meshing or serving
clients whichever one is fastest and
most appropriate can be used so in this
case some of these links have converted
over to the five gigahertz radio others
where there's where the better
propagation properties of the 2.4
gigahertz are still using 2.4 so let's
switch over to the to the mountain view
network just just as an example then
um it is primarily a public access
network it was launched by Google just
over two years ago for free wireless
broadband access to the citizens of
Mountain View it covers the entire city
there are about 500 routers mounted upon
mounted up on poles so that works out to
run 40 to 50 devices per square mile
there's 67 gateways within the city so a
good fraction of the devices have have
some kind of backhaul and in this case
it's it's wireless backhaul again
there's point-to-point wireless links
that feed feed capacity into the network
and that's because this isn't a smart
grid or meter reading Network it has
much higher capacity requirements to
serve serve broadband to the entire city
so there's no there's a high density of
routers and there's quite a bit of
backhaul order to serve the whole
network um it's important to note that
the system doesn't require those kinds
of density so that that number of
devices to work their other networks
where we have as few as one router per
square mile and they can still mesh up
in form a very sparse mesh for
applications like public safety or for
for me to reading and again the backhaul
you know just as much as necessary he
needs to be needs to be put in if
they're not high capacity requirements
for the network the just a few back home
points can be can be provisioned and
then as you should grow zor new
applications come on board some of the
notes can be converted to gateways to
increase the capacity of the network so
in mountain view as I as I said it's
primarily public access there's in home
broadband if you have a cpe or Google
Health a Wi-Fi modem that's a higher
power mains powered device deep plug-in
and stick in your window and that has
enough sensitivity and power that it can
penetrate a few walls and give give
access inside a building otherwise it's
laid out for street level
average for laptops and iPhones and
other handhelds the bookmobile has a
mobile node in it so as they as they
travel around and stop at different
places they can provide access and there
is actually a meter reading pilot in one
of the newer newer constructed
neighborhoods where they're doing doing
meter reading for the water 4mon be
detailed east water so there's so Google
intro is collect a lot of data about the
network there's some interesting things
that that come out of that so this is
these are some plots and numbers for a
typical I guess that's last wednesday
that i took the screenshot so they're
typically seven or eight thousand unique
clients that associate to the network
every day many of those may be
unintentional if you're just walking
around and you connect it up with your
iphone in the past it may just connect
up as you know without without you
knowing it so the real number that that
is more reasonable of quotas around
three thousand unique active clients so
those are devices that connect up and
transfer at least one megabyte of data
I'm during during their sexual session
but still that's a that's a enormous
number of users in the city if you look
at the number of users here plotted over
x is a this is a month view you can see
that it's higher on weekdays and then it
drops down every weekend that's people
come in to work in mountain view versus
those who live here right in the middle
there's a three-day weekend that's
thanksgiving right there dropped way
down the opposite is true for the amount
of data that that traverses the network
though there's a little bump on weekends
here that you can see periodically so
turns out that that's when people are
doing more downloading and uploading
even even with fewer users there's more
overall traffic that gets passed on the
weekends and that that works out to
about well for this particular day three
hundred fifty eight gigs downloaded 107
off and we've seen
days where there's over half a terabyte
transfer it up and down over the course
of the single 24-hour period so that's
that's a huge amount of capacity and
that's something that we've we've had to
work pretty hard to be able to be able
to achieve so toward those goals for
toward getting that kind of capacity
reliability we've had to look at the
resources in the network and figure out
how to use the most efficiently there's
not a lot it's it's an unlicensed you
know it's using a licensed spectrum
nobody's gone out and bought lot
spectrum here so we have about 180
megahertz in the two bands that we're
using that work cepted 28
non-overlapping channels that can be be
selected by the routers so we have to do
more than just pick pick the channels
that are available to us and one way is
to look at the resources as a functional
location so by adjusting the power
transmitted from the devices we can use
up spectrum in a small area or a large
area and use use only as much as as we
need to in order to get a signal from
point A to point B directionality is
also important and then ténéré can
listen only in the intended direction
and cancel out on an unwanted signals
coming coming from other directions and
finally there's polarization which is
the final component of the of the
airtime resources that we have to work
with so let me look at the first one
here which is the spectrum and the
channels that are available so there's a
lot of information in this map there are
as you can see there they're square and
round icons the squares represent
gateways in the network so those have
some kind of backhaul and the nodes are
or the untethered devices that just are
getting power are the are the circles
you can see that they've clustered up
into into a cluster of notes around
every gateway and each one of them has
chosen a different channel represented
by the color here there some some notes
taking two or three hops I'm going
directly to a gateway just depends on
how the how the metric works out which
path the device computes will give it
the fastest throughput and the lowest
latency over here on the right side
there some devices with with two colors
those are dual radio nodes so there's
the inner color represents the channel
of the five gigahertz radio and the
outer color is the point for your hitch
video so for the most part they're
actually using their five gig radios to
mesh and then picking different color
channels to support client devices and
and using using actually a different
channel than the neighbor in order to
get as little overlap as possible in the
most capacity so this all of this
happens automatically devices are
listening for noise and interference and
they're also looking at the channels of
their neighbors in order to figure out
how how to get a good link but not
interfere with their with their
neighbors whenever possible so that them
get the most spectrally reusing the most
capacity out of that out of the network
if interference is detected then the
devices will automatically switch
channels so they can keep working and
have a have a robust link so as
mentioned airtime really is that
resource that needs to be used
efficiently here the network and the
management system collects a tremendous
amount of data this is just a screenshot
from our photo management console here
but you can see hour by hour there are
not only performance measurements that
are being done so this is these are
throughput tests that are done several
times an hour showing the results in
megabits per second the latency of the
network channel that its operating on
number of hops number of clients that
are associated but we're monitoring the
air time which is the fraction of time
that the spectrum is busy so here broken
down into transmission and reception and
total I'm isn't showing up
so at an example for this particular
node during this hour it was
transmitting with a 20-percent 22% duty
cycle it was receiving twenty-seven
percent of the time and if you add in
other interference or other signals that
is picking up as the air time is is
fifty eight point nine percent utilized
so what we really try to use do is use
that air time as efficiently as possible
and try to prevent it from getting so
saturated that that the medium starts to
break down and devices start to get
disorganized and start clobbering each
other so when that when the traffic
reaches this sort of eighty percent
airtime level when you're using that
much that much of the capacity a
standard Wi-Fi system will start to get
this organized I'll start have devices
talking on top of each other and those
collisions cause them to step back right
back basically start talking more slowly
which in turn causes even more
collisions to occur so by monitoring the
resource utilization monitoring that air
time continuously we're looking for this
breakdown point we're trying to prevent
it from occurring trying to keep the
network right below the saturation where
it can continue to use its resources and
operate efficiently but not cross that
cross that boundary so one strategy is
to use power control so in this diagram
I'm showing a transmitter in red in the
middle it's talking to its neighbor but
it's also its signals extending well
beyond that distance that it's trying to
close there so basically all of these
ten other devices have to remain silent
when it's talking because they all can
hear it the system looks for
opportunities where it can reduce its
power and in turn reduce have to it'll
have to reduce its reduce its bitrate
and speak more slowly but where it can
reduce this range of interference and
allow other devices to operate
concurrently so it's looking for
these opportunities for for simultaneous
transmission we're just by quieting down
a bit it can allow some of its neighbors
to also talk at the same time and there
and thereby get that that get that kind
of concurrency so I'll go quickly
through through these next few slides
because it gets it gets pretty technical
but the point is that the with this
power curve algorithm the each device is
trying to figure out who its neighbors
are and how much they'll be affected by
its by its activities so it can see that
at this end of the curve if it's
transmitting at full power it's going to
knock out 14 of its neighbors in this
example vs of it if it whispers it will
only affect two of its neighbors so it's
making this trade-off between using up
the resources for itself and being sort
of selfish about transmitting at high
power and getting lots of lots of speed
for itself versus accommodating its
neighbors so that's something that we do
in real time is you know on a packet per
packet by packet basis adjust the
bitrate and power in order to get as
much concurrency as possible within the
mesh so the results speak for themselves
by just a just a small reduction in
power on average throughout the network
we were able to increase the throughput
by seventeen percent really
significantly decrease the number of
nodes that were they were getting
congested and getting getting low
throughput and we estimate increase the
capacity network by on what you know by
almost a factor of two you um the other
prong of this of this approach of using
air time efficiently is to monitor the
air time and look look for this this
sort of saturation that can occur and
throttle back only when one of those one
of those saturation saturation events is
about to occur so it's it's something
that that Google really encouraged us to
do they didn't want to do rate limiting
wanted to keep the network as neutral as
possible and not say cut back on
bittorrent traffic and let web traffic
you know go good go through so I think
they were really taking a strong stance
on on on neutrality there I'm so they
encouraged us to find a different
solution that would be absolutely fair
and only cut back on traffic when it was
basically averting a congestion event so
this acc air time can get congestion
control algorithm monitors the air time
and only activates when when the air
time is starting to get congested and at
that point gives out equal allocations
to all of the devices in the area the
end result is that the end result is
that the total traffic actually
increases by averting the saturation
events where the air time starts getting
getting used inefficiently it keeps it
in this efficient regime it actually
allows more total traffic to to to
traverse the network so it really is not
a rate-limiting algorithm in that regard
but enough of the boring stuff let me
get back to some of the some of the
other cities where we have networks and
talk about how they're using them and
how they're they're operating more
efficiently and making strides toward
toward developing a smart grid system um
so this is this is one are one of our
first exposures to meet a reading in
Corpus Christi Texas this was a network
that was actually justified solely for
this meter reading application they went
on and put in put in 147 square mile
network that serves water and gas meters
and the business case was such that they
could justify the entire entire your
network just to do this meter reading
since then it's there other applications
that have come on since the network's
been built especially for for Public
Safety
Christie um Rock Hill South Carolina is
another example where they they put in
the network they had a smart meter
project instead that the network in
actually before the meters were in place
so they rolled out 32 square miles for a
automated meter reading system and they
were actually able to use the network
for that meter rollout project again
they discovered that having that that
wireless access in the city allowed them
to offer public access to residents of
rock hill as well as get it get Public
Safety police and fire and city
operations on the network Oklahoma City
is our biggest network in terms of in
terms of size so it the city of Oklahoma
City is actually covers a large rural
area around around the city center
itself 555 square miles and this is an
example of a very sparse Network where
they're only about 1200 nodes and the
entire network so the density is just
one or two per square mile actually it's
denser in the city center when out in
the rural areas they've taken advantage
of storm siren holes so they have these
tornado sirens that no very tall tall
falls out in the rural area and it
mounted nodes on those the other
interesting thing about the Oklahoma
City network is that because it was
originally a public safety Network they
had very strong security requirements
but that's that's something that's not
not foreign to utilities and the smart
grid where they they really want to take
security seriously because the grid is
obviously an important part of our
infrastructure so that security in other
words just proven in this in this public
safety network
Anderson yes Father all these
deployments how Hillary is the current
it really depends I mean you have
something good down here like lompoc
california where it's flat the not very
very many trees middle of the desert so
just one note per square mile is all you
need to get them the mesh to form into
offer it robustly I'm in the Northeast
especially it's it's it's not so much
the hills although that that that causes
problems with the foliage but you know
in the Northeast um all kinds of trees
and the higher density of notes notes is
required but yeah we've seen you know
seen many different environments and
adjusted the no density accordingly
it'll depend on the foliage and how
clear the clear the terrain is but also
the capacitance required and the type of
device and end-user devices that you're
supporting so if it's a public access
network anyone low-powered iPhones to be
able to connect up and have good
coverage that's much different from a
meter reading application was also
wondering they were trying to get them
to do san francisco which is both Billy
and has tall buildings and yes and a lot
of those I know how interesting that
would be in the deployment yeah that
would that would probably be similar to
mountain view there's the number there
it's per square mile can you get that
working maybe but maybe a little more
yeah how accurately can you model the
density requirements before you actually
begin taking in field measurements we
can do it pretty well and we do a mainly
based on experience it's it's difficult
to get accurate enough data clutter data
to do a to do an electromagnetic Model
Model beforehand but just by doing a
site survey and figure out the number of
the you know the approximate density of
notice that we need we can we can heat
it pretty well and the nice thing about
the about the wireless mesh is that it's
so easy to install you don't have to do
it right the first time if you're
putting in a cell tower you have to you
know lobby and get access rights and
and go through a lot of trouble to get
you better get it right the first time
if it takes 15 minutes to take down a
note and move it or put up another one
you can do it iteratively so you put in
the mesh you hold back a certain number
of of nodes and then you drive tested
figure out how good the coverage is
figure out how well it's performing then
you can fill in then actually as a lot
of these cities startup very sparse and
as they add additional applications
what's happened is we've added
additional nodes to fill in for the
different applications or add an
additional backhaul because for instance
starting off in Anderson Indiana they
just they were only using the Met to
backhaul metering data that was that was
the application that they built the
network on and since then they've added
a bunch of other applications and
they're using it for mobile workforce
type applications for their utility as
well so they can actually use GIS maps
and do work orders from the vehicle to
do that though you had to the window per
square mile was just too thin for that
type of applications they had to add
additional notes in certain areas to get
the kind of coverage that they needed so
one of the nice things about this
architecture is you start off with a
very sparse deployment to meet a single
application then the intent that you can
layer on additional notes fairly easily
as the number of applications on top of
applications grow over time yeah the
cool thing about Anderson is they you
know that they put it in for for AMR and
then they yeah they discovered how
useful it was and then they ultimately
opened it up for public access so so
they're hot pasta run on anybody wants
to you can connect up to the network and
get get free internet access then I
think finally Burbank is the best
example of a smart grid city that we've
seen so far so they they have their own
generation facilities and they're really
looking to use them as effectively
inefficient this puzzles click and avoid
investing and building more generation
generation capacity
so really is a two-way metering system
and they're doing you know as well as
communication to manufacturing customers
to do load shedding they have several
customers who have these nice energy a/c
units and their buildings so they're
telling the devices when power is cheap
and when it's not and and already
building already working with many of
the components of what what we call the
smart created and so why do that over
Wi-Fi instead of cellular packet data
seems like there's not that much
information there well there's that's
that's a good question no there-there's
no if people ask why not use quad-band
over power line as well that's that's
another the technology that's been been
suggested for the smart grid part of it
is economics if it's your utility has a
rate based they can use to charge for
electricity and it's it's better for
them to own their own assets then to be
naevus liability to have a paid a phone
company every month for for cellular
access and it works out to be works out
to be quite a bit cheaper to build it to
build a Wi-Fi network for this
application then to you know to pay
these fees to get to get high later data
that's something that that you know it
certainly has been tried there there
metering companies that started out
expecting to use cellular data to the
back hall back call me during data and
if found just as a practical matter they
need to come up there with their own
solution or with a you know with a
solution that the utility can own and
operate in order to make it feasible all
I the other thing is that is that these
networks um you know there may be enough
capacity today but you know every
network that that's ever been built just
about exceeds its you know it's you know
the initial demand and having something
that's that's more future proof and has
more
capacity and has has the ability to grow
so a wireless mesh network can be built
out sparse and that capacity can be
added it can be built on built out
incrementally as the so when they're
putting on these other applications
where they have mobile workforce they
try to access GIS data or do asset
tracking on the field you know the
bandwidth adds up and and sell the other
starts to look a little bit neater I was
going to say it depends on the on pit of
Maaloula Canada's fertility also in the
near term the first five years typically
especially just for an ami type
deployment for me to read it's actually
cheaper for the first five years to you
so then what happens is you get a cross
point somewhere between the five and
seven your mark probably where for that
particular application that actually has
a savings to use mesh network utilities
tend to look at projects and 10 to 15
your hands when the utility goes it gets
approved go ahead and put in meters of
print in a new system they typically are
looking at a multi-year deployment and
then operation for probably ten years
they want to make sure that the system
that pic is okay this future proof
because going back and changing that
network is politically difficult
economically difficult and operationally
difficult one of the things that a lot
of these guys have gotten hung on in the
past is the fact that you ever heard of
an old thing called CPD so they are data
packet data it used to be wat 18t
offered and then they said no we have
this new GPRS so we're not going to
support tdpt long so if you happen to
have CPD equipment put out there we're
sorry but we're turning the system need
to do something of replacement and then
what's going to happen is at some point
in the near future probably in the next
five years six years they're going to
have they've jumped two generations of
data transport beyond GPRS so we are
they going to maintain
GPRS network for just some Cheney
machine data moving over the network
probably not they have no restriction as
to to keep it running they'll just send
a notice saying you know in six months
we're going to shut it off so now a
utility PG&amp;amp;E covering 10,000 square
miles California has to figure out what
it's going to do to replace its data
collection methodology in a year you
want to be caught in that position
especially if it's a mission critical
things such as managing and reading your
the grid and it sucks reading it's
actually managing because we're smart
grid is going is a full to a
communications platform which is going
to be more than that right it's going to
be more than you eating it's going to be
command and control and other
applications which takes me to the last
piece and that has to do with
controllable weights when you're running
over someone else's network entirely
it's very difficult to manage that
latency because it goes over the
internet which you may not know how many
hops it's going to take and it has way
to you it's hard to predict when you
have a network and you manage that
network and you have a neuronal agency
between the control point and the end
device you're controlling which allows
you to actually do real-time command and
control of switches or things on the
grid as needed without having to do with
latency issues did that that switch
actually throw or not so you can
prioritize packets and reduce latency on
on he tracker Kenya say no just one
other thing about Burbank so so Fred
Fred Fletcher he's quoted on here one of
the things that he told us is that one
thing that they anticipate in in car
loving Southern California is is you
know plug-in hybrids taking off there
faster than they will in the rest of the
country and that's something where
that's that's tremendous amount of power
that it takes a charge a charge a car
battery it's a lot of energy and that's
something that they anticipate having to
you know to a condom accommodate with
their their municipal utility so
part of the reason that they're
embarking on this project is
anticipation of plug-in hybrids in
Burbank can you can you upgrade the mesh
network software Republic mm-hmm so you
can roll out firmware whatever yeah you
may want to give an example of what
happened analogy about software update
you did mr. Luthor aware there's a and I
want to do actually yeah there are two
images that I'm sort of it when we
rolled the software upgrade out and
actually increase the overall
fascinating yeah well I think there's
we've we've made significant
improvements I try to touch on them in
the earlier slides there but you know I
think compared to two years ago we're
supporting about four times as much
traffic as we saw then and that's that's
through these algorithms and using using
the resources more efficiently but I
things want of you like lifetime of
these slices um they're really over
built so they're they're hardened and
attested ip67 salt fog tests you know
corrosion drop tests and all these
things um so they're they're they're
built to be withstand the elements so
we're looking at lifetimes of 10 to 15
years o our current our current actual
calculated mean time between failure in
the field that we've experienced is
running like 20 roughly 20 years right
now yeah 20 21 years whatever some sort
of accelerated like Custer's right
basically it's just a number of hours of
service the number of units that brought
my cancer calculated actually forget the
existing it does it takes serious
hardware though to survive up on the
pole because there's there's the weather
but there's also dirty power you get a
lot of surges and brownouts and things
like that can wreak havoc on the power
supply then there's lightning as well so
we have lightning protection built in
the units we've had we've had our maids
come back for that where the device is
taking a direct hit the antennas are
just blown open but you just unscrew the
antennas and put put new ones on
there's a lot of well we've generated
several times there on the hardware
design there's a lot of a lot of
overbuilding that goes into making these
things making each individual unit
reliable the fact that it's a mesh means
that you don't need each unit to be
reliable it can it can self heal and
route around failures like that so the
overall system ends up being extremely
robust so that's basically it for me to
conclude where we're seeing the smart
grid being built today cities like
burbank and anderson and other places
and you know a major part of them is
central to the smart greatest
communications we think that wireless
mesh is an appropriate technology for
that for those communications and go
bye-bye basically solving in what in
some ways are harder problems building
an access network from Mountain View
building a public safety Network for
Oklahoma City you know we've solved the
harder problems and we've come up with a
with a system that is you know really
works very resilient Lee for smart smart
grid applications tough little bell
concession as when you're an urban
environment and there's a lot of home
Wi-Fi happening um so that's where the
that's where two of these algorithms I
mentioned I'm coming to play is that
there's the auto channel algorithm which
looks at the number of devices that use
in that channel as well as noise level
from things like microwaves and baby
monitors and things that aren't aren't
necessarily Wi-Fi devices and fix X
channels that are that are less occupied
and then there's also you know what
we've what we've discovered sort of do
our surprises that the signal from home
Wi-Fi access points is pretty well
contained by the walls of the home and
that goes both ways it makes it you know
it keeps those signals that we want to
hear inside but it makes it harder to
get there as well as keep our signal
from getting in as well also and that's
why things like these Wi-Fi modems are
necessary to get
um good indoor reliability yeah imma
grab on my window has to be in the
window ya ya screams will block at the
 of a blogger so I think we've we've
discovered that but most of the
congestion is actually our own it's
other devices that are up on poles that
are you know within clear line of sight
that we're hearing so that's why it's
it's so important to coordinate the the
channels that they're using the power
which they're transmitting and then look
for these congestion events and try to
try to write back the traffic when when
they're about to occur so in the context
of a smart grid all the devices are
going to need to do Wi-Fi how does it
this looks like it's part of the problem
it's definitely doing with part of part
of the problem and so Wi-Fi is Sun is
something that we've chosen for things
like that for the Google mountain view
network the technology works for it for
any wireless technology and the devices
don't necessarily have to be Wi-Fi
devices so the meters themselves are
often using proprietary wireless you
know technology and are talking to
collectors that are then the neither
using Wi-Fi or wired directly into it
into a widowed so that's that's probably
the most typical architecture is 450 or
900 megahertz proprietary wireless from
the meter's going to connect a collector
that's wired into a control pose to pose
nude hydrology
I think the important thing is that it's
it's open standard and it's IP based so
that means that a lot of applications
can can run on if I modification um
there's those the current big news about
having free internet available at this
day empty wireless spectrum and whoever
gets that wireless far that wireless
spectrum nest all for free internet
though right users I think the latest
news is it hasn't gotten any further but
the question is will do you think that
Davis wireless technology could be part
of how to actually implement free
wireless is everybody or is it really
just order to see by City kind of
applications I think we're seeing it
already happened to some extent so
certainly for municipally owned
utilities where the city is running the
water and the power and so on it makes
sense for them once they've they've
justified this network to open it up you
know it has extra capacity why not make
this any more attractive to residents by
by giving them giving them free access
that may not necessarily be the case for
an independent investor investor-owned
utility but i think they certainly have
plenty of uses for that bandwidth
themselves for the mobile workforce and
through running their their transmission
and distribution in like Oklahoma City
it was actually closed in private and I
guess it technically still is closed
right now they haven't opened up for
public access I don't think so so if so
it's a nipple if it's been in existence
and working now for four years and as
Cyrus had mentioned before they've had
from a security standpoint because it is
the primary data communications
mechanisms at the city police fire and
those guys use think they've had
attempts to hack that network and break
into the network dozens of times so far
they haven't had anybody right into it
yet in terms of is your question more
aligned around like the seven
hertz spectrum array I think so okay the
latest the whole thing about the empty
part of spectrum is optional yeah nice
to see what okay Joey one point species
yeah yeah
you had many issues with mic feedback or
forward like flattening leaves causing
causing problems that's something that
we haven't done I mean we model you know
it is there's no central control so it's
it's distributed intelligence each node
is making its own decisions as to you
know what channel to use for example and
that can affect its neighbors but that's
something that we've modeled modeled
very carefully and we've we've looked at
looked for in real world networks make
sure it's not happening so there's
enough the node will anticipate what
effect its actions will have so it's not
causing this is kind of flapping or
feedback from phil yet i'll try to try
to choose their gateway intelligently
yeah gateway goes down they'll recloser
part of the notes will go to 11 gate
wave hard part to another difficulty any
other questions a minute left well I
want to thank you Cyrus you're coming in
and talking yeah thank you I'm really
interesting me a chip something small
for you right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
