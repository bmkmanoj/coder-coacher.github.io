kind of exotic walls was that a far
beyond our solar system but before we
get to that let me remind you of a
simpler time we all knew what stars were
we knew what planet were star shone by
their own light planets reflected
sunlight and there were nine of them
remember that you know things move fast
you guys might forget blue things and
that wasn't so long ago and then what
happened with a few years ago
astronomers started discovering all
these icy bodies in the far reaches of
our own solar system many of them had
moons just like Pluto did and at least
one of them which is now appropriately
fittingly named eros after the Greek
goddess of discord looked like it might
even be a bit bigger than Pluto so this
created a bit of a problem for us either
we had to elevate it as the tenth planet
in the solar system for putting the door
for perhaps dozens of others that will
be discovered in the next few years all
we had to demote luto and that's what we
chose to do and became quite unpopular
for it schoolchildren wrote letters to
astronomers calling us heartless or
worse cartoonists had a field day and
there was at least one protest march
that I know of I wasn't and it's
shocking out of the you know close to
2,000 astronomers there I think a few
hot couple of hundred only voted on this
it was important to the rest of the
world apparently not to not to us and at
least four state legislatures passed
resolutions usually unanimously
declaring that Pluto shall remain a
planet you should look up I'm showing
the one from New Mexico you should look
up the one from California it's quite
entertaining talks about how this change
disturbs Californian sense of cosmic
well-being and they don't quite know how
to go about their life you know in this
new scheme that the strana ms are
proposing so what astronomers did
instead that the international
astronomical union meeting in prague
that summer in August was to create a
new class of dwarf planets and to put
Pluto in there along with Eris plus the
biggest of the asteroids in the asteroid
belt that's been known for over 200
years so we have now H planets and and
and three dwarf planets are in this new
scheme in our solar system and we expect
the dwarf planet category to grow quite
rapidly in the next few years and
decades but while this has been going on
and getting a lot of attention there
really has been a revolution unfolding
beyond the shores of our own planetary
system after literally thousands of
years of people speculating and over
maybe 150 years of people claiming to
detect planets beyond our solar system
claims that turned out to be mistaken in
the end in the mid 1990s astronomers
discovered the first planet around a
normal star other than the Sun since
then there have been over 500 confirmed
planets that we now call extrasolar
planets planets orbiting stars other
than the Sun these worlds many of them
are quite different from anything we
know of in our own solar system many of
them are way too hot are compared to
anything we know some of them are frozen
hells others of them are bigger than the
earth the biggest rocky planet in our
own solar system so there's quite a
range and I hope to convey a little bit
of that diversity during this talk the
first of these planets was cut was
discovered in 1995 around the star
called 51 pegasi by these two gentlemen
michel mayor and didier hello working at
the geneva observatory what they used
was a technique that we call the wobble
method or the Doppler method where they
basically measured the wobble of a star
due to the gravitational tug of an
unseen planet orbiting that that stop so
this is an idea people had worked on for
a long time they had first tried as my
described in my book for decades to try
to measure the wobble of the star on the
sky by plotting its position
very precisely and trying to see if you
could be a bubble in the motion of the
star instead of moving in a straight
line if the star looked like it was
wobbling along its path then maybe
something unseen with tugging on it
that's not the method that paid off
first it's measuring the wobble using
the spectrum of the stop so in the
background of this slide what you see is
a spectrum of our own Sun going from the
red to the blue and this forest of
vertical lines in that spectrum are
basically the fingerprints of elements
in the outer atmosphere of the Sun so
these are spectral lines due to a
variety of elements and they have really
they tend to have a very fixed pattern
they fall in very specific set of
wavelengths except when the star moves
so if it's moving away from us or
towards us these lines get shifted
alternately towards the red and towards
the blue so this is what we call the
Doppler shift or the red shift or the
blue shift depending on which direction
they go and that's the effect that
allows us to measure the component of
the wobble of the star towards us and
away from us and therefore the infer the
presence of a planet that's doing the
gravitational tugging on that stop this
happens in our own solar system Jupiter
being the most massive planet in our
system is the one that affects the Sun
the most that means son has a 12-year
wobble which is the period of Jupiter
going around the Sun and that's
measurable with the current
instrumentation this is a technique that
took a long time to to perfect and and
one of the other stories I tell in the
book is the work of a pioneering group
of Canadians actually Gordon Walker out
in Victoria and his colleagues who
starting in the 1970s tried to figure
out how do you measure this very small
very subtle shifts in the spectral lines
what you need is a very good ruler so
what they did was to build a little cell
of gas hydrogen fluoride in their case
which is toxic not something to be
playing with at the telescope when
you're half you know half asleep in the
middle of the night but that's what they
did they made this gas cell and they had
the light from the stars passing through
the cell because you know where the
lines from the the stationary gas
is going to fall and that provides the
ruler against which you can measure the
the shifts of the stellar lines so it's
a pretty neat idea and later on other
astronomers started to use this with
with much safer iodine as a gas cell
rather than rather than has been
fluoride and and these astronomers the
Canadians as well as many others
including those in California many of
them were looking for planets like
Jupiter in Jupiter like hobbits what
does that mean that means big massive
planets but taking a long time to go
around their stars that means they
didn't necessarily take data every night
they took data every few weeks over a
decade long period because that's how
you look for a decade long period planet
sometimes some of them did do
observation night after night in an
observing run but never actually
searched for periods very short and then
came the surprise of 51 peg where there
is this a planet with at least half the
mass of Jupiter presumably a gas giant
orbiting that star every four days so
for days not 12 years a very unlikely
place to find such a gaseous Beast that
that really was the first of many
surprises in the field in a very short
time so that's much closer than mercury
easy now solar system and a planet we
don't think would have formed so close
to its top most likely it from further
out and migrated inwards and that's not
something almost any astronomer thought
of exact 40 years earlier there's a
story of someone who went on to become
an important figure in American
astronomy called autos truth and his
story is yet another one that I tell in
the book it's quite a charming story he
happened to fight in the losing side of
the Russian revolutionary war his father
and grandfather and uncle I think were
all astronomers so astronomy really was
in his blood and he was excited to
Turkey where he basically lived off soup
kitchens and worked as a lumberjack and
you know try to just survive but he one
of his uncle's was in Germany and he
wrote a letter to that uncle asking for
help to find his way to America by the
time the letter reached him the uncle
had died
but his widow actually put him in touch
with an astronomer at the Yogi's of the
tree in Chicago who basically was
willing to hire this guy as he said you
know on his lineage right as an
assistant in spectroscopy at yogi's
observatory and it's quite a charming
story I quote from the letters of that
Otto wrote back in response to this
offer of a job but he came to the States
he went on to build up play major role
in building up observatories in Texas
and and in Arizona but one in this
incredible two-page simple paper in the
1950s he predicted that there may be
planets that are so close to their staff
they only take a day to go around their
son and he actually for sold two of the
most successful techniques for finding
such planets one was this Doppler method
that I mentioned already which is the
one that until recently has been the
most successful out of those five
hundred planets I think something like
370 of them have been discovered using
this method but the other method that
and this is an artist image of what are
this impression of what one of these hot
Jupiters might look like as we call them
now these incredibly hot walls are so
close to their stocks but one the other
method that Otto's true for so as a way
to find planets is called transits what
you see up on there in the little movie
clip is planet mercury in our own solar
system seen to cross in front of the Sun
so every once in a while let me see if I
can replay that every once in a while
you see the two inner planets of our own
solar system venus and mercury when they
aligned just right from where we are on
earth we see them as little dots
crossing the face of the Sun now the
same thing could happen with a distant
star right there in the other little
clip when a star we look at doesn't
appear as the Sun as a big disk in the
night sky it's a point of light so we
don't see a dot when the planet passes
in front but what we do see is the star
dimming in brightness by just a little
bit because that planet is blocking a
small fraction of the stars face as seen
from where we are so
planet about the size of Jupiter blocks
about 1% of a star light source unlike
style was you know soul a five-star I
should say and that means if you monitor
the brightness of the star you see a
one-percent dip in its brightness just
for a few hours while the pilot is
passing in front so that's what we call
a transit now you have to get lucky
right because if a planet isn't aligned
right if its orbit isn't almost
certainly a claw a perfectly edge on as
seen from where we are you'd never see
it transiting it stop you see it going
around this way which means it will
never be caught in transit so only some
fraction of the stars will we see that
way harboring planets but it's
incredibly successful technique what you
have to do is monitor thousands of stars
so you improve your statistics in some
fraction of them you'll see some small
number of them you will see planets are
in transit what I find really neat about
this technique is that all you need are
pretty small instruments telescopes that
are much smaller than many amateur
astronomers have in their backyard so
this is a set of eight little telescopes
mounted on the same mount on in the
Canary Islands off the coast of Spain
one of the most successful transit
searches going on this is I think it's
close to about 40 planets have been
discovered with this super wasp system
yes
yes so you're asking couldn't the
variability or the dip in brightness be
due to some other process other than a
planet so one well it's certainly
possible you have we do know sunspots
starts presumably have spots you could
have binary companions that have grazing
eclipses so yes you could be confused
but what you do is for one thing transit
due to a planet would be extremely
precisely periodic so you can watch
multiple transits going on and the
timing is usually extremely precise
unlike is the case for many other forms
of activity so that's probably the
simplest answer and then you could also
observe it at multiple different
wavelengths the color of the Eclipse can
also can help you rule out some of the
false possibilities but I'll come back
to that in a second because that is an
important question for something that's
coming up so my point is that this is a
method that for the search part all you
need a small telescopes staring at big
pieces of the sky monitoring thousands
of maybe tens of thousands of stars
every night night after night and the
bigger planets are easier to find
because they are the the dip is larger
that's still only 1% for a Jupiter now
planet about the size of the earth will
dim the star by one part in 10,000 so
that's a little hard to do from the
ground so that's where the Kepler
telescope comes in this is a telescope
launched 22 years ago in March of 2009
by NASA carries a one roughly 1 meter
mirror and what it's doing is it's in a
Sun orbit its orbiting the Sun roughly
the distance of the earth and it's
staring at one little patch of the sky
about the size of my hand at arm's
length that's the size of the sky that
it's staring act and it's going to stare
at it for good three and a half years
minimum so that part of the sky happens
to be somewhere in the between the
constellations of Cygnus and Lyra and
what it's doing is recording the
brightness of some 150,000 stars in that
patch of the sky very very precisely why
three and a half years
can anybody tell me yes yes exactly
there you go that's the answer so if
Kepler you could that tells you what
Kepler is after it's trying to find
earth-like planets inert like orbits
around sun-like stars so we want to see
three transits you need to wait three
years minimum right so that's the idea
so this telescope is basically going to
be fantastic at telling us statistics
for different kinds of planets because
it's 150,000 is a pretty small number
compared to the 200 billion stars in our
galaxy but it's a decent sample if you
want to get some sense of the how common
different kinds of planets are around
different kinds of stars so that's what
Kepler is going to be fantastic at is to
give us for the first time the answer to
a question like how many roughly
earth-like planets are there around
sun-like stars how many you know
jupiter-sized planets are there in one
year periods around red dwarf stars so
those questions will have answers
literally within the next two to three
years so already just from the first
year of data that Kepler has gathered
astronomers have announced 1235 planet
candidates just last februari so I make
a little bit of a distinction use the
word candidate here compared to the
500-odd i mentioned before as confirmed
planets and the reason for that is this
gentleman's question which is these are
not independently confirmed in other
ways so we just have transits and there
could be a small number of at least
false positives in that data set in the
sense that the interpretation may not
necessarily have to be planned so that
the Kepler team is getting very good at
ruling out a lot of those false
positives but a few could still be left
so a few percent of that 1235 may not be
real planets but they're doing follow-up
for a handful of them they're going to
try to get velocities get the spectra
measure the velocity so you have
independent confirmation of their masses
not just the size and when you can do
both it's really interesting and I'll
get back to that point when you have a
mass
Anna sighs you can get a density and
that tells you something about what kind
of material a planet is made of so
that's extremely interesting now one of
the systems that Kepler foreign planets
around is exceptionally intriguing it
saw six different planets transiting the
same star okay six planet transiting
system so you could see the transits of
all of these six planets yes it's pretty
it's pretty thin it's pretty well in the
same plane so this would imply exactly
what you're asking which is for us to
see all of six of them transiting their
star it must be pretty well in the same
plane all these planets what's even more
cooler is that five of these six planets
and by the way they're all roughly
neptune size planet so the kind of big
by our standards five of the six their
orbits fit within the orbit of mercury
in our solar system so that's incredibly
densely packed planetary system most
theoretical astrophysics would not have
predicted anything so rich so nature is
turning out to be a lot more wondrous
and lot more prolific in making planet
and making incredibly rich planetary
systems big yeah the the thighs fairly
old so it's at least you know in the
world of billions of years so it's not a
young system that's unstable it looks
like it is table they have done the
calculation and for the particular
planets that masters that we can
estimate this is a stable system what's
even cooler is that because they're so
densely packed from timing the transits
a Kepler scientists actually can watch
the gravitational influence of the
planets on each other it's really like
seeing kind of the dance of the planets
with each other choreographed by gravity
because they're so close to each other
you know the gravitational tug on each
other is measurable just from timing
because if you get you know sometimes a
transit would happen just slightly too
early sometimes just slightly too late
because depending on the positions of
the other four of the five planets and
that's incredibly beautiful to be able
to see in nature in real time the motion
of the planets and the gravitational tug
of the planet on each other reflected in
those motions so it's really beautiful
system one that we wouldn't have
predicted just want to show you that as
an example of the kind of surprises that
continue to come up in this very
exciting business so this is just a very
quick summary of what kind of planets
these planet candidates these Kepler
ones are as you can tell a lot of them
the peak is around Neptune sighs so a
lot of the twelve hundred plus plan
candidates half of them seem to be
roughly about the size of Neptune the
handful that are bigger like Jupiter a
few that I even bigger than jupiter and
then the low-mass end of this spectrum
there's quite a few that are we call a
super-earth a planet that's only a few
times more massive than the earth tend
to be typically between one and maybe
three or a DI and then a few dozen that
are roughly the size of the earth now
this half of the diagram of this
histogram is should be taken with
caution because the smaller planets as
you can imagine are harder to tease out
of the data so the scientists are still
learning how to push the limits of
detection so this part it may be it
turns out is a rising function in the
end that there may still be many more
smaller planets than there are Neptune's
we just don't know that yet that side of
the diagram is probably real will stand
in the sense there are more of Neptune
size planets then there are jupiter
sized ones there's a question
okay so when I say sighs I mean radius
or diameter the actual size when I say
mass I mean the amount of mass okay so
transits only give you the size the
radial velocity or the diplomat that
gives you a minimum mass when you have
both then you can get a density if you
have a size and a mass but if you have
only one then you can't now for the
sixth planet system even without having
velocity measurements you could get
masters for all the planets because of
this interaction among them gives gives
us additional information about their
masses you know the obits and you can
solve for the Masters just from the
transits but you can do that only
because there's multiple planets seen in
transit and because you can do the
timing of those translates generally you
need the Doppler method in order to be
able to see them get the mass now these
Neptune size planets and the ones that I
call super Earths what are they and this
is where having both a size and a mass
would tell us a lot so this is roughly a
schematic of what radius of size of
Jupiter versus what two possibilities
for what these super other planets might
be for the same mass they could be
bigger if they're lower density meaning
there for example primarily I see rather
than rocky so for the same mask you
could have a much smaller more densely
packed planet that we could be a rocky
planet or you could have a bigger less
dense IC or maybe primarily a mix of gas
and ice and rock kind of planner that
will give you a bigger radius so this is
where measuring the radius the size in
addition to the mass will help us
distinguish between these two kinds of
possibilities for what these super
Earths are and that's important because
there are no super earth in the solar
system the biggest rocky planet is the
earth and that's where we happen to me
so it's an intriguing question for
example that you might want to think
about is a super Earths going to be
habitable I mean some people have argued
that we know we need plate tectonics for
stable climate
not well maybe supports if as long as
they're not way too much much more
massive than then the earth may have
more rigorous plate tectonics and might
help recycle through the long term
carbon cycle for example better if you
had more mass if you had more vigorous a
plate tectonics others have argued that
that you know super it might be actually
much less habitable because some things
get locked in quickly and you wouldn't
have the nutrients you need on the
surface in the oceans to to harbor life
so there's a whole range of interesting
questions that come up when you think
about planets that don't exist in our
system that are being discovered
elsewhere now as I said Kepler is a
fantastic instrument it'll answer
age-old questions about how common are
other roughly earth-sized planets what
it is not going to be so great at is the
vast majority of the planets it's going
to find are going to be around stars
that are so far away that the too faint
for us to do a lot of detailed follow-up
okay so it'd be fantastic at statistics
not so great at giving you nearby
examples to go dig into in detail okay
so for that we depend on other
complementary searches from the ground
an example is this mls project which is
a using eight telescopes in arizona it's
led by david Charbonneau at Harvard and
what they're doing is with these eight
telescopes they're targeting one by one
the nearest couple of thousand red dwarf
stars why red dwarf stars because
they're smaller so a super-earth would
cover a bigger fraction of their surface
so the transit death will be a bit
bigger making it easier to do it even
from the ground the same kind of planet
around a sun-like star would have a
transit depth too small to measure from
the ground so that's why you go off to
the smaller stars but you go after the
nearest examples of those small stars so
that you have a chance of following them
up with other techniques so this is a
first step going on right now with ease
finding or we'll find our candidates
super Earths that are much better suited
follow up because they happen to be in
nearby their stars are brighter and
there's a chance that one of them might
turn out to be in
the habitable zone this magical place
where you can have liquid water way it's
not too hot not too cold the Goldilocks
zone that everybody is interested in yes
yes so because it's going off to the
nearest stars it has to do them one by
one because they all spread out through
the sky so that's why they're a
telescopes to speed up the search so you
can do eight at a time rather than one
at a time but it still means you want to
spend several days to a week / staff /
telescope so it takes a while to get
through but in a few years they've
figured out when two to three years I
think they could get enough of a sample
they already had their first discovery
of a super earth and that's around a
star called GJ 1214 just 45 light-years
away which is pretty close by our
standards it to know cosmic backyard
what's neat about it is as you can see
they were able to make the measurements
in transit and go follow up with spectra
and get the velocities so now you have
the wobble and you have the transit
which means you have an inference of
mass and radius and therefore density ok
and that density is somewhere between
what the earth would be a rocky planet
would be and what a gaseous planet like
Jupiter would be earth would be about
5,000 kilograms per cubic meter so it's
a lot less dense than the earth on
average what that means is it could
either be kind of a scaled-down mini
Neptune like I see primarily I see a
ball of material or it could be a
scaled-up super-earth a rocky planet but
with a pretty dense atmosphere for
example made of water vapor or carbon
dioxide something like that you need a
substantial gaseous component all of it
can't be rocky for that radius otherwise
you'd have a much greater density ok so
that means that at least a couple of
different possibilities of what kind of
planet this might be so how could we
tell because it's nearby because the
star is relatively bright number of
groups have tried to actually follow
this up so here's the work done by my
student my PhD student Bryce crow what
we've been doing is looking at this
nearby
super a transiting planet with the
Canada France Hawaii telescope which is
a three and a half meter telescope on
top of Mauna Kea in Hawaii it's pretty
modest by today's standards it's sort of
a medium sized telescope by today's
standards the kind of mean of telescopes
we let grad students play it no actually
well we do let them play with the bigger
ones too but the interesting thing here
is that because we're sitting here on
earth we have to deal with the Earth's
atmosphere which is changing all the
time right so if you go make a
measurement tonight and come back for
the next transit a few days from now and
make a measurement at a different
wavelength you can't compare them very
well because the water vapor content in
the Earth's atmosphere will be different
on the two nights so you have to be
slightly cleverer and you make
simultaneous measurements so that's what
we did we did we sort of flip back and
forth between available in this part of
the infrared and over there and the
reason for that this plot looks a little
complicated it doesn't have to be let me
show you basically there's just two
options one this kind of flat curve is
what models predict for the water heavy
atmosphere a kind of a soup Waterworld
kind of atmosphere a rocky planet with a
water vapor rich or carbon dioxide rich
atmosphere because the atmosphere would
have a small scale height it'll be more
compact and that will give you this sort
of a spectrum in the name correct now if
you had a atmosphere that primarily of
lighter gases like hydrogen and helium
the same amount will be bigger it'll be
less dense and then a bigger radius for
the atmosphere and then you could have
molecules at high large-scale Heights
that do absorption at different
wavelengths at particular wavelengths so
therefore you get this other much more
valuable spectrum NPD's a planet that
primarily made of light gases with a mix
of same attain for example will give you
a feature over here over here so what we
did was to switch back and forth between
these two wavelengths and make
measurements simultaneously literally
flipping back and forth between two
different filters and making
measurements and we made measurement
that you can see number of different
planets
just to be sure we got to try it because
it's a very tough measurement to do from
the ground and what we found is that
indeed our measurements are much more
consistent with the scaled-down version
of Neptune now that's in some sense
disappointing if you're looking for life
for looking for habitable worlds on the
other hand I think the good news is
here's the first nearby translating
super earth and here we are using a
modest-sized ground-based telescope to
make measurements of its atmosphere I
think that's remarkable to be able to do
that sitting here on the ground with
existing instruments that were not built
for planets are in planet searches or
anything we're characterizing nearby
super earth planet atmospheres that's
pretty neat that's a lot of fun just a
few days of telescope time you get an
answer I think that boards really well
for what's coming next yes so this these
measurements are during transit so what
we effectively doing in this case
because we're basically taking this is
the model spectrum so we actually take
is flux measurements to different
wavelengths so what you're doing is
effectively measuring the radius of the
planet at two different wavelengths
right so in the wavelength where they
the absorption due to some molecule
you'll have a different radius than a
wavelength where you don't so that's
what we're measuring and that ratio is
what's telling us what that we know
scale height of the atmosphere is but
let me answer your second question with
the next slide which leads onto as you
said in the simple-minded way that I've
talked about transits so far you have a
planet in front of a star it blocked
some starlight the star gets a bit
dimmer but if you think about it a
little bit born detail which is I think
what you're asking you may have some of
the Allies actually skimming through the
outer layers of the atmosphere before
reaching us or before reaching the
Hubble Space Telescope in that case then
you could do a very interesting
differential measurement even though you
can't take a picture of the planet
separate from the star the plant is
hidden in the
of the star you could take a measurement
when the party's in front of the star
and when it's not you difference the
chill any left over the any extra
absorption must be due to whatever is in
the atmosphere of that planet so this
kind of differential measurement is
quite common in science it's
particularly common in astronomy things
we can't measure in absolute sense we
can measure in a differential sense and
that's exactly what people have been
doing so in this case by taking a
measurement of this is the first
transiting planet that was discovered
the Charbonneau and his colleagues were
able to actually see imprint of sodium
in the atmosphere of that planet in the
star spectrum so you're not separately
taking image or a spectrum of the half
the planet separate from the star what
you're seeing is the imprint of the
planet's atmosphere on the stellar
spectra by doing this differential
measurement the extra little absorption
is what we are measuring so you can push
this further and people have used the
spitzer space telescope the hubble space
telescope and even from the ground try
to detect other interesting atoms and
molecules and this claim of a detection
of water exclaims the detection of
methane and carbon monoxide yes
no what you're measuring is the light of
the star passing through the planet's
atmosphere so we call it transmission
spectroscopy not reflected light or not
yet does I make is refracted through the
atmosphere of the plan so it's coming
through rather than being reflected
right that is between us and the star
when this measurement the maid
you could so maybe my next slide will
have to explain what a kind of answer
your question okay because I'm still
talking about the primary transit when
the plant is in front of the stuff but
you're making an interesting point so
the next thing I want to get to is
exactly what you're getting at you're
one step ahead of me so if you look at
this little a cartoon movie what you see
are kind of the faces of the planet just
like this phases of the Moon and phases
of Venus in our solar system just before
and just after it comes out from behind
the star you see a full planet fully
illuminated a slide and as it comes to
the front the transit which is what I've
been talking about all this time what
you see is actually the night side
because the day side is facing the star
not us and it comes around it gets from
Crescent planet to fool planet there it
is that is what we call anyclip so the
secondary clips the one when the plant
goes behind the star and then what
you're measuring if you were able to
measure that secondary clips not the
primary transit be able to measure the
secondary eclipse again in a
differential way you measure a stoploss
planet- just the star what left should
be the emission from the planet itself
and that's exactly what we're doing now
we're getting Camino do the transits
it's easy let's try something harder
this was first achieved with the Spitzer
Space Telescope which is an infrared
sensitive telescope in space but in the
last few years a number of groups have
actually managed to do this right here
from the ground again my student Bryce
crawl and colleagues we use the with our
colleagues we use the kind of France for
y telescope now to take the best
measurements of thermal emission from
these hot Jupiters here from the ground
what we're doing is making measurements
of the secondary clips and we do it at a
number of different valent so here's our
best case where we measured at three
different filters in the near red part
of the spectrum the the little dip and
you can see there's a pretty darn good
measurements right I mean they're not
bad at all considering all the challenge
we have dealing with the Earth's own
atmosphere we've developed the
techniques to make these differential
measurements extremely precisely and
what that allows you to do is when you
see this day side that's illuminated by
the star and you take a measurement of
it as a ratio between the stellar and
the planetary flocks what you're
measuring is actually the thermal
emission from the planet another way to
put it is we're taking temperature of
the planets dayside this is a distant
planet orbiting a distant star we don't
have a picture of it separate from the
star and here we are taking its
temperature from a distance that's again
pretty neat you know we're not just
finding planets the characterizing them
we're starting to treat them as real
worlds like the wave three planets in
our own solar system can't quite Sen
spacecraft there but from a distance
we're doing a little bit of remote
sensing of what's going on in the
atmospheres so this particular planet
for which I'm showing you our data
happens to be incredibly red hot that's
about 3,000 Kelvin in the dayside it's
an incredibly hot atmosphere now for
some of the planets it's interesting at
roughly the same distance from the star
some of them have a big difference
between the day and the night side
temperatures some of them are roughly
the same so that's telling you because
the day side is what's getting blasted
by stellar radiation that in some cases
it's transported to the backside by
winds NE like other cases not so well so
you could either have a very big day
night contrast or you could have a
pretty well circulated a planet planet
with good circulation of heat all around
it yes yeah very good question so most
of these planets that are so close that
of only a few days mean they only take a
few days to go around their star the so
close to their star we expect them all
to be tidally locked in other words just
like the moon is always showing the same
face to the earth we expect these
planets to be always the same half of it
to be facing its it stop so almost
certainly all of them are likely tightly
locked but that still means well so that
means how does the night side get any
heat only if it's transported through
the atmosphere of the planet and that
means we're really kind of probing the
atmospheres of these worlds at different
depths by taking measurements at
different wavelengths because different
wavelengths probe different depths in
the atmosphere of the plant so we can
start into
even be able to kind of make rather
crude maps of the thermal circulation of
these worlds which again I think is
really you know incredible considering
you know how reason these discoveries
are and considering how you know
primitive our technology is relative to
what we're trying to do try and do this
remote sensing of planets from such a
great distance now all this time I've
been talking about planets that we don't
have pictures of planets that we need to
do all kinds of tricks to find them and
then to characterize them and they
usually have to be in a lucky situation
for example court in transit for us to
play some of these tricks now the reason
for that is of course because planets
are so faint compared to the stars that
they orbit so here's just a logarithmic
plot on this side showing you a
different wavelengths different parts of
the spectrum how right how much brighter
the Sun is compared to three planets in
our own solar system so this is the
visible part of the spectrum where we
are eyes are sensitive and you can see
the Sun is several hundred million times
brighter than even Jupiter several
hundred million times brighter than
Jupiter okay if you go into the infrared
to the longer wavelengths it's a little
bit better because the Sun gets dimmer
and plants get a little brighter because
there's so much cooler than the star
still not enough it's pretty down
challenging I say it's a little bit like
trying to see little embers against a
bright searchlight from a distance the
little embers will be all hidden in the
glare of the bright searchlight you
would not see them so that's the
challenge that we're facing when you try
to take pictures of planets orbiting
other stars and yet we did it three
years ago here's a star that's roughly
the mass of the Sun and they're over at
the top left is a little dot and that
little dot we could take a separate
because they separate this is a real
picture is a star he is a companion we
were actually able to take spectra of
the star and the planet separately and
show he has a spectrum of the star
pretty boring and he is a spectrum in
the black of the planet and he come
a bunch of different things but this
shape is due to water molecules for
example absorbing in the atmosphere of
that world and the presence of those
molecules the presence of those
absorption features tell us the
temperature of the atmosphere of that
world and that's way too cold to be a
star so that's how we knew that this is
not just a chance alignment of a distant
background star that looks faint just
because it's much further away next to a
more nearby star so it's not a chance
alignment it indeed is a cool object
that this was right next to stop so what
helped us I told you all this time how
hard it is to take a picture well here
we did it how did we do it a number of
things helped one we targeted young
stars with young Clanton's and the
secret there is when planets are young
specially gas giants like Jupiter are
young they're still contracting they're
still shrinking in size and therefore
the converting gravitational energy into
heat that means they don't just depend
on you know reflecting sunlight for us
to be able to see them but they actually
emit their own heat they're harder and
they have their own emission not just
the reflected light from the star that
makes them much brighter than they would
be otherwise so when old jupiter like
ours will be several hundred million
times fainter than the Sun in the
optical a planet like this is only ten
thousand two hundred thousand times
fainter than its star at a young age of
just a few million years that may not
seem like much but it's enough for us to
make this detection another thing that
helped this planet is pretty massive
it's about eight times the mass of
Jupiter but because of the way the the
equation of state is it's not much
bigger than jupiter surprisingly about
it's bigger because it's young but it'll
actually become roughly the radius of
jupiter over time because it's a
degenerate object now the its massive so
in young and hot but the other thing is
also it's pretty far away from its star
compared to the planets in our solar
system this planet is at least 11 times
further away from its star than neptune
is in our solar system so it's way out
there we don't quite know how it got
there it might have been hurled out
there by planet planet interactions or
it may have formed very differently
from the planets we thought formed in a
protoplanetary disk like in our solar
system yes Oh being far away from the
star helps us because yes so this was
not found by either of those methods
this was found by direct imaging this is
a completely new different technique you
actually search by doing imaging of
young stars looking for companions so
indeed you're right so this direct
imaging is much more sensitive to start
planet further away which is quite
complementary to transit and mobile
methods which are much more sensitive
plants closer in right so if you want to
know the whole plant population you need
all the techniques and so it's further
away and the fourth thing that helped is
a technology called adaptive optics some
of you may have heard of this basically
what you have is a secondary mirror
inside your instrument that changes
shape many times a second because all
these actuators on the back so it's a
feedback loop that measures the
distortion due to the Earth's atmosphere
corrects for it by changing the shape of
the mirror in real time and that allows
us to take much sharper images from the
ground then we could otherwise so
without actually going into space from a
ground-based telescope like Jamie 9
which is what we used for this one and
eight meter telescope in Hawaii we could
take this very sharp picture which
allows you to concentrate the Starlight
as much as possible so you can see faint
dots next to it so in other words you're
basically taking the twinkle out of the
stars ok sounds kind of vino dollar none
poetic but it really helps us get
sharper pictures of the stars and
therefore be able to see their
companions yes
exactly so well both in the sense that
it hasn't had time to cool down but it's
also still producing heat by contraction
so not by nuclear reactions just
gravitational energy being converted to
heat okay so that's why it's so hard so
over time it will cool down it'll just
take a long time to cool down or what
you know to what we're used to so I'll
show you in a sec I'll show you in a
second before that we made a tabloid in
Sweden that's when you know you made it
in life right any scientists can get
written up in the new appliance come on
and and an intruder Boyd fashion they
you know hyped it as an earthlike world
which I hope by now you get that it most
certainly is not in every possible way
you can think of its not hurt like and
think one thing we didn't have I thought
you'll change me on that hike at I
didn't see you one thing that we didn't
have at the time when we announced this
in September of 2008 was actually proof
that the two of these two objects are
moving together on the sky the star and
the companion okay we showed we had a
spectrum so we could tell the companion
was cool and therefore not just a
background star but still you know there
was a tiny little bit of a if you want
to seal the deal you want to really show
that to physically bound to each other
that's what we've done over the last
couple of years we've taken observations
that show these companion is indeed
bound and not a background of that
happens to be in the same line of sight
so now we have sealed the deals that
they have a lot to do with each other
they physically bound they seem to be
moving together on the sky because the
plant is so far away from the star it
takes a while before we can see orbital
motion not as long as you might think i
think in we estimated in close less than
a decade you should see a little bit of
the Ark of the orbital motion okay it
time goes quickly it's already been
three years give us three or four more
years and we will actually show you its
orbiting right that's pretty neat but
anyway so that's that's where it is and
you go answer your question geez you
guys anticipate all my slides this is
wonderful we don't officially have a
real definition of a planet cut off at
the high end we had the debate about the
low end which is what i started this
talk with about Pluto where to draw the
line we don't officially have a line
drawn at the high end the working
definition the International Union has
is that it's less than the mass of
deuterium burning which is about 13
jupiter masses so 88 Jupiter masses it
meets that and it says doesn't matter
how you form the companion as long as
it's that math and it orbits a star you
call it a planet so this is a planet by
that definition oh it definitely has
because it's incredibly massive it would
have cleared out its surrounding oh yeah
yeah it was my question oh I see whether
it has had enough time yeah ezek you
know being so far away possibly oh yeah
yeah I mean the more massive it is there
and there's less dust out there than
this closer in the density of four disc
is less yeah that's not a huge issue now
what's interesting is just within a
couple of months of our announcement in
September 2008 three other groups
announced direct pictures of planets the
one that got the most press was this one
it's a thoughtful formal out with its
dust ring left over the star has been
subtracted out that's why it's stuck in
the middle but what astronomers were
able to see because in 2006 but this was
this little dot and it looked like it
was moving in a way that it could be in
orbit around that star and it's embedded
in this dust ring kind of like the
Kuiper belt in our solar system is sort
of encircling the planet it made a nice
story I'm going to get in trouble
because this is going to be on video I
am more skeptical of that one of the
ones that have been announced so far it
got a lot of class because it was a NASA
press conference it was a hubble
discovered brief but the challenge is
that you know three years later there
hasn't been a paper that's shown you
know detected it again recovered it
again I just had email exchange with the
colors who was involved in this
discovery they have found another speck
like that in more recent data from LA
September they haven't been able to
quite
how weather moving in the right way to
be identified with the previous tax seen
in previous a box so there's a little
bit of uncertainty and I am willing to
bet I'm not going to go into all the
technical details I am willing to bet
they actually have not detected any
light coming directly from a planet in
that case and that's the centum that's
going to get me in trouble they may have
you know they may have detected
reflected light from a cloud of dust
something to do with the protoplanet but
i don't think the light is coming
straight from a planet in that
particular case okay and a number of
observations in the infrared from the
ground have not detected it there are
limits and that really aren't consistent
with the original play what's
interesting are much more secure are the
one up one of them is the one up there
those two dots are actually the same
planet it's embedded in a disk seen
edge-on it's a famous taco beta Pictoris
the first one around which astronomers
were able to see a dust disk because it
happened to be a John and those two dots
are the same object seen on one side of
the star and five years later on the
other side of the star as if it has
indeed been orbiting that star so that's
pretty secure that there's a real object
there it's pretty massive about eight
times the mass of Jupiter gained much
closer in than the one I talked about
before that you can actually see a full
orbit in a less than a decade okay so
that's pretty neat the one that I think
is the most spectacular is this one it's
a star with a three planets system all
three of them seen in this one image so
it's a family portrait of another
planetary system you know very nice and
no a couple of years because this tie is
nearer to us and because the plants are
a little bit closer in still pretty far
by solar system standards but much
closer in than the one I talked about
before you could actually see little
arcs of the orbital motion just in a
couple of years and they did so this is
led by Christian marwa who's now at the
Hertzberg institute in Victoria and his
colleagues to really neat again using
adaptive optics on Gemini and keck
telescopes in Hawaii so when my former
postdoc at the time David lafreniere was
involved in that discovery and he
decided why don't I take a look at the
publicly available Hubble image archive
and see if I can find any of these
planets because they happen to be an
image of that star taken by Hubble 10
years earlier in 1998 with a little bit
of fancy processing out for the outer
most of those three directly image
planets in that system so all this time
I was trying to convince you astronomers
are so clever we do this incredibly
precise measurements here we you know
could have had our first directly image
planets 10 years earlier had we been a
little cleverer and working harder of
course I'm making the story a little
simple it's easier to find things when
you know where they are where to look
it's a lot simpler button also the image
processing techniques have made
significant advances since then so
that's why he was able to recover it
what's cool about it is that all of a
sudden now instead of a two-year arc you
have a ten-year arc for the orbit of
this planet you'll have to wait 10 years
to get it you have it from 10 years ago
so it's really neat we could constrain
the orbit better what's even more
incredible is that Christian marwa and
his colleagues found a fourth planet in
a fourth planet in that system just last
December they announced this so here the
far with the four planets all directly
imaged all seem to seem to be orbiting
that star and they're all pretty massive
these are between about seven and eleven
times the mass of Jupiter each of them
now this system because there are four
of them and because we can see the
orbital motion is very consistent with
all for being in the same plane the
orbits of all four seem to be in the
same plane that's highly suggestive that
they formed out of a disk of dust and
gas which is how we think our solar
system planets formed but again nobody
would have predicted such hefty planets
to form out of a Duff disk that's
typically seen in round other young
stars well that's a good question so
this guy is a bit more massive than the
Sun so the more massive stars may have
more massive disks and this may also be
the unusually you know heavy end of the
spectrum right you may have a range of
planetary systems or protoplanetary
disks and this might have been at the
high end of the mass for protoplanetary
disks so that's possible but it's still
really
intriguing that such massive planets can
form and survive in the same plane in
obits well it's certainly much closer in
than any of these planets right these
are still tens of astronomical units
away from the star so what's exciting
what I was very busy with all this month
in addition to the book tour was putting
together a proposal to compete to get
time on an upcoming instrument at the
Gemini South telescope what this is is
both the German I thought cope and the
European Very Large Telescope which is
in Chile as well they're both getting
the next generation adaptive optics
instruments so these instead of having
dozens of actuators in the back of the
secondary mirror will have thousands so
the correction will be a lot better and
that means we can get much sharper
images and achieve much higher contrast
between the star and companions by also
suppressing the light with the corona
graphic spot for example suppressing the
star itself so you can see something
paint next to it so number of teams are
competing for this you know I put
together team of 22 scientists from all
the Gemini partner countries and we
wrote a proposal we know a number of
other teams are going to do the same so
there'll be competition to decide which
one or two teams get many many nights on
the neck on this instrument for the next
three years to be able to do a survey of
nearby stars looking for planetary
systems so instead of showing you
pictures of just three or four or five
planets in a couple of years or three
years I hope to be able to show you
dozens of family portraits of other
planetary systems I mean that's the pace
of discovery it's a fast-moving field
where you go from you know that glimpse
of the most massive systems to hopefully
being able to observe take pictures of
and take spectra of dozens of planetary
system in the next few years a little
bit further down the road is the
successor to Hubble the James Webb Space
Telescope a six and a half meter mirror
telescope to be launched into space been
delayed again a little bit budget
problems they may not be even till 2018
that it gets launched but one of the
goals of this mission is indeed
planet-hunting not so much time hunting
but plant characterization one if we
imaging that
simulation of what that three planet
system before we knew about the fourth
one would look like in a simulation for
the James Webb Space Telescope but it
will also have spectrographs that we can
take spectra transmission spectra of
planets in transit and it will be very
easy to do that plan that a big like
Jupiter still pretty damn hard this is
quite a crappy signal to noise spectra
that you get for Earth super earth-sized
planets that's still pretty challenging
so while the page you know it's been
incredible progress the next step of
actually looking for bio signatures
having a chance of detecting them things
like oxygen methane ozone carbon
monoxide in the atmosphere of a
relatively small likely rocky super
earth is going to be still quite
challenging okay that may really take a
whole another step it may take the
building of the next generation of
ground-based instruments with 20 30
meter mirrors or it next you know or a
dedicated space mission with a much
smaller mirror but targeted for that
particular purpose so in order to find
biosignatures around a nearby transiting
planet that's Rocky that's relatively
small we have to be exceptionally lucky
to do that with even with James Webb it
has to be a planet around one of the
nearest nearest red dwarfs court in
transit for us to even have a chance of
doing it and even then it would take
many many many many hours of observation
continuously with the star scope to get
enough signal to noise so that's going
to be pretty tough but you know as it
has been happening happening in this
field over and over again presumably
there'll be a lot of interesting
technological developments there'll be
enough interest and political will and
financial resources to invest in it
because of the discoveries that Kepler
is making that discoveries that are
being made from the ground there's a lot
of Public Interest there's a lot of you
know people see it as being so close to
answering a big age-old question that
there may be enough impetus to get there
just to remind you at the end the pace
of discovery that we've seen so far and
this is until last year this is before
the Kepler discoveries tarling in the
mid-1990s let's look at how many have
been discovered beyond our solar system
every year it's a rapidly rising
arc and just last year before Kepler
over 100 planets were found in one ear
alone so finding extrasolar planets sees
no longer news you read about them you
know every other week in the in the
paper but finding unusual planets
exploring the full parameter space just
understanding the full diversity of
worlds out there and the full diversity
of architectures of plant the systems
out there is really an ongoing process
it's very exciting I quote another
astronomy in the book saying it really
has this feeling of being in the wild
west where the discoveries are being
made left right and center there's a you
know people from all walks of life are
playing a role in it I tell a charming
story of a housewife in New Zealand that
played a crucial role in discovering
planets with a yet another technique
called microlensing and at the time she
didn't even know what microlensing was
she learned about it off to the fact but
this cleaner and I already gave you some
glimpse of what my own graduate student
is doing there's quite a range of people
that have come into this game and it's
sort of a flourishing time it's a very
exciting time literally on a weekly
basis there's interesting developments
so I'll end there and sort of tell you
that it really feels like being part of
an unfolding revolution in understanding
our place in the universe and I sort of
thinking in some ways it's not much of
an exaggeration to say it's a little bit
like when Galileo first turned his
telescope to the heavens in particular
when he could see the four moons of
Jupiter orbiting it and show people look
not everything in the universe is
revolving around the earth there was
here the evidence it's not just a theory
here's the evidence you can see these
move you can plot their positions you
know and show that these moons are
indeed orbiting that planet and I think
in some sense we kind of you know
completing that Copernican revolution by
really understanding that all solar
system our planetary system is just one
among so many and there's such a huge
range of diversity of systems out there
and in some level we've come we've come
far we've really in the last 20 years
made incredible progress we still don't
have the answer to the big question well
one of the answers will come with Kepler
we will know how common roughly
earth-sized planets are yet the big
question of you know are we alone
is there other life that's still a
little ways to go and even if we detect
bio signatures in the atmosphere of one
of these walls that still doesn't tell
you whether it's slime 0 civilization
right and that might make a difference
to most people even though I think once
you have life independently originating
in two places then that definitely
raises the question of why not a billion
other places so I'll end with that thank
you very much yes 20 billion seems
awfully low how many do you want yeah so
the latest number that i have seen that
I talked to Kepler people about is what
they can say is at least forty percent
of the stars have planets in that field
forty percent that's a lot so and that's
a minimum right that's that's only
within the planets within about 50 day
periods that's just inside that yeah
exactly is a German collection for the
geometric
very low none that we know so the scales
are so different between an individual
planetary system and what's going on in
the galaxy a pretty much decoupled yeah
I mean they're basically making a
geometric collection and a collection
for some limits in the data processing
up to this point but also the period of
observing right so you can't catch a
planet dinner you know one year obit yet
so they're just that why it's very much
a minimum but to me that's still a
pretty large minimum forty percent and
the other number that comes to play is
that when you know I mean for my thesis
I used to work on protoplanetary discs
and a number that comes out of that is
that you know almost every star is born
with the stuff to make planets you know
some ninety percent of stars at a
million years have protoplanetary discs
now whether they all make Pleasant or
not we don't know that's why we have
Kepler but they at least have the
potential right they have the stuff to
make planets so it really is likely to
be a pretty large number and the other
thing is you know I hope you got some
glimpse of you know how prolific nature
is in producing planets from the
glimpses we have that's not definitely
statistics but it really seems there's
some very rich systems yes yeah well
it's signs you don't know till you know
right i mean a good question i can't
remember that i can't remember that
fraction how many of the ones they've
seen a multiple systems i can't remember
that sorry but I mean usually the
multiple cloud systems are pretty common
I mean it from the ground based service
you know at least a third tend to be
multiple and if you can make one usually
you can make more and these all have you
know selection effects you're still only
finding from the ground base surveys the
big ones so there's plenty of chances
that there are smaller ones we can't see
yet yes yeah
you
not for the same not for detection
reasons because the bigger the planet is
the bigger the dip in brightness of the
star during a transit there's really no
reason not to be able to find them now
there's could be confusion at that and
you could have for example more false
positives there because for example
while the false positives that can
happen is that you can have a binary
star system and then the third one that
happens to be in the same line of sight
order with the third companion that's
further away and that one could have
like a grazing eclipse so your depth
isn't very large of the eclipse but
that's because only 1% of it gets
covered it's a grazing eclipse not a
full-on eclipse usually you can tell
that with just a star in a style you
could tell that from the shape of the
dip but when you have this sort of
complicated triple system sort of thing
you can can sometimes get full so maybe
you know those things that look like
they had radii much bigger than jupiter
they actually quite puzzling if they're
real planets because of the way the
equation of state works for anything
like Jupiter or bigger the radii i tend
to be roughly the same for a whole range
of glasses you know even old brown dwarf
is roughly the size of Jupiter even
though it's more massive you know so
those are actually kind of puzzling so
you could have more false positives
there I don't think you're going to have
detection sort of selection effects are
strongly at that end yes question in the
back yet
hmm
haha you putting me on the spot well for
some very particular projects it is
quite effective right so even even in
the I'll just give you an example from
extrasolar planet world so there are
planets that are discovered through the
wobble method and for each of them you
can calculate given what you know about
the orbit what chance they is that it
might even be actually be transiting and
there's Greg Laughlin who's a professor
at UC Santa Cruz who sort of Marshall
the number of amateur astronomers around
the world to you know because you can
predict if there's translate when it
would be get these people to go out and
observe even with pretty small
telescopes and and and and find them now
in terms of I think you're talking about
even sort of large numbers of people
working with data online for very
specific well-designed projects it's
quite useful right so we don't have to
have armies of credit students looking
through lots and lots of images it is
useful I think it depends a lot on the
design it depends on having a particular
cat you know it I don't think it works
for every kind of science it works for
certain particular questions that
involve massive sets of data we're a
pair of eyes can do better than most
algorithms still so that's where I think
it's most effective okay thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
