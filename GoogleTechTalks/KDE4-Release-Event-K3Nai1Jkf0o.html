was flown out here for free courtesy of
the KDE V which I cannot thank enough
for that because it's absolutely amazing
to be here and meet all you guys and
just listen to the discussions and
everything going on and yeah of course I
need to thank Google too because they're
paying for my hotel and of course we're
hosting us you've been great and yeah
that's about what I wanted to say it's
just a big thank you for everything and
I'm not the only winner here it's also
Kyle Cunningham and he's apparently
going to show something on his laptop to
which I want an Irial if I were a
religious man KDE would be the pantheon
of the gods a Pantheon in which the
sweet sounds from amarok would seem
sweetly to the other divine presences
while plasma gleefully floated about
it's not that Katie's perfect but i
think that the spirit behind katy may be
perfect and it's that spirit which
drives all the developers artists
documentaries and other contributors to
work on it daily it's something that's
truly amazing to witness
so as you already know my name is Kyle
Cunningham I'm a student at the
University of Minnesota and I'm majoring
in computer science and computer
engineering i'm also an open source
developer this summer i participate in
the google Summer of Code and I work on
Drupal and I'm doing some features that
will hopefully appear in Drupal 7 um so
you may ask yourself why I'm up here
talking to you after all I am just a
student you've heard much more important
people than me talk earlier today but i
think i have a couple things to share
and i've really come here for the
knowledge that the KDE community has
you're obviously all good developers i'm
using KDE 4 right now and i want to be a
KD developer myself so I've come to
learn from you all and I've also come of
course for the rest of the community I
mean using software can be impersonal we
don't really see anyone behind it um and
so it's nice to be able to put all these
faces on the software that we use daily
and you know what all you people come
from very diverse backgrounds we are a
very large community and to see all
those facets that make up you know what
is the KDE gem is really amazing but you
know I suppose there's something a
little more and that's you know I just
wanted to say about Katie four point oh
it's pretty awesome it has some rough
edges but I use it now I enjoy using it
and it grows on me every day and you
know it's clear that it's really only
the beginning I can see that it's going
to go great places but you know even
more so there's something I just really
really want to say you know and that's
making software is really hard as a
student I've already found this out and
even huge companies have trouble making
a good piece of software or even
releasing it on time
but you know making good open source
software can be more difficult even
because it's pretty thankless sometimes
there isn't you know all that much
reward in it but yet so many people do
it because they enjoy it and because
they're passionate about it and so if I
could get all of the KT contributors to
stand up please and and so to all you
people there's just one thing I want to
say and that is thank you all very very
much you guys have all done an amazing
job and you have a lot of obstacles in
your way and despite all that you know
you've still done amazing work and so
thank you very much and on that note to
all UK d contributors you should come
talk to me I've already talked to many
of you and if you come talk to me I
would be happy to buy you a beer and so
lastly I just wanted to say good luck
i'm looking forward to 4.1 and i think
even beyond that it's going to be even
better so thank you all again and thank
you very much for having me here have a
good release event Yale
Odin and and Kyle are the most
enthusiastic que te users on the planet
if you know this the Scandinavian
mentality he is beside himself maybe we
maybe we can take a couple of questions
for the guys yeah as a fellow Swede it
was also very shy I'd like to ask aaron
to actually describe his daily work it's
quite amazing how it uses Katie and now
uses computers in his work well actually
I can't run it at the cafe because yeah
i forgot to say i run a little book cafe
in my hometown and so i can't really use
it there because and that's what one
thing i would like to do is make a
little shameless call for help if
someone is interested in writing like
the most simple suit of administrative
programs like bookkeeping point-of-sale
billing stuff like that because that's
one thing that really misses that kitty
really misses then please come to me and
i'll be glad to help to the best of my
abilities but apart from that i use
caddy at home like I can't really use it
at work but I'm hoping to be able to and
yeah yes
Oh Troy
okay i have anding that there is some
offer for coffee or something to katie
developers and of course of course in
that come visit your bookstore totally
totally so as much coffee as you want
just come to Sweden but it's pretty far
and you don't want to go there now I
really want to thank thank you for
flying out here like right now because
right now my home country is like a hell
of dark cold so thank you for giving me
some Sun well hidden question arm Kyle
this is some advice rather than a
question you say just a student I say
future of the free software community
and you shouldn't forget it yeah thank
you anyone else otherwise we will thank
the two guys for being here thank you
for joining us thank you and thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
