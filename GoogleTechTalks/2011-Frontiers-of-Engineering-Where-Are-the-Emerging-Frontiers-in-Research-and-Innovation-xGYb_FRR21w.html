the National Science Foundation is going
to tell us about his emerging areas in
the research frontiers I'm sure you'll
get the name right I did but please good
morning ladies and gentlemen it's a
pleasure to be here with you again this
year I'm going to tell you a little bit
about the activities of office of
emerging frontiers in research and
innovation so the challenge that that we
have been given is to find out what are
the emerging frontiers in research and
innovation here's a one slight
description of every it was established
in 2006 as an office to invest in
important emerging areas so the mission
is very very simple actually important
emerging areas in a timely manner so
it's a those are the kinds of things and
then you know are the most difficult to
do when the world the wards are a few so
we set up a process to look for
transformative ideas ideas that deal
with a national need or grin challenge
and one of the things that we looked at
was what kind of what kind of a project
are we looking for what are the needs of
the community and what are the what are
the gaps if you like so notice that
there are NSF is run NSF's mission which
is advancing discovery education and
innovation most of the projects as you
know are what we call single pie or two
to pee I projects roughly
around a hundred thousand dollar a year
for three years these are the typical
bread-and-butter projects of NSF and
then we have centers engineering
research centers which are fantastic
interdisciplinary activities for
research education and technology
transfer so there was a gap in between
having small groups of people coming and
pushing new ideas and focusing only on
research so that was one of one of the
first thing we we determined that that's
the kind of project we want to focus on
then we looked at higher higher risk and
higher reward projects so another option
was to go completely unsolicited which
we still can we haven't tried it we are
we consulted advisory committee twice a
year whether or not to go that route and
they haven't told us to do that yet so
we took an alternative route of
identifying topic areas topic areas that
are that are emerging and important
first we started doing this activity
within NSF within the engineering
Directorate we have about 60 to 70 PhDs
they're all very well aware of the topic
areas each of each one of them deals
with a portfolio of 100 250 projects so
they know communities about forty
percent of the folks are professors such
as yourself who a little bit more
advanced in their career who rotate in
and out of NSF and bring in ideas so
there's lots of great ideas so we
experimented with exploring topic areas
important topic areas within on the
floor itself and then after a couple of
years we realized that the process works
and we open it up to the community so we
have been receiving ideas one pagers we
put out it dear colleague letter we
asked the community to send us their
ideas what they think is an emerging
topics and that's the catch here is to
look
topics that are not explore exploratory
but there are more emerging that is
there is a burgeoning community that's
coming out for which there is no program
at NSF so that's really the gap we're
trying to to fill so it's like a
prototype program if you like and these
are the list of topics that that we have
looked at since 2007 autonomously
reconfigurable injured system cellular
biomolecular engineering cognitive
optimization resilient and sustainable
infrastructures biosensing and bio
actuation hydrocarbon from biomass
science in engineering and environmental
design engineering sustainable buildings
which is one of your topics this year
renewable energy storage engineering
multicellular and inter Kingdom
signaling which is was be just need
award eight awards in that direction the
awards will be announced later this week
mind and machine my machine and motor
control and three see these are these
are the topics that we've done through
2011 and we've just opened up a
competition for 2012 with with three
topic areas and I'll tell you what they
are in a minute so the community puts in
their idea for last year for example we
received about 121 pagers from the
community and furthermore we engaged
experts from the community in sifting
through these ideas brought in venture
capitals experts from other countries
extras from government more experts from
that are not involved with any of these
projects from some of the universities
in the US so we brought them in and we
engage the program directors themselves
on the floor so we went through a pretty
elaborate process in order to identify
what the important topics are a lot of
these ideas are great ideas so so we
continue to seek your input for those
ideas the next opportunity for input is
going to be 2000
14 4 2014 4 for two thousand twelve and
thirteen we have already completed the
cycle of topic selection so I've already
told you the criteria we are looking for
an interdisciplinary as is an important
criteria for this program as well we
also juxtapose these projects with
respect to n a grand grand challenges
and as you can see great majority of
them deal with with many of the grand
challenges identified by the National
Academy of Engineering we have a few
ideas in the bottom right that go beyond
those grand challenges deal with other
other ideas for instance and what I've
labeled green which are the topics for
instance seed and restore seed is the
topic for you today and our are in those
arena but we also have hydrocarbon from
biomass which is the idea of alternative
energy or the topics for this year I'll
tell you in a minute photosynthetic
biorefineries or this one multicellular
inter Kingdom signaling has impact on on
better medicine but though has an impact
on biotechnology and an energy for
instance one project in mix that we
funded this year on entertain them
signaling is to take advantage of
termites understanding the organisms in
termite gut and manipulating those so
that you can you use those two to break
down lignocellulose in the in the
photosynthetic process and so in the
photosynthetic refinery process so
that's one of to get to give you an idea
what what what ideas it opened when we
went to the direction of inter kingdom
signaling which is a well understood
well study top
in biology but engineers are just
getting into it so we brought biologists
and engineers to work on those for seed
you're going to hear quite a bit about
that our idea was to bring architects
and engineers together and social and
behavioral scientists and really
addressing portant issues on sustainable
buildings defunded those last year so
for the topics that that deed will we
deal with today I mean this year the
three topics flexible by electronic
systems for medical applications or
bioflex origami design for integration
of self-assembly systems for engineering
innovation or odyssey and photosynthetic
biorefineries PSP are are the three
topics we picked for this year yeah we
partner for with Air Force Office of
Scientific Research as well as other
directorates of NSF in this activity
information important information
regarding regarding these we will have a
webcast in two days actually you can go
to the a free website and sign up for it
if you have the time it's going to be
three in the afternoon eastern time and
the end of September's letters of intent
required letters of intent if you have
an idea and one if you want to submit a
pre proposals and pre proposals are due
november nine and four proposals will be
invited for at the end of March so these
are the important dates I wanted to also
make a remark about the kinds of project
you did this we did a study extensive
study of assessment of the every
processes last year and externally and
one of the things we have them do is
look at the interdisciplinarity of the
of the of the projects they looked at
both transformative
potentially transformative nature of the
projects and interdisciplinarity of the
project and what they found so that you
it's sort of it's a clue for you the
kinds of projects that were successful
is in the next slide everyone is
familiar with the global map of science
anyone doesn't know doesn't know this so
this is just at one way they have
organized different fields of science
and engineering in this in this visual
way so they what they did was they
looked at this is for biosensing and by
a actuation project but it was more or
less true for most of the projects so
what you see there on the top row is the
lead p eyes focus area where where his
or her publications were so you can see
for instance oops you can see for
instance it's dominated in this area the
other one is dominated in these area and
so you can see the get an idea there's a
33 of the projects and you're not
identify which ones they are and then
will they also examine the proposals
that came and if you look at this for
instance the bi even though his or her
expertise was in this area you can
barely see it here so what they did was
they went they partnered with three or
four other experts and they wrote a
fantastic proposal that was funded they
did not focus necessarily on their own
research area they focused on the
project and that's a very important
lesson what is it that you want to
accomplish what is it that is important
that needs to accomplish rather than
saying what can I do what doesn't what
is it what is needed to be done you
figure that out and then you assemble
your team and you make a successful
proposal that's how successful
interdisciplinary proposals in F we look
like so that's that was a method that
was the little message that that that I
that I got from
from this examination and I stop right
here a couple of minutes for question or
we can stop and give you back some time
it's refreshing to hear somebody
emphasize this theme of choosing the
problem rather than being sort of a
solution looking for a problem which is
all too common these days we we sort of
over specialized and get good at
something and then become sort of a
round peg trying to ram in a square hole
whenever we see a proposal call and it's
it's something that's really problematic
I would generalize the theme a little
further and I would say this in certain
areas like energy where the problems are
so challenging you know look witness how
little progress has been made since 1973
the oil shock of 73 in terms of real
progress and game-changing technologies
what that tells you is it's not that
there's a lack of ideas around it's that
there's a lack of really good ideas
around exactly and you never know where
especially in something that's highly
interdisciplinary where those ideas may
come up and so I would say beware of
being overly prescriptive of setting up
kind of a topic du jour type of thing
where if somebody comes up with a great
innovation they're going to get a
response well that doesn't fit into this
year's solicitation very very
problematic and it's hard to run a
program like that because people would
say well you need focus but it's
important to remember focus in it of
itself is not an end yeah that that's
you know they're there are two counts so
we hear both your your idea and we also
hear ideas from others that if be
completely make this unsolicited then
you're going to get 2,000 proposals and
the funding rick is going to be so bad
that people are going to be very
disappointed so that that's why we we
sort of this top top topically drew
brought topically driven path was chosen
so that we say okay we're going to take
a risk and do it in these two three
topics and and and see what happens but
NSF has other opportunities as well for
for what what you're what you're
pointing out for exploratory ideas you
can always submit what is called eager
proposal its exploratory grand for
something something eh ER I can't even
and then we are about you're going to in
the next few weeks you're going to hear
something about that the director Suresh
has come up come up with a called
inspire interdisciplinary support for
interdisciplinary research and education
and you're going to get opportunity to
submit proposals for up to a million
dollar for exactly the kinds of ideas
that you just mentioned and so you and
and these are so the details of that is
going to be in the Dear Colleague letter
so I cannot tell you too much about it I
can tell you that there is such a
activity because it's in the 2012 budget
he has disclosed so I can tell you that
there is going to be a a program so in a
few weeks you're going to get a Dear
Colleague letter that's going to open up
opportunities for those kinds of ideas
that you mentioned but I do appreciate
your your find some sometimes be right
now okay we want these elements to be
included in your proposal that's a way
of us narrowing down a little bit the
number of proposals that come in that
may limit sometimes it may limit some
some good ideas but we have also
violated that people have submitted it
and it was a great idea the palace is
great and we've gone ahead with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
