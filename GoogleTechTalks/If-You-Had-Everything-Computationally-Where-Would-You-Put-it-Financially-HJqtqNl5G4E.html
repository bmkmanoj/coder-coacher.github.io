him about if you had everything
computationally where would you put it
financially if I met David this winter
at the mana tech conference where he
gave a talk which will enjoy it and so
we work together to bring him here to
google to tell you all about his topics
M his the hash hello in finance at the
School of Business at UC Berkeley and
just started a new center for innovative
financial technology and where he
especially focuses on how to extract the
tradable information from the web which
is something we were basically
interesting for us it could be two and
before that he traded himself on several
managed several portfolios and busy he
started out with degree in physics and
computer science from MIT and there was
one of the first people on the internet
so he's really been busy with that part
of that they saw several since the
beginning so David language it's it's
great to be here and I think we we
started talking about this about two
years ago I was on a conference with
Peter Weinberger but Wolfgang really
really put it together and my Berkeley
colleague how very and who maybe we
can't see the guys in the silica in the
Silicon Valley side of the room anymore
also it was instrumental in in doing
this the talk is called if you had
everything computationally financially
this is really the first first one that
I'm doing is the head of the center at
Berkeley just to give a little bit of
background about why am I here I did I
did start out at MIT and then I got a
graduate degree at
at the school up the road Harvard that
wanted to merge with MIT in the 30s and
call the combination Harvard later I
found that a HUD a company called IAC
that later became itg that the quantex
product at an early algorithmic trading
system I didn't want to move back to New
York my wife is a Southern California
girl and once the once wanted to stay
there so I went to work for a quant
manager called first quadrant where I
became the managing director for
equities I ran six billion dollars in 27
different quantitative strategies across
six countries both long and market
neutral having sort of been bit by the
entrepreneurial bug I started a firm
called codex ax in 1999 which was an
Internet information extraction firm and
we probably should have started it in
1997 post bubble I got to be a visiting
professor at Caltech which i think is no
better than hitting the streets and have
continued to work in the area about
extracting information for for financial
purposes from the web and over the last
year started I've given a series of
lectures as a guest speaker at Berkeley
and they invited me to start a new
center there called the Center for
innovative financial technology if you
look at the Berkeley website everything
is innovative I heard a rumor they
wanted to change the name of the
operations research to the innovations
research department much to the dismay
of the operations research people the
center has a website which you were
invited to to go look at we they have
the bear the whole goal bears thing is a
little mystifying at MIT they have teams
the Beavers but you might not notice
unless you were on one of them the
account at Cal it'sit's very different
the this this slide shows
in a nutshell well against visually
speaking sort of to nutshells what the
center is about we're interested in the
activities at the intersection between
finance and technology finance and
computer science really that as the is
the technology that matters for for
finance today we have a mission
statement given to us by the Dean
conduct and facilitate innovative
research and teaching on how new
technologies impact global electronic
Marcus investment strategies and the
stability of the financial system you
can see that the research is over there
on the left the teaching on the right
that actually the students are fabulous
the students are fabulous one thing I
will do a lot of them would love to be
interns and you know at Google or other
firms here you know if you have if you
have interest we could hook you up as my
daughter says the areas of interest and
this is on the site in a sort of a
longer form for the center our web 20
for finance and investing the idea of
aggregate molecular search which we're
going to talk a lot about today using
the Semantic Web harnessing ideas from
collective intelligence in a practical
sense there's one center and I won't say
where it is that is about harnessing the
ideas of collective intelligence and
cooperative work that seems to consist
of one guy I don't think we make a lot
of progress we're trying to recruit
people you know at a number of levels
and sponsors sort of faculty affiliates
and just general kibitzers and I'll give
you instructions on how to sign up as a
as a kibitzer the lot of issues
involving wired markets algorithmic
trading quantitative plus investing I
would call it because a lot of the
information that you use is really not
quantitative a lot of this textual in
nature the idea of intelligence
amplification human interfaces that
allow people to play well with computers
and in this sort of plays to one of the
specialties at Berkeley the idea of
hardware for high-speed markets one of
my computer science colleagues Dave
Patterson who will hear invented the
risk chip says parallelization is the
wave of the future and always will be
it's been
very hard to find real applications for
parallel hardware but they are they're
building mini corps architectures and
they're very interested in sort of if
you get for if you have a serious
graphics problem you got a graphics card
if you have a serious sound problem you
get a sound card if you have a serious
market analytics problem you can't get a
market at alexs card but if you could
what would it do I guess is the way of
saying that and then there's the the
issues of Technology and market
stability the lot of people think that
technology is a destabilizing influence
and market and there are some examples
the the 87 crash was exacerbated by the
use of portfolio insurance which was
developed by the firm lor Leland O'Brien
Rubenstein ello and are are all on the
faculty at Berkeley and really don't
want to do it again or see anybody else
do it again so I think those issues are
and there's not as much you know hard
engineering in there is there and some
of the others but it's an important
topic getting to the meat of this if you
had everything computationally where
would you put it financially the the
origins of this talk come from the the
30th anniversary edition of the journal
of portfolio management which had a huge
number of papers and virtually nothing
about technology so I've written for
them over the years I called up the
editor Frank Fabozzi and I said hey
Frank what's with the technology Frank
if you know is the system is the mother
lode of the finance section of the
bookstore it's like Fabozzi and
everybody else he gets there not by
writing politically by suckering other
people into writing prolifically so he
did what he does so well and suckered me
into writing one the summary of that
article was sort of to look back at the
greatest financial technology hits
electronic market data computerized data
storage and analysis electronic
execution systems and then looking
forward in algos in intelligence
amplification visualization and in
finding alpha and textural and Internet
information just a focus today one thing
about the investment business is that
people go oh it's you
it's sort of an inch in some senses
maybe you know in these in you know
algos executing over 43 different dark
pools it is kind of a niche but in terms
of finding research or keeping track of
what's going on in the business the kind
of stuff that you would read about as
opposed to trying to process you know
high-speed data it really is kind of the
aggregate of all business the mean the
institutional investor all-america
research team consists of people who you
know specialize in industries you know
banks buildings chemicals energy
engineering consumers and they have the
same interests that the people working
at these companies would have so you can
really think of at least in in the sense
of more traditional securities analysis
as opposed to micro level market
structure issues as the investment
research industry as the union of all
other businesses this is a nice picture
this is one of my favorite graphics it
started out as the tree map for computer
science purposes that ben shneiderman
slab university of maryland but it's got
got some traction over the years at
smart money a Dow Jones company that
allows you to sort of take a view of the
market and you can you can see that you
know clearly you know this is this is
this is what business is in in the
United States and the world I'm going to
digress a little bit to give a short
history of Market Information Technology
I find it's easy especially I mean some
people are not you know deep I know some
of you guys are have been doing this
your whole lives but it's easier to
understand what's going on
technologically sometimes if you look at
something simpler um we have a Prius you
open up the hood of the Prius I have no
idea what's going on underneath there i
can barely identify the parts but if you
look at say a 57 Chevy or even you know
67 Chevy all the moving parts are
clearly identifiable so sometimes
understanding where technology came from
it makes it easier to understand in 1792
the New York Stock Exchange consisted of
a bunch of guys hanging out by the
Buttonwood tree yelling and yelling at
each other this was
market dissemination back then the first
big technological advance was in 1794
moving indoors so the market could
operate on days when it rained or was it
was cold information dissemination and
trade execution were mostly by shouting
at each other you had to show up at the
market there was no no such thing as
calling your broker the big change the
big advance was telegraphy and this
wasn't just really in the stock market I
mean telegraphy was the wonder of the
age this was the first time in human
history that you could send a message
over the horizon instantaneously this
was bigger in its day then the web is
was when it first came up and we were
kind of used to telephones we were used
to radio we used to tell it television
this was this was a fabulous thing over
here you'll notice where's my little
love yeah it's just going to point that
out the spit I don't know I mean you
know the speed of light times about 1.5
maybe they knew something we didn't know
uh there's there's a fabulous book on
this called called the Victorian
internet about the impact of the
Telegraph on society which which really
mirrors a lot of what we see happening
in in in finance the telegraphy caught
on in a huge way on Wall Street I mean
here we see a teller you know it make
you didn't have to show up at the market
in order to trade this is that this is
this a trader strap the Telegraph to his
arm lots of guys did this it was sort of
the 19th century blackberry ah you can
appreciate the the the that's the way
you use a telegraph you learn Morse code
I'll I knew Morse code when I was a Cub
Scout don't give me a quiz but the you
can appreciate the impact of of
telegraphy by a pair of before and after
photos this is the the neighborhood and
the vicinity of the New York Stock
Exchange shortly before the introduction
of telegraphy and this is what it looked
like after wires darken the sky a few
years later as Rob Algren the the author
of
as he claims the most cited least read
paper in algorithmic trading over here
points that you had to know Morse code
which a lot of people really didn't want
to do Tom Edison the ticker tape
eliminated that requirement in 1870 it's
an interesting story but I'll tell it
some other time this created in addition
to freeing you from not having to know
Morse code this also gave you a record
of crisis you could begin to study this
and this created sort of an information
explosion of its own when you see people
saving the tapes and studying them the
there were other sort of lesser
technological advances quote boards
where people would flip little signs
like those things you see at the
railroad stations and go behind and you
could so you could look up and see what
was going on the ticker tape machines
got to get bigger better and faster
people introduced telephones which had
another set of problems before the whole
console industry arose more better you
know paper you can see the little flip
sides people running around a lot of
paper it was getting pretty overwhelming
by the 60s especially when individuals
started trading stocks with all these
little hundred share orders so the
exchange got its first computer there's
the first nerd on Wall Street I guess I
mean he actually the president of the
exchange and probably didn't go any
deeper this is the only time he touched
the computer would be my guess but in in
1966 and there's a number of other talks
on the subject of what they did with it
I want to get because we have limited
time I want to get into what people are
doing doing now really and how that is
has changed things the disintermediation
of of execution is a key as a key piece
the assistant the dot handling these
these small orders the you know it's
it's come to the point where you know
people could boot their broker so you
didn't have to get on the phone and the
brokers wanted to boot the customers
as well etrade is has had a classic
series of ads with the baby spitting up
on the keyboard after he buys stocking
the latest you could probably write a
mark in history just on their ads I mean
the this disintermediation now has led
to stock exchanges themselves becoming
an endangered specie the industry
standard published a cover stock
exchanges r.i.p in 1999 I the exchanges
are still here they're changing and the
floors are much smaller a gun I
understand the industry standard isn't
but may be back as a website another
picture another pair of before-and-after
photos that give you a feel for what
happened in the markets technologically
this is the London Stock Exchange the
day before the Big Bang the introduction
of electronic trading in 1986 this is
what it looks like the day after and I
believe it's a nightclub now you know
this this has gone on now on the on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange
you'll see people using using handhelds
to the access electronic systems and
really technology repeats itself we see
we see that we see the same patterns
over over and over and over again
there's of course a lot of activity
going on in in the algo space the the
diesel let these execution systems
evolved from 100-share convenience to
really the mainstream they've taken over
the block market they've taken over
really virtually all of the execution
and US equities 95 plus percent and it's
growing rapidly in others one of the
things about technologies that the early
adopters tend to do fairly well it's a
it's a good idea to see sees it see
things coming and I think in many ways
as far as non-quantitative I mean we've
been talking about prices and executions
I you know I think that you know the
early adopters of the people may be here
and the people are going to be buying
things from you one was Fisher black
noted options maven in pioneer algo
trader inventor of the the black-scholes
model
would have won the Nobel Prize had he
lived as long as Schultz Charles's still
alive his his his line was a markets
look much more efficient from the banks
of the Charles than from the banks of
the Hudson I think after he moved from
MIT to Goldman Jim hey Jim Simons
founder Renaissance technology a
mathematician very kind of the you know
the Sphinx of quantitative finance
they're there they don't talk much about
what they do but he does show up on the
list of the most highly paid people in
the world you know taking home you know
you know 1.6 2.6 billion dollars and
it's all computerized trading David Shaw
who I met years ago when he was a
computer science professor at Columbia
it's now a Wall Street skink want the
last he he went from Columbia to morgan
stanley morgan stanley's automated
trading group the last paper he
published in finance was something about
hooking unix machines to market data
feeds then he realized what the heck am
i doing why why tell anybody else how to
do this and found it founded the firm
that bears his name he's now sort of
decided he has enough money and he does
computational bio chemistry and as his
own venture capitalist there's another
interesting firm is automatic trading
desk this did algorithmic marking making
they have they have a great website 80
desk Dave Whitcomb describes it as
playing Nasdaq like a piano Dave would
come by the way as a member of the board
of our Center and very supportive we're
really glad to have him involved then
what's next what's next we've talked
about the people who were you know sort
of getting ahead of the curve back in
the 80s the the exploitation of
quantitative information was and remains
a great success none of these guys are
flying commercial the the prices and the
and the market data convey a great deal
of information but they don't convey all
the information where to look for new
information advantages and this is a
little bit of a digression but but I
love this picture i took this in an
educational supplies store
they're these are plastic pennies which
they're selling two kids so you can
teach them how to make change 100
pennies four dollars and seventy-five
cents who buys these you know but uh but
I mean what what you know what Simon's
and you know and black and David look
for maybe not the four dollar and 75
cent bag of pennies but did you know the
dollar five bag of pennies the dollar to
bag of pennies the 98 cent bag of
pennies and you're a buyer or so and you
know you just all you got to do is get
within what it cost you to buy or sell
the pennies and then you can make some
and market making electronic market
making is sort of like that so it's not
just this funny little gag though I have
to didn't I have to admit I go in and
see if they've moved them and
occasionally they restock there's but
where does alpha come from and we've
talked a little bit about this alpha is
out performance in investment strategy
and if you were to ask a bunch of
financial economists where does alpha
come from say in the 90s you could you
could certainly or you could put
together a crowd that would say it's a
trick question there is no alpha markets
or strong form efficient it's a waste
Utah it's a waste of time don't bother
me the joke form of these comments are
the The Economist walking down the
street sees a hundred dollar bill walks
right over it as rinses why didn't you
pick up the hundred-dollar bill the
Economist says if it was real somebody
would have already picked it up ah the
the fallacy really is that somebody has
to be the first one to pick it up Andy
low who teaches up at MIT wrote a nice
essay where he sort of not only admits
to the possibility of alpha but says
that it it's the it's the economic rent
that accrues to the competitive
advantage of superior information
superior technology and financial
innovation in the Internet age there is
a lot of superior information and
superior technology to to use we are as
that as that text sage I got I got I got
Scholes I got Andy low I gotta ball i
got Dilbert
or dogbert information is gushing toward
your your brain like a fire hose and a
teacup what what is what is what does
that mean there is a fire hose of
information with potential alpha in it
other the electronic versions of
mainstream news there are
disintermediated news you can well you
can be your own reporter just like you
can be your own broker there's
electronic access to two primary sources
you get if you read what's in the paper
a lot of thing and SEC filing in a court
in court documents released today you
don't have to wait for somebody to read
that for you and then there then there
are new media create creatures of the
net whisper numbers are an example
various social websites some some more
valuable than others The Wall Street is
kind of a small concentrated place at
least physically in the internet is
fairly large which so this check this
creates a big challenge and how do you
how do you get to this stuff and it's
not just it's not all public information
the financial information is what a 25
billion dollar industry I think maybe 30
people will pay a lot for high quality
information from Reuters Thompson from
from others and I think the it's they
have the same problem there's more of it
than people know what to do with and I
think it's good for companies like
Google to who were great at taking tools
that manage a lot of information to be
able to sort of hook into a private
sources of information either either the
proprietary things that people will pay
for even or stuff that's generated
inside that you did that you don't want
to let out this is everything happens a
lot faster there's a great need for
technology to do this time isn't quite
what it used to be mean or is this sort
of mash up version of a Dali painting
the persistence of memory this is a
remarkable pair of slides that shows
that how how the web has changed the
process by which information is
impounded in prices these are from my
friend
buttman who we used to work for the dais
group now he's at thompson quantitative
this is an earnings surprises everyone
knows when a ring surprises when it when
a company does does better than it's
very these are the earnings surprises in
beta the web was around but it was guys
it's earned you know it was you know
nobody was really using it for anything
and then in the pre web period what
we've done we've got an event study of
the the strong learning positive
earnings surprises and strong negative
earnings surprises and just sort of that
the universe here and this is trading
days over here on the bottom with 20
days I mean this is people the you know
the information and then the nice thing
about an earnings surprise is they
announced it at a particular time you
know exactly when it happened and you
know if it's if it's positive it's good
news of bad news there's really no issue
of interpreting it so so it's sort of a
perfect one for you look you see over
here it's we're looking at two weeks 10
trading days I mean guys or guys are you
know taking barons home and reading it
on the porch out and Greenwich on the
weekend then coming in on monday and
well maybe we should buy a little of
this and you know across the street
somebody's were in a different page of
barons and that will maybe we should
sell a little uh and you could still you
could wait a week and still still pick
up most of the advantage now watch what
happens to these curves a post web era
amazing amazing the saints the same
information reaction time is now minutes
minutes to hours and if I made a newer
one I think we probably see these these
would just look like vertical lines the
earnings surprises are pretty simple
they're there an old form of information
what about the text frontier finding
alpha on the web in other forms I I
alluded to the democratization and
disinformation of information back in
the old days if you wanted to get news
you you had to get it from these ace
reporters like Jimmy and Lois you really
don't need them for you know for it for
Thought pieces i think that's that's the
future of reporting but for a lot of a
lot of standard type in is you can
you can really do it yourself they've
been disintermediated you know does news
move markets you know we certainly think
it does you know if you if you watch
certainly the first break of an
unexpected story will will move a market
the the mainstream vendors have have
tried to address this there were some
product announcements for algo feeds
from from Reuters and from Dow Jones
moving the technology from sort of into
the Semantic Web era you see it you see
a lot of a lot of tagging some mustard
huge apartment and acquisitions on both
companies parts little companies like
clear forests corpora Raven pack this
stuff is not cheap it's about a hundred
thousand a month this does one size for
their a lot of questions is one size fit
all really and this is get armed way a
lot rapidly there's a there's a little
low there's the Reuters one in the Dow
Jones one I think the Reuters people and
the Dow Jones people are have come up
from midtown so there you go there's I'd
like to show you some academic piece
that that talks about how how you might
use this that shows the techmount what's
under the hood essentially this is this
is again older this was reported in
Barron's in 2001 can computerized
language analysis predict the market if
the answer was no it wouldn't be in the
story the the thing was called a analyst
and what they did everybody knows no
sort of language model is basically that
the statistics of a piece of text sort
of the you know you get rid of those the
butts and everything and then you look
at the district most most frequently
occurring words next most frequently
occurring words that's a unigram model
you can look toward pick excuse me word
pairs and so on so they would estimate a
language model what they did was they
took stock prices and they do this for
about 125 stocks and they would do a
piecewise regression they would break
them into plunges flat areas and
answered oh they're sorry there's a
plunge there's a search and they would
in for the in-sample period they would
collect
the news that came that they could
harvest over the over the web preceding
the plungers or the surges so this is
they were looking for example at
Microsoft they did this in a number of
ways they would they would look at
individual stocks they would look at
sectors they would look for all stocks
and then they would look at sort of the
dual do the Bayesian thing and you know
given given a story that matches a
certain language model what happens to
the stock so they did a fairly then this
is this is one of the characteristic
things of research in this area is that
the Welkin times the computer science
people do fairly boneheaded things
financially and they and the financial
people do fairly boneheaded things in a
computer science sense this is an
example of a boneheaded financial thing
but they did a trading simulation where
when the story occurred they would match
it to the the plunge and surge language
models they ran it for 40 days on a
hundred stocks and they if they got if I
got a match on the plus side they would
go long and close out the position at
the end of the day and if they got a
match on the other side they would go
short and close out at the end of the
day ten thousand dollars on each grade
so you know they were not comparing it
to buy and hold which is the boneheaded
aspect of this and you could just be
generating a lot of trading what they
did instead it was compared to a
randomization test where when the story
occurred instead of looking at what the
model told you to do you just flipped a
coin so they they made some profits they
made a cumulative profit of twenty one
thousand dollars and the average was a
should be on the slide here was an eight
thousand dollar loss so that was a
highly significant result and you're not
going to see this kind of thing in a
mutual fund prospectus you know it's a
very odd way of reporting but that's
what they did this is another
interesting piece of research of
research
from a fellow down at UT austin i think
is now visiting an MIT tetlock he was
looking at news also and evaluating
sentiment on a one-day horizon he took a
Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones news
stories for a 20 year period and fed
them into something called the general
and Enquirer which was a fun piece of
software to play with this has been
developed over 20 years with NSF and the
Australian national research council
funding the funding the bill it was a
pl1 on IBM mainframes the language that
I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I
really know a lot about you can play
with it yourself at at the at the
website and what tetlock did it
characterizes text it's been a PhD
thesis machine there are lots of ways of
deciding lots of characteristics of
documents and when you think about this
I mean you know it's some of these are
pretty obvious I mean if you if you had
a bunch of if you wanted to build a
machine to distinguish stories about
motorcycles from stories about cooking
the language model I'm you know the the
you know the word torque is not going to
occur many recipes the word the word the
word tablespoon and brazzers is not
going to occur in many stories about
about the new do you know blazin hogs so
um and and people keep keep doing these
things I mean just think about deciding
what language something is that's pretty
easy but let me show you a little bit of
how this works this is you can go to the
website and you know type in something
and it will show you how it processes it
so I typed in this is this is I'm really
looking forward to lunch this is fun but
but getting long it it breaks it apart
it stems the words you know really
becomes real looking becomes look and so
on you know it's got all these modules
then it categorizes them and you can see
you know fun is a positive there's
they're fun there's they have you can
see all these PhD thesis I think they
start
it out with this work they started out
with just positive and negative or pause
an egg but people keep adding using
different linguistic theories fun turns
out to be a positive in many ways it's
pleasurable lunches food and so on you
know it's categorizing them in many many
different dimensions this is the top of
the thousand forty six word list unpause
ative the tetlock used to have sentiment
able abundance abundance acceptable
accommodate accomplish accord accurate
lots of good achievement no it's a good
things this is the top of negative a
little larger set 1165 words abandon
abnormal abrupt absurd accident of BS
some imagine a bisque occurring in a
business story really can't be can't be
any good affleck the flexion aggravate
aggravation pissed though i think it
gets extra points and then what he did
was he categorized the this is this is
similar in many ways to the yen was like
he categorized the stories these are the
this is the event study this is the time
of the story and these are the positive
stories and he's been AI mean you see a
you and there's actually not that much
going on and you get a little bit of
juice throw from here and this this is
when the story occurs so this is when
you could trade and you get a little bit
of juice but in fairness and I did talk
to you know you know some of this is pre
event information leakage but in
fairness a lot of this is me two stories
a lot of this would say you know the
stock went up and everybody was happy
that's a positive story a lot of stories
referring to other stories so you know
it suggests the line of research which
we actually are undertaking at Berkeley
one of the companies is giving us a lot
of data the other one I haven't asked
yet we will be so we're going to we're
going to try to see if we could if we
can shed some light on this the
distribution of annual trading returns
and again it was a little on the
boneheaded side there were no
transaction costs so is the most
frequently occurring is zero
but they are they skew positive so you
know the even with this there there's
something which is what you'd expect
from looking at those event charts you
know again he's got his his summary and
stuff you know they're there are many
forms of news you know besides these
these mainstream media stories a lot of
disintermediated news to look at that
really are the primary sources and I
think that would that would be a very
different chart the specialized industry
media the international that some of the
private news disseminated by the ricks
ml which is a research consortium and
then of course the government agencies
the SEC is the mother lode of government
information about companies you know a
company show up in or there are 12
Federal District bankruptcy courts
companies show up usually it's a bad
sign the first time they show up it
could what subsequently it could be good
or bad but they're not always there the
SEC looks at all the companies all the
time and they're they're reputable if
you if you lied to the SEC you may find
yourself doing the perp walk that was I
guess your job was to I send the guys
with the cuffs they're there they're
very deep brand it's becoming more
tractable as they've become sort of fans
of XML in the the idea of the Deep Web I
mean you type in the name of a public
company even even public company
followed by stock and you know the stuff
doesn't show up anywhere near the top of
a search engine result because it's in
the Deep Web to get to the interest in
either a thousands of items by tens of
thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of
items there are 300 different types of
SEC filings about General Electric but
you got to log in and ask for them it's
it's it's a database you have to make a
query so you need something to access
that information you don't need a
password it's you know it's public but
in but there are there are others where
you do and the SEC was really
embarrassing for a long time they hired
that that powerhouse of information
technology trw good guys to go
too if you want to buy a satellite not
so hot a place to buy software it was
really like a 1978 vintage system and I
think I think they'd they'd done saber
it was all just plain text and it was a
you know this this is this is plain old
ugly Edgar you know just a bunch of guys
typing stuff very little tagging they
didn't separate sections you had the
date you had the company name you had
the filing type you had something called
the central index key which was kind of
in lieu of symbol and that was that was
about it they I got a I got in trouble
for writing an article criticizing this
for the financial times they and they
they they even delayed it 24 hours on
the public website they would provide it
to the resellers who would kind of do
clean up on this stuff you know tag it
by what kind of what whether the filer
there's nine different subtypes for the
AK filings for example but they delayed
it and I i submitted an article called
if amazon.com calm ran sec gov to the FT
and somewhere between the time that they
published the article and the the
submission the SEC did take that 24-hour
delay so you could actually get it and
the FT saw this is my fault so I have to
sort of sneak around when I when I go
there we're gonna the new the new xml
hip edgar the new guy I mean I find
myself amazed I'm actually saying
something good about a member of the
Bush administration but the the new guy
Chris Cox has finally gotten rid at trw
he put it out for bids people have been
trying to do this kind of stuff for a
long time there were some prototypes
Nasdaq did some prototypes I think Price
Waterhouse did some prototypes but he's
making it happen he's tagging the
sections a lot of the stuff in sec
filings is like the like the tags
underneath these chairs you know it's
it's inflammatory language an abyss but
but it doesn't mean anything so it
depends where it occurs in the document
and he's chopping it up and you can see
this is it he actually went and gave the
keynote address at the xbrl org
the this you can fake this stuff you can
you can you can write your own programs
my colleague Jake sis care did a lot of
work with me both both academic and
commercial and slicing these things up
and looking at the relationships between
documents sort of the linkage analysis
and I have a have an example here the
idea of looking at how a document
relates to another document how or
nuttin in the SEC how another company
relates to another company gives you a
lot of information that basically we're
exploiting the information and
relationships between information
entities as well as the information
contained in those entities we are at
Google so I do have to say what a
concept hey this this might actually
catch off the in the SEC context you can
look at the 10 KS and take out the
filing twenty ones I mean these are sort
of the you know the kind of a pain links
and the out link essentially will tell
you what the subsidiary relationships
are between various companies it's a
multi-step process very tedious this
stuff is written by lawyers and accounts
with word processors that the Duke a
statement had what 27 cases the last
sighted and so you can ask the question
do the number and type of filings made
by a complex company like say Enron
being the poster child for a complex
company how do they compare with with
other firms this is a this really I mean
we talked a little bit about the you
know sort of the analogues to pay drugs
this is this is the one of the oldest
forms of electronic signal analysis this
is traffic analysis goes back to World
War two if there's if your listener and
your patent i think was patent was
listening to Rommel and you see a little
noise from Romo you know how you doing
I'm okay what's up for what's for dinner
um maybe that's just an ordinary day but
when all of a sudden you hear a lot of
activity about you know petrol supplies
and ammunition supplies message traffic
goes up Oh something might be happening
and you can and you can elaborate when
things when things go from in the clear
to encode
you know that that's a sign of trouble
so this is sort of a traffic analysis
what we did was we found companies
comparable to Enron we looked in the
same SI c code got all the Edgar filings
associated with those companies and then
found the related entities and counted
their find the total filings Enron it
turns out as a massive outlier on both
scales it's more this is the raw data
it's particularly dramatic when you when
you when you plot it two dimensionally I
mean this is after the fact but you know
some of our research indicates that this
kind of thing and you know and this is
obviously I mean this is not this is
aggregate you know they kind of think of
you know molecular in the extreme and
we're looking at the relationships among
a lot of different things there there
are other other examples in sec filings
that are much simpler than this one is
the egg case there's I think the current
report there's nine different reasons
why you file one of those some of the
change of management and change in
ownership change of auditor usually if
the auditor leaves that's kind of an
interesting thing when Arthur Andersen
went out because of this Enron stuff
everybody had to change everybody was
using Arthur Andersen had to change
auditors so there was no no news there
the resignation of a director that
directors come directors go so one of
these really this is an example of an
XML tag that that my my friend Cox is
putting on at the SEC directors come to
go you know they retire but suppose
there's 11 people on the board and you
see 15 resignations in the space of two
months that might be an abyss something
something's going on here people you
know that the director saw what was
going on they all left they got some new
directors the new director said oh my
god and headed for the door so again you
know it's it's a I think the search
results are very much atomic now you get
you know individual documents but if you
kind of look at the molecular structure
between the relationships and it's very
domain-specific you need to be able to
to
you know construct something that will
will look persistently you don't want to
be searching for it manually and and and
specify what's of interest sometimes
it's the one example I gave you would be
of interest really for all companies
some are specific to certain industries
that my colleague mr. Passarella here
has some examples I'll show you later on
for that other things programming tools
I mean you know this is this is a little
bit of the the idea of intelligence
amplification there's two gig of text
being dropped at the SEC site every day
which ones are interesting a lot of them
are just you know totally totally
routine dipping dipping the footnotes
extracting the footnotes from the 10
cues in the 10 KS and and using dip i
mean i know some of your programmers you
know dipping will tell you what's new
what's gone and what's different and
when you and the footnotes tend to be
that if you look at these things you
extract the footnotes which again at
this point is not easy and then you look
at them you see they tend to be the same
quarter after quarter after quarter
after quarter but when there's a lot of
new stuff it's hard you've definitely
found smoke sometimes it's hard to tell
whether you found fire or positive fire
I don't know what's the opposite of fire
they but that example you know certainly
when there was a huge you know and the
and these these were just a you know
taken by it you know it up a particular
period we looked at the biggest
differences and certainly something
happened to fmc after that one showed up
another example realnetworks you know a
big you know big footnote a lot a lot of
smoke and you know there's followed
immediately by you know a big move in
the stock energy trading this I don't
know what company PCG is you know again
you know as soon as that showed up you
know and we're looking at scales of days
these are these are not things that
happen in milliseconds it takes a while
to digest so this is the unique and
think of this as sort of the the
intelligence amplification letting the
machine find what's interesting for you
here's another example of exploiting
structure in sec filings this is again
some work
that Jake and I did the idea of director
board membership concentration and
returns there are is better is better
governance associated with better stock
performance CalPERS a number of activist
investors believe so and they're so
there's a lot of interest in this and it
kind of makes it certain amount of sense
you know if if the if the board is
paying attention to the company that is
is a good thing if the board is familiar
with the issues that the company is
facing that's a good thing turnover in
tenure if the board has skin in the game
that's probably a good thing too and you
can you can extract a lot of this from
the from the SEC filings again it's it's
it's somewhat tedious but but it can be
done so let's just look at one component
here this is a board membership
concentration we look at the total
number of boards the directors are on
divided by the number of directors so
the if they're on if their own fewer
boards the lower numbers would be
associated with with higher returns is
our expectation that's it that's our
hypothesis so we got the board
concentrations in april 2003 and we
looked at returns by quintiles and des
des iles and this is the result this is
like the heightened calm of bar charts i
mean they just don't get looking better
than this you know the kind of thing
when you see this bar chart you think
maybe you're plotting the row numbers
that's the did you did you did something
wrong when you when you break it into
des iles you see that it's not quite as
as perfect as it seems i have another
little example i think then we're
closing up another one looking at
sentiment in corporate annual reports
this is a fellow fang li at the
university of michigan some recent
working working papers he did a
sentiment analysis sort of along the
lines of the general inquire thing which
is you know you know acres of software
millions of lines written over 20 years
across multiple continents he did
something much simpler he applied it
didn't apply to news stories he looked
at the the mdna the the management
discussion in the in the annual report
the 10k and he ranked them for risk
sentiment he know none of this general
Enquirer for him he counted six words
risk risks risky uncertain uncertainty
and uncertainties you know again think
how much the CEO doesn't want to say
this it's not as bad as abyss but but
it's not good so he ranks the ear angst
of my quintile and lo and behold you see
you know Jane know the more often they
say this the worst they do and you know
then he runs a trading say runs a
trading simulation you know by it by
year um you know and these are all you
know except for one it's positive every
year so that's you know there's there's
that there there's something there uh
this uh i'll give you the paper it's a
long short it's a long short um there's
never invited professor the company your
guests you guys have a fabulous thing
that i just love the something you've
done in google finance that it's sort of
a microscope for looking at the at a
micro level how information is impounded
in prices this is an example of a strong
form efficiency this would you know
here's the news the price gap you
couldn't do anything you know the dollar
bill the hundred-dollar bill was a fake
you couldn't pick it up so just keep
walking then looking at another case but
they're not all like this this is an
example i've occasionally look at the
you know the big movers and try to track
them back we have a we have a student
who's who's working on some of this now
here's an example from the end of two
thousand six you know sort of a medium
cap biotech stock Accenture that was up
fifty-seven percent on the day and over
here hear the story well there's no
stories here mmm fifty-seven percent no
stories what happened this insider
trading could be we don't know ah but
you can even sort of track it
down the a month earlier if you do some
research you would find that in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute
there was a report on a clinical trial
of a cancer vaccine that made by
accenture that was very successful they
don't mention Accenture
biopharmaceuticals but they mentioned
the compound which and it was public
information that it was made by
accenture the sort of the idea of meta
knowledge in the ace in the the AI world
you know and kind of let having people
who know what they're doing the news in
that report was really you know quite
good there was no abyss here specific
immune response associated with dramatic
and highly statistically significant
injuries increase in disease free
survival sounds good to me the first
formal demonstration of a clinical
benefit associated with the use of a
human cancer vaccine sounds even better
surprised the stock is only up 57%
there's there were some posters who
talked about it and they did actually
mention the company this is this is and
where it started the primary source and
you could have known that to look here
too all you had to do was you know sort
of you know if you're a health analyst
if you're one of the all-america team
this is the kind of stuff those people
do they know that this is happening at a
clinic in Navarra Spain reason months
and you know even though it sounds great
that you could you know the stock is up
57% if you do it in the morning you
can't buy that much stock in the morning
you can buy a lot of stock over 13
months I you know that the market cap of
the company was a few hundred million
dollars so you might have been able to
make you know million to something like
that but if you start accumulating the
stock you if there I don't think this
particular stock had options but I mean
this is this becomes you know as opposed
to a nice portfolio event this is the
stuff that you know gets you on the
heroes list the disintermediated news
would cause the stock to move on that
day on the 19th was a business wire
press release that mentioned both the
company the stock and the compound
and the reason it didn't show up on
Google was that I don't believe you guys
were carrying business wire at the time
I think you'd do now I think business
wire wanted you to pay them and then
they change their mind so now it know it
is there but you had you had to go to to
to the other other sources to Yahoo
Yahoo Finance I believe did pay them so
you could find it there and you know
there was some time I mean you know the
press releases here and you know you had
45 minutes herself to ride this up so if
you're training for your own account
this is this pretty good the mainstream
media had a story at 224 that said the
stock was up you know they kind of
reacted to it the the other brand of
mainstream media I'm going to get rid of
that because they're here they they did
they didn't report on it so and there's
some lessons here you know if you're a
health analyst and you know there are
thousands maybe tens of thousands of
ongoing trials at hundreds of centers
around the world and the news
dissemination process can be very slow
the news does not always mention the
company but it's public information
which chemical is being tested where and
tying it to to to to the company's some
of the key concepts I think everything
that I've shown you so far are the idea
of persistence persistence search
disintermediation you know going to
primary sources going to SCC going to
wear trials are going on don't wait for
the reporters to find it for you the
idea of going into the deep web database
access you have to log into a lot of
this stuff and in particular and I would
expand on that is how do you make money
from this I mean I know you know Google
would actually like to can make even
more money than they make coming from
the University of California which is 15
billion dollars in the hole the idea of
making money sounds pretty good to me um
the free bus now cost a dollar is the
idea of providing hooks into propriety
pilaar spending billions 25 30 billion
on financial information you can rent
them the adapter so you
provide let these tools look at
proprietary information you have
research departments that consist of
thousands of people how do you digest
their stuff you know your own internal I
think you know those little of the
yellow box and the blue box the Google
blades I don't know if you still sell
them i got my client to buy one years
ago for searching their own internal
stuff but that was just all words
exploiting the Semantic Web you know
tagging things you know some stuff comes
in tag some stuff can be tagged at its
origin moving to the molecular view
which we've had a number of examples is
really far more important than the
atomic view problems of electronic
intelligence both in the old ones
traffic analysis and LP and again if you
want to you know it's like like I showed
the old pictures of the markets if you
read the history of the electronic war
electronic warfare going back to World
War two you get the basics of this and
then you know apply the you know there's
some human computer interface issues
overview filter alert drill down to
detail sort of the the Schneiderman
mantra you know there has been a lot of
progress I think you know as that we
that we've seen you know there's here's
a nice example using yahoo pipes for my
boyfriend rob Passarella here what he
was doing was he thought that the
ratatouille game which was being issued
by kind of a medium sized game company
might not exactly be a huge hit you know
you never know but it's about a cooking
rat most of the people who play video
games would rather shoot the rat so so
it's not it's not it's not it's not a
slam dunk so he built a persistent agent
to track the pricing on these things
even before it came out and found that
there you know because people were
looking at it and if you go and you know
no one's gonna buy this game I don't get
to shoot the rat so uh and it was
dropping like a rock and he made the
call that things were not looking good
and I and and the stock dropped what
from like sixteen twenty percent in a
matter in a matter of days
after this and this was this was
persistent searching of Amazon I think
right last one you got theirs and
actually close to you see because of
expected from that title whoever thought
a game about a cook and rat but anyway I
like the rat but is there's a lot of
stuff coming at it out of your labs as
well of similar similar flavor tools
that you can use for for building these
persistent agents these aggregating
agents some of the the alternative views
I mean you've got this thing I'm and I
talked about you know trends you know
the eight KS you know you you know you
begin to see pieces of that some of the
idea of directed search a lot of this is
you know really want to go everywhere
you don't want to scrape the you know
what is the web now trillion and a half
pages or them many of them are just you
know guys and Albania typing stuff you
know after three vodkas sitting around
in their underwear and you know that's
not particularly relevant I guess unless
you're in the Albanian vodka business so
you want to look at particular places
you want to extract particular pieces of
information and then deliver it again
you know in sort of a human sensible way
the quants will probably want to take
this and process it and try to do
statistics and so on but these RSS
integrators that you know you know I use
one from you guys allow you really to be
in in multiple places at once
persistently you know I give these talks
to kind of mixed audiences I have a lot
of financial people who don't who think
computer science is writing an Excel
macro there's a lot more to that and I
urge them to read something like the the
Manning and shoots book there's another
one in information retrieval as well the
computer people you see things like you
know what we saw with the e analyst some
of these boneheaded you know comparisons
of us how am i doing by comparing it to
a to a coin to us people don't cost
coins to decide whether to buy or sell
stock people compare it to an index fund
so compare it to an index
in the basics of that I have a
traditional semi mandatory semi
inspirational closing quotation the
progress may have been alright once but
it's gone on far too long from from
Ogden Nash you know and you know a lot
of the stuff is not going to be totally
smooth as with any new technology we
need to expect errors we will expect
surprises we will expect some strange
innovations like the convair flying car
which which had its I think it's only
two flights down in Miami old
neighborhood near Santa Monica Airport
an emergency landing on Ocean Park
Boulevard sheared off the wings so they
decided maybe the third flight was not
not something they wanted to do but
ultimately we've seen success i mean you
know we're not we're not varied in wires
anymore we're not buried in telephones
and and there are you know there are
ways out of this we would love to have
people participate in the center there's
if you go to the website i've got cards
with it on there and it's all over the
place here and i think i think we've
been around long enough that you if you
google sift berkeley we actually do come
up but there's a collaboration area
where you can just sort of sign up i
think some of you there's are on here
you know there are a lot of them are you
know anonymous but i mean we have a lot
of ongoing discussions so you know
kibitzers are most welcome i only have
one guys trying to sell the agri and i
booted him out i'm going to do a formal
pole or an informal poll here i'm doing
a book that's coming at the end of the
year called nerds on Wall Street and I
mean get involved in a discussion with
my publisher about the cover we have
cover proposal one is the the human
trader and the robot Reiter the output
by sell beer TV sex car holiday is and
then they had this alternate one with
the robot wearing the glasses show of
hands who likes the one on the left we
liked the one on the right really okay
well I like the one on the left but it's
okay so far anyway that's the one now we
are about about ready I know I'm between
you and lunch this is this is a fabulous
lunch spot in my hometown Los Angeles
for the photography buffs money I will
point out that this is also an extremely
rare photo this is capturing the moment
sort of like this where the picture of
the of the bear grabbing the salmon in
the air this is the only moment when the
tale of the pup received an a from the
Los Angeles County Health Department so
you have questions you want proof I'll
give you proof thank you thank you for
coming yeah any comments questions
everybody want a car and I got a new
Berkeley cards so what is yours we
became and we existed we you know
there's we got a URL that was our big
accomplishment recently I mean really
the ink is barely dry on the um you know
they're coming out of the woodwork I
mean you know there's we probably got
you know a half it I'm really the
website has only been up for a matter of
weeks so uh you know I haven't moved up
to Berkeley yet I go when I give some
you know it's you know it's faculty
we're trying to collaborate most mostly
what I've been trying to do once I got
to go ahead from hostas to bring the
computer scientists in because it's you
know sort of astonishing to me that a
lot of my finance colleagues don't know
anybody in the computer science
department you know so you know I found
you know some people who talk where I
went to graduate school crease those
papadimitriou a fabulous computer
scientist so you know we kind of we're
rounding up people who are interested in
this we're trying to bring interesting
data for people to work on real problems
so so we've we've added a lot of faculty
you know it's you know I'm hoping that
will have you know Berkeley is pretty
big place it's you know there's probably
the 600 MBAs there 60 what they call em
Effie's masters of financial engineering
and it's probably a thousand
undergraduate sort of touching finance
every year
