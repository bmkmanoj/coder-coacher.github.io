- for for the invitation to speak here I
think it'll be an interesting workshop
I'm looking forward to some stimulating
discussion so I'm yeah I'm gonna provide
an introduction to quantum mechanics of
photosynthetic light help steam you
can't quite see my title but it's
quantum mechanics of photosynthetic
light housing machinery so I'm gonna
provide a bit of interruption then talk
about some of the work in in our group
in this area ok so right and since this
is a quantum biology workshop I thought
I would motivate a little bit and give
you know start at the beginning and talk
about quantum biology and and what it
should mean or what it does mean and the
way I like to think about I I like to
classify it into three levels of quantum
influence in biological systems so going
down the list here I mean the first one
is the trivial since we believe quantum
mechanics is the theory of microscopic
systems then everything is quantum
mechanical at some level right but
that's at this level of reductionism
it's it's it you can't really add much
to to knowledge you know quantum
mechanics dictates energy levels
molecular orbitals and so on but does
that really tell us anything new the
next level up which is more interesting
is is the level of molecular dynamics
and chemical kinetics so for the vast
majority of biomes of biological
interest you can describe chemical
kinetics market dynamics by just
classical physics different but in a few
cases there are quantum Corrections
which turn out to be significant just
some examples here are these non
adiabatic transitions through conical
intersections which are popular research
these days I mean you need to have
quantum mechanics in order to describe
the rates and the trend the correct
transfer and these in these cases yeah
there are they're chemical reactions
involving tunneling of electrons and
maybe protons there again the quantum
Corrections become important and then
the next level which is maybe the most
tantalizing is where quantum mechanics
becomes a functional necessity ok and
and you know the division between these
two is is kind of hazy where you throw
one and wait for the other is not clear
but at least the third class of quantum
influence you should be able to make a
connection between if the quantum
mechanics wasn't there if the system was
entirely classical the the organism
wouldn't be able to survive right and
I've listed some some examples over some
potential examples from this class the
way is gecko the way geckos hold on to
things is maybe through Van der Waals
forces magnetoreception and birds
olfaction and finally photosynthetic
light upstream which is what I'm going
to focus on I should say that the last
class is really the only one where we
have convincing experimental evidence
for quantum effects you could still
debate over whether it belongs in class
three or class 2 i think i'll talk more
about the role of quantum mechanics in
light Alliston but I I tend to put it in
class three okay so so then I should
also go to the skeptics view all right
this is this is if you say - even if
even the normal scientist you expect
quantum times to play a role in biology
there are a few there are a few
arguments for why this should not be the
case that most people bring out the
first of these is a classical kind of
thermal argument they say that there's
too much thermal energy in biological
systems right the typical energy scales
that you're concerned with is just
overwhelmed and drowned out by just a
thermal noise of thermal energy in a
biological system okay and that's a
fairly weak argument in my point of view
because it's a very equilibrium argument
I mean the temperature is an equilibrium
concept right and in most biological
systems it's a non equilibrium dynamics
that matters and you can have systems
that take a very long time to actually
equilibria and you can be very quantum
mechanical in that in that
in that region before equilibration for
thermalization and still and still have
a state that's thermal at the end okay
so this is not a convincing argument I
don't think a more sophisticated way of
putting this comes in the frame of a
framework of decoherence theory where
you really consider the time skills in
the system you say there are two is
timescales that that matter one is the
time scale is that of interactions
within the system and by system I mean
the biological thing that we're looking
at the structure that we're looking at
and that's of interest right that's
parametrized by this this J so this is
the this is the rate at which dynamics
occurs within the system and one on J is
the is the times the coherent evolution
timescale and then there's a rate of
interaction with the environment and
that's that's parameterize by this
lambda here and so you can see that what
J does is it it likes to create super
positions between states between classic
we distinguish all states okay what
lambda does it likes this decohere these
super positions into classical mixtures
right the intrinsic competition between
these two rates and so a nice way to
talk about how quantum system is to
think about this ratio J on lambda okay
so you can draw this scale down and say
that well we know that all the way on
the right where J on land is large is
where things are very quantum mechanical
and here we have classic systems from
from well these days from quantum
computing trapped ions
you know superconducting systems may be
photons in life and on atoms in law
optical lattices and so on here J on
lambda can can reach you know tens of
hundreds on the other end of the scale
and this is typically the skeptics view
right that this is this is where
biochemical person is like they lie all
the way on very small J on lambda okay
but one should ask the question is that
a priori necessary I mean should
biochemical systems only lie on that
side and what I will hope to show you is
that the we know of at least one
biochemical system which is much closer
to two on to the right hand side of the
scale okay and and and maybe there are
more
okay so that brings me to to the main
topic of the talk on quantum effects and
light housing systems I'm gonna provide
a little bit of introduction in the
absence of Alan's talk here so bear with
me if you already know this stuff so the
structure of photosynthesis really is
you can break it down into two sections
on what it typically call light
reactions and dark reactions the dark
reactions are the chemistry essentially
the Calvin cycle everything that goes
from sugars everything that goes from
units of biochemical energy to sugars
and then the light reactions which is
what I'm going to focus on is what the
things that are initiated by light by
photons okay if i zoom in on those light
reactions this is a this is a cartoon
picture what happens you get light
impinging on absorbing pigments there
could be a whole variety of them going
over multiple energy scales so we've got
blue orange red
eventually the the resulting excitation
migrates its way to something called a
reaction center which is where most of
the chemistry is initiated okay so this
is where you get a you get a setting up
of an electrochemical potential which is
essentially a battery for for the rest
of the reactions so I'm gonna now have a
two-minute little more and just focus on
this first part the what are called the
antenna systems these are the things
responsible for absorbing light and also
eventually transporting the resulting
excitation to the reaction centers
okay so there's a huge variety of
antenna centers this is just a picture
from from Blankenship's book some if you
want to make generalizations then
something's you can say is that they're
all composed of densely packed pigments
so pigments are things like chlorophyll
molecules which absorb light very
efficiently okay
and most of these pigment or molecular
aggregates of these pigment aggregates
are encased in these protein cages such
as these that you see which which which
lends some stability and some energetic
structure to the system okay and and and
all light ups and complexes are also
embedded within membranes
and I'll come back to this point at the
end why this why this could be important
okay so another generalization you can
make which is perhaps the most important
at this point is that energy transfer is
very efficient in these systems almost
well greater than 95 percent efficient
in most cases and it happens at very
fast timescales picosecond times girls
okay so these are some of the fastest
persons we know in biology and and
arguably some of the most efficient as
well so let me let me introduce you to a
specific light harvesting complexes I'm
gonna concentrate most of the
theoretical studies later on this
complex so I'm gonna go through a little
bit more detail this is the apparatus of
green sulfur bacteria so these are
bacteria these are an oxygen X so they
don't produce oxygen but they live in
these sulfur rich environments typically
in oceans or swamps this is a picture of
them
if you zoom into the light harvesting
apparatus it looks like this
it's essentially most of the lighthouses
the antenna of this system is this large
large complex you see at the top here
this is called the claw resume it's
composed of very densely packed pigment
pigments and that's where most of the
light is absorbed and eventually the
resulting excitation from the absorption
migrates its way down to the reaction
center which you can see here can anyone
can people see the cursor on the screen
is that okay okay I'll keep using that
um but in so in this migration of this
excitation energy right in the middle is
on this thing called a far more complex
okay so it's essentially a wire it's
essentially a wire that channels the
energy from the main antenna to the
reaction center okay I'm going to zoom
in on that a little bit and has this
structure it's a trimer
of identical units that looks like this
if I just look at one of the monomers
this is its picture and by strip away
the protein cage all this gray matter
and around it it's essentially just
seven chromophore seven chlorophyll
molecules okay there's a standard
labeling
one two seven and if the way I've drawn
in here is actually what we believe it
looks like in vivo so this is the
orientation the light enters through
chromophore is one and one and six from
the base plate and it leaves through a
chrome four three right so it really is
just a wire that connects the the main
antenna to the reaction center okay and
and it is very efficient it's an
amazingly efficient at this at this this
job it's it's been given of funneling
this energy down so as you probably all
know there were experiments on this
precisely on this complex on their
formal complex in 2007 which showed that
not only are the static features quantum
mechanical but the dynamic features in
the system also require mechanical
meaning that how energy moves about
among these many different pigments is
not by just hopping from pigment to
pigment it rather moves around in a
wave-like manner it samples a lot of
many of the pigments at once okay as
it's moving around and if you look at so
I mean I like to think of this basically
getting refuting this this classic
picture of energy transfer in these
systems of excitation jumping from
pigment to pigment and rather moving to
this other picture of where this is now
an energy space these are the energy
levels of the system and it's just
coherently sampling the energy levels
it's moving up and down more like a wave
okay that's a very cartoony picture but
I think it's useful to think about the
the the the sea change in the picture in
which the dynamics is happening okay
yeah and then as I mentioned there have
been several experiments since then so
this initial experiment was done at
cryogenic temperatures and now there's
there's been multiple experiments at
room temperature which confirm the same
effect and in multiple organisms too so
not just in green sulfur bacteria this
is not a an outlier in the space of
light house and complexes okay it's been
confirmed in marine algae in purple
bacteria also in higher plants so LHC 2
is a light housing complex in
in spinach so in most of the green
plants that we see is contain LHC 2 and
we know that there are quantum coherence
XML AC 2 okay so now moving on to the
theory there's been a lot more theory on
these systems and this is just a small
sampling of the theoretical papers out
there people have looked at efficiency
of these systems and how quantum
mechanics plays into the efficiency I
think Masoud will talk a little bit more
about this in the next talk people have
also looked at more exotic quantum
properties like quantum entanglement and
speed up in dynamical in a dynamical
sense and I'm going to talk more about
these two topics in later on in the talk
but just just a survey there are other
things that people have looked at and
Masoud will again present some more
illnesses optimality of the system is it
really tuned to do what it's meant to do
or is it is it is it not really optimal
at all and the I'll let Masoud answer
that question because since he's done
the work there and then on purple
bacteria which are in a sense more
heavily studied because I guess the
quantum chemical effects there at least
the static quantum chemical effects were
known for a long time a long a period of
time people have looked at
delocalization so how delocalized
coherently delocalized is the energy in
the system how the transfer rates in
between modules of this of this purple
bacteria light housing complex dictated
by quantum mechanics and also in in
higher plans people have looked at
entanglement in these light housing LHC
two complexes of higher plants okay so
now I'm going to move on to some of the
work that we've done specifically and
I'm going to begin with looking at
entanglement and in the FMO complex
itself so so let me define entitlement
I'll give a brief introduction so
entitlement mathematically is is this
statement that if I'm going to write
down a quantum state if I can write it
and it's a quantum state of many parties
so I've divided my system into a bunch
of subsystems there's some natural
division
if I can write it down if I recognize
write down my column state as a state of
party a tensor product with a state of
party because the particle the saved
party see if you're not familiar with
the tensor product I mean it's just it's
just a mathematical term for saying this
independently of this independently of
this so if you can write down the state
of the combined system independently of
in a way that each each system has its
own independent state then we call that
a separable State and then any state
that's not written this way is an
entangled State okay and so I've written
an example here of an entangled State so
this is because these are spins spinning
this pointing up or down so you can see
that you can you can't factor out the up
component of the spin state right if you
factor it out of this thing you can't
factor it out of here so this is party
that the left side is party a in the
right hand side is party B um okay so
that's that's curious and I think that's
that's uh that's nice math but why does
it matter and really to understand the
fundamental importance of quantum
mechanics you have to think about what
it means for for what the state is
telling us about knowledge okay I think
this is the clearest way to interpret
the system so the entropy of a state we
think of it how much uncertainty there
about the state of the system there is
so it's a measure of uncertainty
just like classical entropy is a measure
of uncertainty you can define a quantum
entropy the one normal entropy it's a
measure of uncertainty so that's this
entropy function here there's a row if I
if I calculate the entropy of this
entangled state here it's zero okay so
in a sense I know as much as I can know
about this state it's a pure state and I
know as much as I can know about this
day but now if I ask the question what
is the state of either party of party a
or party B the natural way to think
about that is is to eat is to average
over the state of the other other party
okay it's called a partial trace
operation and this is what you get for
the pilot for the state of either
individual party it's a completely mixed
state and it's a classical mixture of up
and down and if you look at the entropy
of that it's one which is the maximal
entropy set such a system can take so
what is the same and
this was first noticed by Schrodinger
way back in 35 and he says what this
means is that the best possible
knowledge of the hole does not imply the
best possible knowledge knowledge of its
parts okay and this is this is the
reason people get excited about in time
we know people are perplexed by it
because this is very counterintuitive
but if I if I tell you I know everything
about everything in this room I should
be able to answer the question about
what state is that chair what color is
this chair right but that's not the case
for entitlement if even if I know
everything about the global state I can
have as little knowledge as possible
individual states okay
and so this is um this is this was
recognized a long time ago and this is
precisely what read on what led Einstein
Podolsky and Rosen to - maybe posit that
the quantum mechanics is not a complete
description of reality we progressed a
lot since then and we think that it's a
complete description but maybe one
that's not intuitive okay and then and
then more recent developments some
manifestations of entitlement these days
entitlement is not it's still weird but
it's not a it's not necessarily that
something we don't we don't get our
hands wet with experiment to illustrate
this all the time there are there
experiments to conducting systems ion
traps photons that routinely create
entangled States and furthermore we know
that it's useful for certain task
information processing metrology
communication and so on but I should
note that these are all low temperature
low noise experiments to create an
entangled state with with the high
fidelity requires a lot of effort from
experimenters and even small deviations
from from from ideal conditions can
destroy entanglement so but but there's
there's a more recent developments that
show that even bulk systems if I just
take a magnetic salt in this case if I
if I talk about its it's the state of
its constituents the nuclear nuclei of
this magnetic salt I'm below a certain
temperature I think in this case it's
about a Kelvin or 5 Kelvin we know that
the the state of the nuclei are
entangled okay we can do bulk
measurements which tell us that the most
consistent state
is an entangled state so in a sense this
is a natural system on its system
magnetics all that that is entangled
below a certain temperature okay so it
kind of led us to ask the question can
you actually can it exist in biological
systems which is in a sense of a more
natural system and added physiological
temperatures right so this is below a
certain temperature can we see it in
biological systems at natural time at
physiological temperatures that's the
question I want answered today before I
do that let me clarify what I mean by
entanglement in these light housing
complexes so I've seen I've shown you on
that they're mostly composed of
chlorophyll or pigment molecules that
are spatially separated my internal 'men
t'what I mean is that non classical
correlations between the electronic
states of spatially separated carnivores
okay so chromophores are spatially
separated and they have some electronic
degrees of freedom which are moving
around and if you have non classical
correlations between them that's what
I'm gonna call in time this is a fairly
sensible definition of the concept the
only thing is how you divide up your
whole system and now here I've chosen up
chosen to divide up the degrees of
freedom are the degrees of freedom of
the chromophore themself and this is
sensible because they're actually
spatially separated individual
components so how do you quantify
entanglement in such a system and it
turns out to be very difficult
quantifying in talent is a tricky
concept by itself and in this case what
we have is something called multipath
mixed state entanglement explain what
those things mean multi-part I just
because you don't have just two parties
here right you have many chromophore so
you have at least seven in this unit
seven more complex so you can't just
talk about a bipartite system and it's
mixed state entanglement because the
system is never in a pure quantum
mechanical state meaning that it's
always interacting with its environment
it's a biochemical system of flow it's
interacting with the environment and the
state of the system is never in a pure
quantum mechanical state so we have to
talk about mixed state my multi-party
retirement and there is some there is a
simplification which we can make which
makes us able it allows us to actually
quantify the internal in the system and
that's that where we're always in the
single excitation subspace in the system
what I mean by that is that this
particularly for this effort more
complex and more generally for
for many light housing complexes the the
amount of photons that they receive per
unit of time is very small so you can be
very sure to to a very high-level
approximation you can say that there is
that most a single excitation in the
system at once right it transports
excitations and femtoseconds of
picosecond timescales and it receives a
photon once every second so you know
it's gonna it's gonna dump that photon
much before it gets a long time before
it gets the next time so we're gonna use
this approximation that there's at most
a single excitation in the system and
what that and and and that's that's very
accurate for for at least this FMO
system and more generally for other
light has some complexes as well and
that allows us to form measures of
entanglement in this system I'm going to
use two measures one is a global
measurement time so it kind of captures
the total amount of entanglement in the
system okay I'm not going to go through
the technical details of what these how
you come up with these measures of or
how to interpret them but I'm happy to
talk about that at the end of this time
and then that the other measurement
element I'm going to use is a standard
measure called the concurrence it's just
a measure of bipartite internet so i
single out two particular chrome fours
and I ask how entangled are they okay
and I'm gonna use a measure of
concurrence for that and okay so then
now I've talked about how to quantify
interment I'm going to talk about how to
actually theoretically simulate these
systems so that you have you have some
way of actually calculating how much in
time with there is and this is maybe too
technical for for people who aren't
interested in the details but I'm just
going to go through very quickly for
people who are a very good approximation
of the dynamics here is what's called a
Frankel Hamiltonian what it says is that
each chromophore so this this this
notation here of n you should think of
that as the as as the state of a single
chromophore okay a single single is the
same of a single pigment but it's is
that each pigment has a certain
characteristic energy to it this is the
energy of its excited state and there's
there's a matrix element that couples on
pigments and this is that this is the
physical Coulomb the coupling so if
there's an excitation on here and
there's
nearby chromophore night right next to
it um it will eventually move over to
here okay and that's and and how quickly
it moves over to here is characterized
by this is characterized by the J okay
so it's technically called the
transition dipole couplings so that
describes the movement of excitation in
these systems but that's not all right
because I've mentioned a couple of times
it's actually embedded within this
protein cage it's embedded within a lot
of a lot of other dynamics happening
around it so you need to actually talk
it talked about the open system dynamics
and that's the Hamiltonian there that
what describes the dynamics there is not
only this part but also something that
describes the coupling between the kron
four's to the environment and also the
dynamics of the environment that ends up
being a lot of a lot of things to keep
track of so what the usual way to do
this is to average out over the dynamics
of the environment what you say is that
I'm going to ignore what the data what
the environment is doing I'm just going
to look at the system of interest and
that's you you compose things like the
master equation which which describe the
dynamics of the system now the tricky
thing about this particular system and
about lighthouse and complexes is in
general and we could talk about why this
this is is that there are no
perturbative timescales in the system
the standard way of going from this this
complete description of the system and
the environment everything around it and
just focusing on the environment is to
put turb around some time scale you say
that the environment is not moving very
quickly so I'm just gonna say it's a
constant its constant or moving very
slowly right and this is this is a
standard mathematical technique you
separate timescales and you just talk
about the timescale of interest you have
know things that happen too fast and you
ignore things that are happening too
slow but the thing about these systems
is there are no perturbed of timescales
it's really difficult to do this and so
you need a theory that can that can take
this into account and very recently just
last year such a theory was developed in
the Fleming lab at Berkeley and Aikido
is your sake with the first order and
we're going to use that model for the
dynamic so we're sure that we're
capturing the dynamics of the system in
the regimes that are interesting
precisely in this regime where there are
no kotoba timescales okay all right so
here are the results so what
these come out running the simulations
according to this this very accurate
physical model and and measuring the
entanglement using the measures that I
mentioned so if we just look at global
entanglement right so this is the total
amount of entangled in the system the
two curves here the blue curve is 477 K
which is where the first experiments are
done and the red curve is for the room
temperature of 300 Kelvin what we see is
that there's an initial spike of
Intendant so the the initial state here
is that the excitation is just on one of
the chrome floors
so here I mentioned that the FMO
receives its its excitation from through
1 &amp;amp; 6 right so I'm just choosing the
excitation to to be on 1 in this case
and then it's as its spreading out over
the kron four's this entitlement build
up over all the chrome floors that
aren't involved in the transport and and
you see that the temperature dependence
is not it's not drastic so you know
there's a viewpoint that increasing
temperature will kill off quantum
effects very quickly right but this is
not what you see here you've increased
temperature almost fourfold from 70 70
80 300k and the entitlement has
decreased by by maybe 3/4 all right so
there is no kind of linear or super
linear scaling of I should say there's
no super linear scaling around the the
the suppression of quantum effects in
this in this case with temperature and
this and furthermore this significant
entanglement at long times it's the
steady state of the system which is way
over here so sorry so the the the main
graph shows time up to 100,000
femtoseconds and this sub graph is
showing on x up to 5000 femtoseconds so
there's entitlement even up to up to 5
Pico seconds now that that's on absolute
x because all at least on human x
because it's very short but you have to
remember that these systems dump these
these things do their job in femtosecond
timescales right so these are certainly
functionally relevant timescales and
that's the important thing to keep in
mind ok so this is a measure of just the
total entanglement in the system it
doesn't really tell us about what things
are in time well you might say well this
is maybe not so surprising because you
know you have chrome poles that are very
close to each other they're talking you
know they're strongly coupled to each
other and therefore they will have in
time with each other so
maybe this is not so surprising and to
to look at more closely of where exactly
the entanglement is spatially what you
have to do is resort to this kind of
bipartite measure so I'm going to look
at I'm going to choose two kron four's
um and then just look at how on-time
obey oh okay and so on let's just focus
on the left hand graph here that's 77k I
think you can see this this is showing
which two kron four's each line
corresponds to so the blue is one corner
flow is one and two
the red is crimp was one and three and
so on and so you see that the intuition
was right that the current flows that
get very entangled quickly and there's a
lot of entitlement are the ones that are
right right next to each other one and
two okay but then and then as the
excitation moves around other things get
entangled and the really surprising
thing for us here was this one in three
the red curve here you see this
entanglement build up over the chrome
close one and three and it stays around
for long timescales all right at least
till Pico second at 77k and further so
this is red good and why this is
surprising is that one in three are
almost as far apart as they could be in
this complex they're about three
nanometers separated and they have
negligible direct coupling right if you
just look at the direct coupling between
these things they're not very coupled at
all
so this entanglement there's non-local
correlation between these two is is
mediated by the interaction with the
rest of the system okay and so and and
then if you look at if I just thought
the the curves which would show the most
significant amount of in town but if you
look at other bipartite cuts as well
they also show entitlement and what it
means that this is true multi-part are
in terms so if you look at internal
theory people make the distinction
between things that are just bipartite
entangled and five three systems only
these two are entangled or are they all
entangled with each other which is a
higher more complex description of the
internal in the system and turns out
there it's multi-part items angle in
this case okay so that brings me the end
of the entitlement discussion I'm going
to talk about quantum speed-up um so
what did I mean by quantum speedo uh we
were motivated to look at this but but
by statements like this that came out
right after the V on the experiments
were done in 2007 so people made the
analogy to quantum computation in these
systems saying that well planets are
actually do performing a quantum
computation in the process of absorbing
energy and for anyone who works in
quantum computing and that's my
background this is a very striking
statement if you talk to the
experimentalist they've spent years and
years you know building up a single
qubit to do virtually nothing and and so
you know it's very kind of a almost
insulting you to if you talk about
quantum computing computing
experimentalist to say that such a messy
system is performing corner computation
so we wanted to really examine this
question closely and the way we do it is
so the most direct analogy to quantum
computation is through this thing called
the quantum walk so quantum walk if you
most of you probably know about a random
walk a random walk is just where you
move randomly between spots and then you
eventually diffuse out in a system right
so if I have a line and I moved to the
right with probability P and I move to
the left with probability P after a
certain amount of time I'll have a
Gaussian distribution for my position
this is classical diffusion if now
instead I say that I'm I'm a quantum
Walker I can move in superposition to
the right and left if I look at my
distribution after a seminar time it'll
be this black curve so the blue curve is
the classical distribution is just
Gaussian it'll be this black curve and
it's really strange not only is it a
solitary it's also bimodal right so you
have maximum probability of being on the
ends not in the middle anymore
so so people just look at the variance
of that Walker it scales linearly in
time as opposed to sorry the the
variance scales linearly in time Oakland
yeah the variance scale quadratic we
know anything right it scales polynomial
faster than the classical Walker
okay the variance of the system and and
you can embed a quantum algorithm like a
quantum search within a quantum walk so
you can say that the walker is searching
for a particular node in the graph and
you can embed the whole idea of a
grovyle search algorithm within a
quantum walk and this is the most
natural way in which the finger of
photosynthetic systems as performing a
quantum computation
they're actually randomly walking around
this chromophoric complex and maybe
they're doing some computation in this
process right but one thing to keep in
mind is that I think this is not an
ideal quantum walk at all for an ideal
quantum walk you assume that all the
nodes are at the same energy
there's no D coherence and in these
systems there's a certain energy
landscape and you need an energy
landscape because you need energy to be
funneled to reaction centers right so
the there's an energy landscape in the
system the there is disorder in the
system there's um there's also
decoherence in the system which we've
talked about extensively so can you
really have speed-up in this environment
can you really have this kind of
quadratic speed-up over on over
propagation in this environment and to
look at this what we did was actually
look at the FMO complex and map it to a
1d quantum world since we know the
properties of the one one day Cornwall
very well if you look at the Hamiltonian
so what is this Hamiltonian main the
diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian are
the energies of each chromophore and the
off diagonal elements are how strongly
they're coupled ok so so this element
here will tell you how strongly
chromophore one is coupled to ground
floor to okay now if you just get rid of
the the smallest elements and you just
look at the largest element here so what
you notice is that it looks very much
like a 1d quantum walk now you have two
source nodes 1 &amp;amp; 6 at the end and you
have a sync node in the middle 3 okay
there's a slight ambiguity here that
there's 5 and 7 are equally or very
strongly coupled to 6 and also for but
you can collapse those two into a single
node in no quantum or can you have the
so you have a six node quantum walk and
your things coming from the ends and
moving to the middle okay and now a good
way to see if you have a quantum
speed-up is just to say look at the this
scaling of the variance and say if it's
classical it's kind of scale linearly
and if it's quantum is kind of scale
quadratical all right so it's it's
direct analogy to this this picture here
so what do you see so on the left hand
side is a graph of the actual the
variance with respect to time
and the right hand side is its power law
I think the right hand side is probably
more it's easy to interpret but but we
can look at both let's see so in the
what you see is that up to about 70
femtoseconds you have ballistic motion
so you truly have a quadratic scaling of
variance it moves very quickly all right
so it's easy to see in the Paolo the
power if you just look at T to the B B
is is to fancy a quadratic scaling of
how quickly it's moving but then very
quickly it goes down it goes actually
sub diffusive it goes to below what you
expect for a classical random walk and
then it then it eventually gets trapped
in the trapping so this includes
trapping that's why it's it's going down
continuously but what this tells you is
that there is no quantum speed-up
in the sense that you need for a quantum
computation beyond 70 femtoseconds okay
but the coherence is still there up to
750 seconds an order of magnitude
greater and you could also why is this
happening right why what is limiting the
quantum speed-up and it turns out it's a
combination of two things one is its
localization and this is well known from
condensed matter and it's it's usually
called anderson localization in very
large systems
it's where if you have any disorder on
your system so if it's not a plane if
you're not just moving along an
energetic plane if you have like
disorder on your system you're gonna get
localized you're gonna get trapped in
local minima you're gonna you're not
going to propagate very far in the
system but at the same time there's a
defacing mechanism which is the effect
of the environment and not the defacing
does is it actually it moves energy
levels around okay so if you imagine a
static patrol the energy levels are just
fixed you're going to get trapped but
then the the defacing actually helps you
because it moves energy levels around
and you can get pushed over boundaries
and so the phasing moves you beyond
being trapped so if you didn't have the
de phasing this would go from to and
rapidly drop down to zero right so the
the effect of the de phasing is that
push it back up but it still doesn't
push it back up to one so it's actually
sub sub ballistic all the way through
after 77 femtosecond so we think this is
a pretty convincing argument but there
is no quantum speed-up in this system
the the combined effects of the the
disorder the localization and the
defacing preclude any kind of quantum
mechanical speed-up that's required for
quantum computing in the system okay
okay so how much time do I have left 15
great okay so I'm I'm gonna talk a
little bit more about well maybe this
question is naturally motivated at this
point what's so special about light up
some complexes right
you know I've presented you some results
and you'll see some more about their
efficiency and so on but I want to
address what is special that set
lighthouse and these are the only
arguably the only biological systems
where we know quantum effects play such
an important role and so what makes
these things so special and this is this
is not just a philosophical essence I
think this is a very practical question
because if we want to find more systems
in biology which might benefit from
quantum mechanical effects then we
should really isolate what is special
about these systems we should really
find out what makes these different from
you know any other biological system and
so it's useful to go back to this
picture that I introduced about the
system and environment coupling so J is
that the rate of that which dynamics
happens within the system and then does
the rate of dynamics between the system
and the environment and it turns out for
light housing systems they increase J by
by doing a very nifty thing of just
having very dense packing of molecule's
right so these these chlorophyll
molecules are packed very close together
on separation of the length of a
nanometer or sub nanometer length this
leaves a very strong interaction between
them so J is kind of pushed up naturally
by this but it's injured by this
engineering in a way and furthermore
lambda is pushed down and there's a
couple of tricks that it uses to do this
so the main trick is that the light
housing complexes are always embedded
within membranes okay so you have some
membrane and the light ops and complex
lives within the membrane and this
there's a very good reason for this it's
really to set up an electrochemical
potential if you want to separate
electrons from protons positive charge
from negative charges you need to find a
way to keep them separated otherwise
they'll recombine again so what you do
is you send the positive charges to one
side of the membrane and the negative
charges to the other okay so this is the
membrane and senses a battery here the
terminals of the battery but but maybe
it's doing something more the
if you if you put things inside a
membrane there in a way in a more
controlled environment than just in some
bare solvent okay and it turns out if
you look at how strong the electron
photon coupling how strongly the chrome
pores are coupled to the vibrations in
the system it's it's orders of magnitude
smaller than what you'd expect in a
typical solvent so if you look at what
you'd expect this coupling is called the
reorganization energy if you look at
what the reorganization energy is that
you calculate in a typical solvent it's
about two hundred to two thousand wave
numbers in this unit and if you look for
the FMO where it is it's about
thirty-five wave numbers so it's
drastically smaller than what you see in
a typical solvent system and and we
believe this has to do with the membrane
reading it's a much more controlled
environment and another aspect that
comes out of this is that maybe the
fluctuations that in it that it sees is
much much more controlled it's a they're
not just random fluctuations there's
some correlation time and there's some
spatial correlation to the fluctuations
as well and and people including Massoud
have shown that this has this can
actually help in the transport if you
have correlated fluctuations as opposed
to a completely random environment you
can you can preserve coherence for a
longer period of time okay so this this
could be so what what does this mean it
means that for these systems J or lambda
is about 1 they don't lie all the way on
this left-hand side of this graph that I
drew and and and and it may be this is
an engineering choice right you push J
up and you push down lambda down in
order to achieve this this kind of
coincidence of timescales okay
and so this leads me to structure and
this is some work that we recently
started I'm going to talk about some of
the work that we're doing now and some
of the things we're looking at so these
considerations lead you to think about
structure in these systems and how
structure plays a role and and so in
biology I guess these are normally
called structure function questions you
want to know you know why the structure
is so that it performs a sum function
and you can really kind of form this
picture of light house encompasses going
from a monomer or a signal pigment you
aggregate them you form them together
into a ball and then you put some
protein cage around it in order to give
it some stability okay so how does each
on each aspect of this of this
construction affect the quantum
mechanical effects and also the function
the function of a function of this
device so you can ask you know which
structural features actually determine
the quantum behavior what's the
influence of the pigment density what's
the influence of the the pigment
orientations that you choose of the
actual choice of pigments that you use
you can ask whether you can engineer the
protein backbone so I mentioned that the
membrane may be may be a way that you
have some shielding from environmental
deaths can you engineer the protein
backbone so you have this similar kind
of shielding and how you know can you
enhance quantum behavior by suitable
design and so how does also how does the
aggregation how does the protein
determine that both the transport
properties and also the optical
properties so I haven't mentioned much
about optical properties but really
these things antenna right so not only
do they need to be good at transporting
excitations that they also need to be
very good at absorbing the light that
they receive it's a whole nother story
they turn that it turns out that most
items and complexes are really finely
tuned to the to the actual spectrum that
they receive so to investigate these
questions what we're doing is actually
building test systems we're basing this
on a tobacco mosaic virus so this is a
common virus this is just a monomer of
the of the protein and what you can do
is you can mutate certain sites of this
protein and you can add chromophores you
can add pigments right so the pigments
will be attached to these sides and then
they self assemble into these beautiful
structures see they self assemble into
these you just throw a bunch so you
mutate a bunch of them your touch
crumples and you throw them into a
solution with a certain pH and and
temperature and they self assemble into
that these disk-like structures these
stacks of disks or they can even
assemble into into these helix
structures okay and these look very
similar to natural light housing systems
that we have but there's a natural light
housing analogy counterparts of these
helical structures and also these disks
like structures and so the person doing
the synthetic chemistry is massive mad
Francis at UC Berkeley is a professor in
the chemistry department and so he has
worked with his team resistance for a
long time he's really an expert in
designing the structure and also
assembling it in the way and and so what
he can do is mutate different components
and attach chromophores at different
sites
achieve variable separation distance
between kron four's so so what does this
mean if he attaches it at site 103 and
they're separated by only about point 8
nanometers and if you make a disk out of
them they'll lie it right in the middle
here okay so but if he attaches them at
site 123 the green side I guess the
colors don't come out so well here but
the point is that where it worry
attaches them determines what the
density of pigments is and what they are
orientations is okay see we can we can
kind of make light housing complexes on
demand here and that's and that's the
idea so this is because it's a bottom-up
approach we're really trying to
understand the structure function
relationships like if I make a light
housing complex like so how does it how
do the quantum properties emerge out of
that and how do they influence function
like optical and transport properties
right so the goals here I guess to mimic
the fantastic efficiency of natural
light housing complexes but by design by
really microscopic design and and also
give it to neural property so one of the
things that about natural lighting
systems they don't use many a huge
variety of pigments but by just
engineering the pigments so they can
absorb either all the way on the blue or
all the way on the red and so can we can
we have that kind of variability can we
tune the absorption of these item
systems by just changing the structure
by engineering it's like by not only
changing the pigments and also we want
we want structures that are suitable to
biological environments and obviously
there are applications to this may be
light sensors also photovoltaic
applications ok all right so here's the
summary of what I presented so first
part of preventing the endowment I'd
hopefully I demonstrated that
entitlement is a young it is a natural
feature of these systems it turns up as
a result of the excitation transport
what I didn't really address is the role
of the entitlement so we haven't been
able to pinpoint at the short precise
role for this entitlement it could be
just a side effect of the coherence or
the fact that they strongly coupled so
we're still working on that and the the
class of entangled States for people
we know about internally the class of
entangle states of these things exhibit
a very small class that took the total
entitlement that they could exhibit it's
only the so-called single exit on
manifold and and you could ask whether
there's more general class of
entitlement that they could exhibit
exhibit is all the second part I
demonstrated that there really is no
quantum speed-up
in the corner information centers in
these systems that it's not
these things aren't built for quantum
computation and the the defects that the
natural effects that they have don't
allow for the kind of support of speed
up that that's required but but that's
not to say that there's no quantum
advantage that you make a distinction
here the quantum computing is not the
only role here as I mentioned that that
really overcoming local energy minima
is a possibility people have postulated
that efficiency is a role robustness
coherence could provide more robustness
in these systems
you know directionality so you want
these things to take energy in one
direction towards reaction center you
want you don't want it to go backwards
right so maybe that's a role for the
coherence as well and then briefly
presented that the new approach that we
take from the bottom-up approach of
actually constructing artificial light
out of some systems and and playing
around with them to see what the effects
of the coherence are okay thank you this
is so this work was done in
collaboration with a lot of people the
speed-up work was was done in
collaboration with Stefan Hoya he's
actually here today you can talk to him
about if you are interested the
entitlement work was done in
collaboration with akitoshi sakis and
Graham Fleming and the synthesis work
that I talked about at the end the
molecular synthesis is done in
collaboration with Dan Finley and Matt
Francis and Brigida Whaley was involved
in all the work as well
so this this is actually transport
within the smaller weight so this is
transport within the excited safe
manifolds only right so the ground too
excited is about is about 15,000 wave
numbers but within the excited state
manifold it's only about a thousand wave
numbers or so separation so it's the
transport within that that gradation if
the energy difference was even larger it
would be even more localization you
wouldn't have defacing mechanisms which
could bridge the gap of over 15,000 wave
numbers
I see very high so much slowly
so I should say that that energy scale
you're talking about the optical energy
scale right is not relevant here because
it is really in this half it's really in
the thousands of wave numbers what we're
talking about the disorder because it's
transport in this exit excited manifold
it's really I mean the the complex
question of how it would scale with very
large energy differences I don't think
it would scale well I mean you would get
localized very quickly because there
isn't the least to my knowledge there
aren't defacing mechanisms that could
bridge this huge energy gap
took place at the energies roughly of
ATP hydrolysis yeah we have an on
simulation so I don't know what it looks
like but it's it's an interesting quick
I mean I think the thing your diffic in
CERN about is actually relaxation
mechanisms in that case because the
energy you have to relax is much smaller
right so one of the things that
photosynthesis is working for it you get
this initial kick of energy you go up a
huge amount and then you just play
around in this like large energy square
whereas if you push down where that
excitation rifle is all the way over
here you have a very you have a larger
chance of losing the energy that you
initially got yeah so then you would I
mean I think you would lose all quantum
maybe I shouldn't be so John because I
haven't done the simulations but I think
well I I believe it about these systems
but I don't believe that an artificial
or or infrared absorbing system
named typography
yeah yeah so we are very much inspired
by that work and so the artificial
systems we think of as actually a
aggregates that are in case within a
protein so that the protein degree
freedom is an additional degree of
freedom front from these these other
older aggregates that were engineered
yeah
and my future lies home janitor here at
last
yeah okay so first we haven't thought
about Matt using micro tools because so
that there are certain advantages that
tobacco mosaic virus because we know the
synthesis pathways we know exactly how
it how it a great sand so on or how it
self-assembles I'm not sure it's so I'm
not in the sentences expert so I don't
know if that the same thing is known for
microtubules the other thing is that
this is not and this is not a natural
thing for me to make these viruses to do
right they don't actually have chroma
falls in them what goes up that helical
chain is actually the RNA so what you've
done is you've stripped away the RNA
where the normally the RNA would bind
and actually bound these chroma Falls so
the the question about what in natural
in nature they wouldn't have chroma
falls attached to them is what I'm
saying and also we're more interested in
the quantum properties of the
chromophore themselves rather than the
protein the tobacco mosaic virus protein
the protein is really the environment
for the chromophore so we're interested
in not necessarily engineering the
quantum properties of the protein which
is a very difficult task because it's
just a large structure but rather the
quantum properties of the chromophore
does that answer the question
okay
okay I so my expertise is in synthesis I
mean this is the this is the expertise
that the lab that we work with has but
I'd be happy to hear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
