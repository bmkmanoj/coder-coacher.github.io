was this kind of question about for
formal analysis of languages and we did
system on this was answer investors like
this body finish but the basic idea that
you owned by the things you can kind of
logical form and then generate SQL
series and this car Universal query but
one of the clear problem socially
coverage of red bike presumably on
yesterday to mention so backing and then
really help and that was also actually
my personal motivation move machine that
because i was in traditional way i doing
the rules by that mentor but they were
also creating problems they make
programming degree in preciseness wanted
fergie our subjectivity so I very much
liked choices and personal mention it
business and I have learned with us that
actually ever be 91 when where I
modeling work sample talk and small and
things like that so so that's that's but
that's not a sophisticate decided I
acknowledge the current level of
conversing understanding the moment
where I actually change also many of the
desi emotional is used eastern aspects
of the continuity which is still feel
that I somehow feel lacking some of the
aspects related to the kind of whore
contest reality is being understood in a
continued
in a fabulous place referring for
example that that we have a theory on
fossil fuels places so flexible morning
transitional EP is only partial so I
could be very interesting well that well
Manti Te'o Braga was the nice form let
them
ground or create a theory of semantics
but i think it was severely india
because of the very strong emphasis on
conscience and abilities really called
partial now visual domain just a bit
like the examples from we had these
options here we have four options and
then we think this is visual I'm a deer
but when I see in the context we see
that is it's really white even though we
can categorize it without the voters
wouldn't be white points at least
authority of the substance which is
there so if the given conclusions is
that specimen is really necessary and
useful to improve the coverage and then
related to what we're moving told about
the graph using straits moments away
free test by dismissal a very was really
my weapons tiny my son yes sir yes sir
channel and one of those experiences I
really became concerned about the strong
they use some of the theories on one
traditional civil coaching and I rather
but I would think about that really big
theory of semantics
the bracelet is develop realistic in the
sense that the ink rather simply film
representation as itself is not an
appropriate funding for me but it really
requires something else then of the
conclusions here is that supervised
learning is often used in order to learn
something blended families assuming a
theory of language even if I panic here
so we need to have in context physical
so frugal and we don't have annotated we
don't have labels like what norris and
workplace and whatever they have to
emerge from the end and that sense the
experience designer even with very short
day by the way just work on this we
learned about many things and that's
that's why i had my weight the relatives
english arguments in the former champion
school so we are able to learn so weak
1990s viel dimension data collection of
inanimate any a thousand etc etc and
when we take a 15 year three further the
next thing I mentioned was subject in it
so we have the problem opportunity but
subjectivity so I know I think that
empirically we can't really assume that
any of us would have the same
interpretational basis funny thing
say up here and that's why we actually
have to be late with the model the
conceptual basis of human beings being
different from these and distal
interpretation feed on the approximate
and then only when we when the Gulf
mapping is close enough in some my damn
suit against them then we are really
getting understanding and then the
understanding is not the cabling
probably approaching but it's really
property of me more continuous basis
functions so net next step to the multi
modality aspects so mistakes a stupid
was a movement so they are so common two
weeks pods that he tricked it when
successfully being fatal situation
occurs then we do sign language analysis
in our research group and go into the
details related in that the patterns
there and so on our researchers were
there they do research on animation and
motion capture so
but here I don't that was the product of
a distillation so many of you may have
seen in presentation here this
connection that they be taken off but I
rematch in it but actually for humans
and animals recent problem we have to be
able to with the movement which we are
confusing to fight etc and then there's
this extreme example different planet
animal that transforms itself into work
well and needing some small break in the
process but our focus is in human
movement another interesting aspect is
that we may need invaded white from the
very bottom see what we want to think
about the continuous movement in such a
way that the starting point is not been
in the categorization but really do then
from that phenomena and and one of the
things were such activities that we
don't want to say that a particular kind
of movement is walking by definition of
swimming voice growing for whatever but
it is a subjective point subjective
distribution
over those patterns move extensively
hypodermis of movements international
container space and then we have
patterns of usages of words and
expressions over and none of those uses
of words is taken as a trans with but
it's more like the distribution that we
want to learn about in the end there's
been very with the work being created
webs a movement what they do various
this is a hand movement and he used that
units to walk formalized be used in any
old way of determining some of those
underlying concepts and being actually
want to be more civilized or less
supervised in the sense or less manual
in the theater formation but anyway
continued mystics tells us that possible
walking is something to say that has
multiple dimensions and then there are
people who like linguist Rona Berger who
is trying to gain ground in after a
strip club over littletonco so this car
works life enter and the our ages to be
with language and movement in such a way
that we prefer some huge language to
generate animations and movement in such
a way or then we can put some background
expressions
different languages using movement as a
graffiti so the car that scene is based
off of a training program detective
movements with the basis for machine
translation but now whether who's got
two people come together thank you so
I'm going to talk about some of our
ongoing work on learning relations so
first many words that we use don't
describe object categories like cars but
properties of object like three or soft
or whatever but rather a combination of
objects and so some extreme examples of
perceptual relations to follow for
example this is my one case than the
other face watch it then what can we
really say about when we don't know
there is a polo speed and well we need a
you know if a philosophy then we know
that if we know the location of B that
is also nearby with a very high
probability and we can also note that we
don't need to know very much about a to
be able to make birdies and another
example is conveying so if we have some
kind of container like a bag for example
we can take any object and as long as
the containment relation close we can
move the bed wherever we want them when
we open the back the thing which is
inside is hope
there we all know this but yeah so we
are trying to formalize this inside the
way that pro staffer ditional definition
of our relation is that a relation is an
N place predicate that inside the true
or false or some argument so we have a
MBA and relation R and their goals or
doesn't then you're set of rules that L
operation it so if you say that you know
that a plus B then it might follow that
that if we know that in Sierra Nevada be
then it follows that in Sierra Nevada
guess what but this is quite difficult
to apply in a perceptually but setting
because this is publicly discreet so we
are doing these definitions like that
its head and say that the important part
is actually the prediction so if we can
predict something from from we know
about or let's take the front beginning
so when we know that the relation holds
its in x and y and we can protect
something about X from Y that we can't
predict from XO low and we do this
exactly symmetrical severe it is the
definition a symmetric with that but we
implement is exactly symmetrical so we
have a learning algorithm for for
movement data where we have x and y
which represent different objects and
then we learn relations using a
labyrinth of arrival model that
observers the changing correlation
structure between the variables so at
each time and its relation there is a
correlation signal RT that tells of how
collective is the relation
particular value and this produces a
very fast I threat to the algorithm but
so far we are when we apply to simulate
emotional after the sample so we have
these green agents and they are they are
walking around here in this space where
they live and some of them are hungry
and are chasing this case so you can see
all of the cakes are moving that doesn't
happen very often in the real world but
computer simulation these gates and may
become batters so if you see that this
guide is going here towards the corner
there is no cake if we probably not
hungry but this bed on the other hand
you see started out here and then is
turning at this cake is also moving is
probably targeting that day so are we
tries to figure out when which pairs of
agents are marked are targeting a cage a
particular point in time and here is a
result so the green is the ground truth
so it's one when the relation is known
to be active and then it's 0 otherwise
and the blue one is is the estimated our
casino so we see that if all of my
Cuellar is what works the 0 quite noisy
but but then is active only where the
relation
give that dangerous tough time so
that it allows us to generalize for a
completely unseen object bears so that
if I know that something is following
something else I don't need to know
anything about the object categories
really except that maybe they are
physical objects if there's an alien
from outer space and it's following me I
can pick any further pretty well and
then related to much of that has been
said in this workshop that we you leave
you with this thought that that
metaphoric relation generalization which
is something that is not happening
linguistic where you applied one concept
from one domain to another completely
different domain that you can describe
fly mass movement like time flies of the
weather maybe that is some kind of
automatic discovery of compatible test
for multitask learning so that will be
taking this relation maybe one step
further maybe you can show the previous
five ten photo/jeff discussant we made a
fan for sleep
a great thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
