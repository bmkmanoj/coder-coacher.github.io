hope that I can convince some of you
that I'm not totally nuts
they got relation of philosophy
mathematics and physics is truly curious
the involved brings together three
people who are usually not thought of
together the big bit consign philosopher
and mathematician who will hear more
about as we go along
- bald wheeler who was a an eminent
theoretical physicist primarily working
in gravity but also as we will see
instrumental in a philosophy of quantum
mechanics and David Foster Wallace is a
notable author and writer a but who
unfortunately committed suicide in 2008
shortly after that suicide I googled
David Foster Wallace which is the way
everyone starts anything these days and
I found first thing I found was his
address to the graduates of Kenyon
College in 2005 this has led to a book
called what the hell is water and a book
repeats his address one sentence at a
time on each page so they could fill up
a book it's something which would have
horrified David Foster
Wallace I think the title of the book is
what the hell is water when I pulled it
off the internet it was in the public
domain
it has since vanished from the internet
and vanished from the public domain so
you have to watch for these things there
are a lot of things like that I found in
this anyway to do it refers to a quote
from from David Foster Wallace from this
address there are these two young fish
swimming along and they happen to be an
older fish swimming the other way who
nods at them and says morning boys house
of water and the two young fish swim on
for a bit and eventually one of them
looks over at the other and goes what
the hell is water and the idea of course
if one did what it's everywhere around
you and completely obvious you all have
to be outside it to recognize it and for
the quantum fields eros in our midst I
mean it's equivalent to asking what the
hell is a vacuum state David Foster
Wallace and his first novel was a novel
called Infinite Jest which is suitable
for propping children up to the dinner
table it's two and a half three inches
thick thousands of pages and extremely
clever he after Infinite Jest he he he
wrote a number of articles for Harper's
yeah in the period after infinite jest
and even before one of the most famous
which is I I don't know if it's tilting
the public domain or not it's the one
that is he followed the first George
Bush campaign okay
in 2000 and wrote I wrote a journalistic
article for Rolling Stone about that the
after after Infinite Jest he he did not
start another novel for some time as a
matter of fact his of last novel his has
just been published posthumously and
Baron in between he wrote this booklet
as he called it called everything and
more as a compact compact history of
infinity the book begins it it's written
in David Foster Wallace style so it has
lots and lots of footnotes and the first
footnote is of interest here your author
here is someone with a medium strong
amateur interest in math and formal
systems he is all someone who disliked
and did poorly in every math course he
ever took say one which wasn't even in
college but which was taught by one of
those rare specialists who can make the
abstract alive and urgent and who
actually really talks to you when he's
lecturing and of whom anything that's
good about this booklet is a pale and
well meant imitation that's a very
interesting disclaimer and one which the
the pure mathematician or the
well-trained mathematician has to keep
in mind it's not really a book about
mathematics
it's a everything and more is it book
about the danger
of abstract thought abstract thought is
according to David Foster Wallace
abstract thinking tends most often to
strike during moments of quiet repose as
in for example in the early morning
especially when you wake up slightly
before the alarm goes off when it can
suddenly and for no reason to occur to
you that you've been getting out of bed
every morning without the slightest
doubt that the floor would support you
now this plight of the of the the
abstract thinking it's the dyslexic
agnostic insomniac who lies awake all
night wondering if there's a dog that's
pretty funny it and also worries we'll
the floor support me now why would the
floor is supported you every morning
when you got up for thousands of
mornings and look it presumably you're
not really worried about you supporting
me this morning but you don't have a
proof you don't have a proof that what
might happen to you what happened to
cousin may cause some primal termite
knocked on wood tasted it and found it
good and that is why your cousin may
fell through the parlor floor today that
could happen to you but you don't worry
about it
unless you're a dyslexic instant
insomniac agnostic the problems of
philosophy and mathematics the first
that we've got to hear this this is
David Foster Wallace's order here at
length about the Greeks about
particularly Ailey attic le attics Zeno
who was the most famous is his
predecessor Pierre amenities who was his
teacher and Zeno proposed for paradoxes
most of which all of us think were
completely resolved by us by the studies
of motion in the in the 18th century by
by Newton by all his successors I mean
the one one of these was how do you get
across the street if you can't get half
way because if you get half way you must
have been half way to half way and so
forth and so forth and so forth out
infinitum and you got an infinite number
of terms and how do you how do you know
it comes out that you can get across the
street and of course you know the the
someone like Plato would just get up and
walk across the room and say there
that's how you do it you don't work me
about the the this is the kind of
situation where the mathematician
philosopher gets out of bed and that I
really love the Monty Python philosopher
song that many of you may know the
lyrics and recognize them but it's very
irreverent and somewhat on the money in
Plato these because it's a drinking song
of course and Plato they say could stick
it away half a crate of whiskey every
day
Aristotle Aristotle was a bugger for the
bottle he also formalized logic
and at one of the peaks of this his is
the work of of Euclid there aren't even
any stone statues of Euclid anywhere as
a matter of fact he's a very shadowy
existence it's not clear exactly in what
sense there ever was a Euclid although
his book The Elements was used as a
geometry textbook my father used it as a
geometry textbook in in high school and
Euclid fell he followed this
Aristotelian idea that he made
definitions and then you made axioms
about how the things went together and
the things he defined were points lines
planes things like that intersections of
lines and this he founded geometry and
he put it on a logical basis and that's
how most of us actually had our first
introduction to what constitutes any
kind of a logical proof is geometry the
definition of a point is I don't think
has ever been improved on from Euclid
nobody knows what one is exactly but
it's that according to Euclid it's that
which has no part that is it is that
thing which cannot be subdivided somehow
and that's that's about as good as we
can do but Euclid made great progress in
in axiomatic structure of connecting
points to to them to reality usually
when I do this I have another prop
that I couldn't bring with me from
Florida because he couldn't I'm sure you
can't take it on an airplane yeah
there's a box of objects I bought for a
dollar at the at the disposal counter at
an office depot
it's called mathematical tools I thought
everyone should have a box of
mathematical tools and the first thing
it has in there is a point maker then
it's a pencil of course it's that you
put on the paper and it it makes a point
but of course according to Euclid what
all you got to do is imagine the pencil
with no lead and that's that's what
makes a point it has only its location
and he also had things which there are
things in there that would that baffled
the Greeks baffled me for that matter
that Plato was bothered by the fact that
if you make a right triangle with equal
sides the hypotenuse has length the
square root of the square root of two
times the length of a side and he could
make he could draw a picture of a
isosceles right triangle but he couldn't
he couldn't figure out how much was the
square root of two he couldn't there was
no representation of it other than this
and the problem is and it's of course
it's an irrational it's an algebraic
irrational number and that just the
decimal expansion goes on and on and on
forever never stops never really beats
and so forth and that was in the box of
mathematical tools too as was a
straightedge and several other things
including a compass which I'm sure it'd
be the thing that would block you and
taking it on the airplane because it's
got a sharp point I didn't ever try it
we were that rough as sometimes
what happens if they impound
mathematical tools to keep with all
their all their knives the end of the
finally the Greeks it comes down to the
pretty much the last of them was
Archimedes Archimedes of Syracuse this
is a painting from the from the 17th
century and it's supposed to be
Archimedes in thought and there are many
anachronisms as a matter of fact
virtually everything is an anachronism
there were Archimedes wrote on Scrolls
or he'd get he's scribbling in the sand
this actually the work of Archimedes is
there's recent interest in one of these
Google lectures at one time was about
the Archimedes codex I don't know if
anyone was here for that but the the
codex is a book whose pages are made of
parchment which is scraped out leather
and this this this codex was written
over in the it was originally copied
from a scroll an Archimedean scroll
probably in those 7th century sometime
Archimedes when he did his work when he
wrote down all his things he actually
computed the to several decimal places
the perimeter of a circle of unit radius
and he did this by by
inventing essentially calculus it's
essentially the epsilon-delta method he
just got closer and closer and closer he
lower bounded and upper bounded it by
regular poly polygons and got finally
what he reckoned was close enough but
all these things were written on scrolls
this particular codex was one of the
scrolls on one of the scrolls that he
shipped off to the great library in
Alexandria to his friend
Aristophanes who ended subsequently the
course the scroll was destroyed as was
everything but it something survived at
least to the point where in the 7th
centuries someone copied it onto a
parchment codex which is like a book and
the the codex was eventually turned into
a prayer book which is why there's a
fold down the middle the Archimedean
tech runs along the the minor axis and
the the the book the book text runs the
grub book text in a Greek runs along the
major act and I look texting lap excuse
me it was all all painted over and
carefully illuminated and they the
lecture here at Google was by the people
who cleaned off and scrubbed the Codex
and read it eventually and found out
what it said which is but these things
were shipped back and forth around the
Mediterranean and it's often said that
Roman principal Roman contribution to
mathematics was the assassination of
Archimedes he was killed during the
siege of Syracuse a Roman soldier
had orders to bring Archimedes before
the before the Roman Conqueror and
Archimedes said he was busy and he
talked to him later
and so the soldier killed him because
you don't just hunt the government and
that kind of ended things for 1,400
years through the through the Dark Ages
and things didn't really awake until
well I give Descartes a lot of credit
for coming coming to life bringing it to
life he he was the one who said really
that abstract thought was part of his
personality that is part of what made
Descartes Descartes was I think
therefore I am which either there's a
story of Rene Descartes he's in a bar
having a drink he finishes his drink the
bartender says we have another mr.
Descartes he said I think not and
vanished
my buddy Pythian says I drink therefore
I am it to people arrived on the scene
at approximately the same time with
similar ideas and the two mathematicians
physicists philosophers all three who
really not only got out of bed and had
the floor support them but they danced
the on the floor Newton said this
this peculiar statement down here has
all kinds of symbols in it that no one
had thought of before a matter of fact
Newton I mean I don't know the cincin he
says there's an equation there are dot R
is a fluent according to Newton and r
dot is a Fluxion according to Newton we
call them functions and derivatives now
on the on the right hand side is a limit
as delta T goes to 0 now something going
to zero says it's reciprocal is infinite
so it's again another backhanded
infinity coming in and appears in the
compact history of infinity in fact it's
probably the part of days of the the
everything and more that's really the to
me the best is when he does discuss
calculus which he does in a couple of
pages the the other giant of this time
is Gottfried Leibniz and I'm going to
bypass what he said for a few minutes
and jump through roughly a hundred and
fifty years when serious mathematics has
become a part of everything part of all
reason part of all philosophy part of
everything that was going on and I'm
going to just do this discussion with
the with a new guide with someone to
help David Foster Wallace alone and our
guide is going to be Bertrand Russell
and Russell wrote and remarkable
autobiography
that covers his his whole life and it
was all in three their only unfortunate
part about it is that he wrote it as
autobiographies just about always have
to be written during your lifetime and
and he wanted to protect a lot of people
whose reputation he didn't want
slandered because by the time virgin
Russell died he was he was viewed as as
a paragon of evil
particularly in the United States so he
didn't want to slander a lot of people
particularly women and other
philosophers so he left him out of the
autobiography but fortunately we have an
alternative autobiography thought oh but
not alternative biography which is a
thing that's different in every respect
from its logic comics it's this thing
this book which is which is by reckoning
of its authors a comic book it's a
graphic novel it's a graphic story and
it's a it's a very good story by the way
this shows you another thing that's
really screwy about copyright laws and I
know they're dear to the hearts of
Google but they're in logic comics every
time Bertrand Russell appears with his
pipe he has it in his right hand here he
has it in his left hand all pictures
that I could find photographs I could
find a Bertrand Russell with his pipe
where copyright protected if he had it
in his left hand he has it in his right
hand you can use them you figure that
Lajja comics here is the cast of
characters at logic comics which is
which is supposed to be the role of
logic in the affairs of Man that is the
curious relation of logic mathematics
and physics and he says you know really
in the affairs of Man if I gave this
lecture on that subject alone it would
be the shortest lecture of all time
because there is no logic in the affairs
of may so instead he says I'm going to
tell you a story and it's a rattling
good story it's a story of my life in
logic and therefore that's forth it's
it's pretty much all logic comics is
pretty much all fiction based on fact
the authors of logic comics relied
heavily on the two biographies of Ray
monk himself a philosopher in England
the biography of Wittgenstein and the
biography of Russell the liberties that
were taken took Russell from from
England through Europe with his first
wife Alice who is a lady with the funny
hat in the background they went to
Europe in 1900 which they really did but
did not but logic Comics has him
visiting visiting in the flesh yeah
Fraga and also visiting Canada neither
one of which he ever met
and the the trip through England brought
him in contact with all these he and
whitehead
the finished principia mathematica
and the it was sold that he and
Whitehead had to pay for the publication
was him the publisher wouldn't deal with
it and but but print copy I did did
circulate and in in the logic comics he
has visited by by Ludwig Wittgenstein
who came to him by way of Fraga to study
logic Geritol I guess at briefly in 1944
before he went back to England but in
the main is it's just a good story and
not much of it mean if the the seamy
parts of all his romances I think are
probably all in either in his
autobiography to some degree or in the
biography by Remo
in any case Wittgenstein was entranced
by the the problem that that was
unsolvable the the the Russell the
Russell's paradox about the village
where the barber there's only a single
barber in the village and that barber
shaves everyone who doesn't shave
himself and the question is does the
barber shave himself yes and if he does
he doesn't if he doesn't he does that
the Russell's paradox and Wittgenstein
Russell and everyone thought that this
was a that this was a solvable problem
and I
that for some reason it skipped that
page and Wittgenstein was I'm going to
put that up for a minute because
Wittgenstein spent his spent the first
world war in the German army and was in
the in the trenches he he wrote a thing
which he eventually brought back to to
Cambridge and was he said that he had
had completely resolved all problems of
logic this thing was eventually named by
GE Moore who was Russell's colleague at
Cambridge was the name attracted
Tractatus logico-philosophicus and it's
a very strange document it's available
on the internet you can download it it's
not copy protected and Russell and the
publishers looked at it and said this is
actually word-for-word part of the
abstract the abstract has seven has
seven lines in it he calls it an
abstract and the if each of these leads
somewhere there are fuse some cases only
a few sentences for the four these lines
in some cases there might be a page most
of the actual philosophical meet the
actual logic resides in four or five and
six I the I didn't put those up although
he tried to express them in words it
just it really you did didn't you
it's the eventual result was that
Russell had to write a preface for
Tractatus the publisher said they
wouldn't take it unless Russell
certified that there was something to it
so at least in one of the in one of the
in one of the things that's available on
the internet you can find Russell's
introduction to the tracked artist which
is about the same length as the track
TARDIS itself but which many say is the
only part that makes sense
that you can understand what Russell
said that he's really hard to understand
webkinz time the would consign zone
synopsis however is is interesting that
this he gives in his introduction to it
what can be said it all can be said
clearly whereof one cannot speak thereof
one must remain silent that is there the
fact that there is an elephant in the
room in the person of of Russell's
paradox and wasn't it's related friends
you just ignore it and go on and you can
do a lot of useful things even when you
ignore the fact that there's this
paradox residing in the background now
for the record logic comics and
everything and more and on the same note
with respect to infinite sets with
respect to the curious relation of
philosophy mathematics and physics that
Geritol encounter both died in
confinement bequeathing a world with no
finite circumference one that spins now
in a new kind of formal void and
mathematics continues to get out of bed
following Wittgenstein's dictum
is ignore the hurdle girls contribution
of course was the incompleteness paradox
that if with every every logical every
set of logical rules there exists
unprovable undecidable propositions
which are themselves tautologies and
should be part of the should be part of
the fabric if you're going to get the my
paraphrase is that with with logic you
get the truth and nothing but the truth
you just don't get the whole truth and
but back to this parallel universe which
i think really is different Lyda nuts
might have said in if I were to write a
logic Comics I put liveness in there
saying this exactly that the derivative
of a function is itself a function which
is the derivative and that function is a
function of a complex variable that f of
Z plus Delta Z minus f of Z divided by
Delta Z is f Prime and that F of Z all
functions have both a real and an
imaginary part and that is to say F of Z
the derivative of F of Z also is a
function and you put those two things
together now the same hundred-and-fifty
that wideness didn't say that he did
define he did define the f of z DF DZ to
be a function he understood that it's
not this business of fluent equals
Fluxion it's one function equals another
function they're the same thing and that
again this is the same hundred and fifty
years passed and in the same 150 years
things were pretty much the same as they
were with with newton's view
but what about this x squared equals
minus one thing and some said it was
just a matter of convenience some like
all the engineers call it J some took it
seriously and among the people who took
it seriously our Koshi riemann on
through my idol the arnold sommerfeld
there's a straight line to John
Archibald wheeler the Sommerfeld
sovereign Sommerfeld had the most
remarkable set of students and research
associates that anyone ever had he had
four Nobel laureates 20 or so of which
were were were famous in their own right
beyond you know the famous Peter Debye
people like that I mean I was that the
list ISM is incredible and he also had
some research associates who were quite
well known one of those Research
Associates was Hertzfeld who was
wheelers advisor his thesis supervisor
at Johns Hopkins and wheeler himself had
quite a remarkable set of students among
whom were it was at North Carolina and
Richard Fineman of Caltech and a number
of other quite notable students I pulled
out this quote because this is this is
this is typical typical wheeler that
Fineman I know why all electrons have
the same charge because they're the same
electron and what he was talking about
was that if you need to draw the path of
us of a single electron through space
and time and you imagine that the single
electron can go both forward and
backward in time then if you take a
slice in time across you get you get
it's all the same electron so they must
all have the same charge because that
some of the times it's going forward
sometimes going backward and everybody
realized well it takes you whiz you know
that means that that there are such
things as a as an antiparticle of an
electron and a that they they asked they
said you know there's going to be as
many positive charges as negative
charges and and that's a typical wheeler
he ignored the elephant in the room and
he says well maybe they're stuck on the
protons or something so I the of in
those nineteen late 1980s wheeler became
very interested in quantum computing and
he wrote a paper which is has also goes
in and out of the public domain called
it was that infernal IBM's a symposium
and it's I don't understand the paper
but I do understand his puzzles the
papers call world as a self synthesis as
a system self synthesized by quantum
networking I think you know you might
call it tracked otic tracked oddest
logical and mechanicus the if they if
the world is founded on a discrete why
does every work add a description of it
have to employ the continuum how does
this quantum state function get into the
act how do we reconcile the demand for
structure with the demand for austerity
austerity I think simply means that you
have the minimum absolute minimum number
of axioms to get anywhere which is
probably one and how to derive time
without presupposing time all
philosophical puzzles and all we need is
an austere timeless statement of quantum
mechanics now hidden might what I have
been trying to do and what I'm doing
here is trying to to engender a point of
view of quantum mechanics that's
consistent with my thesis supervisors
book the elementary quantum mechanics by
David Saxon I have been trying for
several years to make myself a webpage
which has a lot of things on it like a
lot of the things that we're in this
talk that are in or that yet not yet on
there I don't know what's going to
happen to it I don't know what's going
to happen to it because I did it with
with I web and the and I on mobile me
where you get a web page sort of for
free
and Apple is ending all of that so my
web page will end and I don't know where
we'll go
but at the present moment it's on there
and so is elementary quantum mechanics
that Dave before he died gave to gave
the copyright to just you really opened
it up he gave it to us that you can do
anything whether you want one of the
things I have done is to you can
download it off my webpage which the
important part of the structure is that
very early on Dave Saxon introduces the
notion of the debroglie wave function
for a structuralist point particle
labeled by a coordinate X he says he
breaks down the familiar form of the
Devourer wave function it is a
time-dependent plane wave and says so
know there be no misunderstanding we
stayed as emphatically as possible that
the quantum mechanical rabbit is already
in the Hat
once equation one is accepted and
understood that is this is the single
thing that defines quantum mechanics
this is not what we're used to but it's
the way this this book is developed and
in relatively short order Saxon shows us
that the the time-dependent wave
function can be a superposition the in
general is a superposition of these
debroglie waves and that the time
derivative of the integral of size star
saw is zero
something which you can easily establish
for yourself confirming that X is a
continuous random variable now the trick
with this time derivative is for those
who are you have to slip the time
derivative under the under the integral
sign and find some relation between the
time derivative of SCI and its spatial
derivatives which is supposed to be a de
Broglie wave and that that confirms that
the acts in the in the de Broglie wave
if the position variable as it's called
here's a random variable a continuous
random variable we know it's continuous
is that it you can you can you can even
make it a complex variable if you're
going to talk about derivatives in a
sense of like nuts where the derivative
of a function is itself a function then
you have to take it you have to think of
it as a complex variable and but it's
confirmed as a continuous random
variable and one which can be
analytically and analyzed as a complex
variable and it the probability the the
integral of size star saw over all
values of X which I just said there's
some domain that is equal to the equal
to the sum of the complex conjugate the
the amplitude its x that flowed to the
piece of s by a star a piece of s as you
can which you can easily work out for
yourself which that confirms piece of s
also as a random
a discrete random variable with
probability a star a so this is what
section says is the heart of quantum
mechanics is this next step do these by
the way are not axioms these are just
theorems from so that this statement
that the de Broglie wave is the is the
is the heart the rabbit in the Hat of
quantum mechanics is I think mean
there's that's the only thing you have
to its an austere timeless statement of
quantum mechanics I'd like to go on and
on and on but that's probably enough I
hope I can encourage some of you to
eventually look at my website which will
be somewhere sometime and maybe could
this be water thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
