well not quite at the Google faculty
summit three or four years ago I don't
exactly remember but actually a couple
months before that when the then vice
provost of undergraduate education at
Stanford invited a group of us would
been award winning faculty to come and
talk about how we might change the way
in which we teach a Stanford so as to
open up more time in the curriculum for
actual engagement between faculty
members and students as opposed to just
have a one-sided communication where the
professor lectures in an auditorium for
300 students and there were a bunch of
us in the room and the bunting ideas
were thrown around nothing really
clicked and then a couple of months
later I was not in this building and
another building google keeps expanding
i guess and and listening to talk about
youtube and realized that it didn't
really make sense for me to come in to a
room to give the same lecture that I'd
been given for 15 years telling the same
jokes at the same time and then have
that be the interaction that I have the
students and at the idea that came sort
of almost full fledged into my mind at
that point in time was why if we took
that lecture and put it online but in a
much more engaging format so a lot of
the ideas that Peter mentioned that
eventually ended up being part of this
project were some of the initial ideas
have came up at that point in time the
shorter video modules that were more
focused on shorter concrete
self-contained topics so eight to twelve
minutes the interaction within the video
stream so the students are constantly
questioned and i'll show the example in
video quizzes in a moment the social
interaction between the students around
the material which is so absent from
today's classrooms all that was sort of
part of the vision that I then went with
to both google who graciously funded
some of that initial effort as well as
to President John Hennessy who gave an
even larger amount of money
and and then that basically led to the
development of a lot of the ideas that
ended up manifesting in these three
Stanford online classes that Peter
mentioned that went up in the fall of
two thousand eleven now at the same time
my colleague and rowing who was one of
the people to offer these one of these
fruits free online classes came at it
from the direction which ended up I
think getting the bulk of the attention
of this effort which is the how do we
get information to be how do we get high
quality course content to be available
to everyone around the world for free
how do we change the dynamics how do we
change the world so that people
everywhere around the world have access
to the kind of education that currently
is only available to a tiny sliver of
the world's population will happen to be
enrolled in institutions such as the
ones where we teach and so Andrew and I
basically merged efforts a couple years
ago we ended up developing a lot of the
ideas that that made their way into this
project and I'll tell you a little bit
about that today although some of it
will really echo some of the ideas that
Peter already talked about so I'll try
and go through it a little bit fast so
first let me talk about the need maybe
this is obvious to people but the need
for education is a really drastic thing
right now around the world and let me
talk about two of the problems that baby
you're familiar with the first is just
lack of availability in large parts of
the world to high-quality education one
of the most poignant examples of that
occurred in South Africa at the
beginning of 2012 where the educational
system in South Africa was geared for
the white minority and so there just
aren't enough positions at the state
universities to accommodate the much
larger population that now wants and
deserves a higher education and so after
the standard enrollment process at the
University of johannes berg had closed
there were a handful of positions left
open and there was a line of people a
mile long outside the gate before they
were going to open those positions
because every of all those people who
wants to be first in line to get one of
those slots and when the gates opened in
the morning there was a stampede and 20
people were injured and one woman died
she was the mother of a son and she
literally died to try and give her son a
chance at a better life
now that of course is real tragedy and
is not that common we hope but the
scarcity that underlies that is a real
problem many parts of the world closer
to home in the United States we now
haven't heard about this until recently
we've heard a lot about the rising cost
of medical care everybody talks about
that what is less commonly known is that
college tuition and fees have gone up at
almost twice the rate so since 1985 by
about five hundred and fifty-nine
percent so that makes education
unaffordable for a very large number of
people even here within the United
States so how do we use technology to
help address some of those issues and
one way is by doing a hundred thousand
to one which which we've already talked
about so in Andrews class he teaches
machine learning at Stanford one of the
larger Stanford courses has 400 students
every time it's offered when Andrew
thought machine learning to the general
public he had over a hundred thousand
students so if you think about that in
order to reach the size audience and it
would have had to teach his stanford
class for 250 years which means he will
get really bored by the internet so how
do we exploit this power of a hundred
thousand one well it turns out that we
can do that because once you take really
great course content and put it out
there for free people keep coming in
droves our current registrar current
enrollment rate is about 30,000 students
per day enrolling we're now at eight
hundred and ninety thousand students
from pretty much every country around
the world 2.3 million course enrollments
116 courses from 16 universities so
there is a real need for this and people
keep coming but it's not just about the
numbers individual people are really
where what it's about and we get these
amazing emails from people about how
this type of courses changing their
lives by giving them access to something
that they would never have had had
access to before and I can list hundreds
of these but I won't single mom of two
teenage boys wanting to go back to
there's hundreds of these that we could
talk about so what made these courses so
different I mean MIT opencourseware has
been around for a while iTunes U YouTube
edu all of these are great resources
what made be so different what why is
this so important ocean of deadlines
deadlines turns out to be really
important so the course it began on a
given day and then you can see the
spikes see the spikes of the traffic
that's the deadlines for cross the
nation is truly a global phenomenon um
and then the other thing is that at the
end the students got some kind of
certificate which we know they presented
to employers we know they presented to
institutions at which they were enrolled
students and actually bought course
credit for those and so that is
something that really gave them
something of value for the effort that
they put in and that was the other thing
that made this so impactful okay so what
are some of the elements that went into
these courses so the first is the
personalization of learning and we'll
talk a lot about personalization in
different points in this so by breaking
up the content into these little modules
of 8 to 12 minutes you can allow people
to traverse the curriculum in different
orders that better suit their learning
needs so you can have for example in
addition to different trajectories
through a basic course content you can
have you know prepare Tori content that
some students might need and others
might not you can have more advanced
content that talks about specific topics
that are of interest to some but not
others so basically that allows you to
move away from the one-size-fits-all of
education that we've had to enforce in
our students because of our need to
scale up to 200 students who are sitting
there in the auditorium so
personalization of the curriculum the
second and this is one of the papers in
addition to the bloom paper which I'll
come back to that had a lot of impact on
me this is a paper that talks about the
importance of practice and constant
practice in in the learning
in the learning format so this is a
paper that appeared in science in 2011
buy carpet can blunt it's actually the
comp it's one of a long series of papers
from this group and others and what it
shows our learning outcomes on the final
exam by people who just study the
material people who studied and review
the material people who study then did
this exercise a cognitive psychologists
really like called concept mapping about
how these different things fit together
and people who studied and had to be and
did a simple retrieval past after they
studied the material and even simple
retrieval testing turns out to give a
huge boost in performance scores not
just in memorization tests down the line
but also in conceptual test down the
line and so this is a really valuable
learning experience for the students in
terms of improving learning outcomes so
where do we put in interaction and
constant testing and that's where we've
put I think really the bulk of our
efforts so first there is the
interaction within the lecture itself so
these are the in-video quizzes which was
one of the things that you know I owe to
the Google faculty summit a few years
ago so I'm not going to turn on the
sound but basically if you heard the
sound heap this would this is caught
page from Michigan he's teaching you can
read the subtitles as he's talking the
video pauses the student gets asked the
question submits the answer told gets
told immediately that the answer is
incorrect tries again and this time
missed you can got it right there is an
optional explanation and then the
lecture on zombie now these are the
kinds of simple questions that is an
instructor you or I might ask in class
but what happens when we ask a question
in class eighty percent of the students
are still scribbling the last thing you
said there is that group in the back
that's on Facebook and then there's a
smarty pants in the front row who
answers the question before anyone else
at salford Thank You Alfred I was hoping
to be Peter but um and it's always the
same guy or girl and they answer the
question before pretty much anyone elses
even realize that a question has been
asked and then the lecture moves on here
every student has is forced to engage
with the material and has this retrieval
practice opportunity
now of course it's not about just these
really simple assessments in addition
there's real homeworks with real grades
and real deadlines we talked about that
so what kind of things can so the
question of course is it give real
homeworks who's gonna grade that who's
going to grade the work of a hundred
thousand students all right you don't
have 5,000 th so at least Stanford
didn't agree to fund that I tried but
they refused so so what can you graded
scale you can do multiple choice
obviously you can do numerical answers
you could do short answer is you saw an
example of that in the video a moment
ago using fairly simple text processing
you could do math including mathematical
expressions greater than both syntactic
as well as semantic equivalents you
could do programming and modeling
assignments I'll talk about that in a
minute and peer assessment is something
that we recently tried out in order to
allow grading at scale for the kinds of
open-ended critical thinking work that
is so central for example in the
humanities business medicine and others
so very briefly on structured output
basically that's the beauty of computer
science so you can actually grade
meaningful work in a scalable way so you
can grade pretty much any programming
language you can grade some client-side
some server side JavaScript you can
grade in the browser it turns out that
one of our faculty members is actually
writing a Python interpreter in
JavaScript so you can actually create
Python in the browser which would be
really cool you could also do not just
correctness testing using unit tests you
could also do more advanced assessments
such as timing memory use has set
performance so for example in my class
we had a spell checker from OCR data and
students were graded on how many
spelling mistakes they've caught and
corrected correctly and so you could do
all sorts of things like that um now
programming is not just for us computer
science geeks programming also comes up
in the sciences and in the engineering
discipline when you want to write
programs that are really models of
physical systems for example or in some
cases models of things that are economic
or social systems like financial models
or data analysis because you can grade
Excel spreadsheets in the same type of
structured output grading that you can
programming assignment
so let me show you an example of this is
from the cs one-on-one course that nick
parlante who's also here at Google
teaches the students supposed to do
color correction of that image on the
right they run it in the browser doesn't
quite not quite right so they get the
chance to try again I'll come back to
try again it's part of mastery learning
with Peter also mentioned and then
they're basically are told that their
output is correct and they can one so
what about the humanities and the social
sciences and so on and so forth
open-ended work is is something that
also needs to be dealt with and so
that's where we adopted a pipeline we
adopted the UM merged ideas from two
communities one is the idea of
calibrated peer review that education
researchers and educators have used in
small classes of 20 to 30 students and
the other is crowdsourcing such as on
Amazon Mechanical Turk and so by
combining ideas from these we basically
put in a pipeline that allows you to
grade open-ended work at a scale of tens
of thousands of students so first let's
talk about the education work this is a
paper from Sadler and good 2006 and it
shows that peer grading if carefully
constructed can actually correlate very
nicely with teacher assigned grades so
you can see a very nice correlation
between teacher grade and the pier
grades on the y-axis what's even more
interesting is if you incentivize
students correctly to self-assess their
own work the correlation gets even
better so students are really good at
assessing their own work since the
amount of time I won't go into the
details of the peer grading pipeline I'm
happy to answer questions about that let
me briefly talk about the social aspects
that Peter also mentioned this is from
the Princeton sociology 101 class
students decided to self-assemble on a
map showing where they are and you can
basically see the worldwide reach of
this and there is different formats in
which students interact so they interact
with each other on the Q&amp;amp;A forum and we
use a stack overflow model which
unfortunately is cut off on the left so
you can't see it but I'm sure you're all
familiar with it where students rank the
questions up and down and rank the
answers up and down this is really
critical for the kind of scalability if
you want the form to be usable
all for a hundred thousand students it
has to have that capability it also has
to have another capability that I'm not
showing you which is on detection of
semantically redundant questions so that
if a student types in a question that's
already been asked it automatically gets
pulled up and they basically realize
that the question has been asked and
avoid asking it which avoids which
reduces question fragmentation by an
order of magnitude or more um people
really thought that this was in fact a
more interactive format than most
face-to-face instruction so this is an
example comment on the forum about how
how this was more interactive than non
virtual courses now the other place
where students interactive was actually
in study groups students self assembled
into study groups are actually going to
show you the study groups for the
finance 101 class that for the finance
class from michigan that started out
this week there are 10 pages of study
groups Romania Toronto Indonesia Greece
London you know Vietnam basically every
country in the world is represented in
these study groups and some of them meet
physically to just talk about the
material others are purely virtual um
okay back to this so let me talk about
some of the promises of this from a
long-term perspective first there is the
opportunity to really understand human
learning human learning until now has
been a study of hypothesis driven work
people come up with hypotheses they
construct a case control group of about
20 students in each group in most cases
and then they do the experiment here we
have unprecedented data we collect every
single click where the student pauses
where they rewind what they watch at 1.5
x what they submit as the first time
they submit a question what they submit
the second time what did they do in the
middle every single thing is collected
at a scale of a hundred thousand
students or more so let's think about
what that can give you here is a
distribution of wrong answers from one
of Andrews machine learning assignments
answers happen to be pairs of numbers
you can grab them
two-dimensional plot every little X is a
different wrong answer the big so these
are one-offs the big x's are common
wrong answers so for example that top
left one is a place where 2,000 students
submitted the exact same wrong answer
now to students in a class of a hundred
submit the same wrong answer you'd never
notice but if 2,000 students do the
exact same thing then it kind of jumps
out at you and so and Andres DA's went
and looked at some of those wrong
answers realize that this was that the
students had inverted two lines of an
algorithm and gave a targeted error
message to any other assignment that
sounds that bucket the students would
get a tailored error message telling
them what they ought to think about in
order to correct their work
personalization once again um you can do
more clever things than that we started
to do some analytics so here is the
question of if you submitted a wrong
answer and then submitted a right answer
to a problem set what did you do in the
middle so you can ask that for example
regarding forum visits so which form
visits are the most helpful to move
students from the wrong answer to the
right answer and you can formulate this
as a probability of transitioning from
wrong to right then there is a formal
way of doing that and if you look at the
ones that satisfy that criteria you
basically get the exact forum questions
that really helped drill it on the
misunderstandings that are most common
and so that can be used either to tell
the instructor that they should have
explained this better or to tell the
students that if they're struggling with
this particular concept they might want
to go and look at this forum post or in
other cases of video and so on and so
forth so that brings us back to Peters
to Sigma problem a paper that was also
influential for me so I'm not going to
talk about this very much because Peter
already talked about the fact that the
lecture is one achievement distribution
mastery learning is one standard
deviation higher and personalized
instruction is two standard deviations
higher and so we get the Lake Wobegon
effect of ninety-eight percent of
students being above average now the
reason bloom called this the two sigma
problem is because we can't afford an
individual human tutor for every student
but we can afford maybe a computer at
least a smartphone for every student and
so the question is how far
remove us from the blue curve to the
green curve and mastery is actually easy
because the computer doesn't get tired
of showing you the same video five times
or even grading the same assignment five
times and so we can get to the red curve
and some of the ideas on personalization
that we're starting to play around with
might move us closer to the green curve
maybe not all the way but maybe close
enough that we can get some really
meaningful improvements and learning
outcomes they had one minute okay so
some of us might be thinking oh my god
if this is so great um do we still need
colleges right though do we still need
universities are we all out of a job and
that's a criticism that's come up Mark
Twain certainly thought that we were
redundant but I disagree with Mark Twain
I want to go even further back to
Plutarch who said that the mind is not a
vessel that needs filling but wood that
needs of mining and maybe what we ought
to be doing in our classes is something
that is more igniting the mines igniting
the imaginations teaching critical
thinking skills and basically that comes
back to the whole flipped classroom
model which was my original interest in
this and there's again a tremendous
wealth of studies that show that when
you do that when you have active
learning in the classroom this is by
Nobel Prize winning physicist Carl
lineman who shows that when you compare
lecture-based to active learning you get
an improvement of not five percent of
thirty percent in attendance in
engagement and in learning and we've
been doing this and some of our Stanford
classes including my own I can tell you
that these results hold up student
engagement is up students learning is
improved and I'm not going to go into
the details of this because I'm out of
time but it's been this is really the
way in which we ought to go back to
teaching because lecturing I think is a
thing that we ought to be moving away
from and going back to teaching the way
it should have been before we needed to
scale
