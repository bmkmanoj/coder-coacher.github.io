coming and I thank Google for hosting
this Tech Talk today and for Christine
Hong for sponsoring me to be with you
can you hear me okay okay I also want to
recognize that I have with me four of my
summer interns that are in various
tracks with their educational pursuits a
couple of firsts have completed their
first year in law school and a couple
our undergraduate communication majors
so it's been really fun to enjoy good
food here today and and have a great
tour I think I have four interns who are
considering career changes after
spending a few hours on the Google
campus it looks kind of like being at
Disneyland anyway I am Jennifer wall and
I am here today representing the Center
for Bioethics and culture I'm the
national director and founder of that
organization I also am a founding
director of a very interesting coalition
of a diverse group of people from both
sides of the political aisle and
religious divides and we organized some
almost three years ago now for an
international campaign called hands off
our ovaries which we thought was a way
to get people's attention
I don't deceive myself in any way to
think that all of you here today are
going to agree with me and I'm expecting
to have some interesting conversations
and questions at the end of my talk I've
been asked to repeat your questions for
the sake of the recording and I'll tell
you right up front I'm horrible at that
even though I have in the back of my
mind repeat the question so if I don't
think of it please feel free to make
your way to the microphone and then the
gentleman in the back will be very happy
that he was able to capture your
question and then my subsequent response
anyway I want to start by telling you a
story a week hardly a week goes by that
I don't get approached by some woman
family member mother sister daughter to
tell me about their own personal story
and part of the story is that the sad
reality as many of the story
I could tell you today have to be told
anonymously because so many women
families children are wrapped up in the
complexity of this issue and I have been
privileged to hear their stories often
times told in utter confidence because
they are trying to piece back their life
and the lives of others who have been
impacted but for the sake of my brief
story right now I'm going to call the
woman Debbie it's not uncommon for me to
speak publicly as I am today and then
have women come up afterwards to tell me
their story and I was speaking to a
large group of people giving them more
broader generic sort of Center for
Bioethics and culture talk where I
briefly touched upon the issues and the
concerns that I and my colleagues have
around the recruitment and exploitation
of young women for their eggs and Debbie
came forward to tell me her story that
she had been asked to be an egg donor
that she had considered what she thought
were the risks to doing that and was
told that what she was going to do was a
very safe procedure I could tell that
her hearing me speak that day was new
information to her as an I had never
heard this before she went on to talk
about getting it you hear a lot of girls
talk about I got it and Debbie said she
got it and she got it really bad and her
doctor told her she had it so bad she
had to be hospitalized she actually put
it on a scale of 10 being the worst
getting it to you know one not being bad
at all she said my doctor said I had a 9
out of 10 she went on to tell me then
after being hospitalized she went on to
donate her eggs and less than a year
later she was diagnosed with aggressive
cervical cancer had to undergo a total
hysterectomy and would never be able to
have her own children so it's because of
these types of stories and these women
that we meet that I stand before you
today and oftentimes I get out of bed
every day to raise awareness that young
women are being exploited for their eggs
I know that one of those sayings around
Google is do no evil this is a cartoon
that says how important are ethics in
today's society and of course ethics are
very important and ethics is a
discipline that primarily concerns
itself with not what can be done but
what should be done you know yes we can
screw our partners and we can conduct
ourselves unethically but should we do
that and the same thing with with the
matter of egg donation yes women can
donate their eggs they are donating
their eggs but the question that I want
to concern myself with and in the work
that I do is should women be doing this
and if you Google I just love being able
to be at Google saying that because
whenever I give this talk I say to
people this is why we have Google so
when you hear people talk you can go
home and find out if they told you the
truth and if you google egg donation you
will come up with thousands and
thousands of hits under egg donation but
in fact that's quite euphemistic
language because there's nothing about
donation predominantly yes there are
people who altruistically donate their
eggs that by and large large sums of
money are trading hands and this is a
young woman who I've traveled with
spoken on several platforms with this is
Julia Derek Julia Derek's written a book
with a provocative title called the
confessions of a cereal egg donor
Julia Derek donated her eggs twelve
times fourteen if you count two cycles
that had to be aborted because she was
so sick thing that they could not finish
the the cycles in donation Julia found
herself typical Americans story I hear
she was a student from Sweden arrived in
Washington DC did not have a green card
and did not know how she was going to
make ends meet she answered an ad in a
paper and went on to become what she
would call the serial egg donor
Julia writes in her book which she
became an egg donor because you can make
lots of money then she realized that
that wasn't the preferred answer that
good girls state so then when she would
go back to do it again she would say
because I want to help
oh and that she learned quickly but
Julie has been quite candid if you take
the money incentive out of the equation
young girls are not going to want to be
doing egg donation how did I come to be
at Google today speaking about egg
donation this is a relatively new
practice so for the interest of time I
will start with 1978 with the very
famous baby who made the news and her
name was Louise Brown is anybody in this
room heard of Louise Brown so if some of
you have heard Louise Brown is famous
because she's the first test-tube baby
and this month July 25th I believe marks
the 30th anniversary of her birth so in
1978 something significantly happened
science technology medicine wise and
that we were able for the first time
ever to take an egg out of a woman's
body sperm out of a man's body mix them
together in the petri dish in the test
tube in the lab and plant it back up
into mrs. brown's womb and Louise Brown
was born I think there was some 200 plus
attempts before Louise was born not on
mrs. Brown attempts on her pitous in
general in the practice of fertility
medicine and this is a picture of Louise
on the right who made the news I think a
year ago now then and she's become a mom
herself so this is Louise all grown up
with her baby and Louise did not have
infertility like her mother and had her
baby the old-fashioned way mrs. Brown
did not use an egg donor
it was mrs. Brown's egg but some quickly
five years later journaled in the an
article in journal magazine was
published with the first baby born
through egg donation so quickly again
the technology was becoming much more
efficient and we were now able to offer
people the ability to make babies by
using egg donation dr. Allen trouncing
was the fertility doctor he and his
colleagues actually published this
article in Nature at the time dr.
Townsend was head of fertility medicine
at Monash University down in Australia
what's interesting is now dr. Townsend
is here in California and he's a
president of the California Institute of
regenerative medicine which is at the
heart of the debates with
71 and the whole cloning and embryo
stem-cell debate it's not unusual to see
doctors who sort of cut their teeth in
fertility medicine make the transition
to cloning research because of their
skills and abilities and techniques in
making you know embryos in the
laboratory also samuel wood who's the
CEO of stem again which is a company
down in us I want to say La Jolla San
Diego area also a fertility doctor who's
now involved in human cloning and
January 17 2008 Sarah wood is quoted as
saying it's that's Temujin that they had
become the first in the world to create
and meticulously document a cloned human
embryo using somatic cell nuclear
transfer using donated eggs a conflict
of interest is a concern of ours at the
heart of the fertility industry and the
cloning researchers who are now
competing for the human egg no
reproductive revolution would not be
complete without a clash in dis
worldviews from the late 70s into the
80s you know we see the left and the
right the religiously religious and
non-religious you know the the debates
playing out people are saying are we
playing God now that we could make life
in the lab this is a Frankenstein moment
do we have to worry about who who and
what we're creating are we going to
create people or monsters and just sort
of that whole debate again the debate
over women's rights reproductive rights
in the in the issue of choice do we have
the right to reproduce do we have the
right to bear children if we have the
right do we have the right to demand our
health care covers that in the United
Kingdom curiously enough the the
socialized medicine structure in the
United Kingdom is supposed to pay for
three rounds of infertility for couples
that have been diagnosed with
infertility because of the long waits
and the long lines infertility
infertility is not life-threatening
most people are waiting not waiting and
adopting into this new egg sharing
program which means if you will donate
your eggs to the cloning researcher you
can get you know a rate you can get
50 percent discount on your fertility
medicine
you're willing to share your eggs so
that's something that causes sorry my
colleagues a nice I to be a little bit
confused and concerned since this is
supposed to be provided in their you
know their health care plan anyway do we
have the right to design our children
now that we can make life in the lab you
know can I just create like because I
want a boy and a girl I don't want down
syndrome so you see what you're seeing
now is that the traditional lines of
left-right religious non-religious are
muddying because we have the ability to
form coalition and abortion politics
which traditionally sort of set which
side of the aisle you had to be on are
you for or against abortion doesn't
really hold any any bearing on these
larger issues when you could find people
that would agree that a woman has a
right to terminate her pregnancy but
they're going to be very uneasy about a
woman terminating her pregnancy because
it's a boy and she wants a girl or it's
a blue-eyed child and she wanted a
brown-eyed child and of course as the
technology exploded my background is in
pediatric nursing over for 20 years in
healthcare we've stopped looking at why
are people experiencing infertility in
higher rates because we found this way
around that the technology got more
efficient when you didn't get pregnant
the first or the second month of trying
you were immediately sent sort of off to
see the fertility doctor when in the
olden days they'd say well just keep
trying and keep trying a lot and you
know people are having a lot more maybe
fun sex back then I don't know can I say
that but as the market exploded and the
technology got more and more efficient
the demand for the human egg became more
increase and we saw reaching into the
international market global art not as
in fine art but assisted reproductive
technology this is from their website
global art USA a part of a long
established international egg donor
program that provides IVF physicians and
their patients with high quality donor
eggs at exceptional prices since 2002
Global art USA has offered an attractive
alternative to the domestic typical
domestic egg donor programs through our
unique intern
national donor program go Blart USA is
an expansion of a very successful
Eastern European IVF egg donor program
founded in 1995 so quickly the
commercialization of the human egg and
businesses setting up camp in
predominantly poor countries I have the
honour of speaking at the European
Parliament in Brussels to members of the
European Parliament not soon after quite
a few women were seriously seriously
harmed I think it's very interesting
that the members of the European
Parliament took their cue from the
United Nations trafficking laws so the
laws that guide and enforce the anti
human trafficking issues they took their
cue from the UN trafficking protocol and
issued a resolution specifically
condemning the treat in humans human
eggs the the international laws are much
more broadly where written so that you
can traffic in organs not just in
persons you can track trafficking blood
in cells in body parts if you will the
resolution was titled the European
Parliament resolution on the trade in
human egg cells it was a direct response
to the exploitation of Eastern European
young women and condemned the trade in
human egg cells and it stated that the
harvesting of egg cells poses a high
medical risk to the life and health of
the women and despite the possibility of
serious effects on women's life and
health
the high price paid for egg cells
incites and encourages donation given
the relative poverty of the donors I
read an Israeli woman's PhD dissertation
she was doing her study because Israeli
has gotten in partnership with global
art USA so she did her dissertation and
went up and you know interviewed and
took a lot of photos and her whole
dissertation is on what's going on in in
Croatia Slovakia Romania and young women
you know were six months behind on the
rent who wanted to have a matching
bedroom set like the Americans have you
know are being encouraged to donate
their eggs and of course in the middle
of a highly
unregulated industry and market are all
kinds of ethical breaches conflicts of
interests abuses to young women and
corruption began almost immediately as
the right rising commercial value on
eggs was realized back home here UC
Irvine if any of you have followed
what's been going on down there I'm
pretty sure that they've lost their
fertility clinic altogether dr. ash who
ran the UC Irvine clinics was has fled
to Mexico City and is practicing down
there knowing that he steps foot back in
the United States that he will probably
be arrested 1995 there was a major fraud
case at UC Irvine where women's eggs
were being taken from them and they were
other people were being given the
women's eggs and being told that they
were their eggs I I think there's even
been reports that dr. ash was happy to
allow his sperm to be used one of the
women I met one time when I was speaking
came up to me and said all all my
sisters babies are UCI babies and every
time we get together for you know family
dinners we all can't help but think that
the middle child looks just like dr. ash
can you imagine being the child is four
to being right and I don't know that the
child knows these stories but you know
that vibe that you sort of get when
you're at those family functions it
reminds me of the old traditional
adoption day you know kids kind of
growing up quite I just don't fit in
they look at the family pictures and
they kind of go how come I look like
this and everybody else looks like that
but the greatest injury most recently
twenty-three point five million dollars
in damages have been paid out I think in
the last year finally the fraud case was
settled the greatest injuring thus the
greatest payouts resulted after one
woman's eggs were taken without her
consent than given to another woman who
ultimately gave birth to the child there
had to be obviously a lot of court cases
around that who owns a child I mean if
your eggs are Solon and somebody else
has a child and it was very messy
Israeli senior four till infertility
specialists were caught intentionally
super aggressively hyper stimulating
young women so that they could get so
many eggs that that they could go out
and sell them normally a woman obviously
ovulates one maybe two naturally a month
but I'll get into the drugs in a little
bit so they were intentionally
giving these young women more drugs than
were necessarily because they wanted
more eggs to sell and then also another
scandal down in Orange County California
was options national fertility registry
and last year they ran a paper an
article in the paper saying that
thousands of human eggs may be missing
options national fertility was already
forced out of business in 2003 again at
a major scandal when the the way that
options was set up is that young girls
could pick and choose who they wanted
their eggs to go to one egg donor went
for her post egg retrieval checkup and
the OBGYN said I have some good news
both of the couples are pregnant and she
said what do you mean both of the
couples I gave my eggs to you know John
and Debbie and so with that story sort
of busted loose this whole scandal and
then later on they went on to say that
thousands of human eggs are missing it
was quite hilarious and sad at the same
time because the paper literally ran
columns and columns and columns of
numbers telling the public if this is
you come find us because we don't track
this so we couldn't call you up and say
oh we think your eggs have been stolen
or misappropriated or or whatever
because we don't know who's doing all
this of course is always going to be the
social aspects of the the this this
story
this is Wendy Kramer her son Ryan on
Oprah a few months back one of my
favorite children's books are you my
mother
these children are coming of age and
wanting to know they go to their doctor
and their doctor says well did your
maternal grandmother die of did your
your grandfather have this what's your
medical history they don't know because
they're a product of sperm and egg
donation
Ryan her son was made through sperm
donation and she Wendy is a strong
advocate for no longer allowing
anonymous sperm and egg donation so Ryan
grew up knowing that his dad was a sperm
donor and he wanted to find him so she
set up donor sibling registry com in how
hopes of helping Ryan find his his
biological father
they have still not have found
him he's found many many of his
half-siblings and Wendy tells me that
she has on her site now matched at least
twenty forty sixty and sometimes as many
as a hundred children back to one sperm
donation father so you can see just the
complexities of these issues she said
it's very hard to track kids wanting to
find their egg donor mother and there's
so many more children she says that
don't know they're a product of egg
donation because as women we can have
the embryo implanted into us we can be
pregnant we can you know labor and give
birth we have all the pictures of us
when we're pregnant
giving birth and a lot of the children
are growing up not knowing that they
were created by an egg donation often
it's more hard to it's easier to know
that you were a sperm donation baby also
a person I've spent I've chatted with
and actually written a review of her
book Deborah Spahr who's a professor of
Business at Harvard Business School
wrote the baby business how many science
and politics drive the commerce of
conception you know the big idea of her
book is this is a bit this is a billion
dollar plus a year industry and let's
treat it like an industry in a business
and let the market forces sort of drive
what's going on and I would say to you
you know is that the best way when we're
looking at protecting all the interested
parties to dis let you know the market
sort of said how we conduct ourselves
and I mentioned earlier the competition
for the human egg explan exploded more
so when we entered the clone clone age
1996 the technologies had advanced to
the point where we were able to clone
higher mammals with the dolly the sheep
cloning story a few months late a few
years later sorry embryonic stem cells
were actually identified see before we
were able to make embryos in the lab
most of the research that was being done
was being done on either aborted fetuses
or fetus like stillbirths babies so now
the research could actually be involved
in in embryos and then in 2005 we had
the horrible korean south korean scandal
break recently in nature just last week
Kevin
and Douglas Melton from Harvard
University's stem cell Institute claimed
that the lack of available human eggs is
hindering the progress of stem-cell
research in the United States they
explained that the researchers are
facing difficulties and obtaining human
eggs for cloning primarily because
states aren't allowed to pay for eggs
fertility industry can pay for eggs
cloning researchers and scientific
researchers cannot pay for eggs and that
is hindering their ability to get access
the South Korean cloning work was done
with two thousand sixty one human eggs
came from a hundred and twenty nine
women it's about 16 eggs per woman
twenty percent of the women got it I
talked about it earlier ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome so twenty
percent of the women got sick twelve
percent of them had to be treated in the
hospital two hundred and forty two eggs
were needed to create one stem cell line
so if we estimate ten egg donors ten
eggs from every donor we need about
eighty-five to 170 million eggs from
women and remember these are women in
the prime of their reproductive years
they don't want my eggs I'm too old
they don't want young girls eggs they're
pre pupae prepubescent they're not
mature yet so they're specifically
needing eggs from women who need to be
protected because their eggs should be
for their own fertility dr. robert nach
de Gaulle who's an fertility doctor in
San Francisco has said one of them then
being an egg donor is going to die one
day
Gerald Shatan who was the u.s. partner
from the University of Pennsylvania with
the Korean studies has said it's
California MOOCs superfast in
stimulating thousands of women when the
first woman dies he doesn't say if he
says when the first woman dies for the
sake of cells and a plastic dish this is
going to be a nightmare so we've seen
the deconstruction of the female body on
the left is a nature article on the
cloning what now below is mining the
secrets of the egg you'll notice the
woman has no head she has no arms she
has no legs she has ample breasts aren't
we glad for that women and her
reproductive tract is lit up like
precious gems as they
- secrets of the egg to the right is a
graphic that was in the paper when you
see a vine announced the launch of its
therapeutic cloning program and I always
ask people what's missing from this
picture is a woman have a nice guy there
in his boxer shorts but if you look at
the side graphics as they move around
it's the here it's the egg it's the egg
it's the egg it's the egg but there's no
mention of the anonymous and faceless
woman who's needed to produce the egg
one woman in New York I don't know if
this is a joke but she's trademarked her
own eggs
she's packaged them as caviar the
world's most expensive luxury consumable
item this is one of those Google moments
where I can say if you don't believe me
go home and Google Chrissie caviar she
has a one little one-minute clip - of
showing her or a woman getting on to the
exam table to have her eggs harvested so
at the height of this competition of the
human egg between the IVF industry and
the cloning research progressing and
nobody seemed to be noticing or
mentioning the fact that young women are
going to be needed by the millions to
produce their eggs groups organize our
bodies ourselves which has been around
since the longtime out of Boston Women's
Health collective got very involved in
this issue a group called thin rage
which is feminist international network
for resistance against reproductive and
genetic engineer founded by Renata Klein
got very outspoken and partnered with
Women's Forum in Australia because
Australia has a large therapeutic
cloning project which is where again dr.
Alan Townsend came from hands off her
ovaries was founded Korean women linked
got very active and hosted a very large
international conference after the
cloning scandal down there one of my
colleagues from hands off her ovaries
was invited to speak it at their event
comment on reproductive ethics which is
out of the United Kingdom and again the
Center for Bioethics and culture so what
actually happens to make a young one
produce twenty forty sixty eggs at a
time the first thing is she takes
about two weeks of very powerful
artificial hormones to suppress her
ovaries to make her ovaries think that
she's a menopausal woman to stop the
ovarian function and for about two weeks
she injects herself daily with synthetic
hormones typically commonly used as a
drug called Lupron which is used
off-label meaning it's not FDA approved
for this it's FDA approval comes before
prostate cancer so it's a drug used
off-label for ovarian suppression and
it's also category X which means you do
not take this drug if you may or could
be possibly pregnant because you will
have a child born with with defects so
of course that's a concern right there
because who's taking this is young girls
in the prime of their may be sexually
active years as well
one woman Michelle I'm sorry Lin
Milliken who's in the Boston area
maintains a site called the Lupron
victims hub and she's a woman who's been
really made quite sick from years of
taking lupron because she was inferred
Island suffered from endometriosis so
she has a very detailed site there she
also has given Senate testimony which is
on the hands off her ovaries site as
well as her site so after the ovaries
have been tricked into thinking they are
the ovaries of a very old menopausal
woman the young girl has switched over
to a different drug again injected daily
for about two weeks you'll see drugs
like purgin Oz an example of that drug
and that the purpose of the next phase
of the drug therapy is to hyper
stimulate the ovaries so that they don't
produce one or two eggs as they
naturally would but they would produce
10 20 30 60 egg donors often tell me
that their Julia Derek for example her
egg broker loved her because she was
easy to stimulate me and she responded
well and they could get lots of eggs
they're told you've done well you're a
good producer kind of something you know
farm animals you know good good job
Bessie a lot of eggs and then they get a
final HCG ingestion injection which
causes the the follicles as 20 40 60
whatever they produced finally mature so
then they can undergo the surgical
procedure where they go
remove the eggs so you can imagine just
me just telling you what people do and
we live in an era where you know we're
all about holistic and natural and you
know environmentally friendly I was just
loving that you have the garden out
there and I asked Christine what's the
garden for and she said it's for the
chef so we can get you know good food
and we're you know the hundred and fifty
like the restaurant called 150 where you
only eat things that are grown but here
we are taking these young women they're
taking synthetic hormones that aren't
even FDA approved they're doing it at
home you know giving their injections
and then what are the rest I told you it
it commonly is ovarian hyperstimulation
syndrome which can be lead to organ
failure it can lead to strokes sirs
future fertility problems and even death
in some cases you can go into the Google
chats and you can see even listening on
their conversations how big is your
belly today can you get your pants on
today and this is what they're chatting
back and forth because the ovaries have
been abnormally you know hyperstimulated
so their bellies get huge and they get
all this Adem Adem it has fluid
retention and the fluid has nowhere to
go so it starts leaking out and you can
just imagine what happens as it puts
pressure on your lungs on your kidneys
and in the harm and these girls aren't
patients they're not being monitored as
if there's somebody sick in the hospital
they're you know young women out there
who get their medications in the mail
gilda radner most people don't realize
was an infertile woman who later went on
to die of ovarian cancer
Liz Tobias who was a good friend of the
Princess Diana she publicly blamed her
fertility drugs that she took for her
ovarian cancer which later took her life
author journalist iris Chang committed
suicide in 2004 at the age of 36
she was entered into a deep depression
became bipolar after taking these drugs
to address her infertility you know you
see you hear stories after stories after
stories and here is one woman jacqueline
Rustin I've testified with her mother
Angela Hickey it at
a congressional briefing on Capitol Hill
she was 32 year old years old when she
died of aggressive ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome her lungs went
into acute respiratory distress she was
on a ventilator and had to be taken off
life support
Jessica weaned her mother is now one of
my colleagues was a Stanford student who
followed answered an ad and donated her
eggs Jessica's mother dr. Jennifer
Schneider is a medical doctor as well as
a PhD she's testified twice with me now
on Capitol Hill and dr. Schneider writes
about Jessica since her death I kept
thinking about a possible connection
between her daughter's cancer and her
egg donations high doses of hormones are
used to stimulate the ovaries of
infertile women trying to get pregnant
as well as women who provide their eggs
to assist infertile women one year ago
dr. Schneider read a 1998 article in the
British Journal Human Reproduction
citing a woman who donated her eggs and
then died of colon cancer the story and
spiders inspired dr. Schneider to
actively pursue her theory dr. Schneider
has since published one if not two
journal articles now on a case review on
her daughter's case and Jessica was
diagnosed at 29 of advanced stage colon
cancer and died at the age of 31
when dr. Schneider found out about her
daughter's illness and death she went
back to the egg broker to try to get the
medical records in the broker said well
we don't keep those records for very
long and they've already been destroyed
and this is Kalaupapa Dimas is quite
famous around this neck of the woods
because she also was a Stanford student
she answered an ad in the papers
offering her $50,000 and probably within
three days of taking Lupron she suffered
a massive brain stroke and will
ironically for the rest of her life have
to take daily hormone replacement
therapies because the stroke obliterated
her pituitary gland which normally
regulates and and secretes those
things those drugs and she will never be
able to have children on her own and
Calais story accentuates the whole
bait-and-switch Calla answered an ad
offering her $50,000 she was told after
reviewing her profile that she hadn't
been selected and could we please keep
your profile on file in case somebody
else comes down the road and a few a
period of time passed I don't remember
how long is she it was picked and
selected for a $15,000 client who's
gonna pay her $15,000 when she was in
the hospital literally paralyzed on half
of her body for several weeks post
stroke her egg broker called her and
said you you didn't fulfill your end of
the contract you didn't produce the eggs
we're sending you a drop cycle cheque of
$750 and she no nowhere appears in the
medical literature but the goodness is
my good news bad news slide and I'm
almost ready to take your questions
the good news is is after 30 years since
Louise Brown was born changes and trends
are moving away from what I call the
reproductive medicine gone wild approach
and they're moving back toward things
called we will see commonly if you typed
in search words natural cycle IVF
minimal stimulation IVF mild approaches
IVF less is better no longer this
aggressive hyper stimulating super
ovulating I was in April and London and
attended this conference welcome to is
Mar and is Mars the International
Society for mild approaches to assisted
reproduction where I heard day after day
of international experts talking about
the drugs are dangerous the procedures
are harmful the benefits and the
outcomes to the children produce this
way are not optimal we need to move away
from that but again the concern is what
about the non patient egg donor who set
herself up to be the commodity Suzanne
Parisien who's the former medical
director of the FDA says the girls who
donate their eggs after they are done
with her there's no numbers there's
nobody saying how many of those girls
went on later to have complications or
problems
she is nameless
she doesn't appear in the medical
literature there's no tracking there's
no no government oversight she is gone
nobody cares what happens to her so this
is what we hand out on college campuses
thinking about donating your eggs think
again thank you questions comments
Wow
all right so so do I just say class
dismissed then okay so I'll ask what I
know I'll say that's a son okay so I am
we actually did my partner and I had
reproductive issues so we had one baby
successfully through IVF and after
repeated other tries actually used an
egg donor
so I'll state that up front but are you
saying that all egg donation is bad or I
know that the the donor that we used
went through the exact same with the
same doctor through the same protocol
that we did and was coasted and so on
and so on so we thought was minimal risk
are you saying it's all bad or there are
I'm saying what do Jennifer Snyder said
and makes the point young girls are told
there's no known risk which is a lot
different than saying there's no risk
I mean we don't know we're not tracking
your egg donor
sounds like had a delightfully a
wonderful unhospitable uneventful egg
donation procedure we don't know what's
what the long-term risk for her is doing
because we don't we don't track if you
donate your kidney today to help a
stranger or a family member who needs a
kidney transplant you today are making
an informed decision based on years of
tracking because when we first started
going to people and saying will you
donate a kidney we think people can go
on and live long healthy lives with one
kidney we didn't know but we think but
you immediately back then in the olden
days went into a tracking system a
database so that we could continually
monitor people who donate kidneys and
what happens to them short long
longer-term it's a week today are the
beneficiaries of that long body of data
collection so that we can go to people
we haven't done that we've been doing
donations since you know the the early
1980s we don't track these girls
so did Gilda Radner die of ovarian
cancer because she was an infertile
woman and took these drugs we don't know
so I'm not standing up here saying your
egg donor is gonna die of ovarian cancer
but I am saying we know I mean I'm 50
the minute I had a hot flash of okay do
I take hormone replacement therapy
do I take estrogen then the literature
has been very convoluted no you don't
yes you do and you know and my mother's
err you had a hot flash you went on
estrogen I mean that's just what we did
we a woman we're living generations of
the the women who went before us that
we're told to take des you know one of
those dreadful drugs that then went on
to produce a virulent form of ovarian
cancer and the daughters born of those
daughters of des so shouldn't we know
before we go to these young women and
say we need your eggs so that so that
they can then say yes I will take the
risk I will assume that risk because I
want you to be able to have a baby or
totally supported by the way of getting
the data to make those decisions but it
sounded like you're saying stop the
whole egg donation not let's put some
pounds around how it's done and what
data is tracked well when you have the
international community saying we need
to move back to minimal stimulation
natural cycle IVF Louise Brown's mother
wasn't hyperstimulated it was a natural
cycle where they watched her cycle and
knew when she was going to oscillate and
went in and retrieve the retrieved the
egg follicle after it had naturally
matured in her body but because of
efficiency and because of speed and
because of quality controls we found out
well if we can get 30 eggs you know
isn't that better because IVF is
expensive and then we have more eggs to
play around with because it's all
product driven and in the end game is
that happy couples have happy healthy
children but you see the experts in
fertility medicine saying wait a minute
after 30
we we are given pause and we need to
move off of this approach and and
remember the egg donor isn't a patient
she's not sick she's not going to assume
the risk of taking these drugs and
undergoing the surgical procedure as she
kind of weighs the calculus of risk to
benefit so I'm not saying I'm saying
natural cycle minimal stimulation I'm
saying we don't know and we need to be
quite candid with young women before we
ask them to do this one of the slides
you showed in'
had a picture of an advertisement
$100,000 for a clinician i'm just person
i guess it's just my own ignorance it
why is that different than organ
donation i if I were to offer someone a
kidney today I think my understandings
that would be illegal to sell it why why
is um and I also know that nothing in in
medical research and drug research the
actual payment of money and on some
cases if it's if it's larger than a
certain minimal amount thought just to
compensate the person for the time is
often considered to be I'm in a lot of
areas of medical ethics coercive and I
guess I'm curious as to what is the
difference between an egg donation and
let's say a kidney donation or a blood
donation that allows for an attachment
of a large lump-sum my bag well the
kidney donation is a donation you can't
sell your kidneys in the United States I
mean we have laws that say you can sell
your kidney I think there was somebody
tried to sell their kidneys on eBay or
something but you know the law is that
you cannot sell sell your organs you
know I've made the point about the
international community because the
international laws are written broadly
enough that eggs organs blood you know
are encompassed in things that you can't
traffic and sell on the black market now
you you raised a question about you know
the use of human subjects in scientific
and research practices and and I think
the guidelines are pretty tight when you
look at documents like the Helsinki
declaration and the nurse
trial and not the Nuremberg trial
Nuremberg code of medical ethics you
know when you enter in as a subject in a
research study you have at any moment
the ability to get out of it and say I
don't want to participate in the study
anymore there has to be some risk to
benefit calculus what is the benefit to
the egg donor I mean when you're
entering into a research sub you know as
a research subject perhaps you're
entering into that in your weighing
those things but I don't see what the
benefit as the young egg donor and she's
not treated like a subject in a human
clinical trial or something which are
really tightly guided by internal review
boards and like I said the Declaration
of Helsinki where they need to make sure
that you're not harmed and if you are
harmed then there's there's gonna be
some compensation or some you know
protection for you I mean calop Abidine
was she got a phone call saying we're
gonna send you $750 and she says every
year when I go for my annual MRI and see
the big hole in my brain I'm reminded
about what happened to me you know
there's nobody that's responsible for
for her long-term medical needs or or
her conversation did you did you want to
come to the mic
and I think maybe this should be the
last question because people coming in
the back there should be you know the
same way you donate a kidney there
should be studies and follow-ups and the
same types of rights are there programs
like that is there a push towards making
that no that's why I've spent the last
12 months doing three different
congressional briefings I mean at a
minimum we are asking to develop a
federal tracking system I joke you know
the ad that I showed about the hundred
thousand dollar that was at the daily
California newspaper where my daughter
just graduated from and she brought it
home home to me but there's I joked that
these young girls could literally travel
the world and saw their eggs whenever
they run out of money there's guidelines
the American Society of reproductive
medicines guidelines say you cannot do
this more than six well I as a
scientific person say well how come six
has six been shown to be safe but seven
isn't
has five been shown to be you know kind
of borderline and cy6 let's study it and
say yeah six times the safe you can do
this six time because I know Julia Derek
who's done it fourteen times and she she
got very sick and she was able to lie
and and sort of you know get under the
radar and just hop to a different clinic
and find a new a broker because
guidelines mean is kind of suggest
today's you know suggested donation I
mean you can get everything I give it
you can ignore you can you know give you
know a million dollars so the guidelines
are meaningless in at the tenant you
know the kind of hallmark of our medical
ethics is this thing called informed
consent and how can we properly and
adequately inform these young girls so
that they can agree and consent to do
this if we haven't done our side of the
homework and created a body of evidence
that says this is safe it's safe six
times but not seven or four times
they're not at all or these kinds of
girls are going to be more at risk than
these kind of I mean some of us could
smoke our whole life and never get lung
cancer and some of us could smoke a year
and get lung cancer and we have the the
talent and the ability to track and
collect data and make some meaningful
decisions about that information and
these young girls literally are we take
their eggs and we're done with them and
I mean Yorkin it's a rarity where you
had a relationship and you knew this
person but even then I couldn't say to
her you know long term you're gonna be
fine
we don't know thank you for your time
it's been my pleasure to be with you
