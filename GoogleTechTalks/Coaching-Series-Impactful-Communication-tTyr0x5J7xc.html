Gillis and we are corporate coaches and
we are coaches here at Google and we're
going to give you a presentation and
some practice with some tools on
impactful communication like to start
with some introductions first we're here
as part of coaches week at Google and I
don't know it might be good to just give
you an overview of so what is coaching
and there's lots of definitions of
coaching and there's even lots of kinds
of coaching the kind of coaching that
Greg and I do in the coaching that's
done at Google is really what we'll call
corporate or business or executive
coaching so it tends to be usually
around your leadership and interpersonal
effectiveness and the way I describe
coaching is it's a leadership
development program that is custom
tailored to your individual strengths
and and business objectives and it's
something that happens over time because
a lot of us we might go to the best
class in the world including classes
that are here at Google we learned some
really great tools we come away with
great intentions and then we go back to
our job and life happens and we revert
back to our habits so coaching
engagements tend to happen over a three
to six month period so that you've got
lots of time to learn and implement new
behaviors and a lot of clients that
Leslie and I work with are successful
people I think the majority of our
clients are very successful in their
jobs what you find is as you move on in
your job and as you get promoted and as
you get more responsibility the things
that worked really really well for you
in the beginning may not work so well
anymore and a lot of times you're
wondering how do I change now we're all
superstitious we were successful doing
these things to get here now how do we
shift to do different things we kind of
want to hold on to the things that got
us to the point we're at so coaching a
lot of times is moving to the next level
and knowing what to let go of what
doesn't necessarily work well anymore
one of the times that I was coached and
I was coached three times before I made
a career change was at a point where I
had moved to the vice president level I
was actually working at Charles Schwab
and running one of the technology
organizations
and I'd gotten promoted because I was a
really good project person really really
effective at mobilizing resources and
often doing things that had no one could
even imagine we could do and when I
became a vice president it was sort of
like everything that it got me to that
point was no longer the things that I
needed to be doing I was managing more
senior team I needed to adjust my style
from being less directive and more
influential I needed to think about how
to build my relationships and my sphere
of influence and a cross-functional
nature and my boss at the time told me
Leslie you need to make this shift from
being a really great supervisor to a
really great leader and it wasn't until
I worked with the coach who could help
me figure out how to do that what does
that mean how do I change behavior it
was until I work with a coach that I was
successful in making that change so
let's move on and talk about some of
these things first we want to do a
little bit more introduction on who we
are so um Greg and I have known each
other for a long time in our prior
careers and in our current careers as
coaches and we each come from the
business world originally so I started
my career out as a software developer
and moved up the ranks into management
and ultimately executive positions at
Charles Schwab and was VP of software
engineering at commerce one before they
went public I've been coaching and I
also do some organizational development
or team-building type work since 1999
and I've been coaching at Google for I
think it's been about five years have a
lot of different clients Greg and I have
a lot of clients in common but the
majority of my clients are technology
organizations or organizations that are
very very dependent on technology to run
their business my career started in
sales I was technology sales various
companies Xerox to begin with Silicon
Graphics Netscape and then commerce one
where I met Leslie we were both in the
company about the same time my career in
sales allowed me to be in hundreds of
different companies hundreds of
different environments and different
decision-making processes it was
interesting to learn how relationships
were formed how power was manifested in
different companies just the ability to
be
working with in so many different
companies really helped me in my in my
coaching career I went to coaching in
2001 I've had a lot of companies I
worked with mainly all in the Bay Area
I'm a professional certified coach
through ICF and I was on the board of
the professional coaches and mentors
Association of know in California for
two years what is impactful
communication we're going to give you
our definition does anyone have a
definition coming in here what that
might be what you want to share
we're going to give you a demonstration
of what we think it is and isn't oh yes
sorry the question is is it different
than effective communication might be
very similar and I think the reason we
chose the word impact is to really think
about something that is effective and
perhaps is really helpful in allowing
you to further your agenda and
objectives yeah yeah thanks
so we're going to give you a roleplay
demonstration of two different kinds two
different scenarios okay Leslie Leslie
yeah yeah I need to talk to you yeah oh
yeah what is it part of zebra is we're
two weeks behind uh-huh okay oh no I
know I was upset too oh oh I can't I
Greg I'm gonna have to take care of this
kid could we talk another time what
we're two weeks behind
I didn't yeah I know I know but this is
even more urgent isn't it is good to see
you you know I you know you know I'm
there for you but you know I got I got
something a little or urgent tailorable
come back later okay
okay now we're going to do another demo
of the same situation a little bit
differently okay
Oh Leslie yeah I need to talk to you
uh-huh
since you're my boss now I let you know
that we're two weeks behind on project
zebra uh-huh
let's say I really need you to pay
attention to this this is really
important
okay thank you because we lost those two
engineers last week you know they went
to that other project I just reanalyze
where we are we're at least two weeks
behind and I'm going to need more
resources and since you're my boss I
thought you could help me you know
pulling some our resources to this
project our resources so you're pretty
sure it's it's two weeks it could be ten
days but it's it's we're out there right
now and you're you're pretty sure that
more resources is what's required to get
us back on track that's what I thought
about yeah is there are there any other
options that you considered you know I
mean I don't know I can make the case
for resources but I can't guarantee
we'll get them anything else that we
might be able to offer we could cut some
feature set there's there's certain
things that don't matter right now that
I think we cut those out no one would
notice we can add them later and it
sounds like you think being able to
deliver the full set of features that we
committed to and getting more resources
to do that is the better way to go yes
yes I do
okay so what do you need from me I need
at least two more engineers okay do you
pull them from somewhere else I need a
month project
okay all right can you follow up with
some with anybody to start the metal
okay
right on time okay all right thanks for
letting me know all right thanks okay
okay that first one just upset me even
even acting it what were the difference
is there does anyone have any feedback
for us and what was different between
the first one the second one yeah yeah
he asked for her attention and wasn't
just pushed out of the room what did she
do differently
what's that yes close the laptop which
is a big thing in the middle of a fire
big fire so that's an example we're
going to give you what our definitions
are and they they sort of play back to
the example that we just went through so
we say that impactful communication it
makes a difference there's a lot of
communication that goes on hi how was
your weekend weekend was fine how was
yours it was fine bye see you that's not
really impactful it doesn't really make
much of a difference every communication
does not need to be impactful so we're
not standing up here saying every
communication needs to be impactful what
we're drawing a distinction on is when
you do make need to make an impact there
are certain things you need to be aware
of it affects the relationship so an
impactful communication will affect the
relationship one way or the other might
make it stronger it might make it weaker
it connects to you with the thoughts and
feelings of other people in other words
it employs some empathy when she closed
her laptop and looked at me I felt
connected to even though I was play
acting in this role she connected with
me for the first time she was just
blowing me off
we were not connecting and the third one
is a mutual understanding it allows
problem-solving solving and creative
thinking to occur so without that mutual
understanding it's very hard to do
creative thinking she helped me
brainstorm a different way of thinking
about the solution which is maybe we cut
feature set versus just adding more
engineers so impactful communication we
also feel it's our experience as
executives and coaches that your ability
to get things done is directly related
to the impact of your communication and
your ability to relate with people
some coaching communications that les
and I run into often is executive
coaches are some of the things we put up
this is just a small subset of some of
the things we talk to clients about we
like to think about them as two
different things you've got skill layer
things which are I need to be a better
presenter I want to have better writing
skills I want to manage my email better
these are a lot of things you can go to
training classes for and learn about
there's also the second level which is
behavior related things and you can kind
of think of these as you know server
layer and the application delivery layer
or the OS layer and the application
layer when you get down to behavior
power influence presence or showing up
Leslie showed up during a demonstration
first time she didn't show up she was
involved in an email discussion or wor
confidence empathy conflict these all
happen at a behavioral level and as
coaches we work it at both levels when
we work with someone who says I'm having
trouble with my presentation skills
first question we're going to ask is
what have you tried
well I took presentation skills 101 I
took a video tape credit presentation
skills 201 I read three books and I
joined you know speaking class if it's
still a problem we're probably looking
at something in the behavioral area
maybe it's confidence maybe it's just
showing up a different way so that's how
we differentiate these two different
areas and today the experience we're
going to do some experiential work on
showing you different different
techniques mainly down the behavioral
area mainly in the operating system area
but as a coach again we may recommend
that someone take a class in this area
while we're working with them on
behavior there might be both things
going do some integration of both both
aspects so we're going to introduce
hopefully if we manage our time well
several tools that we've used in our
work with clients and give you some
opportunity to understand and work with
the tool actually something experiential
and our goal is to give you some things
that you can go away and apply this
afternoon in your work here
so the first exercise we're going to do
is called centering and what it is is
what Leslie did when I asked her to pay
attention to me and she closed her
laptop and she took a breath she did
something and then she showed up she was
actually listening to me what did she do
what is this centering I like to just
boil it down and say it's showing up you
actually show up for that communication
you're not doing a million other things
or one other thing you're actually
showing up and that's a decision you
make to show up for that particular
communication that particular meeting or
email may be really important and how do
you do that how does that happen for
example here at Google what if you're in
a meeting where your manager tells you
that your particular projects going to
get cut maybe something you worked on
your 20% time you put nine months into
it it's something you're passionate
about it's really important to you and
you go into a meeting your boss says we
just can't support this it doesn't have
any bearing on on product development
it's not going to happen right after
that meeting you've got to meet a
critical person who you interviewing to
join the team
someone's been recruited to Google and
you have to really interview this person
and show up you leave this one meeting
where you're completely upset and
aggravated and you got to walk maybe
thirty Seconds to the next conference
room and have the next meeting how do
you shift and just showing up for the
next meeting and that's what we're going
to talk about does anybody hear
snowboard is anybody snowboarded before
a few people besides you I see few
people besides Rick so the analogy I had
of snowboarding was I decided I wanted a
snowboard some friends said we'll take
you and they took me and we got to the
resort went to Northstar I rented my
stuff they told me how to strap the
board on it got me on a chairlift I got
the top and fell off and they said do
this just watch us and they went and I
was left there
but all this stuff and I had no idea
what to do about this so three or four
hours later I was done I was bruised I
was so sore I thought I'm never going to
do this again so I waited a full year
and it was the next season when I
decided I would go to Sugar Bowl and
take a lesson and when I went to the
lesson you know the instructor spent at
least 40 minutes of the lesson first
four hours 40 minutes on how to put your
snowboard on the second part was 30
minutes on how we're going to get on the
chairlift and get off the chairlift once
we get there and then when we got to the
top of the mountain it was at least a
half an hour on how to stand up okay put
the edge in the snow slowly get up keep
the edge there once we learned that we
learned how to turn which was my
instructor said point downhill now if
you want to turn left swing your body
this way swing your body that way you
know we learn to swing our bodies all
around and it worked you know but is a
complete exaggeration of how you're
actually snowboarding and the exercise
we're going to do is a complete
exaggeration of how you would Center
yourself because your body learns
through exaggeration and repetition like
any other thing you learn to ride a bike
you learn to play tennis its
exaggerating things when I was watching
the X Games last week on TV they're
doing the halfpipe none of those
snowboarders we're swinging their arms
around like this crouching down sticking
their butts out like I was trained they
looked very fluid because it's all
second nature now so we're going to do a
centering exercise that's about
exaggeration repetition and it's about
how do you get back that Center place
after you've been knocked off I have
some people that I think of when I think
about this like in sports world who can
do this in hockey I think of Wayne
Gretzky he's one of the great ones that
could do that I'm a sharks fan so I
think of Patrick Marleau and sharks
always consistent doesn't matter if it
gets knocked down gets back up Tiger
Woods in golf Kobe Bryant in baseball
Tom Brady in football then you've got
John Elway and Joe Montana be on
these are guys who when they get knocked
down they don't think about oh I just
got hit real hard they sent her back to
the middle and then go forward
world leaders JFK Martin Luther King
anyone else have anyone you can think of
that has this sort of ability to stay
centered
Gandhi exactly Nelson Mandela now these
are people that do it so subtly you
don't notice it happening
they don't go whoa hold on wait a minute
I gotta do my centering practice it just
happens because they're so good at it
okay so let's I'm going to lead you
through this exercise experiential and
the first thing I need you to do
actually is I need to trigger you I need
to get to thinking about something
difficult so I would like you to bring
back a difficult situation that happened
in the last few hours or days could be a
really bad email you've got a really
terrible meeting you're in somebody you
really can't stand being around a bad
interaction I want you to bring that
back into it and just think about that
dwell on it for a few seconds and I'll
give you a little bit of time to bring
something up but I want you to really go
back to that place that happened
recently and sort of relive it
and while you're doing that I want you
to notice is there tension anywhere in
your body when you're remembering this
is it is your heart rate changing is
your breathing changing is your attitude
changing now you're picturing this event
and I want to remember the attitude you
have right now
okay so when it asked you to do now is
everyone stand up if you've got a laptop
you're going to have to set it down next
year sorry
you don't have to slam it closed like
Leslie but you're going to need to have
your hands-free so what I ask you to do
is balance your weight equally on both
feet again this is an exaggeration of
centering stay balanced on both feet
feel the weight equally on you on the
balls of your feet and the heels of your
feet so you come to a full vertical
position put your chin out a little bit
so you feel very very vertical now we're
going to do is we're going to take in
three deep breaths and I'm going to show
you how to do this breath first so I'm
going to get four you're going to get
three first one I'm going to do is I'm
going to exaggerate that even I'm going
to breathe in my nose to my stomach up
to my chest I'm going to breathe up into
my shoulders and I'm going to let it out
with a loud exhale okay I'm going to do
this I'll just demonstrate it yeah
that's all do that
another one
one more now what I want you to do is
feel the heat radiating off your face
right now your skin temperatures about
90 to 91 degrees we're all basically
little heaters you can feel that heat
energy coming off of your face
if you could visualize the heat coming
off the entire front of your body now
you just feel that heat radiating off of
you you know how you've been in a
conference room that's too small and a
bunch of people get in there it gets
really hot just feel that heat coming
off your body now visualize it coming
off the back of your body also so it's
balanced front and back and now
visualize it off the left and the right
side also so you're equally distributing
that heat radiating off of you now you
can visualize it off the top of your
head in the bottoms of your feet and
while you're in this place I also want
you to think into how much space there
is in your body you know from a quantum
physics point of view there's 99.999%
space and every atom make up makes up
every molecule of every cell of your
body so you're mainly space so go into
that space feel the spaciousness inside
yourself okay everyone can sit back down
so now what I'd like you to do is bring
back the incident the person the email
the meeting bring that back into
consciousness the thing you were
thinking about before
is there any difference what do you
notice now
not as tense as the first time anyone
else
heartbeat different are you in a
different attitude than the first time
you were thinking about that person you
are so this is what we did we changed
our state our state is the way we are
and if you come out of that hot incident
and in this case we recreated it
artificially you come out of this hot
incident how do you switch back into
being ready for the next thing
especially with something important
where you need to show up versus
carrying the trail of that incident into
the next place and what we've done is
we've tricked our nervous system we have
an autonomic nervous system there's two
sides that sympathetic the
parasympathetic the sympathetic is the
fight-or-flight we go to scary movies we
like to get scared you're going to get
your car at night and there's a shadow
behind you you jump someone gets in your
face you don't know if you should run
away or get a horrible email is this is
fight or flight
what we did is trick our body into going
to the parasympathetic which is the
opposite of that it's opening your
pupils it's allowing your stomach to
digest it's relaxing your muscles what
happens when you're in that place is you
get a lot more information about what's
happening around you about the event you
were thinking about you're not as tense
about it the events still there it
didn't change just how you're reacting
to it
Lesley would you accompany me this les
Lee's done this once before because we
tried this the other day but if you take
this bottle while water has about a
quarter of the bottle in it and this
one's full this told us which one's
heavier Oh
clearly obvious a full and you're
obviously getting to the answer to the
next question but I want you to grip
them as tight as you can hard as you can
do you notice a difference they feel the
same you guys can try this not now but
later and go over here and grab a water
bottle but the point of this exercise is
when you're constricted you have a lot
less information you have a lot less
information about what's happening so
the purpose of centering is that between
meetings you leave your 11 o'clock
meeting your
uptight your you're agitated you're
upset if you know you have to show up
for the next meeting that's why you
practice the centering practice so that
in three to five seconds you can shift
and that's what the people we talked
about the sports heroes the world
leaders that's what they're good at
doing it's not that they don't get
knocked off balance all the time with
events happening to them it's that they
can shift back to Center really quickly
and show up for the next important thing
there's lots of things you don't need to
show up for but you don't need the
center but there are some that you want
to you want to Center and show up for go
to next slide any questions on this so
the water bottle exercise really helps
me understand something that I work with
clients on a lot which is awareness of
self and awareness of others so if we're
constricted if we're anxious I get like
this tenth step our ability to sense the
environment around us the people around
us our own reaction is limited our
ability therefore to choose an
appropriate response to the situation is
very limited if we're able to have full
command of our ability to take in
information externally and internally we
can then make a better choice how do I
want to respond or maybe I need to give
myself 30 minutes before I respond to
this email that I'm very upset by so you
just have more choice more awareness
more choice so if you're going to use
this exercise you would want to practice
it for awhile maybe several weeks and it
would take this kind of time but much
like snowboarding like an example I gave
if once you get good at it
it's a shift that happens you just start
shifting it because it's a body
intuition your body understands it okay
trying to do slide advances for me here
yeah
okay so the next tool that we're going
to introduce and give you some practice
with is a tool called balancing advocacy
with inquiry and this is a tool that has
a couple of really powerful distinctions
that I first want to introduce to you so
the first is to actually make a
distinction between two basic modes of
communication advocating here's what
needs to be done here's what I need from
you
versus inquiry what do you need from me
and most of us and certainly most of the
clients I've worked with are a lot more
comfortable and better trained at
advocating so being aware that there are
two primary modes the second is in the
use of this tool what we also do is go
below one's position and state or
inquire into the underlying context
behind the position so one way that I
like to think about this is anybody here
also good at math we're going to bath
when you're in school so I was really
good at algebra and I loved algebra but
I was always frustrated by the fact that
you had to write out the way you got to
the answer other problem you couldn't
just state the answer you had to show
your work so when advocating were
showing the thinking process that we
engaged in behind the position that
we're holding so when we're advocating
we're saying here's what I think needs
to happen here's how I got there and we
invite others to explore and challenge
and build on our view here's what I
think here's how I got there what do you
think about my perspective maybe there's
a better way to solve this this
particular issue and with inquiry we're
doing the same of others I might see
like in our roleplay earlier Greg came
in and he said I think we need to add
resources and I asked him are there any
other options that you've considered to
a frequent situation that I'm sure
you've all dealt with - are there other
options that you've considered walk me
through your thinking
a way that I a time that I became a
really aware of this tool and used it a
lot was in my prior career and when I
was leading engineering efforts at
commerce one we are religious where at
the time was a platform war and at the
time it was really around which platform
are we going to develop on and we had
two basic schools of thought and the art
the discussions were arguments its
Microsoft know Microsoft sucks its UNIX
know UNIX is too new it's not right and
that kind of dialogue which is at that
positional level doesn't really solve
anything we just get more dug in and
trenched in our own positions so what we
would try to do is then have a
conversation about okay what are the
criteria that we think are important in
making a platform decision and are there
some criteria that might be more
important or have some different
advantages for us so what would be the
process by which we would go through an
analysis and assessment and then we can
have a dialogue that gets below
positions and into underlying interests
and this is basically what mediators do
and anyone who's ever read getting to
yes which is one of the most famous and
best books on being able to negotiate
and work with conflict that's basically
what they're doing getting below the
positions to underlying interests or
context please so when we're leading
through advocacy these are some basic
phrases that will put you right into
advocacy here's what I think here's how
I got there what do you think so I've
given you just some sample phrases that
would give you some examples of how to
do that would I noticed both when I was
still an executive and when I became a
coach was that I think we forget to give
context often we forget that there's a
lot we know that maybe people working
with us and for us aren't aware we have
a lot of information that we neglect to
offer because we forget we know or we
don't think that it really matters and
we shortchange people's ability to make
effective decisions or provide other
solutions
when we neglect to deliver that context
we deliver the context people understand
where we're coming from it could it
could be the difference between buying
in and not buying in it could be that
now that I understand what you're really
trying to do I'm going to prove a better
position to give you an even better
solution than the one that that you've
offered with inquiry we're basically
doing the reverse so walk me through
your thought process what leads you to
this particular position are there other
options that you've considered how will
this how will this scale over time
is this a short-term solution maybe we
need something that's more systemic in
nature other ways of thinking about the
power of this is how many people here
like being told what to do may depend
may depend how many people like being
told flat-out they're wrong I sure don't
and this is a way by inquiring into
other people's perspective that we are
understanding their perspective and
we're also giving them the opportunity
to consider their own thought process or
if you've ever gone to someone with a
problem and said hey can I just let you
be a sandy board for me I just let me
tell you what I'm trying to do I'm
really stuck and in the process of
explaining the problem you solved your
own problem so inquiry is effective in a
whole lot of different ways we give
people support for their thinking
process we don't necessarily have to
tell them what to do but we ask them to
think about it we can ask some
provocative questions that may allow
them to see other solutions or ways of
approaching a problem that they hadn't
considered okay a nuance of inquiry some
authors call empowering questions and I
love this quote tell me and I'll forget
and and when you get older it's even
harder show me and I may remember and
involve me and I'll understand which is
actually part of what we're trying to do
today involve you give you the experi
rants of being able to work with some
material and learn through that
experience so when we're asking
empowering questions they are an
effective influencing and coaching tool
whether it's for people you're managing
directly people you're working with
people you're leading in a
cross-functional team or as a technical
lead you know type of in a technical
lead type of role so let me be clear
we're not giving people the answer but
we're supporting their thinking process
we're helping them to find maybe some
different ways of thinking about this
the solution that will that will move
them forward so here are some sample
kinds of questions that you might use so
we're going to give you some opportunity
to do a little bit of practice to
understand and actually before we do
that we're going to roleplay at the
center after this
can't believe this
cannot believe this what what's up my
boss wants us to do an early delivery of
x-ray so why are you frustrated about
that it's a throwaway it's ridiculous
it's a distraction hmm you know in my
relationships with your boss she doesn't
seem like someone who likes to do
throwaway efforts what's she really
trying to accomplish with this I guess
he's just trying to get credibility for
the project team that's the one that I
can figure mm-hmm or early delivery get
some more action yeah show our
capabilities uh-huh
um it's just a waste of time there's a
waste of time well are there any other
ways that you might be able to meet that
goal of early delivery I just can't
believe he said that I mean it really
upsets me yeah I see I see you're
frustrated I don't like throwaway work
either
but is there another way that you can
accomplish the other way well we could
we could do the first part of Project
Athena and get that done that's not a
throwaway that would actually show real
real work it's something that's you know
a real project and you could achieve
that in the same time frame oh yeah
absolutely
I'm sure we show our credibility would
more than show our credibility how do
you think your manager would respond to
that idea she'd probably say yes I don't
know why I didn't think of it hey maybe
need to do some of that centering
process that I was hearing about I was
just so upset when she said that
yeah I understand so what do you think
you want to do about this I want to go
ask her she'll probably say yes I I just
didn't think of it I don't know why I'm
just so upset but it sounds like this
would meet her goal in its and it's a
solution that you'd really be in
supportive an advocate for yeah no
thanks your help okay you're welcome
I wish all my meetings have been that
easy now that's a good illustration of
the power of inquiry and to demonstrate
advocacy what the manager could have
done what Greg's manager could have done
instead of saying hey I want you to do
this delivery of whichever project it
was she might have come to Greg and said
hey Greg I'm really thinking that it
would be helpful for a project team if
we could get some credibility by doing
an early delivery here's my goal what
I'm thinking that this project might be
a good way to do that but what do you
think maybe there's maybe there's a
different project that would be even
better
and in that so there's advocacy which
now tells Greg what I'm trying to
accomplish and Allah invites him in to
brainstorm around a solution to the
problem see the distinction here and
it's my experience especially as a
former systems person that we often
don't give that kind of context we don't
talk about what it is we're trying to
solve we give a solution to the problem
and then people on the other side think
oh that's what I have to do and I'm not
allowed to come up with a better
solution I may not even know what the
real need is that I'm trying to meet so
to give you some opportunity to do some
practice with this and ask you to form
groups of two or three people and I've
got some copies here of some of the
sample language that that we were just
looking at and I'm going to ask you to
you want pesos up to in your team's just
write down some statements in the first
situation imagine you're going to your
team and instead of saying here are okay
ours for the quarter how might you
advocate that okay how might you use
advocacy to put forth your position
and in the last two situations
envisioned someone coming to you and
making these statements and how might
you use inquiry to better understand and
help the person who's facing this
particular who's who's espousing this
particular perspective okay we'll just
give you a few minutes to do some
practice
welcome do that individually or in in
groups of two or three okay
I'd sure really love to be able to do it
I would spend a lot of time
yeah
okay anyone comfortable volunteering how
you might advocate about your okay ours
something besides so here they are yes
go ahead okay so the context of how I've
come to these particular objectives okay
and any enquiries that you want to
volunteer for either of these two
positions that you had to receive yes
great
great great I don't know if everyone
could hear so the real emphasis was
around and asking the probing questions
talking about positive things so rather
than why won't it work well what would
work what's your idea okay very good we
have one more tool that we want to
introduce and so we're in a fast-forward
to feed-forward board this is that our
expenditure to experiential exercise
it's different than feedback we all know
what feedback is performance reviews
what you did over the past nine to
twelve or sometimes 18 months
feed-forward is different it's looking
towards what you could do different in
the future so we're just going to do
this each person it'd be helpful if you
pick one thing you want to change and
that could be something like I picked
when I've done this exercise I want to
be a better listener another one I
picked before was I want to be at
meetings on time
these are simple little things that are
going to make my life better and we're
going to ask for suggestions from
someone else on these things and don't
worry about who you pair up with we're
going to have a pair of with multiple
people you're just going to be walking
around asking people this question I
want to be a better listener they're
going to get oh I think we need better
chairs good recovery there yeah do you
want it should we model quickly
yeah well salespeople only ideas for the
future listen to the suggestion all you
can say when the person gives you the
the feed-forward is thank you I want to
be it let's let's dim with this nicely I
want to be a better listener
okay my suggestions for you to be a
better listener would be first of all do
that centering exercise before you go
into meetings and before when you're in
a dialogue with someone before you offer
your perspective first use active
listening and summarize what you've
heard from the other person okay thank
you you're welcome
all I can say thank you and all she can
say is you're welcome okay so as you go
around you use the same thing you want
to improve with each person find a new
partner I want to be a better listener
they give you two pieces of feedback
they are trying to help you as much as
possible your goal when you're getting
the feed-forward is you want to learn as
much as possible and I think up the
paper because I've done this before it's
actually really good right some these
things down because you're going to get
some really useful stuff so think of
something that you want to improve it
doesn't have to be real personal you
have to share if they want just
something that's going to help you a
little bit in your life to make it to
make a difference and then we're going
to give you a couple of opportunities to
see you'll find a partner ask for two
suggestions switch places and we'll give
you two minutes per pair and you'll
probably have opportunities to do two or
three rounds of the exercise we'll call
time you're swapping with just find
someone else for free so people be free
not just wander around and interact each
other hi you can say my name is my name
is but after that it's thank you and
you're welcome okay okay
forget about it
we make soup on John
okay testing okay okay can we bring
ourselves back to order I know this is a
hard one to stop sorry to interrupt you
all what would one word be to describe
this exercise okay one word useful
anyone else
what collaborative in other words what
what's that positive empowering are
these words used to describe feedback
usually not hmm when done well okay the
reason you know why is this why this is
impactful why is this empowering why
does this make a difference we think
it's because you're allowed to listen
one of the main things is you're freed
to listen you can't give any of the
responses and thank you and in that you
don't need to be witty smart angry all
you do is say thank you so you actually
show up again back to showing up to
listen you're free to listen you can
also focus on the goal not the obstacle
and focus on the future it's about
changing something that hasn't happened
yet and it eliminates judgment it's not
personal you're brainstorming together
working out a way that things can get
better for for you this is a really
effective way of being able to do
performance reviews so focusing on the
future collaborating with people around
what to focus on and how to develop the
needed capability so well we're about
that another thing you can use this for
esteem building have your team together
and say how can I be a better team
member in the future and have each
person one on one go around the room
like this and just share with each other
nothing from the past
just what can I do in the future to be a
better team member really powerful
we're running out of time so we're going
to go to the end so we challenge you to
pick one of these techniques and use it
the next week you know use centering use
feed-forward balance advocacy and
inquiry use these things just pick one
and see if it helps you see if it makes
a difference for you some of the
resources we use to put this talk
together here Marshall Goldsmith put
together feed-forward and these other
resources should help you if you want to
go find these books or resources you're
happy you were happy to help you locate
