can you start rolling please they're
wrong okay thank you so today we have
Kirk Sorensen to talk about liquid
fluoride thorium reactors for us to give
everybody the the general context in the
1950s the a bunch of airforce engineers
were tasked with the problem of putting
a a nuclear reactor inside an airplane
to power it flying through the air this
is a fool's errand terrible idea but the
idea they had for doing it was fabulous
they designed a thorium fueled molten
salt based reactor at ran an incredibly
high temperatures it's very efficient it
was it was a thermal spectrum I can let
Kurt go on and on about that but the
idea died in the in the late 1960s and
early 1970s and it died I believe
fundamentally it's a terrible way to
make a nuclear bomb it can be done but
it's a terrible way and so given the
choice the u.s. did not have the
facilities to do a dedicated civilian
program with no overlap at all with the
with the new with the military program
that they had so they had conserve
resources they killed off the fluoride
program and they went with a nuclear
with the with the uranium fuel cycle and
that's what we've been going with ever
since now developing nations today a lot
of them want the weapons they face a
similar problem and so they're they're
choosing the uranium cycle as well but
the thorium cycle is really interesting
if you don't want to make a nuclear bomb
and like I said there's there's a ton to
say about it and I think Kirk has a huge
amount queued up so I'll let him get
going this is Kirk Sorensen thank you
very much
hi thank you very much I'm very excited
to be here today at Google and uh extra
excited because I almost didn't think I
was going to make it yesterday with my
my flight problems and so forth but it's
a great day to be talking about this
topic anybody know what today is
that's right nowadays a 40th anniversary
of man's first walk on the moon I
actually worked for NASA so I have a
little bit of a special feeling about
that today but I saw in the paper
yesterday what's our next giant leap and
I think they're referring to space and
and I would like to think that that what
we're going to talk about today might be
that next giant leap both for our
country and for the world
and so I'll plunge right into it that
the title of my talk is is lessons for
the liquid fluoride react now we've had
three tech talks so far on this topic
from some very bright folks and a number
you've probably already attended them so
I'm going to try to synthesize some of
the things there's going to be some
overlap for those who haven't heard it
before but there's also going to be some
additional information for those who've
watched those Tech Talks and my general
approach is going to be chronological
when we kind of start through time at
the beginning only not the very
beginning five billion years ago the
supernova but a little more recent than
that and take you to that before I begin
I'm going to kind of give you a real
quick summary of why this is so exciting
the potential energy that's in thorium
is really staggering I mean it
represents an enormous amount of energy
that's equivalent to far more energy
than we find in our in our chemical
based fuels like coal and natural gas
and even the way we use nuclear fuel and
uranium today we could power the whole
world on a whole lot less thorium than
we use uranium ernie's other fuels today
and at the same time we could do it much
more efficiently we can fully burn up
the thorium in this reactor versus only
burning up part of the uranium in a
typical light water reactor alright so
how did it all begin well a long time
ago in a galaxy far far away
thorium was discovered and there was
nothing particularly special about
thorium when it was discovered it was
you know just another tea dad on the
list for some reason there's a lot of
teas on the periodic table and thallium
and thorium and thulium they all kind of
run together and I I taught my little
girls the periodic table recently and
it's kind of hard to tell them apart but
there was nothing particularly special
to say about thorium when it was
discovered and tell Marie Curie figured
out that all my goodness
this stuff's radioactive and that was a
really revolutionary idea the whole
principle of radioactivity where is this
energy coming from three kinds of
radioactivity there's alpha emission
there's beta emission and there's gamma
emission but the basic idea is this
stuff matter that we thought was
immutable actually changes and you begin
to wonder how can it change it and does
it keep going and what is it changing
into and and all this stuff was was it
was completely theoretical for years I
mean they spent the first half of the
20th century breaking down this idea the
idea of the decay chains we find that
there's for natural decay chains and
there's four of them because an alpha
particle has a mass of four and so every
time you drop an alpha you change by
four and so that's why there's four
decay chains now one of them's extinct
neptunium here but the other three we
find in nature and they're the source of
all of our naturally radioactive
materials but before even this could be
understood a few conceptual
breakthroughs had to happen one of them
was is we had to understand nuclear
fission was possible and boy think about
in the early 20th century the idea that
the matter was immutable and the new
clean the atom could never change and
find out it could not only change it
could change radically and give off a
lot of energy and to understand the
nucleus and to and to realize all these
principles these all laid the
foundations for our first lesson for
lifter which is that once you figure out
how matter really works you realize that
nuclear fission is an incredibly dense
source of energy and I would say it's
probably the source of energy for how to
power our industrial society in the
future and I'll try to substantiate that
as I go through the nature because of
those three chose for decay chains I
showed you one of them's extinct nature
gave us three options for fuel the one
on the top is what we we use all the
time and and now paint yourself in in
the in the late 1930s early 1940s this
is when they figured out that
uranium-235 confusion and then they came
over to the United States
this idea came over the United States
not far from here over in Berkeley and
Glenn Seaborg told the students hey go
figure out if we can make something
fizzle out of uranium-238 which is much
more common and they can now they could
they could make plutonium and then
Seaborg who had a very very fertile mind
began to figure out that hey you know
what I'll bet if this worked on uranium
238 I'll bet it would work on thorium 2
and sure enough they figured out that
all three of these could be made to make
nuclear energy so what's the distinction
between well again it's a wartime
scenario so the first question was how
do we turn into a weapon and in this you
know if I find my editorial a second
this to me is one of the great tragedies
of nuclear energy that it was discovered
in context of a war now I kind of wait
that saying you know what if it hadn't
been for the war perhaps it would have
never been perhaps the resources would
have never been expended to make this
happen I don't know but it is a sad
thing to me that all of these were
initially evaluated in terms of their
destructive potential but nevertheless
this is how it happened
natural uranium they figured out that
they could isolate that u-235 and they
could make a bomb atom and that was her
Oshima in 1945 they also figured out you
could take the remaining uranium and you
can irradiated you could make plutonium
and you could make a bomb out of it now
what about thorium could you irradiated
of it well it turns out it's not it's a
it's a really bad idea and the reason
it's a really bad idea is because it's
inevitably contaminated with uranium 232
and uranium 232 is decaying and throwing
off gammas and basically screwing up
your weapon it's a trashing your
explosives it's trashing your
electronics and it's telling everybody
where it is so it didn't take these
smart level-headed guys back then who
didn't have any time to mess around a
while to figure out that we don't want
to do it this way this isn't a good idea
and it's not only something can get away
from either a very very small amount of
u-232 really makes handle u-233
extremely difficult so the first lesson
for lifter is thorium is no good for for
some sort of second lesson for lifter
throwing so good for nuclear weapons but
if it's wartime this fact isn't really
going to help you very much so here we
are 2009 we can take a different we can
take a different perspective on it so as
they looked into how to build a reactor
we've all seen this
before the chain reaction I'm sure you
know sometimes I've wondered if this
picture has it done more to dissuade
future nuclear engineers from getting
into the craft than almost anything else
I've ever seen because the net the
natural inclination when you look at the
pictures well this is bad this is
getting away on us this is this is uh
this is not controllable I don't like
this thing you know and then that was
certainly my impression the first
hundred times I ever looked at it but
then I went to nuclear engineering
school they taught me about what
criticality is and this is another word
that's kind of entered our vocabulary in
a negative way oh my goodness it's going
to go critical like that's a really bad
thing well it turns out criticality is
just a state of balance if you have
10,000 visions and you get 10,000 more
visions that's critical your reactor is
going to stay at the same fission rate
if 10,000 visions lead to less then it's
subcritical if they lead to more it's
supercritical and rates change but I
mean these can be controlled and how can
they be controlled let me give you an
analogy how it works in a real reactor
you know it's impossible to get perfect
criticality through any natural earth
I'm sorry through any artificial means
we know if we can't make a fission
reaction rate perfect two to ten decimal
places the good news is is we don't have
to nature will do it for us if we
construct a system that feeds back on
itself and has a response then it will
naturally dial itself into criticality
and the analogy I use is a mass on a
spring you know if you try to put the
mass at just the right location where
the spring balances the force of the
mass being pulled down it's pretty hard
to just know exactly where that point is
but you let it go and what happens is
the spring will will gradually take you
into the right place the same with a
reactor we create mechanisms in the
reactor that feedback to the fission
rate and we make mechanisms that make
the fission rate and heat proportional
to one another so I'm sorry inversely
proportional to one other
so as the reactor gets hotter fission
becomes less likely as the reactor gets
cooler vision becomes more likely so
what happens it will naturally dial
itself in to just where it needs to be
to be critical so take away from this is
criticality is not it's not a big scary
thing in fact we can build reactors
quite straightforwardly this was a first
reactor that was built in Chicago is
just a big pile of uranium and graphite
bricks and the trick to doing all this
is what's called the temperature
coefficient of reactor
this is a long word to explain a simple
concept which is you want your reactor
to naturally control itself and you can
do this in a normal reactor it happens
because as water expands it becomes less
likely to slow down the neutrons and
that decreases the fission rate and so
the reactor will self-control we can
build self-controlling reactors reactors
are not are not are not necessarily
twitching now don't get me wrong you can
build bad reactors you can build bad
reactors that have unpleasant
characteristics but you can build good
reactors too and that's the kind we
build here in the West as reactors that
are strongly self-controlling
okay after the Manhattan prep after the
the army really took over Enrico Fermi
and Eugene Wigner said well gee what's
the right way to go forward we want to
turn what we've done into something
that's good for Humanity we want to we
want to make energy and Fermi's
approaches he said well gee we really
ought to really ought to base it on
plutonium and the reason why is
plutonium is going to make lots of extra
neutrons in fast fission and fast
fission is the way to go we want to go
fast breeder reactor and Victor said no
no that's not such a good idea
thermal efficient the way to go we want
to slow down neutrons and by doing that
we're going to have safer reactors and
have easier to control reactors gonna be
able to employ those mechanisms that I
was talking about that control natural
criticality and the only way to do this
was to use thorium so this was kind of a
fork in the road back during the
Manhattan Project is one guy went off
one direction to go work your rhenium
plutonium the other guy went the other
direction to work thorium in uranium
uranium 233 I should say and the reason
the thermal reactor is so different from
a fast reactor is it's almost hard to
see at this scale but this is what these
nuclei look like to neutrons I'm if you
were a neutron in a reactor going around
you would see up here on the top row
that's the thermal spectrum you know big
targets and the blue represents if you
hit it you're going to cause a fission
and the red represents if you hit it
it's just going to absorb it's going to
eat the neutron so you see look
plutonium is a big target but most of
the time you hit it well actually about
a third of the time you hit it you're
just going to get eaten rather than
cause a fission on the other hand
uranium 233 most time you hit it you're
going to cause a fission rather than an
absorption now look down here the fast
spectrum
it's you can't see it at this skill but
most of the time you hit the you hit the
nuclei you're going to have a fission
the problem is you don't hit it very
often so a thermal reactor gets a lot
better fuel efficiency you need a lot
less fuel to get the same amount of heat
the upshot of that is a thermal reactor
like lifter can get about can get about
five times more heat per unit fissile
fuel than a fast reactor can so that was
another basic reason to go this
direction so some of the lessons for
lifter only thorium can be fully
consumed in a thermal spectrum reactor
you can't do this with with natural
uranium you have to have a fast breeder
reactor for that and so it's a basic
fork in the road that says hey you know
this is a basic advantage of those three
fissile fuels we really ought to be
thinking about thorium because it has
this basic advantage so how does story
and make energy well starting with
thorium 232 it absorbs a neutron it
becomes thorium 233 that's what doesn't
last very long it decays really quickly
to protactinium-233 now protactinium is
chemically distinct from thorium you
know it tastes different and so you can
separate it chemically in a way that you
can't isotopically and then the
prototype Neum is going to decay to
uranium 233 and that's the good stuff
that's your fuel that gets hit by a
neutron it's going to cause a fission
and throw off some more neutrons that
will continue the nuclear process and
also convert more thorium to energy so
this is how you burn thorium this is how
you you burn it up in a reactor it's a
four-step process and because all these
decay processes take time you can burn
throwing them all up at once you know
it's not like you can load a reactor up
and it's going to go off thorium
represents a great way to store energy
because you can only release that energy
at a very measured rate in the reactor a
friend of mine brought this today this
is a this is a hundred grams of lead and
of course this isn't thorium but it's
kind of analogous because it's almost as
heaviest thorium a hundred grams of
thorium would represent your lifetime
energy consumption if it was used in a
liquid fluoride reactor so it would have
been really neat if we could have
actually lets you hold a hundred grams
of thorium and and Ian and I actually
investigated this to see if we could
bring a hundred grams of thorium here we
found out the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has these concerns about that
you know so I don't know
I mean thorium is natural it's out in
rocks you walked over far more than 100
grams of thorium in your life I can
guarantee but I'm going to hand this
around to you and I want you to imagine
just for a moment that you are holding
your lifetime supply of energy and think
how cool it would be if it was really
thorium yeah
they oh they did okay okay it looks like
we've got some actual thorium or to pass
around and and I don't think it's quite
a lifetime supply of energy but it's an
awful lot so nature was very kind to
give us this stuff in fact it does I
just think you know this is a great
blessing that we happen to live on a
planet that has this much thorium and
then it turns out all the other planets
due to you know NASA's figured out
there's lots of thorium on Mars and the
moon in fact we have maps of the moon's
thorium deposits cos storms could have
to tell you where it is it says here am
come get me right here so it's not like
we're gonna run out of this stuff on the
earth or any other planet either okay so
going back to Eugene and and and Enrico
you know he asked a really large of a
question to uh Wigner he said you know
gee how you gonna use this stuff
how you gonna prevent losses because
that protein is gonna gobble up your
neutron vikner
I really think was one of those mines
that was accidentally transplanted from
the future back into the past I mean he
was just so so so far ahead of everybody
else and he said we're gonna build a
fluid-filled reactor that's how and the
reason why is his background was a
chemical engineering as a chemical
engineer he was used to deal with
everything in fluid form when you use
chemicals or you'd use reactants and so
forth you do it if you got a solid for
CDs turn into liquid when you're done
you can turn it back into salt but you
do everything as a liquid and so his
principle basically going to this was
we're going to do it as a liquid and
here was the basic idea we were gonna
have this liquid core that had the
uranium 233 in it and it was going to be
fissioning and it was going to be
throwing these neutrons out and it was
gonna be turning thorium into uranium
233 then you're gonna just chemically
isolate this cuz like I said they taste
different you know you know I don't mean
that literally right don't don't eat
thorium but they're gonna isolate it and
then they were going to put it back in
the core and so you just kept doing this
process and that was how you're going to
make it work
okay so one of the basic advantages is
in fluid form you can get past a lot of
the drawbacks of using thorium we use in
solid form you run of those problems of
u-232 and so
but there's another one that I didn't
have the art skills to mention on the
slide and that's xenon-135 c-135 is the
biggest Neutron poison we know of it
just loves to eat neutrons I wanted to
make a picture of it on the map it's
like it's like looking at Jupiter next
to Pluto or something like that I mean
is just huge and it gobbles up neutrons
and this was a real problem they built
the first few reactors and vikner
realized Bhau if I had this in liquid
form that xenon being a gas would just
come right out so that's a very big deal
if we had reactor operators here today
they'd be happy to tell you all the
troubles they have battling xenon in
solid fuel reactors it's a real pain in
the tail when you when you run a real
reactors this was a big advantage of
them so after they went in different
directions Fermi's group building the
first liquid metal fast breeder reactors
in Idaho and then Victor's group in
Oakridge building what's called an
aqueous homogeneous reactor this was not
a molten salt reactor this used uranium
in water and well I love this picture a
beaker of liquid equals a thousand tons
of coal that's actually that's actually
a solution there of what is it
urinal night urinal sulfate dissolved in
heavy water and then they really ran
this thing and and it had a lot of
advantages but it had one basic
disadvantage there was no aqueous form
of thorium you couldn't dissolve thorium
into water you could dissolve uranium
into water but you couldn't do with
thorium and that was a real problem as
they tried to build fluid fueled
reactors they didn't know how to solve
it they worked on it they worked on it
but it didn't go anywhere well every now
and then something sucker-punches you
from a direction you're not waiting for
and this is what happened these guys at
Oak Ridge they had this program to build
an aircraft reactor and most of them
thought it was pretty hokey they didn't
think it was a good idea
in fact Alvin Weinberger ran the lab
said you know it wasn't like we all
sudden believe the nuclear airplanes
were a good idea it was the only way we
could keep building reactors that the
purpose was unattainable if not foolish
was not so important a high temperature
reactor could be useful for other
purposes even if it never propelled an
airplane so in the one of the earlier
examples of scientists using the
government's money and the military's
money they they definitely took this
approach they said okay sure we'll build
junior aircraft reactor and it was boy
it was super hard because one of the bay
prongs with solid fuel you burn solid
fuel really hard and it begins to
striate and it's not very thermally
conductive and you get radiation damage
and and all your fission product gases
are trapped in there the worst one being
that xenon-135 it just gobbles up
neutrons in fact when you run a reactor
really hard you make a lot of xenon and
it makes it very difficult to control
you can get what's called xenon
transients where the reactor wants to
shut down and I don't have time to go
the details this but you can only
imagine if you're flying a nuclear
bomber over Siberia and you run the
reactor too hard and the engineer comes
back says captain we're gonna have to
shut down for nine hours because the
xenon is overriding our reactivity
control oh yeah that's fine I'll just
I'll just put down right here on the on
the snow fields of Siberia and wait for
my xenon to at decay away no that's not
an option that's a really bad day so
they learned really quickly like man we
have got to have a reactor that does not
have this problem and the guys at
Oakridge were just scraper than their
heads going cow how are we gonna do this
because we know this water version isn't
gonna work what could we possibly make
this out of somebody had the great idea
said hey what about a fluoride but
what's the fluoride flies are salt salts
are really really chemically stable we
use salts all the time I brushed my
teeth this morning with some sodium
fluoride and the nice thing about about
fluorides is because they're so darn
happy being what they are they can go to
really high temperatures and they don't
have to have high pressures this was
sort of the beginning of the idea like
okay sounds good so far I can see where
you're going there's sort of the
inherent physical merit of the idea but
they thought gee can we build a reactor
out of this stuff and this was the birth
of the liquid fluoride reactors to say
can we dissolve uranium and full pan and
thorium into salts well turns out yeah
you can it's really easy in fact you can
dissolve uranium tetrafluoride
and thorium tetrafluoride into the salt
and guess what you can actually
theoretically make a reactor now again
this was still theoretical okay check
it'll dissolve good we know we've got a
liquid form of thorium now but can we
really make a reactor out of it so they
built this guy the aircraft reactor
experiment this was the first liquid
fluoride reactor this thing ran for
about a hundred hours and some of the
highest temperatures that were achieved
by a nuclear reactor and what's even
cooler about it was it did it at
atmospheric pressure this wasn't some
big high pressure reactor this was
running at essentially ambient pressure
and they found out it with
self-controlling remember I told you
guys about the temperature coefficient
of react
tivity how do you make a reactor
self-controlling they made itself
controlling because as the salt would
expand there was less fuel in the core
and so the reaction rate would slow down
and as the salt got cooler and got
denser there was more fuel on the core
and the reaction rate would increase so
they found that this reactor just
basically ran itself you know as they
would increase the heat removal it would
power up as they would decrease the heat
removal it would power down now again go
back to the cockpit of the airplane this
is a great thing if you're the pilot you
don't want to have fifteen guys sitting
in the back trying to run your reactor
you want to put your hand on the on the
throttle go
and you want that ready to go yeah here
we go you know and power right up and
that's what this reactor could do
because of that very strong negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity
this reactor wanted to follow whatever
you wanted you'd have to use control
rods or moved around it was self
controlling and it was chemically stable
they figured out that yeah you could
have fission and it would still not
screw up the fuel this is a picture of
the airforce Colonel Colonel Gastner who
was shutting down the reactor for the
last time they only ran it for a hundred
hours it was just to sort of see if it
worked
okay after that boy they got so excited
they wanted to build a really big
version of it they call the fireball and
it's gonna be like 60 megawatts and it
was going to show how this was was
really going to power an airplane but
what happened was oh and here's great
picture showing you what this salt looks
like it looks a lot like Palmolive you
know if you've ever had dish have you
ever had a era had to go wash the dishes
of pomo it kind of looks like that
liquid but it doesn't run like that you
come on think it's really viscous it's
not actually runs a lot like water so
it's you can you can pour it now it's
hot nothing wrong you don't report on
your hand but it but it has about the
consistency of water has great heat
transfer properties as well okay so a
lesson from lifter to extract from all
this is sometimes the right answer comes
at a completely unexpected direction
that's what the aircraft reactor program
was to Weinberg and Wigner and those
guys trying to use thorium it was not at
all what they expected and fluoride fuel
is the only way to build a high
temperature high power density reactor
if you build it on solid fuel you're
going to be fighting your xenon there's
no way around that fast spectrum I think
is you know the problems
okay so Weinberg after the aircraft
reactor program began to go kaput he's
like you know I never really wanted the
aircraft reactor program anyway I wanted
the civilian reactor program I love this
quote until then I had never quite
appreciated the full significance of the
breeder but now I became obsessed with
the idea that humanity's whole future
depended on the breeder then when he
says breeder he means the ability to
burn up thorium that's really what he's
saying we tend to think of liquid metal
breeders that's really what he's talking
about
and I understand that kind of zeal and
passion because I feel the same way
myself I really feel like this discovery
of thorium and its potential
earth-shattering consequences for us and
that indeed if we are going to have
sustainable industrial society on this
planet that it's going to be dependent
on this technology so he began to put
together a small team and get funding
from the Atomic Energy Commission to
continue designing this now he had a
basic advantage it was really easy to
separate thorium in uranium and this is
another great trick that nature gives us
if you pop uranium in solution with
fluorine gas it will turn into uranium
hexafluoride which is gaseous and that
will just come right out our solution so
it was a one-step process to remove the
fuel that you're making from what it is
that will become the fuel in this case
the thorium this trick doesn't work in
uranium plutonium but it does work in
thorium uranium because of the
particular chemical characteristics of
that fuel so again nature is nature is
kind lesson for a lifter the ability to
separate this stuff is a big deal and
you can do it at high temperatures you
can do it in high radiation fields it's
it's inherently chemical process there's
no cooling off that's required so this
got them even more excited and then
serendipity struck one day they were
meeting in 1959 and they found out the
Atomic Energy Commission wanted to build
experiments and so they had to cost less
than a million dollars the guy who did
the guy who ran the what I'm about to
explain you the molten salt reactor
experiment he wrote the proposal and day
how many you guys could write a proposal
for a nuclear reactor in a day yeah I
couldn't do it either but hey Chris
could do it cuz but but what happens
sometimes in the real world is when
people want stuff they don't want to be
patient for they want the answer right
then they want the puzzle so you got to
be ready and to keep things simple he
just wanted to simulate the core of what
it was they wanted to build he wanted to
have it bigger he wanted to have it have
more power but there were all these
limitations based on what the Atomic
Energy Commission wanted so this is what
the molten salt reactor experiment
looked like it was a bunch of graphite
fuel elements in that tank and then they
would flow the fluoride fuel through it
and here it is sitting in his hot so
they can I see the reactor kind of in
the middle there's the salt pump and the
heat exchanger so you'd run the you'd
run the salt through the core and it
would get hot and then it would give up
its heat to the heat exchanger and then
it would all be driven by these pumps
and they ran this reactor for about five
years from 1965 to 1969 and during that
time they demonstrate
a lot of the features that we would want
ultimately in lifter online refueling
they did it this is actually a capsule
and they would load it up with new fuel
and then just drop it in the reactor and
it was just kind of the fuels in the
capsule just is all the way when they
wanted to take out the uranium they used
fluorination they showed that that work
they could remove all the uranium
actually did that in 1968 and then they
did a sample where they they took out
some of the fuel and they distilled away
all the good stuff out of the fuel and
they just left behind the waste so each
of these steps was was really
demonstrated successful in the msre and
they had this fantastic safety feature
well it's called the freeze plug now
because if you will so hot if you cool
it down it will it will freeze and it
will lock up in the pipe and so they had
a little blower over a flattened section
of pipe and it kept it kept part of the
salt just frozen right there in the pipe
so the whole idea was if you lost all
power to the reactor if you turned all
the lights off all the juice off all
that would happen is that freeze plug
would melt and the and the salt would
drain out into a drain tank that was
passively cooled now this is so cool
because this reactor in most reactors
you have to take the coolant to the
reactor in an emergency situation and
that makes them hard to build because
you've got to have the regular core be
able to run and make power 99.9 percent
of the time but in an emergency case
you've got to be able to get the
emergency coolant in and override
everything else you designed for all the
other times this reactor was completely
opposite you could have the core just do
what it was supposed to and then if
there was emergency it would send the
fuel to the safe place that would send
the fuel to the place where it was going
to be passively cool so fantastic safety
feature and one of the ones that they
demonstrated in the msre in fact these
guys on friday afternoons they wouldn't
want to leave the reactor running over
the weekend so they just go and they
turn off all the power the salt plug
would freeze the thing would drain into
the tanks it would lock it would freeze
up over the weekend they'd come back on
Monday they turn the heaters on they
pump it out of the tanks back up into
the core so I mean they did this over
and over and over again fantastic safety
feature here's a picture of the building
the msre is in today now that's not
actually the msre but but it's down it's
actually right below that concrete slab
I was there a few years ago and got to
see the building so if you ever get a
chance to go out to Oak Ridge National
Labs you know tell them to take you over
to the old msre building or Annelle 7503
okay so lessons for lifter from the MSR
you
got to be ready to demonstrate your idea
because when the time comes you're not
going to get much warning they're going
to want the answer and the working
example is worth stacks of documents and
theories so one of the things I love to
tell people like you know how do you
know this works and go well they did it
it really worked and they demonstrated
not all but most of the features that
are that are pertinent to this reactor
well after doing that they really wanted
to investigate how to build the real
thing and they began to go through
different design concepts for what would
be called the molten salt breeder
reactor the MSB are some had pebbles
some had prismatic filaments but the
basic idea was that you were going to
have these sections in the middle that
would run the course all and they're
going to surround the whole thing with
the thorium blanket kind of like that
schematic that we showed earlier this
was about where they were they stopped
on this on this design it's a little
hard to see but the fuel will get pumped
up through the middle go up to the top
and then come back down and an annulus
and it'll ed to a lot of plumbing
problems and and some very tight
tolerances on graphite and that was a
real concern for him because they didn't
know how graphite was going to respond
under a radiation here's more pictures
just showing what the reactor looked
like in the building but the really
appealing thing about this was approach
was they had this super simple fuel
cycle I mean you would make the you
would make the fuel you would
fluorinated out you would introduce it
into the core you'd burn up when it was
time to reprocess the core you'd take
out the fuel you distill off the good
stuff and you were just left with
fission products so they're just a super
simple closed nuclear fuel cycle here it
is in it more schematics I'm going to
leave all these slides make them
available to you so you can peruse these
at your leisure a lot of these things
I'm flying through because I don't have
a lot of time but I want you to to get
an idea for the depth of work they did
now the real problem they had was with
graphite graphite would swell first that
would contract and then it would swell
under a radiation and as they began to
realize this they thought a lot of our
plans for how we were going to build
this reactor aren't going to work just
because of tolerance seeing and how
graphite is going to change and so forth
so they had to they had to move away
from the two-fluid reactor had a
plumbing problem
so for us we got to realize that the
plumbing problem has got to be
understood and managed and I think it
can be I have some really good ideas
that but the overall appeal the
two-fluid reactor is still great and it
really comes from that very very
simple fuel cycle well after the
two-fluid they moved to a one-fluid and
it's like they traded one set of
problems for another now the thorium in
the uranium were mixed together in one
fuel the core was a lot simpler it was
just these was actually very very simple
it was just these prismatic few elements
of graphite
I'm sorry not fuel ins prismatic
elements of graphite he'd pump the salt
in the bottom it would flow up through
all the graphite elements and then it
would be pumped out the top so it was a
very very simple reactor design
unfortunately the simplicity in the
reactor led to complications in the
reprocessing the reprocessing went from
being easy to hard and the basic reason
for that is it's very difficult to
separate thorium from the fission
products they chemically are very
similar in the two-fluid approach the
thorium wasn't mixed with fission
products because fission wasn't taking
place where the thorium was the thorium
is in the blanket the uranium is in the
core it's easy to separate uranium
fission products it's hard to separate
thorium so that's why I got complicated
so a lesson for lifter fixing one
problem can create another and the other
problem you create often is bigger than
the first so maybe we should be thinking
about the two-fluid reactor everybody
who's on my forum knows i'm a big
advocate for the two-fluid reactor okay
well if you want to have a reactor that
is a fairly compact you have to think a
little bit about why our reactors not so
compact today and this shows what a
containment structure looks like in a
typical light water reactor here's the
reactor which although it's big is not
nearly as big as a containment structure
the reason the containment so big is
because the water in the reactor if the
reactors breached somehow the water will
flash the steam that water's being held
in about 3,000 psi of pressure so if you
breach the the reactor or the steam
generators or the pipes that's all going
to flash to water so your containment
has to be big enough to hold all that
steam under pressure and in fact the
Watts bar reactor they have these huge
ice condensers that are just there to
condense the steam that would come out
in the case of the reactor breaking are
being breached on the other hand with
the fluoride reactor technology you can
have these really close fitting
containments because even if you were to
go and breach the side of the reactor
well the first thing would happen is the
salt would probably come out and freeze
and plug the hole because it's not under
pressure and the outside is cooler than
the inside so
that's that would be nice thing but if
you manage to get it out it would kind
of go glug glug glug it would fall down
the side it would hit this pan and it
would roll down into the drain tank so
there's no evolution of steam there's no
chemical reaction that's going to take
place
and either way whether you do terrible
damage to the reactor or shut it
normally it's gonna end up in the drain
tank so that's a really nice feature if
you want to think about deep levels of
safety if you want to think about really
inherent passive levels of safety so
lesson four lifter if you want a
close-fitting containment don't have
anything that changes phases or
undergoes violent reactions like liquid
sodium that's a nice thing about this
reactor alright so what happened to this
well part of it was is the Atomic Energy
Commission was being run by a guy named
Milt saw and he was very driven to build
the liquid metal fast breeder reactor
Lisa Weinberg's words he said Milt
tackled the LMF PR project with rickover
Rick cope in you know what that was
dedication woe be unto any that stood in
his way this caused problems for me
since I was still espousing the molten
salt breeder mill was like a bull he
enjoyed congressional confidence so his
position in the AC was unassailable it
was clear he had little confidence in me
or at ORNL after all we were pushing
molten salt and not the fast breeder
more than that we were being quite
troublesome over the question reactor
safety I didn't mention this earlier
alvin weinberg invented the light water
reactor he holds the patent on that
design that is so prevalent in the world
today
he knew it's its capabilities and its
limitations he felt like this was a
better approach but that was not a
popular opinion of the time there was a
congressman who ran the Joint Commission
Atomic Energy Chet Holifield and they
were having conversation he and Milton
Alvin and congressman Holyfield got
exasperated said Alvin if you are so
concerned about the safety of reactors I
think it may be time for you to leave
nuclear energy so what happened was
Alvin Weinberg the Wernher von Braun of
Oakridge got fired and he got fired
because his his opinions were at
variance with those of the Atomic Energy
Commission and congressional leadership
he'd called nuclear energy a foul in
bargaining you promoted the molten salt
breeder so very important lesson for
lifter even if you invented the light
water reactor
your bosses will still fire you if you
get in the way of their plans the
comment was that rickover was even worse
than the Atomic Energy Commission he
owned a huge chunk of the Navy and try
with Osprey and congressional approval
so these guys were in very powerful
positions okay
so we'll set that part of the story down
for a while and pick up a very
interesting part of the story which is
what do we do now what are we facing now
well if we look at spent nuclear stuff
that comes out of our reactors and we
look at the radio toxicity of the three
parts of that the fission products the
uranium the spent nuclear fuel we can
see that the radio toxicity of the
fission products drops off rather
rapidly over about 300 to 500 years on
the other hand the unburned fuel the
plutonium has a much longer radio
toxicity so if you can go and if you can
go and remove that or not create it you
can have a radio toxicity over the long
run that's much lower than even uranium
ore now how do you do this in a thorium
reactor well the basic physical
advantage you have a thorium is you're
starting to mass number 232 and you've
got to march pretty far up the chain
before you get to plutonium up at 239
and as you march up that chain there's
two big on ramps called fission where
you you're probably going to get turned
into energy so the upshot of it is is
you can run a thorium reactor in a way
where you will make very very little
plutonium in fact if you pull out the
neptunium you'll make no plutonium at
all but if you don't you're going to
have a very small and plutonium on the
other hand in a light water reactor that
uses you 238 you're going to make
plutonium on your very first step you're
going to absorb a neutron you make
plutonium 239 and it's not as good of a
fissile fuel you begin marching through
these higher actinides and they're
captured efficient ratios and a whole
bunch of other stuff I don't want to get
into but what it means though is if you
want to avoid making the long-lived
stuff
your best bet is this to start with with
thorium so avoid making transuranics
while you make power and this is
possible if you use the thorium approach
now today we've got spent nuclear fuel
accumulating from our nuclear reactors a
typical 1 gigawatt reactor will make
about 35 tons of spent nuclear fuel each
year and what they do is they take this
this fuel which is just very hot because
of the decay of the fission products and
they put it in these cooling pools and
it cools down the the reactor
radioactivity and the heat generation
drop exponentially over time but we're
accumulating this stuff here's here's a
graph that really opened up my eyes this
is this is the amount of spent nuclear
fuel we have and this line right here
represents how much we can legally put
in Yucca Mountain now we'll get to Yucca
Mountain just a minute but you can see
that it's not going to be long before
our rate of generation spent nuclear
fuel is going to have Yucca pretty full
and then even if we expand Yucca
Mountain which is perfectly possible
Yucca Mountain could be could hold a lot
more spent nuclear fuel and does it
doesn't take all that long to get there
especially the constant 100 gigawatts
were making today if we start building
more nuclear reactors and having more
power than and I mean when I said
nuclear reactors I mean light water
reactors we're going to hit those limits
a lot sooner this is a really big deal
for a government that's trying to figure
out what to do is spend nuclear fuel
under current nuclear regulate under
current regulations we can't hold all
the spent nuclear fuel we're going to
create in Yucca Mountain and especially
if we build we build a lot more of these
lifters so this was the approach that's
been advocated in the Department of
Energy for the last seven or eight years
or so it's now no longer being advocated
but this is what they had said is we're
going to take spent nuclear fuel and
we're going to go separate it and we're
going to make fuel for a fast burner
reactor rather than a fast breeder
reactor we're going to go we're going to
burn it up and then that's going to
reduce the amount of the transionic
waste that we're going to send the Yucca
Mountain now our current approach to
nuclear reprocessing this is I think
called aqueous for processing or pure X
or Y or X or some variant of her X and
it's based on dissolving nuclear fuel
in nitric acid and liquids and so forth
you have to let the nuclear fuel cool
down before you do it quite a bit in
fact and it's a very complicated process
because like I said before the first
thing you're doing is you're taking a
solid and you're turn into a liquid and
then when you're trying to liquid you're
trying to separate all the piece parts
and the components out and then at the
end you're trying to take this liquid
and turn it back into a solid again and
so our typical approach to reprocessing
is quite complicated and quite expensive
now the friendship they've really
mastered this I mean they have a
facility la Hague where where they do
this but it's a big facility and they
spend a lot of money to make this work
we know it's possible but it's difficult
now on the other hand the reprocessing
we talked about in the fluid in the
fluoride reactor is really simply we
just flora Nate the blanket and we
introduce it into the core and on a
batch scale on a batch scale approach we
can go and we can process out that core
this lesson has to be done really
regularly it can be done on a longer
time scale so this is a complete nuclear
fuel cycle boiled down to just a handful
of steps ok so the natural question to
ask is is there anything that this
fluoride reactor technology could do for
our existing light water spent fuel
problem and the answer is yes absolutely
because the first step we do with normal
uranium oxide that we might as we turn
into a fluoride that's the that's how
it's put into a gaseous diffusion plan
Chris asked me to ask whoever is on the
VC to mute the mic so I'm gonna assume
whoever you are you know what that is
okay so here's the composition of spent
nuclear fuel most of it is unburned
uranium then there's dessert which is
mostly zirconium that's the cladding
that goes around the outside of the fuel
element there's some hardware that's
used to pull the fuel elements in and
out of the core now you see that says TR
you 0.7 that's the long-lived nuclear
waste that's the stuff that really
drives a place like Yucca Mountain to
say what are we going to do with this
stuff because the other that's the
fission products they're very
radioactive right now but because
they're still radioactive they're
decaying quickly they're going away and
within a few hundred years they'll drop
below background levels of radiation
the
vision products are not our long-term
waste problem the long-term waste
problem is the transuranics they're the
ones that have thousand-year half-lives
and so forth okay so what can we do
about this we could flora Nate that
oxide fuel we could change it from being
oxides and make it into fluorides and
then once we go to this fluorides we can
start using all those same chemical
tricks that we use on lifter but now
using on spent nuclear fuel we take out
the uranium as uranium hexafluoride we
we bubble fluorine gas through it and
take it all out now uranium that's been
in a reactor is basically no different
than the uranium that's been in the
ground in fact my vote for it would be
to just go stick it in a cave somewhere
because it's it's no different than the
uranium that's sitting anywhere else
what's really what we want to do is to
burn up those those transient acai
scopes and there's a number of different
ways we can do it we could do that in
lifter we could do it in variations of
lifter that use chlorides and set
chlorides but the idea is we want to
burn this stuff up and not make it into
a long-term problem we want to isolate
those fission products and let it decay
away and then we want to use lifter to
stop making more transgenic waste
because when we run lifter we can avoid
making the transionic waste probably not
stupid uh-huh yes yes
other the vast majority of uranium never
fission is you're absolutely right so
the question was is where are the
fission products and they're in the the
other category and then he made the
comment that the vast majority of the
uranium never fission's and that's
correct in a white water reactor the
vast majority does not fission okay now
if we could take this approach the way
we're going now is this red line you can
see if we wait for it to get to the same
radiotoxicity
as natural anymore we're looking at you
know three hundred thousand years if we
go ahead and take out the plutonium in
the uranium we give that to the nine
thousand years which isn't that
impressive to get it to there but if we
remove all the plutonium uranium and the
minor actinides the the unburned fuel so
just pumped we can get that down to
three hundred years that's basically the
curve for just fission products and that
green curve is where we can get with
lifter we can get there and even though
we we haven't been using lifter we've
been using light water reactors we can
still go use this fluoride reactor
technology to go and remove those those
transgenics and to destroy them the
uranium we just go stick in the ground
somewhere or we could rain returned when
ever we want with it
I have another request for a mic to be
muted by the VC whoever's on the VC turn
off your mic that was Chris better
listen to him okay okay so my lesson for
lifter you we can use these fluoride
reprocessing technologies to fix the
problem that we have right now handling
spent nuclear fuel and then we can use
the results of that to start new lifters
that don't contribute to the problem in
the future
so this is really the break in nuclear
technology that I'm proposing that we
take is to say let's go in this thorium
direction this direction that we ignored
for so long that was proposed at the
very dawn of the nuclear age and let's
use this approach to solve our long-term
nuclear problems I want to show you the
the waste generation because a lot of
times I read criticisms of nuclear power
that are based around how much waste you
generate and so I started
with the assumption that we were going
to make a gigawatt year of energy and I
I used an anti-nuclear site to to give
me these numbers so I figured it would
be considered fairly a conservative if I
use the anti-nuclear side there's better
sites than this but the whole idea is to
get a gigawatt year of of energy in a
uranium-fueled reactor were going to
mine about 80,000 tons of uranium
containing 0.2% now there are some sites
that have a lot better than that there's
some sites that have much higher war
grades than that some that are worse so
I mean take that for what it's worth
scale it for the degree of uranium I'm
sorry
800,000 my my my thank you thank you for
catching me on that okay now let and
after we go and we make all this stuff
we're going to be left with you know 35
to 40 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel
and that's where we are today this is
what we do today now contrast that with
a thorium approach now who's got the
who's got the thorium mean you gotta for
you okay now I don't recall exactly what
is the percentage of thorium in this
Rock what would you say it was in half
percent okay so I wanna show their half
percent okay in a high-grade ore for
thorium is twenty percent so I'm gonna
I'm gonna show you here we go this is a
piece of half a percent this is a shale
right in this is from the Lemhi pass in
idaho this piece of rock right here
contains about half a percent of thorium
and I believe about 25 milligrams the
thorium is that correct sufficient
energy to orbit an SUV that's pretty
exciting okay
say here there's something perverse
about that thought I don't know what it
is me okay so here I am I'm holding this
piece of rock right here with half
percent of thorium if I had 200 metric
tons of this rock I would go and I would
process it to get out roughly a metric
ton of thorium and if I did that I would
be able to put that thorium in a lifter
and I'd be able to burn it up completely
to u-233
and I would make about 0.8 metric tons
of spent nuclear fuel that would just be
the fission product so you know 200 tons
of this rock is not so hard for me to
imagine we could probably I'm not you
know how much do you think 200 tons of
this are I'll bet we could put a pile of
it in this room we might on we might
break the floor but I mean you're
talking about a gigawatt year of energy
this is just a staggering amount of
energy and there's a lot there's a lot
more where this came from in the LEM
High Pass of Idaho so this is pretty
exciting to have a technology Weinberg
called it burning the rocks he said he
said boy you know this is so good that
you could literally mine rock just for
its energy content in fact I did a
calculation that you took the average
crust of the earth
a cubic meter of average crust has about
12 grams of thorium in it and that would
be enough to power your life for about
10 to 15 years at Western standards so
that's an awful lot of energy that's a
that's a pretty neat Rock yes sir
okay those are the yeah that's a good
question he said you still have a fact
you sell the same mass you don't really
change mass much as you burn this up so
if you burn up a ton of thorium you're
going to get a ton of fission products
the fission products are like I said
they're very highly radioactive there's
a whole bunch of them from okay yeah
they all are born very radioactive but
because it's a reactive within a week
half of them have decayed to stability I
was really amazed when I started doing
the calculations how fast fission
products find stability they do it
really quickly so in a week you have
about half our stable in about a year
you have 75% are stable so you can
actually go and take that that waste and
you can begin to isolate it for
interesting things in there things like
rhodium anybody know what rhodium is
it's worth about 10 times more per ounce
than gold you can extract it it's stable
after after about 10 years there's no
radioactive rhodium left in the spent
fuel so and there's other things you can
extract from spent fuel they're very
useful in fact some of the most useful
things in spent fuel are radioactive
isotopes things like strontium 90 cesium
137 that could be used to shoot what
sorted irradiated food and destroy
pathogens there's a number of very
interesting things you can do with these
things but right off the bat we're
talking about a much smaller waste form
and a waste form that's in a way that we
can then isolate the pieces that were
interested in much more easily because
they're liquid okay so I'll come back to
the chart I showed at the beginning
which was starting with 250 tons of
natural uranium that came out of our
mining process when it would 35 tons of
spent fuel but one ton of natural
thorium will give us the same amount of
power and within 10 years 83% of those
fission products are stable and can be
sold yes sir the thing that makes the
throwing fundamentally more energy dense
is that we can burn it all up in a
thermal spectrum in a thermal spectrum
reactor both of these are thermal
spectrum reactors you can only burn up
part of the uranium in a thermal
spectrum reactor the only way to burn up
all the uranium is to go to a fast
spectrum reactor
or in Chris mentions enriched you all
the way to pure u-235 but then what
happens to get fuel failure before
you're able to burn it all up so yes the
most the most of you you're right the
most abundant natural isotope of thorium
is thorium 232 and that is the fuel for
this versus in a light water reactor the
most abundant isotope is u-235 which is
only 0.7% yeah the comment was is in
order to use the Iranian it has to be
enriched and you can see most of the
uranium enzyme never go into the reactor
it ends up as depleted uranium at the
enrichment plant only 35 tons of it
actually goes into the reactor verses in
thorium we can use it all in this
approach so does that does that help
answer your question that's the basic I
mean if you take uranium and thorium
together they both have the same energy
density if you fission them all up
the real advantage is the ability to
fission up the thorium all the way in a
thermal reactor that's the big hit and
and the end of thorium fluoride approach
okay and then just again showing some of
these slides I showed at the beginning
if we take this approach if we take this
radical increase in energy efficiency
and I love them people talk about
efficiencies are low-hanging fruit
that's what we need to go out for first
LIGO yep absolutely let's go after
efficiency I'll give you a 301
improvement on efficiency by going with
thorium in the fluoride reactor over
uranium this is this in conclusion this
gives us options for inherently safe
proliferation resistant economic nuclear
power that can last thousands if not
millions of years it's really fun to run
the numbers on this and find out just
how good this really is it's almost
staggering and you and you begin to get
that feeling like we had oh man this
really could be the answer this could be
the Silver Bullet that enables us to
power our industrial society and this
also offers real options for solving the
long-term issues surrounding our
existing light water fuel our spent
nuclear fuel and and ultimately
preventing the formation of new
transient equation and finally I want to
thank Google
because it's fun to be here and I love
Gmail and I love your search engine and
almost all the stuff I've done on I've
done on this it's been thanks to Google
so I could not have done anywhere near
the work I've done if it hadn't been for
Google and you didn't even charge me for
you guys are awesome thank you so much
and thank you for having me today
as we end the talk just before questions
I'd like to give a shout out to Virginia
killerman who's a geologist at the Idaho
Geological Survey she got us these rocks
at the last minute I really appreciate
it thanks a lot Virginia we had a few
but anybody have any more questions yes
sir right right there you yeah I'll let
you go first
okay I hate to say that was such a good
question but was long like that the the
cash is overflowed could you could you
actually come up here and just to
understand what you were saying in
principle the one of the big advantages
of this thorium process is that we breed
thorium into uranium and then these two
species are chemically extractable as
opposed to being two isotopes when you
enrich uranium you have to do an
isotopic separation which is much harder
yes
and so then my question is and I think
you sort of went through this with some
of the chemistry but just so that if you
can give it a concise answer this should
be possible with uranium 238 and
plutonium 239 you could breed uranium
and then chemically separate those two
species but no one ever talks about that
oh you're absolutely right you can breed
uranium 238 plutonium 239 and you can do
a chemical separation of those two a
couple of things with that that's
exactly what they want to do in fast
breeder reactors there is first of all
they're using solid fuel so they have to
irradiated argot the blanket the uranium
238 blanket for a certain period of time
before it's economically advantageous to
take it out and actually separate out
the bred plutonium and then go and make
new what they call driver fuel to go in
the core so your first disadvantage is
you're using solid fuel now that can be
overcome you can imagine doing fluid
fueled versions of the Iranian plutonium
approach but then the other part is is
that beautiful chemical trick I showed
you where you could Florin eight the
uranium out and leave the thorium that
doesn't work in your rhenium plutonium
they're too similar to each other in
fact if you go to try to Florin eight
out plutonium from uranium what will
happen first is all the uranium will
come out so if your your rate if your
fluorinating a blanket of uranium you're
going to end up fluorinating all of it
versus the stuff you want and it's it's
really it's really all the reasons
nobody's really ever seriously proposed
doing this way the other part of it is
is going back to that basic idea the
chemistry I'm sorry the neutronics you
can't burn up the plutonium effectively
unless you go to the fast spectrum so
these effects work too
gather to make this process it's not
impossible or inconceivable but from an
engineering approaches is basically a
whole lot more difficult than doing it
this way one thing I love about this as
an engineer is I can look at this and go
there are really tangible
straightforward easy to do already been
demonstrated steps that are based on
well understood chemistry that's been
around 100 years that we can go and do
it and make this happen this isn't that
hard
comparatively so what that would answer
your question okay and we could get
anybody who has a question if you have a
long question please just come up and
and say to the microphone ma'am you ask
a question is is is anyone actually
doing this was that your question is
anyone actually building this No darn it
why not I know I think the exactly why
not you know makes a great idea I had a
slide I took it out this morning I
showed a pile of cash and I said lessons
for lifter don't fool yourself it's
gonna cost a lot of money so it's good
thing I'm here you know yes sir
the question was given proper funding
and I will to do so how long would it
take to to work these things out and
I've kind of it's a very good question I
thought about a lot myself I kind of
broken in a couple of different
categories the first one I would call
the Manhattan Project approach the
Manhattan Project approach is everybody
gets a phone call that says stop what
you're doing work on this we're throwing
the whole national effort at it
everything's at your disposal I think if
we took that approach which would be my
favorite actually I honestly think we
could have a prototype up and running in
probably two or three years and we could
have production reactors being built in
five years now truly I don't think it's
going to happen you know that is just
only in brutal wartime scenarios do you
really get that one the next level I'd
call the skunkworks approach and the
skunkworks approaches you get good
funding you get favorable political
consideration you have the the means and
so forth you need but people are still
working 40-hour weeks you know they go
home to their wives and their children
at night or their husbands or whatever
and and you live a regular life in that
approach I could see us being to a
prototype reactor in about five years
and to a production series of reactors
in about ten years
that'd be the scenario and see there and
then there's what I call the business as
usual approach which is an extrapolation
of what we're doing today and that
approach nothing ever happens and we
never build this and we never get any
further than where we are now so
hopefully we will I would really like to
shoot for the skunkworks approach
because I think that is a reasonable
approach to to consider Lars I work for
the government
and I've discovered that uh and there's
an enormous variation in how things cost
depending on the the skill and the
quality and the competency of the people
executed given competent intelligent
people who were executing this with a
minimum of Mickey Mouse my estimate
would we could be to that prototype
reactor probably for three to four
hundred million dollars that would be my
guess
with Mickey Mouse and fooling around and
goofing off billions so but we don't
want that we want smart people and and
people who are working hard man this is
a fun place to come ours the comment was
the the estimate of two or three years
correlates pretty well the Manhattan
Project and and one of things I wanted
to mention when I was talking about the
plutonium of there we showed plutonium
for bombs versus thorium plutonium was a
laboratory curiosity I mean they
discovered in 1941 was like huh look
plutonium and from 1941 to 1945 when
they actually dropped a working
plutonium bomb on Nagasaki I mean you
got to remember they they went from gee
it exists to oh my goodness we can make
it - oh my goodness we're making a lot
of it to understanding the metallurgy
and the fabrication and so forth
plutonium has crazy metallurgical
properties it has like some like eight
different crystalline phases and they
all change depending temperature I mean
it was that it was a devil to figure out
how to use plutonium how to stabilize
and all these other tricks but I mean
they were throwing unlimited national
resources out of essentially the
brightest minds on earth and they went
from lab curiosity to working system in
four years so I mean things can move
really fast when you have smart people
who have nothing else to do but do this
and you read their mail and he made some
of the original msre was a five-year
project and that's I love that because
that shows they got the go in 1960 and
they turned it on in 1965 I'd say they
knew way less about how to do this than
we know now
in fact they learn so many things from
running the msre that we would be able
to just skip right to having this
enormous database of knowledge sir the
question is is there any other countries
that are looking at yes there are other
countries
looking at probably the most active
program that's going on this right now
is in the Czech Republic I had the good
fortune to sit down with one of their
fluoride chemists his name is dr. Jana
who lick I'm sorry who leer sorry i
confused it with you dr. Jana leer and I
sat down with him a few weeks ago he is
it a nuclear research institute there
outside of Prague and they are doing
great work with fluorination and
destroying spent nuclear fuel we went
through he gave a talk and went through
all these points and and it was just
really clear that they were they were
really in the lead there's another group
in France probably about 20 or 30 strong
that is also working on this there's
some interest in Japan there's great
interest in thorium in India but not in
this approach they're taking a solid
core approach and and I really think
they're taking the the wrong approach
because it's going to take him a long
time to realize the benefits of thorium
by going to solid core out whereas if
they went to liquid fuel drough it would
happen a whole lot faster but India says
more about thorium than anybody else I
mean they are absolutely committed to
becoming energy independent on thorium
and I would love to help them go and do
it the way that will take a whole lot
less time and money so sir the question
was what's the best size for a thorium
reactor and let me jump back in and show
you something that's a great question
and it enables me to tell you something
that I didn't get to say in the talk
which is one of the big problems when
you went from the one fluid to the two
fluid let me bring this up that thorium
blanket also acts as a neutron shield
and it's kind of a good place for
neutrons to go to die when you make that
all one fluid you get fission throughout
the volume of the reactor and you get a
lot of Neutron leakage so what that
meant when they went from one flu to two
fluid was they could only make them big
if they made it much smaller than about
one gigawatt electric they couldn't
continue to burn thorium they couldn't
get a conversion ratio of one that's a
one fluid reactor whereas if you go with
the two-fluid reactor because of the
basically almost they think of like an
optical density of that blanket but in
neutronic terms if you go
the two-fluid reactor you can scale way
down and you can scale way up so the
two-fluid reactor gives you remarkable
versatility in size I would say probably
the practical lower limit on a two fluid
is probably down at a megawatt I mean
you can build reactors to have less
thermal output that but they just don't
get any smaller you know you want to
what's the size at which the the
physical dimensions start stop scaling
down I would say probably down somewhere
between 1 and 5 megawatts and then how
far up do you want to go pretty much as
far as you want
I mean you we could conceive building 10
gigawatt lifters but we have some power
plant operators here in the audience
that know that's not such a good idea
you want it you want to actually it's
ironic we talked a lot about
decentralized power this really lends
itself to that approach very well
because you can imagine building 400
megawatt units or 100 megawatt units and
dispersing them much more throughout our
grid than the way we do today with big
systems and that promotes grid stability
these are very stable operators they
they strongly follow the load and they
don't care if the sun shining or the
winds not blowing or anything else so it
would be really good for our National
Grid to have a whole bunch of these yes
sir okay it's gonna be a long one so
there are there two elements to your
talk the building a lifter and burning
up existing spent fuel in reality those
two things are quite separate they
merely they both depend upon the
technology of fluorinated separation is
that correct
they both you're right they both do
depend on upon the technology but I
would say they would go hand-in-hand in
the sense that if you were just going to
use fluoride chemistry to try to
separate out these products from the
light water fuel and not destroy them
you probably wouldn't go the fluoride
chemistry route you'd probably stick
with aqueous reprocessing but if you're
then using those wastes to feed in to a
new generation of lifters that aren't
going to produce the transionic wastes
and are going to burn up what it is
you've already made then those two
start to go really hand-in-hand with one
another so I mean if we were starting
from a clean sheet of paper if we were a
country had
nuclear power and we wanted to start our
nuclear economy as intelligently as
possible we'd probably want to just go
straight into lifter but right now we
have this heritage of our light water
reactors and the spent nuclear fuel so
we need to think about how are we going
to address this problem
I sometimes debate with anti-nuclear
people on the internet and and then some
of my friends do too and one of things
that really bothers me say how we need
to shut down our nuclear reactors
because of the waste problem I go well
it's still going to be there if you shut
down all the nuclear reactors it's not
going to magically disappear you know
you got to figure out what to do with it
and this is a way to transition into a
future that produces the power we need
but doesn't keep having this problem yes
the question was you take the
transuranics in the waist where does
that go in here
that could potentially replace the u-233
as the initial fizzle load you got to
start this thing with something you
can't just start it with pure thorium
it's got to have some fizzle material to
start it the idea I really like is to
have a few lifters that are kind of
dedicated to this work on some really
secure site and you would just feed them
this junk from the light water reactors
and then you would pull all of their
u-233 that they're making out and not
feed it back into that reactor but to go
start other lifters with it so you could
start most your lifters clean on u-233
and you could have a few of them just
kind of dedicated to chewing through
this transionic waste did ask your
question okay let's get well we can talk
more after I know how much time we have
do we need to keep going okay great go
ahead sir they just haven't used the
device so funny the question was does
this have any use in space that was the
very first thing I looked at with this
because I you know I worked for NASA and
and I got interested in this from a
friend who worked at Oakridge and he
said you know let's make a great space
reactor and we spent a few years looking
at it it has some advantages for space
in fact I would really like to go try it
out we probably wouldn't build lifter
though for space we would probably just
have a fluoride reactor that was being
fed fissile fuel continuously who
wouldn't probably go to the trouble of
trying to breed into thorium or so forth
just because you're really driven in a
space reactor to minimize mass at all
possible instances I wanted to look at
lifter but when I started running the
numbers I was like now this isn't the
right answer for space I'll just feed it
fissile material and let it go out to
Jupiter rather than now if we wanted to
build a base on the moon or if we wanted
to terraform Mars on the other if you
want a long-term fuel supply yes go with
lifter in fact I think this would make a
great power plant for terraforming Mars
you know I'm gonna show my spacegate
outside there yes sir
the question was is in my historical
recap I kind of trailed off with with
the one fluid reactor and its problems I
didn't make the over connection but when
Weinberg got fired from Oak Ridge their
political protector was gone and it was
not long thereafter before the Atomic
Energy Commission commissioned a report
called wash 1222 as I like to call it
white wash 1222 that was a review of the
technology it was very negative it
focused almost exclusively on kind of
little minor nits in the engineering
development technology completely
ignored the safety completely ignored
the waste completely ignored the
proliferation and just said hey you got
these little issues the irony was is by
the time the report was issued two of
the three issues they focused on it had
already been solved by the Oakridge
researchers and but from a political
standpoint they were swimming upstream
they were they were going the wrong
direction what happened was the program
was canceled in 1974 was briefly
reinstate 1976 and then cancelled again
a bunch of Oakridge guys did try to kind
of keep the torch burning probably into
the 80s but I've got their number of
times I've met with some of the
old-timers there's really almost nobody
there now who was involved in this there
they're just about all gone there is one
individual but the vast majority the
vast majority them are dead
the rest are retired or in or in a hole
folks homes and and I asked one of my
sick people I even go to the old folks
home and talk to him and the guy says
don't you don't want to do that there if
you would just embarrass them I saw okay
that's that's a good point
is Oakridge still the place to do this I
don't think there is necessarily a
central Nexus anymore for this that's
why I think any country could go and
make this any any reasonably sized
country could really go and make this
happen
firstly I'd love to see United States do
it you know I mean I think this would be
a fantastic project for our nation who
developed this technology but there's no
reason why any reasonable sized country
couldn't go and make this happen quite
successfully within their national
resources yes
the questions what's the biggest
obstacle is a funding as a political
right now since there's zero funding I
would say it's funding but I actually
think there's there's a whole lot better
chance of making that problem go away
one of the basic problems is is this
stuff is completely different than what
they do in the nuclear world today a few
weeks ago I was at the American nuclear
Society conference in Atlanta and I mean
this is like the Nexus of all of your
best and brightest engineers in the
field nobody knows about this stuff and
I don't mean that in a disparaging way
these are very very smart people they
just I've almost finished my master's
degree in nuclear engineering in that
time I had one course that talked about
breeding and during that course about
ten minutes of it talked about thorium
and during that ten minutes none of it
mentioned fluoride reactors so it's
entirely possible to go to nuclear
engineering school and get a PhD and
have never been exposed to any of this
stuff that I told you about and then
when you do go get in the field and you
learn how to run real reactors and solid
core and you learn how to control
control rods and run the feed water and
all this other kind of stuff I mean this
technology is completely different it's
like the difference between a typewriter
and word processor you'll get the same
thing in the end but what's under the
hood is just utterly and completely
different so I think the real nuclear
industry looks at this and they go you
know what are we going to do with it
we'd be starting from scratch so it's
great for an entrepreneur but it's rough
for the legacy folks who would want to
get into this
the question was the the real nucleons
she looks at this and says nuclear power
is safe why change and you know the
assertion here is not so much over
safety I mean the the safety record of
the of the nuclear industry is really
really impressive it's you would be
hard-pressed to find an industry that
has had less deaths per my go at our the
nuclear industry and I'd stand it up
against hydro wind solar or any other
which sounds surprising until you find
out you know people really get killed
building renewable energy systems
putting up windmills and putting solar
panels on the roof and things like that
you can get killed doing that kind of
thing
as a friend of mine told me at a nuclear
site if you drop your doughnut on the
floor you'll come back five minutes
later there'll be a circle painted
around it there'll be ten inspectors
around with clipboards and they'll be a
review a safety review commission to try
to figure out why it was you dropped
your doughnut you know so I mean these
guys really run safe and I think the
incentive here is really to get past the
the waste concern and to get to those
higher fuel efficiencies and the safety
is great you know I don't want to come
here and talk about unsafe reactor but
but I think that's the real incentive
chrisp nuclear energy industry today
makes all their money making fuel
elements it's very expensive it's very
exacting little zirconium cans with
precisely measured oxides inside this
would make all the fuel kind of at the
plant and it would that revenue stream
would go away and that's a it's a huge
revenue stream and none of the incumbent
players are really interested in
designing a reactor that that cuts off
their big revenue stream in the future
that's an excellent point he makes
because a lot of times back in the 60s
reactor vendors would sell reactors at a
slight loss in order to lock in a long
term fuel fabrication contract it's
almost like the razor blades approach
you sell the razor you sell the unit
cheap and then you sell the blades
expensive and so the whole cost
structure around today's nuclear is
really not amenable to this approach
that has cheap simple easy to process
fuel yes sir
the question was is the things I've said
are true for countries already have
existing nuclear industries what about
emerging countries who are doing
everything on their own why can't they
start here and the most obvious example
to me this is India India is a really
interesting situation because they were
cut off from purchasing nuclear
equipment when they tested their bombs
in the 1970s but there's a school of
thought that I pretty much subscribed to
that says that that was that was
probably not a good idea that India
really did not deserve to be treated
that way
India's done remarkable things in
nuclear energy and could they start and
go this direction absolutely in fact I
would love to bend the ear of Indian
powers-that-be and say hey this is a way
for you to get to your goals with
thorium a whole lot more quickly than
the approach you're taking but in India
there is a lot of inertia to continue on
the path they're going it's a different
kind of inertia than we have here but it
is nevertheless a strong inertia but I
think India is the most logical country
in the world to go after this ma'am
the question was are we or anybody else
talking to Obama administration several
of my friends and I on our own time did
reach out to both the Obama and McCain
campaigns previous to the election no we
don't treat this as a partisan thing the
energy is for everybody and we were not
able to meet with anyone from the Obama
campaign but we did have an opportunity
to talk with Senator McCain's chief
energy adviser Jim Woolsey he was a
former director of the CIA he really
embraced this he thought it was a great
approach in fact his quote was call me
on November 5th and we'll do something
about this well you know McCain did not
get elected Obama did I do think though
that the goals of the Obama
administration are absolutely congruent
with this approach and I think they
would find it very interesting oh sorry
but the question is deceived to know
about this not to my knowledge there was
a quote that came out there was a
tribute to him when he was asked by a by
a congressional representative about
this technology I have reason to think
that that there were some errors in the
quote saying about how the the reactor
was was corrosive and and there were
uncertainties and so forth I know
probably better to get into afterwards
but as far as I know the Secretary has
not been briefed on this although I
would love to have the opportunity sir
what are the implications for nuclear
proliferation well we go back to some of
the fundamentals which are that the
uranium-232 signature makes this stuff
very very difficult to work with now the
proliferation game is one you can play
so many what-ifs with is it's it's it's
really hard to to get it to everybody's
satisfaction it's almost like you can
get one Sigma 2 Sigma 3 Sigma but you're
never going to get everybody but one
piece that I think is very compelling
for this is because we've got this fuel
in a fluid form we can do what I call
just-in-time denaturing we can dump
uranium 238 into the core and into the
blanket and we can trash the quality of
any uranium that's in there and we can
do that in a very very short period of
time you can't do that with solid fuel
elements can't take a solid fuel element
all sudden change its ISO topics like
that but you can with liquid and the
implication hopes are the implications
for that though is if you had a secure
facility and you were under some type of
three
add or attack I mean you can literally
push a button and you would make sure
that nothing in there would ever be
remotely conceivably useful for a weapon
the downside of that is you then destroy
the ability to plan to ever make power
again you know so you just means you
destroyed that fuel so what you'd have
to do is you didn't have to take all
that fuel out you drain it all you have
to restore with new fuel but it would be
a serious economic hit to push that
button you know but there are scenarios
where that can be conceived I hate to
give the proliferation game because
there are so many what-ifs about it and
and one of the things it really boils
into if you look at how countries really
develop nuclear weapons they do the same
way we did in the 1940s they build a
pile of graphite naturally rhenium and
the main plutonium and they take it out
that's how people develop nuclear
weapons they don't use power reactors
last question on a more positive note
the question was what other applications
can we use lifter for and it's
distributed process heat one of my
favorites is the ability to use the
waste heat for desalinization because we
couple this reactor to a high
temperature gas turbine we can then turn
around and use waste heat which normally
is waste we have to throw it away to
desalinate seawater I think that would
probably be a very very nice thing to
have here in California as you tackle
water issues and concerns and pretty
much any coastal place in the world I
think would be very interested in
getting desalinated seawater we can take
the electricity from lifter and we can
use that to create synthetic fuels one
of them would be ammonia which we could
synthesize from atmospheric nitrogen and
from hydrogen that we'd split from water
another one that I'm very interested in
is called dimethyl ether that can be
synthesized from methanol and you can
synthesize the methanol from atmospheric
carbon dioxide and also from hydrogen
that you split from water so you can
imagine lifters running kind of flat out
all day long to make power for everybody
and then at night when everybody turns
off their lights and go to sleep they
switch over to let's make let's make
fuel for people or charge your electric
cars so we know that to tackle our
global warming concerns we're going to
have to go after number one coal and
number two transportation
and I really think that between this and
and electric cars and and some of these
fuels like dimethyl ether or ammonia we
could make a big difference also one of
ones that excites me is the thought
ammonia is the basis of fertilizer and
fertilizer is the basis of modern
agriculture
right now our fertilizers are made
predominantly from hydrogen from natural
gas without fertilizer five out of six
people on this planet would be dead
because we would not be able to sustain
the agriculture that keeps our
population alive we need to be able to
make ammonia for fertilizer and do it in
a non carbon emitting way and that's a
very exciting possibility all right
thank you so much I believe we're
already turned off
