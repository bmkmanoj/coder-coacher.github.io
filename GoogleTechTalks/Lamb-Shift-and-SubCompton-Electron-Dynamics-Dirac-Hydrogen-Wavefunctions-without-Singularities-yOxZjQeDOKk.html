those of you who are online watching
which is more than we have in the room
like to introduce Lloyd watts he's a old
friend of mine from when he was a grad
student at Cal Tech and we worked on
Cochlear's together electronic analogs
of human hearing and we did a cool
thesis on wave propagation in the
cochlea that
leveraged a bunch of physics stuff like
wkb approximation of that especially yes
which some had something to do you get
into this physics stuff I think they did
anyway then he went off and worked at
interval research and then took some
technology it was working on there and
started audience and turned into a big
company doing noise reduction for cell
phones stuff like that and retired from
that and now he's amateur physicist I
guess yeah I guess that's one way of
saying it yeah so tell us about that
okay thank you very much
so um thanks very much for setting up a
time I'm trying to go after an old
unsolved problem but it's an old
unsolved one that I think is perhaps
been forgotten or perhaps people are not
aware of it anymore it's so old that
it's it's not top on anybody's list but
nonetheless there is an old unsolved
problem that I think might be a gateway
to some new physics so that's why I went
after it
not just that I wanted to go and Don and
I and cross the T from 87 years ago I
think if we get that right we might find
some new physics that we can get access
to because we have it so this slide here
is I'm gonna walk you through the the
history and the sort of the the problem
statement so I assume that physicists in
the audience are of course familiar with
the Schrodinger equation and the direct
equation but I'm just going to just
recapitulate those things so the the
Schrodinger equation is the first access
point in quantum physics where you get
the energy levels of quantum transitions
that are often used to explain for
example that the hydrogen spectrum the
observed hydrogen spectrum so this first
diagram here is showing the energy
spectral levels of the hydrogen excited
States the grounds
here n equals 2 and N equals 3 States
and of course there's a different number
of those states there's a usual one over
N square law that describes that spacing
of energies and in the early nineteen
hundred's that was adequate to explain
what was observed so Schrodinger
hydrogen atom explains the basic energy
levels but it doesn't explain spin or
fine structure and it has wave functions
with cusps at the origin so now why when
I say that that may seem an unfamiliar
statement I haven't seen anybody ever in
the literature comment on that or
complain about it as a problem but it's
related to the problem that people have
commented on in the Dirac equation so
let me say what I mean by cusps at the
origin for example the ground state has
the simple is of the simple form e to
the minus R over a naught where a naught
is the Bohr radius so it's a simple
decaying exponential going up from 0 R
is on the semi infinite scale going from
0 to infinity but if you took a slice
through the atom and you looked at it
sort of coming in from the left and
going out to the right what you'd see is
a decaying exponential in both
directions so at R equals 0 you got a
decaying exponential going out on this
side and coming out on the other side
and there's a peak in the middle where
they both come together and that's what
I'm talking about the cusp there's a
slope discontinuity at the origin and it
goes out in all three dimensions but
there's a slope discontinuity in this
simple form of the Schrodinger solution
now no one ever comments or complains
about that but it's an existing problem
now when you go to the Dirac equation
people advanced to the the news for the
Dirac equation because in fact the
simple spectrum is predicted by the
Schrodinger equation doesn't explain
something that was in fact observable
spectroscopically in the 1920s which was
the fine split if you actually looked at
any of the upper you know the spectral
lines you could see actually that there
weren't just simple spectral lines but
there were little pairs of lines there's
a little splitting of those lines the
end to zoom in to one part in a hundred
thousand to see those little finds but
but they were there
miserable even with the optics of the
1920s the direct equation beautifully
explained that and to explain spin from
first principles whereas Pauli had been
just sort of attaching it ad hoc on to
the Schrodinger equation and direct
equation explained antimatter all in one
you know one fell swoop explained all of
those things but now instead of just
having a cusp at the origin it now has a
singularity at the origin that was
commented on by Charles G Darwin not the
famous botanist evolutionary you know
the fact you know evolution scientist
his grandson was it became a quantum
physicists in the early 1920s and he did
one of the first wave function solutions
of the direct equator directed the
theoretical work and then Darwin was one
of the few people right on there who who
did the the form of the solution
including the wave function and he
observed in the final solution I'll show
in a minute with the expression that
that there is a singular term there's a
R to the minus something in there and he
commented on it in the paper he said
clearly this is singular he basically he
was a wonderfully frank scientist said
this guy I don't really know what to
make of this and what he said was this
would probably go away if we could do
the two body problem properly because
we're assuming and infinitely heavy
nucleus and a point charge and all
that's leading to nothing moving at the
middle so but if you allow things to
move you could probably solve it so he
basically said probably don't worry
about it and look against all these
energy levels right it's a tort or
divorce so that was the beginning of
leaving this problem unsolved it looks
kind of small now if you look in the
literature from this point forward no
one I haven't really seen anybody
mention the singularity of the Dirac
equation wavefunction until you see if
there's a textbook it's it's extend in
Jubair a 1980s vintage textbook which
describes the how to solve the Dirac
equation and what the wave functions
look like and
it's on the singularity of the origin
and what he says was it because this
exponent the one over R is a very small
number one over R to the point 0:05 so
it's not 1 over R a familiar singularity
it's this strangely almost unity
function except right at the origin so
that's a that's an actual plot of the
function and that small exponent means
that it's very tightly localized so
Issyk sin and jouvert basically say it's
singular but only in a very small region
which is you know kind of like saying
it's it's it's yes it's singular but
it's a small singularity so don't worry
about it right that's the last time I
see in the literature that it's
mentioned there's an awareness in the
literature there's a problem and it's
part of the pedagogical literature but
then not not discussed any further ok so
this is the the picture up to Dirac that
takes you to 1928 now at that point it
basically explains the data that we had
in 1928 by the 1940s microwave
technology had allowed Willis lamb and
his student rather furred to do finer
measurements of these energy levels and
what they saw was than a slight missed
prediction here the Dirac prediction
says that the 2s 1/2 and the 2p 1/2
energy levels should be identical
because the expression for the energy
depends only on N and J and both of them
have 2 and 1/2 as the quantum numbers
there so those are basically
energetically identical in the Dirac
theory well so he did a beautiful
experiment that measured are they really
the same by forcing a transition to the
two of them and measuring the difference
and he measured the small difference of
about ass outta gigahertz it when it
when the measurement is done expressed
in terms of Hertz this number down here
is it's about a million gigahertz that
two million gigahertz is the actual
transition energy levels so it's about a
1 factor of 100,000 difference that's
right so about one in a million
difference is this small thing
the lamb shift okay so this if extra
information on the slide then shows the
small difference shown there the shift
of the 2s 1/2 state and there's a
corresponding shift in the ground state
that is not explained by the Dirac
equation and it required a whole new
theory to explain that small energy
shift so the lamb shift was an important
experimental result and it caused
Fineman and Schwinger and the famous
physicists of the 1940s and 50s to build
a whole new branch basically a new
branch of physics quantum
electrodynamics to explain that one part
in a million experimental error so that
was a big deal in explaining it and now
the expression for the leading term of
the lamb shift is shown down here so you
see that we have these three expressions
for the energy the Schrodinger energy
the Dirac energy up here and then the
tiny correction associated with quantum
electrodynamics that gives the full
picture so now by the by the time that
was done it was heralded as a massive
achievement it was a massive achievement
and now pretty much explains what we
need to know about quantum transitions
victory was essentially declared
although there was rumbling by Dirac
himself about various problems with
infinities and renormalization in this
in this formalization but one thing that
they never did go back and look at was
you still have the singular Dirac wave
function in quantum electrodynamics
never says anything about how the wave
function is affected by quantum
electrodynamics is simply it's a way to
compute the energies so by focusing only
on the energy they've left a problem
unsolved since 1928 but what about the
singular Dirac wave function I can't
it's not a physical result it can't be
that way
something must came that singularity of
the origin but no one ever says what it
is so that's the purpose of the work is
to explain that explain what happens to
the direct singularity that has as far
as I know has never been explained in
the literature so question is can we
find the quantum electrodynamics
compatible wave function that is
compatible
with the lamb shift so now before I take
you through the details of how we find a
solution they're just what's the
importance of this why do we care it's
an old problem people apparently not
thought it was important enough to go
back and fix it why should we seek this
QED compatible wavefunction the first
part of it is pedagogical as I was
studying this it was irritating to have
this problem pointed out from nearly a
century ago and then the field advanced
into apparently a solution that left
this problem unsolved behind it so
explaining into new students it's just
simply unsatisfactory to to not have
that thing properly explained but that's
not the reason that I went after it but
the reason I went after it is because I
believe that it may be revealing
something about electron dynamics that
we can't otherwise know if we don't know
what the wave function is and in
particular we can't understand at least
I believe it may be possible that we
can't understand a quantum transition
the process by which a photon is created
from a change in energy levels of an
atom without a deeper understanding of
what is happening with the wave function
no so that's that's the motivation that
actually drove me into studying it is
that I really wanted to understand it
quantum transition at a level of depth
greater than just saying it's it's a
axiomatic event with an annihilation and
a creation operator Dirac collapsed that
down into a single event but there's no
physics that goes below that I think
that there may be some kind of wave
oriented physics that goes below that
and that's what drove me into trying to
study so what we're looking for is the
corresponding wave function that goes
with quantum electrodynamics that would
look different from the show during or
Interac wave functions without the
either the cusp or the singularity of
the origin so I'm going to take you
through just the sort of the terminology
of what's in the Schrodinger interact
equation so that when we come to the the
new work the numerical methods you'll
have a context for it so here is the
Schrodinger equation that includes
the usual Schrodinger terms but also the
the potential that connects the electron
in the nucleus and that's traditionally
the Coulomb potential that it's a one
over our potential of one over R squared
force and it's shown there via bars as a
one over our form when in order to solve
the Schrodinger equation they do
separation of variables they break it up
into a radial and angular components
this is the radial equation that results
you can find the energy the 1 over N
squared form that we saw earlier and
this is the elucidation of the closed
form solutions well known you this is
undergraduate level cell but here this
is here's where we have the e to the
minus R over a naught term that I
mentioned before
that's the thing that gives us the cusp
at the origin and where does that come
from it comes from the singular Coulomb
potential it's because we have 1 over
our potential which goes to negative
infinity at the origin that we then have
a cusp with a slope discontinuity at the
origin so the Coulomb potential is
basically at the root of the problem we
put a singularity into the problem with
the Coulomb potential we shouldn't
expect we should expect some trouble at
the origin in the solution and we indeed
we find it okay so that's the
Schrodinger hydrogen atom the Dirac
equation the direct formulation has a
parallel development this is the more
complicated form of the Dirac equation
it's now not just using simple scalar
variables but now these 8a quantities
AXA y AZ and beta are non commuting
matrices if you're not familiar with
that don't worry about that but just to
show you that there's there's an
additional complexity of it the Dirac
equation is essentially a Ford 4 coupled
one-dimensional equations and that's
what allows it to predict spin and
antimatter so anyway that's the this is
sort of the form of the Dirac equation
it still uses the Coulomb potential for
the hydrogen atom when you do separation
of variables now it splits into these
two components the upper and lower
component this is effectively the
electron spinner
and and the the negative energy spinner
or the positron spinner basically direct
predicted through simply by solving this
new equation that there had to be a
matter and an antimatter component and
this was predicted prior to the
discovery of the positron so unlike not
just purely explanatory of existing
measurements it predicted a thing that
had not been yet discovered and was
discovered a few years later in 1930 so
it has it predicts spin antimatter these
the upper and lower component further
split out into what's called the the F
and the G forms of the radial equation
says F is the upper and usually called
the large component G is the small
component and then there's a radial term
the spinner when you split that out into
the radial equations now instead of a
single second-order equation like we saw
in the Schrodinger case now we have two
coupled first order equations you see
with the F term is there's an F prime
there's an F and there's a G in the one
equation and the other one has a G Prime
at G and an F so it's two coupled one
first-order equations rather than one
second-order equation and both of these
are in the context of these complicated
spinner elements so this is now the
problem to be solved when they they were
able to solve this to me this is amazing
but they were able to solve this in
closed form in the 1920s they got the
closed form solution for the energy
levels much more complicated expression
but extremely close in value to the
simpler Schrodinger values and predicted
the degeneracy the various forms defined
splitting it was a tour de force it
predicted just a remarkable number of
things
now the I'll show a couple of other
things here that we will need later if
you look not just at the general
expression for the radial equations and
the energy levels but you look at the
ground state equations this is a summary
of everything you would need to do a
numerical simulation of the direct
equation you can solve it in closed form
analytically but you could also solve it
numerically on a computer and you would
basically need the two equations that we
described up here but now they're in the
form where they vary using the potential
in this form one over our terms but in
terms of the Bohr radius a knot and the
fine-structure constant alpha so this
line here is saying the same thing as
that line there the cursor is keeping up
with me it's just the variables are in a
more convenient form so we have the two
first order equations the boundary
conditions that the wave function must
go to it to zero and infinity and the
normalization condition so those four
equations are what have to be solved and
for the ground state that's the energy
of the ground state when you solve that
for the ground state you end up with
this form of the solution if you look
closely at it you'll see the e to the
minus R over a naught term that was
present in the Schrodinger equation so
basically both Schrodinger interact
having the broad characteristic is a
largely decaying exponential form that's
the dominant term they both have that
but then if you look here you see that
there's also this 2r over a naught to
the minus 1 plus root 1 minus a alpha
squared term that's the thing that's of
the form R to the minus something very
small because 1 basically this term ends
up having a value of approximately minus
0.005 that's the thing that gives you
the singularity and the fact that it's
got such a small exponent makes it so
tightly localized so this we still have
not just these cusps but we have the
singularity now the singular Coulomb
potential leads to the singularity in
the solution ok so that's the basics the
last place where there's a wave function
and the place where the problem is
basically left in the field so now
quantum electrodynamics was developed in
1948 fine minute winger and others here
so
I'm quoting a modern you know 2007
vintage textbook by experts in QED the
way that they introduced the subject of
lamb shift is by describing you know
what's the small change to our thinking
now that results in that tiny shift in
the energy that that breaks the
degeneracy of to be a 1/2 and 2 s 1/2 so
I'll quote them according to QED an
electron continuously emits and absorbs
virtual photons and as a result its
charge is spread over a finite volume
instead of being point-like so what does
that mean it's really it's kind of an
incomprehensible explanation but if I
may here's here's how I think about it
it's sitting there kind of like a dust
speck in the middle of the air and
there's Brownian motion instead of being
bombarded by atoms in the air it's it's
interacting with both itself and the
vacuum in quantum electrodynamics no
that's a part that I you know it's very
non-intuitive how it could be interacted
with itself how it could be interacting
with the vacuum but that's the that's
the explanation that is given by quantum
electrodynamics
they have a long formal development of
how they compute how much energy is
being delivered and absorbed and
released when it interacts with itself
through these virtual photons but the
net result is if you have a point charge
point charge electron they're basically
saying it can't just sit there in space
it's jiggling and it's jiggling in a way
that gives it a little distribution
little radius so it's no longer small
compared to the wave function yes very
small so some Compton wavelength right
so the Compton radius is basically the
sort of a baseline size below which it
now it becomes difficult to talk about
what's happening in there it's so small
that the energy level has now become
comparable to the MC squared of the
electron and so effectively they're
saying a whole new physics happens down
at this low small scale and I've had
conversations with people where they say
it doesn't make sense to talk about
what's going on in there it's a whole
different kind of physics nonetheless
this textbook is giving this explanation
saying it's basically jittering the
charge so it's no longer a point charge
that there is a charge distribution that
has a nonzero width to it so they they
give an estimate of what that width is
and they say that the finite radius of
the electron generates a small
correction to the Coulomb potential
well the Coulomb potential was the thing
that was going you know 1 over R that
was going to minus infinity of the
potential that comes from the proton and
it comes from the distance between the
proton and the electron and so if you
now jiggle this side if you've been
saying the electron is jiggling so that
it has a distribution now what is the
distance now from this jiggly thing to
the stationary thing at large distances
the jiggle doesn't matter but when you
get really close to zero now the jiggle
does matter and now the distance now you
have to deal with the fact that there's
a there's a distribution it's two point
charges at a perfect distance to each
other no longer makes sense when you get
close to the origin that's the essence
of quantum electrodynamics had to build
in a charge distribution which is
exactly what Carver was saying can't be
a point charge so it must be a
distribution and effectively that's what
they're saying the finite radius of the
charge distribution of the electron
generates this correction to the Coulomb
potential they then say the respective
correction of the energy levels is given
by a perturbation analysis of this and
therefore the finite size of H the
electron leads to a shift of the
electron energy levels which is what we
observe so they basically gave this
informal development of of the process
there is a more formal development it
was done originally by Hans bethe and
then formalized by Fineman but this is
kind of the way they explain to
undergraduates
here's here's how to think about it so
the question is what is that charge
distribution that they never say what
the charge distribution is is it like a
it could be a uniform distribution
inside a sphere it could be a Gaussian
distribution could be a disk what is it
they never actually say if you could say
what the charge is
mission wise you could actually compute
the shape of the modified Coulomb
potential and therefore you could
compute the modified wave function and
it seems as though there's been no
interest in actually following that
process through they simply say it
effectively jiggles you get an effective
distribution they always talk just about
the mean squared radius of that
distribution now what that suggests to
me is that they're thinking of it in
terms of a Gaussian distribution is sort
of a mean squared it's a natural way to
think about it it's jiggling it's not
it's never going too far so the
implication of R squared suggests
Gaussian distribution inside the Compton
radius and if you do all that it's
consistent it leads to results that are
inconsistent in a perturbation analysis
with the Lamb shift so what I wanted to
do is say well then now how do can we
actually follow that all the way through
compute the modified potential and then
compute the modified wave function and
if we do that it should eliminate the
singularity and the cusp in the in the
Dirac wave function at the origin so
that's the agenda so now I'm actually
going to do that now the what we don't
have is a specific form of the charge
distribution like I said it'd be a
uniform distribution inside that radius
or Gaussian we don't simply know what it
is so what I what I did so if we don't
since we don't know what it is I said
okay I'm gonna try every every
distribution I can think of so that I
can then show is there something you
know do they all behave approximately
the same if they do then we may have
something that's likely to be generally
true I'm not in a position to prove
anything yet I'm simply saying every
distribution I try results in the same
basic behavior it suggests that the
basic behavior should look something
like this so that's the approach I'm
going to take so I'm gonna walk you
through in a little bit of detail the
first choice of distribution but then
I'll show you the summary of all the
others show them how they apply they
plot and you see that they behave the
same so the first one that we'll look at
first charge distribution candidate is
inspired by David Heston s work I'm not
sure if you
if you know about his work he basically
made a name for himself in physics by
studying the phenomenon called sitter of
the Vega no that doesn't ring bell
anyway okay
it's basically Schrodinger did an
analysis of the electron and it said
that there's a there's a high frequency
jitter term in here that's suggestive of
it's moving very fast in a very tight
radius and that was observed in 1928
so now quantum electrodynamics says hey
it's moving by absorbing photons so it's
quite natural to say hey maybe
Schrodinger actually saw the math said
is jittering in this tight radius
quantum electrodynamics requires it to
move fast maybe those are the same thing
so there are two guys Heston s and Varun
and Bracken that tried to do as itter
Bennigan's analysis that would try to
explain connect the jittering with this
with the lanchette so Heston s had
basically an entire career around
reformulating the Dirac equation using
his method called space-time algebra
kind of put it in two new variables that
split it out into the spin terms a
radial distribution term and some other
terms but he basically said what I think
is happening is that the electron is
it's moving in a circle which would
explain spin that's why it is jittering
not just in random that's moving in a
circle and if it's moving in some frame
of reference with constant velocity is
moving on a helix
screw the little corkscrew motion and
based on his calculations he said in
order for it for this to be consistent
with zitterbewegung the radius of that
distribution would have to be lambda Bar
C over 2 where lambda Bar C is the hat
is the reduced Compton radius so Compton
radius is h-bar over MC is kind of the
basic length scale for the electron um
so that's called the reduced Compton
wavelength it's it's about 10 to the
minus 14 meters so it's a particular
size it basically makes it about a
factor of
something like a hundred or so smaller
than the Bohr radius and about a factor
of a hundred larger than the proton
radius so it's kind of in between those
two scale benchmarks so so that's it's a
lovely idea
Heston is saying I'm looking for motion
a small motion and he basically makes
this prediction of the size there's half
reduced Compton wavelength so now I said
well let's imagine suppose you have this
corkscrew motion but now the electron is
doing that as it as it moves around the
nucleus so what would a spinning a fast
spinning corkscrew look like if it was
going in you know revolving around you
but also because of spin 1/2 precessing
as it moves so it's like a processing
gyroscope that as it goes around you it
doesn't just stay like this as it goes
around it also rotates slowly right so
if it's doing that and going fast enough
my my conjecture is it would look to you
like a sphere because it's constantly
it's a spherical shell as it goes around
right so becomes a spherical shell so no
pessimist didn't ever say that I know I
don't want to put words in his mouth he
said helical path when moving in a
straight line but I say now if you I
take the idea further if you have it go
around it now looks like a charged shell
of radius R Z he called the RZ for
zitterbewegung on the the Zitto radius
he called it so that then leads to a
charge distribution that would say the
electron now looks like a little sphere
of charge a spherical shell of charge
and now if you now you can analyze that
that's sort of undergraduate math to
look at what is the potential as you
bring a charged sphere close to another
point charge you can do that math and
that leads to a modified Coulomb
potential which is just the like this is
the oldest cut off potential ever 1 over
R goes to minus infinity if you say I
want to cut it off you just pick a
radius and you say I don't allow it to
go below that point then it becomes flat
that's actually what you get if you have
a charged shell and that was first
analyzed by a guy named one air in 1943
and the form of it instead of Q squared
over R it
comes q squared over max of R and R Z so
basically what's the point over R until
you hit R Z and then now you hold it
there so this is basically the clip
function and I'll draw I'll show you
what the pictures look like but it just
it cuts the thing off so that's the
first one it's an easy one
now I was so excited when I first saw
this cuz that oh oh my gosh
Heston as' may have this explanation the
the sitter radius being the half reduced
Compton radius and he never connected it
to the Lamb shift so I did the
perturbation analysis a hoping and
expecting that it would just explain the
land shift and so like there's this big
blueberry pie a windowsill but no one's
ever found oh it's that easy
you know Miller time it didn't work out
that way
so I did the analysis and it predicted
the lamb shift that was way too large
like a factor of five or something too
large it's sort of in the ballpark but
not quite right so then I said well okay
it either pessimists has overestimated
or my understanding of Heston s has
overestimated so what do I have to do
how would I scale that radius down what
radius would I need in order to explain
the legend so I just just typed in
smaller you know I did guess and check
until I finally got that number point
three eight one two six times pessimist
is original estimate lambda bar C over
two that's the scale factor that makes
it actually agree with the lamb shift
okay so now so we've got something here
now it says lambda bar C is the kind of
one person's theoretical prediction but
now to match the data we need a smaller
distribution than that if it's a
spherical shell so that's the first
candidate I don't know if that's the
correct distribution but it did have
basically a highly-qualified quantum
relativistic a relativistic quantum
physicist spent his entire career doing
that and he was this is a very credible
person who devoted his life to trying to
further that line of reasoning so it's
at least a reasonable candidate I didn't
just pull it out of the air okay so now
his prediction just to kind of summarize
them in his prediction said lambda Bar C
/ - what
found to match lamb shift was lambda bar
C over two times 0.38 so about a factor
of one over two point six smaller than
what he seemed to predict but he never
tried to connect it to LAN chef so I'm
not it's not like he made a mistake it's
just the connection suggests it has to
be smaller so now that thing that we
just discussed is the charge shell
distribution and there's the summary
there's the chera shell distribution the
delta function with radius R Z and the
corresponding max function in the
where's my cursor area that
corresponding magical ocean there so
that's the one we just talked about it
and we see in that line it says our Z is
that fraction of lambda Bar C over 2
okay so that's that line on the table
now you see that we've got three other
lines those are other distributions that
that I could come up with Gaussian is
one of them exponential charge density
is another and there's another one The
Sitter become imaginary ring I didn't
just pull that one out of the air either
that's from brood and Bracken who did
another deep analysis of Schrodinger's
zitterbewegung
equations and said you know if you look
at it in the in this new way what it's
this gets into the deep relativistic
physics is beyond what I was able to
understand or you know could that I
could develop myself but what they said
was the math suggests that the electron
is having a complex motion in two
auxiliary spatial dimensions a circular
motion in these other two spatial
dimensions so now I take that further I
say okay so that means in the real
spatial physical three dimensions we
have the distance is one over R but it's
in these other alternate the imaginary
dimensions it's got another radius so
even when you get right to on top of it
at its center of mass in these other
dimensions you've still got a distance
of RZ you never actually get to be right
on top of that that would explain why
you know how there's no singularity you
never get to have the electron on the
protein in the same place because then
these other dimensions they have a
distance from each other so when you do
that assumption
you get now instead of 1 over R you get
square root of 1 over R squared plus R Z
squared so which is by the so that was
another popular cutoff Coulomb approach
if you had a Coulomb potential and you
couldn't stand the fact that it went to
minus infinity like your computer
programs were seg faulting then you you
you can always put in a r plus delta r
plus epsilon right and that gives you
one type of limitation or you can put
square root of R squared plus epsilon
square those are softer ways of rounding
off that thing at the bottom so
mathematicians have been exploring
exploring that for a long time the Patel
and Mehta were the 1970s mathematicians
who explored this form and they called
it the truncated Coulomb potential
whereas 1ea did the cutoff Coulomb
that's a hard cutoff versus the
truncated so anyway if you do those two
now for the imaginary ring you find
again in order to make it match the lamb
shift you need lambda Bar C over two
times something small point oh wait
similarly if you do a Gaussian charge
density you can make it match lamb shift
you get a new form of the modified
potential also rounded off but it comes
now with the shape of an earth function
the error function I'll show you a plot
these for you in just a minute but all
of them result in a radius that is
lambda Bar C over two times something
smaller than one so they basically are
all saying that it's a sub Compton size
but if I talk about Compton size being
Peston is's prediction of lambda bar C
over to use that as a base line
everything ends up being smaller than
that to explain the legend
here's a plot of the functions so let's
for example the purple one there that
I'm pointing at is the Gaussian
distribution and you see that so there's
the familiar Gaussian distribution and
where are the reference points the the
dot and gray line there is lambda bar C
over 2 and the gray line on the other
side is minus lambda Bar C over 2 and
you see that that purple Gaussian fits
nicely inside lambda bar Co plus or
minus lambda bar C over 2 so it's fair
to call
a sub Compton radial distribution of the
charge
similarly the exponential distribution
looks like this the ring distributions
for the charge shell look like the red
line or and the black one is the sitter
bear begun imaginary rings so the common
element of them all is that they all fit
inside the half reduced Compton radius
so that's why in the title of my talk I
said lens you know the connection
between lamb shift and sub Compton
electrodynamics now as far as I know
this may seem strange but as far as I
know I've never seen anybody say that
lamb shift is the result of sub Compton
electrodynamics the quote that I gave
you from I'd scratch to show you tone
does give you an expression for it but
they never say they never actually
calculated they never say how big it is
they never compare it to any reference
so this is just kind of a pedagogical
point but at least for the first time
somebody is saying here's how big that
distribution would have to be regardless
of your choice as a shape of it it's got
to be so Compton so that's one of the
things that was in the talk so this all
charge distribution candidates must fit
inside the half produced Compton radius
to Maps lamb shift if you now look at
how these correspond to the Coulomb
potential each one of them in their own
unique way cuts off the trajectory down
to minus infinity so the first one the
charge shell which lead to the hard
cutoff is shown there the red line just
follows 1 over R in until it hits the R
the radius and then it's just a hard
cutoff and so you see that the red line
across is the hard cutoff
that's one ears cut off potential the
imaginary ring is the black line which
follows the 1 over R curve a lot further
down but it has that rounded bottom
because it has the square root of R
squared plus R Z squared so that's
another familiar one there's there's a
group up in Canada in I think it's
McMaster University mathematicians out
there that appear to have spent their
career doing the mathematics of these
truncated Coulomb potentials so whole
field so
with using that but with just using it
as a mathematical assumption to
eliminate the singularity no physics
underneath it just lets you need a way
to cut it off let's use it well that's a
justification for it similarly if you
have the Gaussian distribution it leads
to this more shallow form of the cutoff
and the exponential distribution leads
to that one okay so they all eliminate
the singularity they all do it in
slightly different ways but they're all
again contained the deviations from
Coulomb are all well contained inside
lambda bar core2 none of them deviate
outside that boundary okay so now we're
halfway there
we've we've we've assumed the form of
the of the charge distribution assume
several of them and found that the the
modified potentials all behaved in a in
a tamed way now the question is can we
follow that into a modified wave
function so this is the numerical reason
so now we'll do the numerical results
using these modified wave functions so
so you're able to get to the lamb shift
energy levels from these potentials
without a wave function right you were
able to fit the radii from some other
calculation right show us but that's
some standard calculation it is a
standard calculation yes that is this
last step which where it says which
agrees with land shift when that's
actually a page of Mathematica and
almost doesn't put a slide for that to
show all the details but basically
that's first-order perturbation analysis
okay so it's a standard technique and by
the way the way that's derived it it's
derived in a way that pops out the first
order of calculation of the energy which
is what physicists want right but in the
derivation it assumes that there's a
modified wave function you just do not
ever have to calculate it you can get
the energy term out when I would ever
have to compute the wave function and
boy do we love that because we save all
that computation we get the answer we
want with a formula that is very easy to
apply so that's that's part of the
problem because that technique is so
convenient effective that you never have
to compute the wave function
who needs the wavefunction and I'm
saying let's go get it anyway it might
be good for something okay so but that's
that's exactly how all of these were
computed but now now that we know what
the energy is now we can actually use it
to go back and compute what the wave
function is so I've done that you have
to do numerically there's no closed-form
for it so given a charge distribution
and I'll use the Gaussian one as the
example from for me that seems most
physically plausible so I'll pick one
and use it but I think you can see from
the previous slides that wouldn't have
matter which one I chose they would all
lead to similar conclusions and I've
actually tested it on one of the other
ones so I'll assume Gaussian and it's
corresponding modified potential can we
find the modified Dirac equation
function now solving this kind of thing
numerically is a known there's a known
technique for doing it a guy named
hammerling and his co-authors in 2010
developed a two-sided shooting method so
basically if you've done the
differential equations this was down
here is the original differential
equations that I pointed out the two
first-order radial equations you have
the boundary conditions at infinity and
the normalization condition so this is
the basic problem you can solve that by
doing a forward integration from the
inside out and from outside in and then
what you do is first time you do that
you end up with a solution that goes
this way and a social specimen they
don't match the MIL so you you say okay
they do hit here but this ones are wrong
so now you you adjust the boundary to
the slum conditions at the end until
finally they now agree in the middle
that's the two-sided shooting method for
adjusting the boundary the free boundary
conditions until they agree from both
sides Hammerman and al did that for the
Schrodinger problem but they didn't do
it for Dirac so I extended it it wasn't
too hard to extend it it to extend it
into the direct form but as far as I
know I haven't seen anybody in the
literature actually do that so it could
be that this is technically a new
contribution extending this two-sided
shooting method into the Dirac
formulation nonetheless so I did it this
is now the modified form the modify MA
vacation basically means you have to
have a modified Coulomb potential and
you have to have a modified energy term
this is the energy term that's the
potential term to e minus V and when you
put in the modifications there's a
little incremental the one part in a
million energy expectation that we have
for the change and over here is the
modified Coulomb potential which in the
case of the Gaussian led to an earth
function so earth basically is one
everywhere except for a little round off
at the origin so basically it's
unchanged from normal Coulomb except
near the origin it rounds it rounds down
so this is the thing that had to be
solved numerically so now so I solve it
and now I'm going to show you consent a
conceptual picture of what it looks like
and then I'll back that up with the
detailed mathematical pictures the
reason I'm going to do it that way is
because you can't show just one picture
it's too complicated and the scales it's
a it's a stiff problem with too many
scale dimensions but too many varieties
and scales so I'll show you the concept
and what the solution looks like and
then I'll back it up with the math
really gave that so we've been talking
about the foot of the e to the minus R
form of the ground state solution that's
shown in red here there's there's re e
to the minus R going off in positive
direction and negative direction and
that has the cusp or the singularity at
the origin the new solution has the form
of a rounded tongue instead of a pointy
top or a singular top it rounds it off
at the top that's what you'd expect it
has to have a slope continuity at the at
the top and the final solution ends up
being lower than the the original charge
density so what that means is charge is
lost near the peak because it's no
longer coming up to its full singular
potential to singular charge density so
if we ran it off and we lose a little at
the top what that means is if it was a
hill of sand you take some sand off the
top but sand is preserved it better get
shoved down the shoulders of the
distribution so you lose charge near the
peak and you displace it down the sides
and what the numerical solution says you
lose
one part in a million at the top and it
gets shifted down the sides on this
wafer thin layer you know it's so thin
that I have to exaggerate it to plot it
for you but this is the look of it now
so we lose top charge there distribute
it down the sides if you look at the
difference function you see something
the difference wave function will looks
like this here we're showing that we've
lost charge there and we've distributed
down the sides so if you keep that in
mind now here's what the mathematical
results gave if you look at this plot
here this is the one that corresponds to
the peak very peak version of the top
you see that the numerical solution is
rounded at the top doesn't have the
singular wave function so it's showing
what I showed before except that if I
was to plot it to scale it would all be
happening in the top pixel up there it's
super tiny it's it's happening at point
nine nine eight that's that would be of
where that's a scale of zero to one so
to be in the top pixel super tiny effect
and now if you go look at the
distribution down the sides this plot
here the green curve here is corresponds
to this part of the difference wave
function down here and you see that it's
showing that yes some charge is lost
there and we know the amount and then
this curve here is the part that's
distributed down the sides that little
area there corresponds to that shape
there but what it's saying is you have
to go a factor of a thousand all the way
a thousand out to get it and it's really
really tiny okay so it's consistent with
the picture I did
it's just now on this scale finally this
picture what I've been showing you here
is the charge density it's the Rho but
in fact to do the computation you have
to use the wave function the real the
the upper and lower components F and G
you have to do the two sided shooting
method and the two-point matching in
those turns so this is actually just
showing how the calculation was done I
really did have two matching points in
the shooting direction from both in and
out so that was actually done that way
finally so the charge distribution
basically has a rounded top what this
last plot is showing is
the upper component F also has a rounded
top but the lower component does not the
lower component actually gets driven to
zero at the origin now that's that's
interesting and important what you might
have expected was everything has a
rounded top including the lower
component what this is saying is the
lower component goes to zero the lower
component is the negative energy part
the positron component so it says
normally the prediction of the direct
equation is that there's a there's a
large electron component and there's a
small positron component but when you do
the lamb shift calculation and the
corresponding wave function that
positron component vanishes at the
origin that I think is important that's
being repelled by the proton right so
you could certainly justify it because
it's opposite charge so that would make
sense it's being repelled in a way that
wasn't modeled previously however so yes
it feels right then it must do that yeah
but this is from the first time this is
saying that that's happening now I think
that's also a new result I haven't
because no one's ever computed the wave
function no one has said that the upper
and lower component behave differently
in the limit as you get close to the
origin and that may be suggestive of
some deeper physics so finally to
summarize then we open the talk with is
there some wave function and you know
the mystery is what does the function
look like now here's the summary of the
picture it has a rounded top in the
density and the large component has a
similar around the top and the small
component is driven to zero at the
origin so that's a summary of the
qualitative behavior final discussion on
that then the exponential charge
distribution the other distributions
that I that I tried I have to tried it
for the exponential distribution it
behaved the exact same way rounded top
small component driven to zero so the
conclusion at least at that level seems
to be general I believe we would get the
same thing for the other distributions
but I haven't proven it one other last
note about this dickie remember I spoke
to you about a year ago I was working
heavily on not on the numerical methods
but on analytic methods because I was
trying to you know can I do what Dirac
and sure
get a closed-form analytical solution
for these curves wouldn't that be
wonderful if I could and dick said
basically can't just do this numerically
if I could be done like in an hour or so
and that was really good advice it
speeded me up tremendously by focusing
on that so I still have that result yes
you can and they turn out to be
confluent hypergeometric functions is
the way to compactly describe those so
there's another whole paper there some
nice math but now I could write that
paper because I have for the numerical
results that really allowed me to find
out what's going on now I'm slightly
over time so I just wrap up yeah we have
the room but people may not believe yeah
you don't you can keep talking yeah so
why don't I sit formally the talk ends
now and if there's any questions from
people that are remote I could let you
take them there's a couple more things
that are worth saying but we could
formally wrap up that questions I'd like
to hear about the patients okay great
we'll follow further um any other
questions from anybody before I continue
okay so so we have the thinking that we
have now is the electron is behaving not
like them not like the point it's
behaving like a moving point the
scattering experiments still saying that
behaves like a point you slam anything
at it and you look for the radius at
which it just barely misses it's as
small as you can go it still looks like
a point but it's behaving like a moving
point and the motion has this small
distribution that's when I talk about
charge distribution I'm not saying that
it's not behaving like a point
I'm saying it's behaving like a moving
point with a sub Compton motion that's
what appears to say Paul the the way
that we're then we're analyzing this is
all based on the Lamb shift
well the lamb shift is a bound State
it's coming from bound state basically
it's coming from looking at the energy
level transitions from N equals 2 state
to N equals 1 state right so technically
that's not telling us something about a
free electron it's telling us about a
behavior that we can
and we can reason about when it's in the
context of moving around near near the
atom we have near that near the nucleus
of the atom so what this next couple of
slides is to try and make the link
between what we what it looks like we
can say with some confidence about when
the electron is near the nucleus that's
what we can talk what we've talked about
so far but could we extrapolate that to
the to the free electron case in
particular my hypothesis if it's
behaving like a jitter two-point charge
when we can catch it nearly the nucleus
and measure its energy that effectively
that way does it also behave that way as
a free electron to the foreshadow I
believe it does in fact the way that QED
calculates the lamb shift gives us a
hint that there's effectively a waited
to make a continuity between its
behavior in the tightly bound state and
the free state and the linkage between
those is the better logarithm beta is
the blast Hans bethe was the physicist
in the 1940s who took the first major
step towards quantum electrodynamics
Fineman followed it up by mentoring ER
tomonaga followed up but Hans bethe from
Cornell was the guy who had the first
insight about being able to calculate
what the Lamb shift would be so this is
the formula I showed on the first slide
with the leading term of the Lamb shift
and all of these things are physical
constants you know math speed of light a
fine structure constant but what about
this one K not what so what is K not
that's the better logarithm and betta in
his 1947 paper sort of gave this very
hand wavy argument about how you would
compute this and then hold that number
out of his ear apparently I mean from
the from the papers who said you can
compute this and with thanks to miss
Sten I think it was you know our
assistant in the computer Department in
Cornell thanks to her we pulled this
number out it's like sixteen point seven
and just leaves it at that so you know
utterly unsatisfactory how you couldn't
read you couldn't duplicate that work
based on
what he said and it wasn't until 1951
that he wrote another paper better Brown
and Sten they explained actually how to
do the calculation and they correct it
wasn't 16.7 it was seventeen point eight
or something like that so they got a
close estimate that wasn't quite right
and they never did explain how he did it
until three years later they did and
then data and saw Peter wrote a book
that also described it in more detail so
it's a it's a detailed calculation
that's very hard to do and it's
particularly hard to do with high
precision so it was remarkable that they
could do it in the 1940s nowadays you
know we have amazing precision
measurements guys like Jenn Shura and
more at NIST the National Institute of
Standards they are now the keepers of
the physical constants and they among
other things like giving us corrections
to the mass of the electron you know the
the eight digit of the mass of the
electron what the fine cotton structure
custom is they also tabulate the bethe
logarithm and this is the the table from
their chart where they computed this
thing and evidently it's a science in
itself to compute this bethe logarithm
so now you need to know that in order to
be able to compute the lamb shift but
take a look at what's in the table man I
didn't just put it up here to be sort of
intimidating or you know bold people
over with this table of numbers take
take a look at it two point nine two
point eight coming down to two point
seven it's all two point two point
something two point seven two winning
I'm gonna plot it for you here here's a
plot of two point eight one one seven
seven by the way it's the natural log of
sixteen point seven yeah right yes
exactly so they were one seven three
eight three early if that's the
corrected number if they got in 1951
they I think they used they said it was
seventeen point seven or something in
the in the first paper so they were
wrong then they they they got a poor
estimate then and three years later if
they had a better estimate which is now
consistent with modern tabulations of it
okay so but now the
the K not term there that they quote in
the table is now not plotting it here
and you see that it goes from 2.70 is
its final resting value and equals
infinity what does any clueless pity
it's kind of like a free electron you're
now such a high energy state away from
the nucleus that you're you've nearly
vaporized or ionized you're now nearly a
free life lesson N equals infinity
approximately corresponds to the free
electron State and as the electron
becomes more and more tightly bound into
the N equals two and N equals one states
that we've been talking about this value
goes up now what what I believe that
saying is that that jittered know that
jittery motion of the electron that's
causing the Lamb shift when we get it
close to the to the nucleus it's the
size of that jitter is basically staying
the same even we go on here it's it's a
constant amount of jitter it changes
only by a few percent when you bring it
in that's kind of what we're looking for
is a kind of a physically constant
behavior it does change when but only by
a few percent when you get it close to
the to the nucleus let me just check
here okay
charging now okay so now they tabulate
they put in the table that that value is
basically 2.7 ish with with it goes up
by about 0.2 or so so on that scale it
appears to change by about 10 percent
but that's the number that they put in
the table the number that's actually
used in the equation is not lon of K
naught over the rip current constant its
lon of MC squared over K naught so when
you take that into account scale by the
factor of the rittenberg constant times
it over MC squared the actual value that
you're using in this calculation is this
term lon of MC squared over K naught and
now I'm plotting that here that now
takes a value of 7.8 and it has the same
additive variation about
point two to eight or so two to six so
that means the quantity that we care
about is changing by only three percent
three point three percent I think what
that says is that the distribution of
charge that's that we can measure and
reason about it in the lamb shift case
holds true to within three percent will
you take it all the way out to invent
maybe when it's in close it's just
started titled distortion right exactly
some sort of distortion because it's now
being in the influence of this strong
force is you know strong force but you
notice this nearby for so the tidal
influence is a nice metaphor for that
right that's exactly what I'm saying
so it's the title effect is is sort of a
three percent effect but because we have
the benefit of the lamb shift of the
bethe logarithm calculation I think this
builds a bridge from the bound states to
the unbound and therefore free states
that would allow us to to extrapolate
then the sub Compton charge distribution
that applied to the lamb shift should
also apply to a free electron so that's
a hypothesis of my I can't prove it it's
I've given you my reasoning and I sort
of have a question mark you know I'd
like to one of the things I want to do
with if I'm able to promote this work a
little bit I'd like to fly out to
Washington and talk to Jen Shara and
more and asked that they're the ones
who've done that calculation would they
agree with this reasoning that this is
telling us something about our free
electrons I have the feeling they would
have a strong opinion about it and it
might be negative but they would say I'm
pretty sure either yes that's a good
idea or no and here's why they might be
among the few people that really have a
strong opinion about it last one or last
comments here we had sir
candidate distributions and my point is
showing all the candidates is to to
emphasize I don't know what the actual
distribution is but they all behave
similarly and they all seem to have a
the same constraints but what would make
this really finished work would be if
there was some way to actually determine
what the real distribution is maybe it
maybe it really is Gaussian maybe it
looks a little bit like Gaussian with a
little bit of ring behavior added on to
it and who knows what it could be
it could be anything right but what I do
think is that there is a way to
calculate that thing I just don't know
what it is yet
and that's why I'm showing it as a
question for Jen sharor and more they're
the ones who have computed the better
logarithm that that calculation this is
a lot like parseval's theorem and
Fourier transforms they've they've got
that calculation is a big sum of energy
components it's kind of like a spectrum
an auditory spectrum you got all these
things the thing about this kind of
spectral analysis you can get the energy
two different ways you can add up the
squares of the samples or you can add up
the Fourier components
that's parseval's theorem you can do it
in the frequency domain or the the time
domain if it's audio in this physics
case here you can do it in the spatial
domain or you can do it in the momentum
domain that's the Fourier transform and
they're doing that calculation in the
momentum domain they never convert it
into the spatial domain which is
effectively what I'm doing now what I've
done is I've shown that distributions in
candidate distributions in the spatial
domain that have the right energy the
same total energy can agree but they
know what the Fourier coefficients are
now if they knew what the phases are
they could actually add them up it would
be the equivalent of reconstruct the
wave function with the wave form from
the spectrum they're in a position to do
that calculation where it was going to
take me a year to even figure out how
they were doing their calculation so
this is a this is a case for
collaboration in collaborate with the
guys who already know how to do it it
was beyond what I was going to be able
to do but that's a question for them
could could they actually determine what
that function is so they would first
have to agree that it makes sense to
look for it but if they agree with it
there's they would be the guys who could
actually say definitively what the shape
is so you know I want to get on a plane
to Washington and ask these guys if they
if they would take a meeting I would ask
them if they would be interested in
doing that so that's that's effectively
that's the end of the main body of the
talk and one other short video to play
we still have we said the room we're
still recording
okay still recording myself some remote
people online yes okay well so tell you
what it's a slow moving animation that I
think that so they're gonna get every
tenth frame or something we'll see how
let's try so who will get whatever they
get
oh that's true no you won't okay oh and
I guess no audio so this is not the this
is the alright oh that's not hard
alright so then I'll just show it show
it as is so the the Dirac equation gave
the upper and lower component and I said
that those were spinners that is a
notoriously tricky thing it's it it
looks like a four dimensional vector
there's four components in it but I
wrestled with this for a while before
shushing jiying at Stanford pointed out
to me you're thinking about it like a
it's a four-dimensional vector it's not
it looks like a vector you're writing it
like a vector but it's two pairs of
quantities and those are spinners those
are Pauli spinners they're not vectors
now what what so what's the difference
between a vector and the spinner that
that's the purpose of this little
visualization very I don't think too
many people have a gut feeling for what
a spinner is the purpose of this is to
show what a spinner is spin one half it
has some
properties and so here it is
demonstration of spin 1/2 I'm going to
show you what spin 1/2 looks like with a
physical model I'm narrating over my own
the video that I shot and will put on so
an ordinary object has the simple
property that when you rotate it through
360 degrees it looks the same as when
you started that's that's a normal in
ordinary object but this strange object
has the property spin 1/2 when you
rotate it through a full turn it doesn't
look the same as when you started now
you're off by PI over 2 you gotta rotate
it through a second turn before you get
back to where you started
that's what spin 1/2 is you have to
rotate twice to get back to where you
started an electron has spin up and spin
down which we can simulate by tilting
that outward disc either tilting it down
or tilting it up but it's just because
we've done the tilt at 45 degrees we
still have the spin 1/2 property you
have to go around twice before you get
back to where you started so one of them
is tipped down the other one's tipped up
and now you still have to go around
twice because they still have the 2 to 1
gear ratio so both of those are models
of spin 1/2 but they're different from
each other because once tipped up and
the others tipped down
that's spin up and spin down you see
those little arrow vectors that shows
the typical undergraduate diagram that
shows the precession of the spin vector
around the axis of quantization that's
why I tipped them that way
so this is a model of what's in the
physics textbooks to explain it to you
but nobody ever shows you that it's got
this guy go around twice property so
those are the Pauli spin vectors so
that's my way of showing paulie's
notation for this now a positron
is basically an electron with time a
time reversed electron well so now the
positron is rotating in the opposite
direction so it's it's an orthogonal
component positron electron look the
same but they're they're spinning in
opposite directions and now we have the
four components of
the you know the the four separate
components now they're rotating all
together and you kind of takes a little
getting your head around it to look at
them but you can see they're all
different from each other
spin up spin down spinning left and
spinning right that's why you have four
of them now see those are the spinner
those are the Dirac spinor components
and now finally just kind of now I spin
them a couple of times just so you can
see that's the basis functions for the
Dirac equation now if I didn't show you
this picture I just said here's the math
and there's the matrices you know what
would it mean it would be very difficult
to imagine what is implied by that but
this gives you an idea of rotating in
opposite directions because of negative
energy and spin up and spin down this
next quote here from Fineman in his
Nobel lecture 265 Dirac obtained this
equation for the description of electron
by an almost purely mathematical
proposition a simple physical view by
which the contents of this equation can
be seen is still lacking what he was
saying even in 65 getting his nobel
lecture he said basically this thing is
so complicated even I can't understand
there's no simple way to think about it
a simple physical view is still lacking
that's the purpose of this little
demonstration is to try to give a simple
physical view for what the four
components of the spinners look like the
radio parts are pretty easy to
understand it's exponential
distributions with now with rounded tops
but that spinning thing it's a brain
buster and I think that that could be
helpful it's very cool thanks thanks
okay so that's so now I really stopped I
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
