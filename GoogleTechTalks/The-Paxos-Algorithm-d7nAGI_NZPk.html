a site reliability engineer at Google
a site reliability engineers we often
work on large-scale systems some of
which rely on algorithms to reach
consensus so that changes to a certain
entity are eventually perceived by the
distributed fleet in a certain order
consistently one of these algorithms is
the Praxis algorithm which is what I'm
going to talk about today
first I will present what is the paxos
algorithm and why we need it then I will
introduce a cassava in the mid-south and
finally I will discuss practical case
which is a distributed storage system
based on boxes
what is paxos Paxos is a family of
distributed algorithms used to reach
consensus a family means there are many
variants of the algorithm we will only
talk about the vanilla Paxos algorithm
the cv that means it runs in a set of
computers or nodes and consensus we will
discuss in one minute what reaching
consensus means the paxos algorithm was
proposed in the paper that is listed at
the bottom of the slide
what is to reach consensus with paxos
imagine you are together with some
friends and you want to agree on on what
to do this afternoon
you really don't care about exactly what
you do you want to do something together
so someone could start by proposing
going to the cinema someone else could
back it up okay let's go to a cinema in
the meanwhile someone that hasn't been
listening may propose something
different like why don't we all have
dinner and even some other people may
agree with them and say yeah I am in
let's go have dinner eventually in order
to reach consensus some of these people
will have to change their mind in this
case let's say someone switches from
going to the cinema to going have dinner
and eventually the last person will go
for that too but fine let's go have
dinner consensus is agreeing on one
result
once a majority agrees on a proposal in
the faxes world that will be considered
consensus so once three people know they
want to go for dinner
everyone will go for dinner it only may
take some time for them to view any
reached consensus can be eventually
known by everyone they could ask around
what whether a consensus was reached and
what the agreement was in paxos they
involved parties want to agree on any
result not on their proposal so they
will contribute towards reaching
consensus
finally communication channels may be
faulty
that is messages can get lost in this
case you observed that someone wasn't
listening they proposed a different
thing to do in the end an agreement was
reached
why do systems need to reach consensus
you mind you have this the workstation
at your home you write a server you make
it public you start getting visits from
people and it's kind of becoming a
success so more and more people are
using it and at some point your computer
is too slow you're running out of
resources so you upgrade the run great
the CPU and it happens again it's still
more and more people using it you are
credit again but that has a limit you
can have an infinitely powerful and
scalable single computer you have to go
for something different
you either go for a leader and replicas
schema in which one node is the leader
and the other nodes are repeaters and
whenever someone wants to propose
writing a value they would talk to the
leader and the leader would serialize
the different proposals and send them to
all the replicas all the data would be
written in all these nodes or you go for
a peer-to-peer schema in which all nodes
are the same and behave the same
whenever they want to propose a new
value they send the proposals to each
other to agree on what is the next
proposal to be accepted to be performed
by everyone so that everything is
applied in the same order everywhere
eventually in the first case if the
leader becomes unavailable notes must
reach consensus to elect anyone
otherwise the whole system would be
stalled in the second one the nodes must
reach consensus continuously so as to
count it consistency so that operations
are applied in the same order everywhere
in both cases you need to reach
consensus that said let's move on to
some boxes basics paxos defines three
rows proposers who propose values to
reach consensus on acceptors who
contribute to reaching the consensus
itself and learners who learn the
agreed-upon value they can be later
queried for what the consensus value was
in practice access nodes can take
multiple roles even all of them so a
single node a single server can send
proposals to other nodes they can
contribute to reaching consensus and
they learn the final agreed-upon value
so that you can call them for it later
but those nodes must know how many
acceptors a majority is this is
important because of a property which is
to majorities will always overlap in at
least one node we will see these being
needed several times through the
algorithm in order to guarantee a set of
properties access nodes must be
persistent so even though the
communication channels may be faulty the
box's nodes cannot forget what they
accepted there are variants of paxos
that can deal with that but vanilla pod
sauce won't a boxes run aims at reaching
a single consensus this is usually a
source of confusion so you can only
agree on one value
once a consensus has been reached on a
certain value it won't progress to any
other consensus any other different
value which means if you want a value to
mutate over time a different paxos from
must happen we will see this in depth in
the practical case by the end of the
presentation
now we can move to introducing the
actual
paxos Albert let's say we have a
proposer on three acceptors so the
majority of acceptors would be two and
let's say that proposer wants to propose
a certain value it will send a prepare
ID message to a majority or all of the
acceptors the ID must be unique could be
for example the timestamp in nanoseconds
it's loaded by the proposal so that
proposal number one can choose IDs 1 3 5
and so on and propose her to can choose
IDs 2 4 6 cetera the point is that no ID
is used twice ever in the case of a time
out the proposal will retry with a new
higher ID so this proposal wants to
propose a certain value it sends prepare
5 to all the acceptors now whenever an
acceptor receives a preparer message for
a certain ID it checks if it promised to
ignore requests with this ID if it did
promise it will ignore them if it didn't
promise it promises to ignore any
requests lower than that ID it will
reply with promised ID you can observe
there's an interrelation mark in there I
will have to add something here in the
future this acceptor gotta prepare 5
message and will reply a promise 5
message to the proposal once a majority
of acceptors promise no ID lower than
that ID can make it through so if you
get a majority of promise 5
there's no way a majority of acceptors
will promise for because the two
majorities would overlap a majority of
them would ignore the request with Ivy
for whenever proposers get a majority of
promise messages for a specific ID it
will send accept requests with that ID
and the value to a majority or all of
the acceptors for now let's say the
proposer will pick any value it once so
whatever they wanted to propose at the
beginning of the taxes run in this case
this proposal gets a majority of promise
five messages and it sends accept
requests five cut to all the acceptors
if an acceptor receives an accept
request message for a certain ID and
value they check did it promise to
ignore requests with these ID
if they promised and please note this
the promise that we talked about before
if they promise they ignore it
this request won't make it through this
acceptor if they did even promised
they'd send accept with that ID and that
value and will also send it to all the
learners
so these acceptors that get accept
request five cut
they didn't promise to ignore requests
five they promised to ignore anything
lower than five
they send accept five cut to the
proposer and to all the learners if a
majority of acceptors accept a certain
ID and value consensus is reached and
that means consensus is and will always
be on value not necessarily the ID the
ID is some paxos internal artefact that
doesn't show up outside of taxes so
let's assume that a majority of
acceptors replies except five cut the
consensus has been reached on cut
and then the proposers or learners get
except messes for ID on body if a
proposer or a learner gets a majority of
accept messages for a certain ID they
know that consensus has been reached on
that value not on the ID I can the ID
may change so if the proposer
gets to accept five cut it knows that
it's proposal made it to consensus and
the learners can figure out the value
the same way there are three milestones
that always happens sequentially in a
taxes run I will mark them with stars in
their slide first
of acceptors promise on a certain ID so
no IV lower than that can make it
through ever second majority of
acceptors accept a certain ID unvalued
consensus is reached on that value and
third whenever a proposal or learner
gets a majority of accept messages for a
set an ID they know that the consensus
has been reached on the value and now
let's see the couple of cases that we
are missing let's introduce a second
proposer who is unaware of any consensus
and wants to propose something different
let's say it sends a prepare for message
to all the acceptors and these acceptors
get the message a majority of them
promised five so maybe one of them would
reply promised four but there is no way
that a majority of acceptors will
promise for so they propose her time's
out three tries again the new higher ID
which would be let's say six and since a
new prepare six message to all the
acceptors the acceptors checked whether
they promise to ignore requests with
this ID they didn't promise to ignore
any requests with that ID so they will
have to reply with promised ID but I'm
going to add a little piece of logic
there they check
did I ever accept any value if they
didn't which was the case before with
promise fight if they didn't ever accept
any value they reply with promise ID
like before they hadn't sent out any
accept message so promise five is five
but right now they have already accepted
any proposal so they are forced to reply
with promise six which is the ID of the
current proposal but I have accepted
five cut in the past they send it to the
proposer and the proposer gets a
majority of promise messages for ib6
before we said it would pick any value
it wanted but let's complete that with
some extra piece of logic it checks if
it has got any already accepted value
from promises so any piggybacked value
if they haven't got any value they could
pick any value they wanted like anything
but given that they got up a piggybacked
value they are forced to pick the value
with the highest accepted ID that they
vote in this case it was five cut so
they are forced to send except requests
six which is this new proposal ID but
the piggybacked value was that the rest
is the same acceptors receive except
request messages for these ID and value
they didn't promise to ignore it so days
and accept six that to the proposer
and the learner's they proposed her the
learners get these accept messages and
figure out what the consensus was this
is the whole Paxos algorithm let's
review some of the key points here in a
little bit more detail first of all
let's talk about majority of promises
let's say we have two proposals and we
have three acceptors proposal one sends
a prepare five message to the three
acceptors and even gets one promised
already
in the meanwhile proposal to sends a
prepare for message to the three
acceptors which please note can get
there in a different order because
different notes may be located in
different places the latencies may be
different at the point proposer one gets
promised five it has got a majority of
promises that means no ID is lower than
that can make it through the prepare for
message will be ignored by acceptor one
will be ignored by acceptor - even
though it is possible that proposal -
gets a promise message from a different
acceptor just due to latency propulsor
one can continue with accept request
five whatever value they want to propose
but request for will never make it
indeed you may have observed that these
may cause convention
for example proposal one may send a
prepare 5 message to a majority of
acceptors who may promise on it propose
sir - in the meanwhile and prepare 6
message and gets a majority of promises
- that means request number five will
never make it through it will be ignored
by at least a majority of acceptors so
maybe proposal one times out and retries
with a new higher ID prepare 7 gets a
majority of promises which steps over
the
with I v6 from propulsor - which will be
in or by a majority of nodes so proposal
- may want to retry with a higher ID
several proposals on the same taxes run
can cause hotspots that yield convention
it can really stall the boxes run
potential solution is to set an
exponential back-off in place so that in
the case this is happening and the
exponential back-off will leave enough
time for any of the proposals to go
through entirely at some point of there
are some iterations and exponential
back-off maybe you prepare eight will
get the promised eight proposer one will
be waiting because of the back off and
proposal too will have enough time to
send accept request and get it accepted
at which point consensus has been
reached and the boxes one is over
the other case is majority of accepts so
let's say also one sends prepare five
gets a majority of promises since accept
requests five that gets a majority of
accepts and at that point consensus has
been reached and is that value that no
accept requests with lower ID will be
accepted by a majority because that
would require a majority of promises for
the lower ID but we got it for the
higher one so they would ignore the
lower one also no accept requests with
higher ID and the different value will
be accepted by a majority because at
least an acceptor will piggyback this ID
and value in their promise which will
propagate to the accept requests so
while you can still have higher IDs they
will be on the same value in this case
let's say propose our two cents prefer
six message to a majority of acceptors
it is guaranteed that at least one of
them will piggyback they accepted five
cut in their promise which means
proposed r2 can only send an acceptor
quest six per idea but value that which
will be can be accepted and this is
actually how proposal
and learners can learn about boxes
consensus if they missed a majority of
except my C's in the past a proposer
will try to propose a value and the
acceptors will pick about the consensus
value and proposal will have to propose
it and will get it accepted finally
let's briefly discuss practical case
which is at suited storage system based
on the boxes algorithm this is a
fictional storage system which is an
extreme simplification of some parts of
mega store the original mega store paper
is listed at the bottom of the slide in
case you want to check it
let's say we have on a user and we have
a bank account for this user and we have
it replicated
we have replicas a or bigger B replicas
C so they are in different places and we
want to have the balance for the bank
account of the user we discussed before
that taxes can only reach consensus on
one value that will never mutate that
doesn't work for a bank account because
we want to transfer money in we want to
withdraw money and so on the solution to
this is we are going to have a
replicated log these would be the log
position 0 which is the initial state of
the bank account they stayed at opening
date of their bank account any time we
want the value to me a date we will
start a new consensus that will be on
the next low position if we want to
transfer $50 in we have to propose that
low position one for user Lewis will be
plus $50 and maybe you can even
piggyback that the balance is $150 just
for efficiency reasons then if the user
wants to withdraw money this has to be
recorded in a different logo position a
new consensus will start on lock
position 2 for user list so that amount
of money that isn't the account is $130
because the user withdrawn $20 the
client would interact with this storage
system as follows let's say we have
storage servers in each of the replicas
that act as boxes note let's a proposer
acceptor and learner all together the
user talks to the storage server can do
a read or can propose how right let's
say the user wants to write withdraw of
$30 the storage server will act as a
Paxos proposer and will send this
proposal to all the boxes acceptors
which are 3 itself on the other two
accepters hat will accept the request
and maybe some other note accepts the
request so consensus has been reached
and at the point the proposer knows that
consensus has been reached the value can
be written and starts to be propagated
it's fine if only two of the replicas
right the value the third one will
eventually figure out the value by some
mechanism to catch up or when trying to
propose any value they will try to
propose it for low position 3u service
which is the same boxes from which we'll
get the $30 throw be debugged in the
accept message so eventually the third
replica will figure out what the right
value is this is actually I said a very
simplified storage system but this is
the way to use Paxos to implement a
distributed storage system with that we
came to the end I hope this helped you
learn boxes and I hope you enjoyed the
presentation I certainly did thanks a
lot
