series my name is Jeffrey Greenblatt and
google.org and we're very pleased to
have today Sally Benson from Stanford
University to come and talk with us
about carbon sequestration and captured
from power plants I wanted to give you a
few brief highlights on Sally's
background she currently serves as
executive director of the global climate
and energy project where she has been at
Stanford since last March previously she
was at LBO Lawrence Berkeley Lab in
various management positions including
deputy director of operations and
division director for Earth Sciences she
had several scientific foci well at LBO
including primarily geologic storage of
co2 in deep underground formations but
also looking at technologies and energy
systems for bringing about a low-carbon
future and the influence of climate
change on critical habitats as well as
geotechnical instrumentation Sally got
her BS in geology from Columbia
University in 1977 and her master's and
PhD in materials science and mineral
engineering from UC Berkeley she's also
the author or co-author of over 160
scientific publications now I first met
Sally when she came to give a lecture at
Princeton I believe where I was a few
years ago just learning about climate
change science and particularly this
novel idea at the time for putting large
amounts of co2 underground in order to
keep it out of the atmosphere part of
the program I was involved in called the
carbon mitigation initiative and since
then we've crossed paths several times
at scientific conferences and now that
we both live in the Bay Area
occasionally in cafes so please help me
welcome sally here thank you
great well anyway thanks thanks a lot so
are we all ready to go and yeah okay all
right so I'm gonna be talking about
carbon dioxide capture and sequestration
or sometimes called carbon dioxide
capture and storage and you'll notice I
chose sort of a provocative title hype
or hope and and that is because I think
there's a lot of diverse opinions about
carbon dioxide capture in storage and I
think it's really good to to recognize
both sides of the discussion and and
what I'll try to do is elucidate what I
think are some of the issues on both
sides but but finally give you my
opinion about hype or hope or somewhere
in between that so so okay so what about
hope we are why are people hopeful well
there's sort of a list these are the
kind of things you hear that studies
integrated assessment studies say that
20% of the needed emissions reductions
could be achieved over the next hundred
years using CCS you also hear things
like if you do CCS it makes the overall
mitigation effort to reduce greenhouse
gases less expensive if you do this so
that's that's one thing you hear the
other thing is you hear sort of the
hopeful well wow you know if we can't
make this work you know if CCS doesn't
work we're really in trouble because we
use so many fossil fuels and we rely so
heavily on coal primarily for
electricity so and in particularly in
the developing world there's a lot of
growing reliance on fossil fuels so so
there's that kind of hope other
arguments are that basically that all
this sort of toolkit of things that we
need to do for CCS are available today
there's no real new technology needed
that it's just we need to put them
together in a unique way that's never
happened before on this scale there's
also the view that well we've been
injecting co2 or other fluids in oil
fields for you know more than 30 years
so so basically what there's nothing new
on the storage side and so you hear that
and then you know you get there well
let's just do it you know this
such a serious problem dealing with
climate change that you know let's just
go do this so these are the kind of
hopeful arguments that you hear and then
on the other side sort of the hype you
know a lot of concern that CCS is really
expensive and you know just never going
to do it and and you know forget it so
you also hear a lot of discussion about
the environmental risk being
unacceptably high and that you are going
to have disastrous situations where
whole towns are going to be wiped out
and so forth there's also the argument
that well you know whatever co2 you put
underground it's just gonna leak back
into the atmosphere so what's the
purpose of doing it in the first place
and then there are other arguments that
the institutional barriers are just too
high and particularly in that context I
think people are thinking about public
acceptance that that there are analogous
kinds of waste disposal operations that
that people just don't like and
therefore it will be too difficult so so
this doesn't represent the full spectrum
of opinions but it kind of lays the
ground for both sides of this so when we
come to the end of this talk I'll give
you my opinions on these and and anyway
as we go along also if you have
questions let me know
so so to answer this question of about
the potential role it will play I think
there are a number of key questions and
this isn't a complete list but I think
these are you know some of the heavy
hitters so the first one is captured
technically feasible you know can we do
this can we capture co2 from the flue
gases or smokestacks of power plants
another big one is will co2 leak back to
the surface is you know putting this
underground futile or or in fact will it
stay where we put it another key
question is will co2 storage create
unacceptable environmental hazards so
that you know if we do this that maybe
it doesn't leak out but it damages
groundwater for isn't as an example
another one is is there enough storage
capacity you know say say everything
else works fine it's cost-effective but
you know is there simply enough pore
space underground to do this another one
will CCS be
too costly to implement you know is
there the cost of electricity generation
including capture and storage just cost
prohibitive and therefore we'll never do
it
and then finally key question are there
some non technical issues or
institutional issues or societal issues
that would impede deployment so I'll
hopefully answer these questions and and
then go back again and and sort of try
to lay out the hype vs hope with regard
to these so so now to get to to the
technology we're talking about carbon
dioxide capture and storage it basically
involves taking the carbon dioxide
instead of allowing it freely to be
admitted to the atmosphere that we would
somehow capture it and that we would
then compress it to get into a liquid
form basically it becomes a liquid and
then we put it in pipelines or we could
put it on ships and transport it
someplace where we could inject it deep
underground for essentially permanent
storage so that's this is basically the
scheme that is involved in this
technology and and I'll talk about each
of these components and we'll start with
capture so answering the question you
know can we capture carbon dioxide so
there are a number of different options
for doing this and they're illustrated
here on this chart and let's for the
moment focus on electricity production
and this is the primary focus of the
target of carbon dioxide capture and
storage is electricity production and
primarily coal-based electricity
production which is today about 50% of
all the electricity used comes from coal
in this country so there are three
different approaches that you can use
the first is something called
post-combustion capture and basically
what you would do is you would run your
power plant just like we run it today
you take fossil fuels and you mix it
with air which is mostly nitrogen and
that and then after you've burned the
the fossil fuels that you would then put
in some kind of chemical separation
process that would separate the carbon
dioxide from nitrogen so that's the post
combustion
Challenge so that's one approach to do
that and I'll talk about some of the
pluses and minuses of that in a minute
so that that would be something that we
could use on power plants that we have
today the second choice is something
called pre combustion capture and here
what you do is that instead of burning
coal in air for example that you instead
first convert the coal to to a gas
something called a synthesis gas which
is typically a mixture of carbon
monoxide and hydrogen you also have the
choice to do a further chemical reaction
that gets rid of all the carbon monoxide
and by reacting it with water and in a
catalog with a catalyst present and that
produces then a pure hydrogen stream and
a pure co2 stream so so that's pre
combustion capture and what's what's
good about that is is that now your
separations job is somewhat simpler is
you're just separating carbon dioxide
from hydrogen or carbon dioxide from
carbon monoxide and hydrogen and
typically the co2 concentrations are
much higher than you would have in a
post combustion plant where you're
trying to separate carbon dioxide from
nitrogen so so the rule of thumb is the
more concentrated the co2 in the waste
stream the easier it is to capture okay
so so pre combustion is the second one
basically they're a completely different
kind of power plant than we run today
and then the final one is something
called oxy fuel combustion and the idea
here is that instead of burning a fossil
fuel be a natural gas or coal in air
which has got a lot of ice nitrogen that
you separate the oxygen which is the
reactant that you really want from air
and so you're separating nitrogen from
oxygen and then you do your combustion
in basically a pure oxygen environment
and then the waste product from that is
a mixture of basically carbon dioxide
and water there there are contaminants
present but those can be cleaned up but
basically you have a waste stream of
carbon dioxide and water so that one is
is a technology that is
in principle rather straightforward but
it hasn't been used today and there are
challenges associated with the very high
temperatures and needing to mud moderate
the temperatures because you would have
very very hot conditions with the oxygen
combustion alone so these are the three
approaches that are available today to
one degree or another we've have
experience with all of them though the
post combustion technology would be the
one that that is most mature amongst
these so so that's on the powerplant
side there's also I think an off
forgotten issue that that actually CCS
in the long run might be very important
for and that is to do with manufacturing
about 25 percent of our emissions are
from manufacturing this is likely to
grow in the future as greater
development takes place across the world
and right now we don't really have a
good pathway for eliminating a lot of
those emissions and post-combustion
capture or oxygen combustion may provide
an option for industrial emissions okay
so those are the options so that we can
then go down the list and look at the
the technology and some of the
advantages and disadvantages or
drawbacks so post combustion technology
it's basically mature technology it's
used at scale today not for this
application primarily it's used more in
gas processing when natural gas is
produced it often has a lot of co2 in it
so this exact same technology is used
it's basically a chemical separation
where you contact the gas with a liquid
the liquid absorbs the the carbon
dioxide you then take that liquid aside
and heat it back up and the co2 is
released so so anyway well very
established technology it's also used
today in things like when we buy soft
drinks for example most of the co2 is
produced by this post combustion type of
capture it would be a standard retrofit
to a typical power plant but that's it's
it's not that simple and these are very
very big facilities so to
retrofit a plant you might need a you
know real estate of maybe as much as six
acres or so for a big power plant but in
principle it's a standard retrofit in
terms of drawbacks first thing is it's
got a high energy penalty meaning it
takes a lot of energy to do the capture
the primary energy requirement is in
this stage where you have the the liquid
that's got co2 dissolved in it and you
need to heat it up to release the co2
that takes a lot of energy with the kind
of solvents that are available today so
you could have an energy penalty or sort
of a hit right off the board of about
30% and obviously that's that's a lot so
it's a at the very least it's sort of
wasteful second thing is that the cost
is comparatively high and it's not
something that you would do today unless
there were policies to limit carbon
emissions and we'll talk more about the
cost later okay so pre combustion
technology also sometimes called IGCC
integrated gasification combined cycle
that's probably what you hear about it
in the newspapers the there are studies
which suggest that on a per ton of co2
basis it's going to be less expensive
than then the post-combustion capture
though frankly I think that's really
debatable probably most importantly is
that the energy penalties are lower
they're only on the order of 10 to 15% I
mean still you know that's still a
pretty big number but it's certainly not
as high as 50% another benefit is that
when you go through the gasification
process you're basically producing
hydrogen and so you could imagine hybrid
plants that both provide hydrogen for
power generation but also hydrogen for
other possible applications such as
vehicle transportation or or as a
chemical feedstock so then in terms of
drawbacks there are some significant
ones basically if you look at power
producers today they know how to burn
things and they know how to make steam
and they know how to run steam through a
turbine or they know how to run a gas
turbine
there are fairly simple operations IGCC
is basically a very complicated chemical
process so so the workforce that is in
place today to kind of run these
facilities it's quite a different
workforce than you need to run a complex
chemical plant it's much more akin to
running a refinery than it is to to
running a power generation statement
station and there's a lot of concern on
the part of the companies the power
generation companies - all of a sudden
be faced with a system that they know
less about and there are lots of issues
about reliability that's one of the key
things in our electricity sector we like
reliability we like cheap and reliable
and so you bring in a completely new
technology and it creates a lot of
concerns on both of those sites so
another thing is that if you move to
pre-combustion capture that or a GCC you
basically have to start from scratch I
mean you might have the real estate for
your power plant but basically you'd
need to pull out what you had there and
replace it with something new or
repowering and that would take a very
large capital investment to do that also
IGCC plants tend to be more expensive on
a per megawatt basis for example than a
standard pulverized coal type plant or
certainly much more expensive than a
natural gas combined cycle plant so then
finally moving to oxygen combustion the
real advantage is that the separation at
the downstream end is very
straightforward you have a concentrated
source of co2 the other primary
constituent is his water and that's a
pretty easy separation to do and this
would lead to potentially higher
generation efficiencies however if
you're doing oxygen combustion you have
to separate oxygen from air and that's
quite an energy intensive process as
well so even though when a generation
side you can be more efficient you're
still have the inefficiency of
separating air oxygen from air in terms
of some of the drawbacks new materials
may be required for the higher
temperature environments
again I mentioned the oxygen separation
which is costly and energy intensive and
again it's not a standard retrofit you
couldn't just put you couldn't just take
away the air and put oxygen there you'd
need to change your materials so okay so
these are the advantages and drawbacks
of each of these and so I think at this
point we will kind of come to the end of
the capture discussion and at the very
end I'll talk about costs of the
integrated capture and storage system so
in terms of the other components in this
chain compression pipeline
transportation all of that is
straightforward it's done today for co2
for things like co2 so no big deal there
really the issue is underground
injection and and doing this at a scale
that would make a difference so the
first question is is well where would we
consider putting the co2 and there are
three main kind of rocks there are
igneous rocks those are like granite
like the Sierra Nevada there are
volcanic rocks you know think Hawaii you
know big black thick rocks with vesicles
in it and then the third main type of
rock are sedimentary rocks and those are
things like the rocks you can see in the
Great Central Valley or if you're
driving to Tahoe there are a lot of
sedimentary rocks along the roadside
there and those basically form as
mountains are eroded and the sediments
are transported down into valleys and
eventually it fills up and that's what
sedimentary rocks are so in terms of co2
storage sedimentary rocks are the only
place that today are being seriously
considered for co2 storage the other
type of rocks though are interesting
research opportunities much much less is
known about those so the question then
is where are those sedimentary basins
that might be potential sequestration
opportunities and they're shown by this
map up here on the left-hand side and
you'll notice sort of three colors
there's the darkest gray and those are
places where there are sedimentary
basins that are considered to be highly
prospective for storage meaning it's
if you went and looked there you'd
likely be able to find someplace to put
co2 there are the sort of medium great
colors and those are areas where there's
a sedimentary basin but maybe it's not
deep enough or maybe it doesn't have the
right kind of layer cake geology that
you'd need to store co2 but but
nevertheless they're sedimentary basins
where you could take a look it also
might just be areas where we don't know
very much about and then there are the
on the continents there are the white
kind of areas and those are areas where
we don't have the right types of rocks
that they are igneous rocks or they're
metamorphic rocks okay so actually I I
didn't ever describe what metamorphic
rocks are metamorphic rocks are
basically either igneous or sedimentary
rocks that had been cooked at great
depths below the Earth's crust and they
tend to be very hard and typically
fractured if they have any permeability
at all okay so so those are the in
general the areas so so what does a what
does a sedimentary basin look like well
one of them is illustrated on the
right-hand panel here and this is
actually a sedimentary basin in
California this is actually quite quite
close to us a cross-section running
pretty much through Sacramento and
you'll notice there are two main colors
there they're sort of a yellow color and
those represents sands so those are
sediments that are deposited by things
like rivers and streams sort of
high-energy deposits where you're
carrying along fairly big grains that
are eroding and then they fall out into
into the bottom of the valley and those
are the places we might store co2 and
the other color you see are the great
colors and those are sediments that are
laid down like in a really deep lake or
in the ocean and those are very low
energy environments so they tend to have
very very very tiny clay particles and
that are laid down and and compacted and
and are very very low permeability it's
very difficult to push any fluids
through those so those great kind of
areas act like the seals yeah
right India India is yeah so so India in
particular is much of it is basaltic
rock so it's it really is not a lot of
capacity there there is some capacity
offshore of India to to the to the West
China is in a little bit better
situation there are some sedimentary
basins onshore and offshore and at the
time this map was developed there had
been no serious assessment of China's
storage capacity since then one study
has been done and basically it said that
it's sort of on par with the North
American capacity I think it's really
too early to tell I think that there's a
lot of work that needs to be done in
China it certainly isn't going to be
giant you know it's not going to be the
middle east of storage capacity you know
it will always be a more challenging
place than then for example the former
Soviet Union which has also got a lot of
storage capacity okay so these are the
kind of places we can put co2 so so
that's sort of the big picture but then
we need to look at specific formations
that we would inject them in and the
most obvious is oil and gas reservoirs
oil and gas reservoirs are in
sedimentary basins and and those are
places where over geologic time frames
of millions and millions of years fluids
buoyant fluids gases or oil which is
buoyant compared to or less dense
compared to water that those got trapped
and and so what's good about that is we
know that there was a seal that sort of
stood the test of geologic time in
addition that some fraction of the what
had been in the pore spaces oil or gas
has been removed conceivably making room
for some co2 so that's kind of the most
obvious because they both have seals and
they're partially depleted
so the second option is really a variant
on that and that is this that you
combine the storage activity with
continued production or enhanced oil
production or enhanced gas production
and so basically while you're injecting
co2 you continue to extract oil or gas
and until you do the two operations at
the same time and then eventually you'd
stop producing oil or gas and then you
just try to fill it up the rest of the
way with co2 benefit of that is that
there's commercial interest in that that
there are oilfield operators who would
be happy to have the co2 because they
can produce more oil and what it allows
you to do is make that operation more
cost-effective because you basically now
have a market for the co2 as opposed to
the co2 really being considered as a
waste so those are the first two options
the next is to put co2 in what are
called deep saline formations so
basically what you want to look for is
like an oil reservoir so a place that's
got a seal and it's got a the porous
sandy storage zone underneath it but
it's not filled with oil it's just
filled with very salty water that is
isolated from the sort of hydrosphere
that has active circulation and fluids
in the crust
so that's saline formations and then the
final one is that co2 can be put into
coal beds and the storage mechanism is
somewhat different
the co2 actually absorbs to the surfaces
of the coal and and becomes basically
part of the coal itself and that option
is much less well developed than the
other two okay so those are the kind of
places that we can put it so so I think
the definitive work on on co2 capture
and storage which was published in 2005
and basically is still very current so
those of you who have a real interest in
this there's a eight or nine hundred
pages of detail on the things that I'm
talking about it also covers things like
ocean storage and so forth okay so this
is a very good reference reference book
on this but what I wanted to do is talk
about two of the important conclude
about the storage the security of
storage you know basically the willit
leak and will it create unacceptable
environmental problems and I'll say
these two conclusions and then I'll
spend a whole bunch of time trying to
explain why they why this group
concluded this the people who work there
on geologic storage there were 23 lead
authors from around the world and about
seven contributing authors all involved
in one aspect or the other of this okay
so so to kind of cut to the chase is
that the first quote that's relevant is
that observations from engineered and
natural analogs as well as models
suggest that the refraction retained in
appropriately selected and managed
geological reservoirs is likely to
exceed 99% over a hundred years or
actually it's very likely to exceed 99%
over a hundred years and is likely to
exceed 99% over a thousand years so
basically this was a statement about the
confidence that if you did everything
right that you should be able to achieve
good performance or that all systems
aren't naturally leaky so that was that
sense and then the second one had to do
with the environmental impacts and
basically it had the same kind of list
of caveats like you have to do
everything right but if you do
everything right and you plug leaks if
they find them or you remediates
that the local health safety and
environmental risks of geological
storage would be comparable to the risks
of current activities such as natural
gas storage enhanced our recovery deep
underground disposal of acid gas so so
basically this so one co2 stays
underground can stay underground for a
long time and second it's not a
particularly unique activity compared to
the whole range of activities we did
today okay so now what I want to do is
sort of describe why the group concluded
this so the first thing is to do with
natural analogs for co2 storage so these
are things that are found in nature that
give you sort of a proof in principle
that co2 or boy and fluids can be
trapped underground we've already talked
about the first of them oil and gas
reservoirs a natural gas is about has
about half the density of co2 meaning
it's even more buoyant oil is
is a little bit is a little bit more
dense but not more much more dense than
co2 would be at those kind of conditions
and we have proof that those fluids stay
trapped for millions and millions of
years now that's not to say there aren't
some oil and gas reservoirs that leak
they do but there are many of them that
don't leak and the worldwide sort of
leakage rate from these systems as
estimated by marine environments is like
10 to the minus 7 per so so one part in
10 to the 7 leaks per year so extremely
high retention rates the second thing is
about co2 itself so you might say okay
well oil and gas will find maybe they
have unique chemical composition doesn't
react with the rocks and therefore co2
could be different well it turns out
that there are also natural co2
reservoirs that are present it also
turns out that many oil and gas
reservoirs also have a lot of co2 in
them so it doesn't look like there's
anything special about co2 that makes it
more likely to leak so so these natural
analogs are proof in principle that you
could store co2 underground for a very
long time periods the second part has to
do with what we're called industrial
analogs so these are operations that
that we carry out today or over the past
century that are somehow analogous with
co2 storage or inform safety and
longevity issue so the first of them is
co2 enhanced oil recovery this is
actually a technology that was developed
in the the 80s seven late 70s and 80s
co2 is injected into oil reservoirs
it's miscible with the oil and it makes
it much easier to get the oil out so
there's a great deal of experience with
that most of it in the United States and
this little map shows a picture of all
the gray areas where co2 enhanced oil
recovery is practiced today and then
these little red areas where there are
natural co2 reservoirs that are actually
used to provide co2 for these injections
so most of the co2 that's injected is
actually co2 that's been extracted from
a natural reservoir and
into the oilfield so so and basically
these projects are carried out safely
within the range of environmental
regulations that are imposed on a
state-by-state basis second one is
natural gas storage we practiced natural
gas storage for over a hundred years
there's a very large natural gas storage
field not very far from us McDonald
Island if you drive through the Delta
you're driving right on top of a very
huge natural gas storage field and it's
developed to provide a gas to San
Francisco in the wintertime because you
need a lot of gas people are using it
for heating and so forth and and I'm
very safe you can go visit the project
it's actually quite interesting and I'll
show you some maps and then finally
something called acid gas disposal this
is something that's done in Canada
mixtures of so2 and co2 and sometimes
h2s are injected underground again no no
problems though this area is far less
monitored than than the other two things
that I've talked about so far okay so so
what is industrially yes
from natural gas storage projects so
there are two types of natural gas
storage projects one are done like in
saline aquifers or oil and gas
reservoirs natural geologic formations
there are also projects that are done in
salt caverns that are mined the salt
cavern projects if you get a leak in the
well casing you can have a very rapid
release and there have been some bad
examples of leaks associated with that
there was a town in Hutchinson Kansas if
you google Hutchinson Kansas you can
find examples I don't think anyone was
hurt but there were fire you know at the
land surface things you wouldn't want to
happen in the in Illinois there was an
early example of a natural gas storage
project that that was leaking and it
ended up making an explosion in
somebody's outhouse so there are
examples but by and large as the
regulations improved it's gotten safer
and safer and now there are very very
few incidents you know okay so anyway so
then the final example is there are real
storage projects today there are 20 plus
cumulative years of experience between
the SH lightener project waiver and
project and insallah project which I'll
describe to you right now but just
really quickly here's a map showing the
location of natural gas storage projects
in in Europe and in the United States
and you can see there are many of them
there over 450 in the United States
alone and fairly broadly distributed so
that's that okay so the real projects
socialite nerve project this is offshore
Norway and you can see the platform here
this is the capture facility this is a
natural gas processing facility so they
produce natural gas from this platform
it's got too much co2 in it they need to
strip it off which they do here this is
exactly the kind of post combustion unit
you'd use in a power plant and okay so
so back in the mid-90s they wanted to
produce this gas the Norwegian
government had a policy if you have
offshore co2 emissions that you have to
pay a tax it was about $50 a ton so they
decided it would be cheaper
to actually put it underground and I
think they also had some foresight that
this may become a very important
technology so so what they do is they
take the co2 that's separated from that
facility there and they inject it into a
subsea aquifer illustrated by that blue
layer there and they've now been doing
that for about 12 years and they inject
about a million tons a year so that's
about one fifth of the size for a very
large-scale power plant in the United
States so it's not as big but it's not
orders of magnitude up so it's sort of
industrially relevant scale it might be
that we probably never inject more than
a million tons per year into any
individual well so so in many ways this
is a good analog to what a commercial
scale power plant operation might be so
there's that project basically it's gone
great another project is the webern
project this is in Canada they take co2
that's produced from a sin gas facility
in North Dakota pipeline of nearly 300
miles up into Canada and here they
inject the co2 about 1.7 million tons
per year on average into an oil field
again this project is gone fine both of
the last two projects have had lots of
monitoring and I'll show you some of the
data from Schleif nur as we go along no
evidence for for leakage out of those
projects and the final one is a project
in Algeria this one is done by BP and
sone attract some attracts the National
Oil Company of Algeria Statoil recently
became a partner also this is another
gas field where they produce gas they
have to strip out the co2 here you can
see that very large facility so these
gas separation facilities are really
large
they take that co2 and they inject it
actually back into the gas field but
they inject it into the water-filled
part of the gas field so the gas usually
just occupies the very little top
so they're injecting co2 down here
eventually they expect it to flow back
into the gas field this has been a very
challenging project it's a difficult
place to work much higher injection
pressures and a very low permeability
formation so a good analog to a more
challenging setting for this kind of
project so these are the real projects
so so I want to move on now to to talk
about some of the caveats that I
mentioned that you know when when the
IPCC concluded that it could be you know
ninety nine percent retention there were
all the ifs you know if you do this
right if you do this right well this is
basically the list at the foundation is
we have to really understand the storage
mechanisms and leakage mechanisms we
need to learn how to select sites so
that they have good seals and that they
provide good storage reservoirs we need
to have storage engineering that you're
not just going to go you know drill a
hole in the ground and start pumping co2
and like oil and gas field production
operations this will be evolved to be a
complex science of optimization
primarily safe operations lots of
experience with that but that'll be very
important monitoring will be a key
component I'll say more about that
remediation plan so you have to have a
back-up plan if something goes wrong
you've got to have something an action
you and take regulatory oversight is
going to be incredibly important to make
sure that all these things are done well
and financed and finally there needs to
be some kind of financial responsibility
model so that if 50 years from now a
hundred years from now or if after the
project is stops if anything goes wrong
that there's money in the bank to pay
for it so so that's one of the
institutional challenges that needs to
be grappled with so so now just I'll
just hit on a couple of other things so
so the first thing is when you put co2
underground it's not going to be a gas
it's going to basically be a
supercritical fluid which basically in
practice is a sort of liquid like
density with a gas like viscosity so and
the density shown by this red
curve will be about two-thirds the
density of water okay so it's going to
be buoyant but but it's not a guess so
when you think about a mental model it's
think about it as a sort of a slippery
liquid okay so it's in the reservoir so
you're injecting it into this sand sand
body well what does it really look like
it isn't some big bubble you know that's
sort of waiting to escape in fact it's
not we and we now can do micro
tomography images using the light
sources the Department of Energy light
sources and basically we can make real
pictures of what the co2 looks like in
these rocks so the red are the rock
grains the green is water and the dark
blobs that's what the co2 looks like and
and you have to appreciate the scale of
this so this whole thing is two
millimeters so you can see that the gas
is actually very very tiny individual
basically blobs of co2 that that are
connected but they're connected through
a very torturous pathway so if you have
some kind of penetration into this you
can imagine that there would be a great
deal of frictional resistance to moving
that gas quickly out of the subsurface
it also shows why it's kind of difficult
to put it in there because you actually
have to push the co2 so that it can get
in all these individual pore spaces okay
so so I want to talk now about what what
is it that keeps the co2 underground
well the primary trapping mechanisms I
already alluded to is you have to put it
beneath seals I'll say what seals are in
a minute but the other there's some sort
of longer term processes that are also
important that co2 dissolves in the
water it can be trapped by capillary
forces which basically immobilize the
co2 and eventually it can also be
converted to solid minerals carbonate
minerals calcium carbonate magnesium
carbonate and then if there's organic
material it can also absorb to the
organic material but the most important
one is seals so I want to say a little
bit what what are seals basically seals
are rocks made up of very very fine
textured materials nano
nano-sized particles clays and these are
highly compacted together and that does
two things it makes it so that it's
really difficult to push fluid through
it so that's called low permeability so
it wouldn't matter what kind of fluid
you had present it would be just
difficult you'd have to have a huge
pressure gradient to push and fluid
through it but the second thing and the
most important is that these very very
fine textured materials provide a
capillary barrier or basically a
membrane seal to to the secondary fluid
that's called the non wetting fluid so
so there's these clay minerals want to
be coated by water and it here is very
very strongly to the surface of those
and co2 is the second phase and it
doesn't want to attach itself to the
surface of the rocks more than water
does so basically it creates a membrane
so you can flow water through it but
unless you have very very high pressures
you can't get the co2 to flow through it
so it's this double mechanism that makes
it so that co2 could be retained
underground beneath these seals and it's
basically what's primarily responsible
for the virtual existence of natural gas
reservoirs that are found in nature so
those are that's what we're looking for
in a seal I mentioned that there were
secondary trapping mechanisms and the
most this is just sort of an
illustration of one possible example of
how these secondary trapping mechanisms
would evolve over time so you can get
dissolution of co2 you can get mineral
trapping and you can get this capillary
or residual trapping and the idea is
that after a hundred years or a thousand
years much of the co2 may actually have
converted to these other forms that are
basically immobilized in the subsurface
and why this is important is that we
don't want to have to worry about these
things forever if you put co2
underground you don't want to be a
thousand years from now just as worried
about it as the day you put it in and
that's why these are important
monitoring is extremely important none
of these projects will take place
without monitoring and there
a whole bunch of different technology
that can be used for monitoring I'm
going to give you two examples one
example will be the monitoring
technology that's basically used to look
at where the co2 is in the subsurface
and the second is monitoring technology
that can be used on the ground surface
to detect any leakage so this is
actually a map or it's actually two
different maps it's on the top are
cross-sections
through the SH like inert plume and on
the bottom panel are map views of where
the co2 is so so the on the left-hand
side here this is what the subsurface
looked like before any co2 is injected
and this is using seismic imaging so
basically you propagate compressional
waves or shear waves through the
subsurface when it encounters the co2
there's an impedance contrast which
causes reflections so it's a standard
technology but it turns out to be quite
exquisitely sensitive to the presence of
co2 so this was before any co2 is
injected in 1994 and the image on the
top now is this Krotz a cross-section
through the earth and you can only see a
couple of features one you see a
reflection near the top it says top of
that Youth Cirrus and so that's the top
of the storage reservoir and you can
also see a reflection on the bottom and
looking down in a map view don't see
much of anything so in 1999
three years after they started injection
you they did the first image and all of
a sudden they're all these strong
reflectors that are showing up and and
basically those are indicative of the
presence of co2 basically where it is
located in the subsurface so on this
cross section you can see that it's sort
of spread out in thin little layers
within the storage zone and here you can
see the size of the footprint of the co2
and this has been done repeatedly this
last image is shown in 2002 but they've
they do this now every couple of years
and I just didn't show those so
basically it shows us that we can tell
where the co2
in the subsurface very importantly if
you look at the top of the storage
reservoir you can see that there's not
evidence that co2 has escaped out of the
out of the seal so this is proof when I
said that she Lightner is going very
well this is the kind of evidence that
used to to show that in fact the co2 is
staying underground yes this is where
the this is the injection well location
yes uh-huh right so it was near the base
of the formation yep okay so surface
monitoring it may be that either there
would be a requirement or it would be
desirable to have some definitive proof
based on surface monitoring whether co2
was leaking or not and it turns out that
the people who study natural carbon
cycling between the atmosphere and
plants and soils actually have developed
a whole suite of technology that's
extremely sensitive and that can be used
to detect co2 fluxes from the surface so
basically all of these are being
borrowed for the application to this
problem and there's actually an
experiment that was set up in Montana
where there was a long well 100 meter
long well that was drilled very close to
the surface a metre and a half below the
surface co2 was injected into it and
allowed to leak out so that people could
test out whether these various
instruments would working and here's a
picture you can see the field where this
experiment was done the blue flag showed
the outline of where the where the where
the well was here was the injection
system we very carefully controlled all
the injection and on the right-hand side
are some of the monitoring techniques
that were used the first one is called a
flux tower and that one could directly
detect fluxes over a fairly large
footprint here's a little device kind of
like a cookie cutter that you can go and
raster over the surface and measure
fluxes this is very very sensitive you
can measure soil gas and they're also
studies to look at plant stress it turns
out actually as a detection sort of
diagnostic plant stress is probably
going to be extremely valuable and
you can do this based on in planes or
you can do it on the land surface
so basically when co2 is in the soils
the plants become stressed even if it's
not visible to your eye the spectra the
reflectance spectra off the plant
changes indicating that something is
different so this is the kind of
monitoring that can be used okay so
quickly because I'm running out of time
storage capacity in the US this is just
one example that detailed studies have
been done of oil and gas field
sequestration capacity saline aquifers
and coal this is just the map showing
where there are saline aquifers that are
deep enough which is typically greater
than a kilometer to potentially store
co2 and so you can see in the US there
are lots of them and there are actually
numbers on capacity but they're just big
numbers so they don't really mean much
so a simpler way to look at this is to
look at the ratio between the
sequestration capacity and the amount of
emissions for example today and these
are actually four or seven different
parts of the United States so this is
sort of the Dakotas this is the Midwest
around the Illinois Basin this is sort
of the Ohio Iowa area west coast and
Alaska southeast and Southwest Montana
area and together these pretty much
cover the country and so so the number
on the left-hand side is basically again
the ratio between the storage capacity
and annual emissions and if you look for
example at let's pick one C curve this
is the southeast this includes the Texas
Gulf Coast you can see that the low
range of the estimates there's a couple
hundred years capacity for storing co2
if you look out in the in the West very
large capacity over a thousand times so
yeah so there's a lot in some areas if
you look at other areas say in the
southwest doesn't look like so much low
end of the range me
about 50 years of storage capacity
probably not enough they would need to
export co2 so so the story is is that
there's some place with a lot yeah in
some place not so much yeah the the
estimates are in excess of 10 billion
tons ten thousand billion tons ten
thousand Giga tons of co2 storage
capacity which would be sufficient for
hundreds of years of burning of coal
yeah for fossil fuels it's about five
thousand yeah I mean it's always hard
because it's which fossil appeals is
that is that all of the oil shale is
that all of the you know methane
hydrates but five thousand is sort of
typically the high end of the number
that people think her
yeah yeah so yeah I I think that we
would run out of fossil fuels before we
would run out of storage space but
that's not to say there are plenty of
areas where there's not storage space
and you know China may be one of those
India's certainly one of those so it's
it's you know very like any resource
it's variably distributed okay so what
could go wrong
release pathways you know we can't just
say oh it does stay down there we have
to consider what could go wrong
well leakage every time you put a hole
in the ground that's a potential leakage
pathway people could make a mistake and
not characterize the site correctly you
could have excessive pressure build-up
if you inject it too high rate you can
actually damage the seal you can
fracture it so those things could go
wrong in terms of wells the panel on the
left here shows the distribution of
existing wells very very high density in
parts of North America so so leakage
through existing wells is a concern okay
so what would happen what are the
potential consequences this is a list in
my order this is nobody else other
people might have a different order
number one I think worker safety you
know we know from oilfield operations
that you know number one thing is people
who are workers are you know the most
exposed and so just like oilfield
operations
you know you worker safety is an issue
second groundwater quality degradation
even if co2 doesn't get into an aquifer
there is a potential for Brian migration
so not only do you need to make sure
that the seal is good to retain co2 but
you need to understand the hydrology
well enough to know that in fact you
won't have Brian salty brine moving up
and do a drinking water aquifer resource
damage thought of primarily in the
context of damage to hydrocarbon
resources you know if someone doesn't
want co2 in their gas field it gets
there they're going to be unhappy
ecosystem degradation if you have co2
leaking out you know we know it kills
vegetation kills fish so that wouldn't
be a good thing
Public Safety if you have you know some
kind of well blowout and someone's
unlucky enough to be near where that is
or if you've got
pipeline leak you know somebody could
get hurt
structural damage if you are injecting
it to higher pressure you could have
Micro seismic events you can have
inflation of the land surface even in
the absence of that and then finally
release to the atmosphere so so again I
think that you can design projects these
are manageable risks but people
shouldn't be blind to the fact that
there are these potential risks so one
of the questions the public-houses you
know well what about catastrophic
releases like Lake Niles you know this
was in in Africa there was a lake that
had a huge release of co2 about 250,000
tons of co2 was released within a very
few a short time few hours and it
created a big plume of co2 which then
flowed down a valley and killed
thousands of people it was absolutely
tragic and so we get lots of questions
well could this happen well to give a
perspective that number 250,000 tons is
a quarter of the all the injection it's
a selector for a year so the idea that
somehow you could get a release this
rapidly it's just very very difficult to
imagine the other thing is is that the
mechanism of the release was completely
different Lake Nyos is a is a stratified
Lake that means that it doesn't turn
over typically lakes you know circulate
between the surface so they can release
their gases and then it gets cold and so
that water goes down to the bottom and
so they're always well mixed but there
are certain very deep lakes crater lake
is another one that are stratified and
and what happened is there this is in a
volcanic region and there were natural
releases of co2 into the bottom of this
lake this lake then turned over maybe
because of a sub subsurface landslide or
something and once you lift up a little
bit of that water that's got co2 in it
if it's saturated all of a sudden the
co2 comes out of solution
it becomes self-enhancing and it just
like just like opening you know your
soda bottle if you shake it up and open
it then that makes a big mess so anyway
so that's the mechanism so I don't
believe that that any
kind of released scenario like that is
credible for co2 storage but but again
we need to be aware so anyway I'm taking
too long but I guess I'm going to just
sort of jump to this you know are we
ready for CCS I think in oil and gas
reservoirs absolutely you know we know
how to do this it's done today saline
aquifers we still have more to learn but
certainly we're ready for large-scale
demonstrations and in coal beds you know
I think there's a lot more science you
know that very foundation of the the
pyramid needs to be further worked on
costs basically the range for costs of
CCS is in the range of 20 to about $70
per ton of co2 for the kind of systems
you would anticipate this is based on
IPCC 2005 data there's a McKenzie just
did a new study that that sort of
verified this range for projects that
have been that are done after the
learning curve has been achieved their
range was about 39 to 58 dollars per ton
of co2 however very importantly said the
early projects are going to cost a lot
more in the range of 77 to 116 dollars
per ton avoided so so these numbers
provide good basis of comparison to
other co2 mitigation technologies
another perspective is how does it
change the cost of electricity and there
are been studies to look at this but
sort of the simple bottom line is that
electricity production costs not cost
not retail cost but production costs
will increase by something from 50 to 30
50 to a hundred percent depending upon
the technology so you know significant
cost increase Department of Energy is
doing a lot of research in this area
their longtime goal has been a 10
percent increase in cost they're likely
to change that to about 35 percent
increase in cost so which is probably
insight given innovation in
new capture approaches so anyway just to
go back to this list so you know CCS can
result in 20% of needed emissions
reductions over the next hundred years
well you know potentially yes the
technical potential for co2 capture and
storage to achieve this is probably real
in my in my opinion based on the
discussions that we've had are we going
to be in trouble if CCS doesn't sort of
pan out in terms of not being able to
meet mitigation targets particularly
when we look worldwide you know probably
and we have a lot of coal in the system
a lot of other fossil fuels in the
system seas at the very least CCS will
make all this easier all of the
components are available today we just
need to put them together in part thats
true but I don't think it's quite that
simple the capacity to to do CCS
projects isn't there today and and the
confidence in terms of investor
confidence to do these projects isn't
there today so you know it's sort of yes
and no at the same time you know 30
years of experience in oil fields yes we
do have this we know how to put co2 into
oil reservoirs I'm not at all worried
about that but for saline aquifers which
have the biggest potential we need more
large-scale demonstration projects to
show that we know how to pick good
storage sites well you know just that
just do it
you know I mean if somebody said all new
plants had to have this today you know I
think that that would be very very
difficult but we're certainly ready for
large-scale demonstration projects so
you know I think if we're building new
coal plants today we should make them
demonstration projects and so in that
sense we should just do it okay pipe co2
is extremely expensive to do I say it
compared to what you know compared to
living with the risks of climate change
no I don't think it's too expensive
compared to that if you look at the cost
of C power generation with CCS compared
to solar today it's still considerably
less expensive than that though of
course there's
huge innovation taking place in solar PV
today and solar thermal all of which is
fantastic but but I don't think you can
argue that it's simply too expensive to
do in light of the risks that we're
facing environmental risks you know
unmanageable unacceptable no I think if
you do these projects carefully that
they're manageable risks co2 will leak
back to the surface
no again not if done carefully and then
the final issue is institutional
barriers you know there's some concern
that the barriers are simply too high
and and I think this is really a big
issue that and I'd like to just sort of
wrap up with those so clearly CCS won't
be done until there are policy or other
kind you know are regulations to limit
carbon emissions you know this is not
going to be done on a voluntary basis we
need to deal with institutional
framework for long-term liability
you know my favorite approach is some
kind of trust fund that basically you
buy into so for every ton of co2 you put
underground you contribute five to ten
cents which should be enough that builds
over time and basically provides a
resource to for any needed remediation
far into the future legal framework for
putting co2 underground in pore spaces
we you know have a very arcane set of
laws about mineral rights property
rights porous base rights water rights
all of which are very complex very on a
state-by-state basis and and someone
needs to sort out who owns the poor
space particularly in saline aquifers
this has been done in Wyoming they
decided they belong to the surface owner
which is probably a good answer in my
opinion we need regulations for storage
you know basically you know how do you
select a site how do you monitor the
site what are requirements what are
performance specifications I mentioned
that you can inject it to a higher rate
well that's those are their standard
regulations that apply for oilfield kind
of projects today but we need to have
those same kind of performance
specifications for co2 storage projects
carbon trading credits
know if there would be a lot of interest
probably in doing these projects if you
could get if you could trade the credits
for that and and it will have to be
decided whether these would be eligible
and if these are eligible what are the
rules under which CCS projects are
eligible another important area is CDM
the Clean Development Mechanism it would
be possible to do some of these projects
in developing countries
if methodology for CCS could be approved
under CDM that hasn't happened yet as a
matter of fact they were rejected to two
projects were rejected or two
methodologies were rejected and then
finally public acceptance you know we're
not going to do this if people don't
want it either philosophically or if
they don't want it in their backyard and
you know this is there's an ongoing
discussion about this I think we've seen
a lot of movement from the larger
environmental groups are very supportive
of CCS they think it's very important
NRDC Environmental Defense Fund just a
couple weeks ago
Greenpeace where Wildlife Fund came out
and said we should do demonstration
projects on CCS which was actually a big
change of opinion on their part and I
think in areas where people are used to
oil and gas operations this will not
draw real concerns about public
acceptance because people are used to
the idea that you can inject things
underground I think in those areas where
it's a completely different thing I
think that people will have concerns
about you know damaging property values
and so forth so some areas will be
easier to do this than others anyway so
those are those I think are some of the
ongoing issues I was asked to sort of
wrap up with that and and I think the
institutional issues are really
important so thank you
I had two questions the first one is
regarding the separation of well using
pure oxygen has an accident in the what
if you dilute the gasified filled with
already separated co2 can you use that
in existing plants without having to go
to high temperature or newer materials
yes exactly
they call it recycle and yes that's
exactly one of the approaches that's
being considered yeah would that be the
most cost-effective approach so far that
looks very good yep okay yep I don't
know what other approaches to that have
been considered but but I know that's
one that's very of interest the second
thing is another thing that is mentioned
is the pipeline network that is required
to be billy transport this since the
order of the existing world's pipeline
infrastructure every year for the next
10 or 20 years do you see that is being
feasible with the land acquisition and
other concerns yeah you know I I think
it's people have used this analogy that
if we do see see us on a really big
scale it's going to be equal to the
volumes of fluid we deal with in the oil
and gas industry and that's true there's
no question that that's true but I don't
think we would want to replicate that
infrastructure so in an oil field for
example you might have hundreds or
thousands of wells because you put them
in because you want to get every last
little bit of oil out and and then you
have to have your whole pipeline
connected Network to deal with all these
wells similarly in gas fields I don't
think you would design a co2 storage
project that you're going to minimize
the number of wells I think you'll
design your big transmission lines to
have economies of scale so every power
plant plant wouldn't go and build their
own infrastructure they would negotiate
together and and and and and it would be
more cost-effective and help deal with
some of those issues nevertheless you
know siting pipelines is a big issue and
but but I don't think we need to think
of so many you know pipelines as we do
for the oil and gas and
Street I think also that in terms of the
distribution side you know it's a much
simpler it's a much simpler problem yes
I have two questions as well can you
explain a little bit more on IG CC sorry
on ID CC the mechanism for doing the
pre-combustion separation and then on
IGCC you showed a ten to fifteen percent
energy hit but you also said that
hydrogen is produced can that hydrogen
be used to create energy in and decrease
that the energy loss or is that already
built into the note that it's already
built in so that 10 to 15 percent is
sort of a full life cycle you know
energy assessment so so basically what
you do is you oxidize coal under
reducing conditions so you don't allow
the combustion to go to to fully combust
and so you end up stripping hydrogen's
off the coal and and then you also end
up breaking down some of the long-chain
you know organics into carbon monoxide
so so you can use both carbon monoxide
and hydrogen as a source of energy or
you can decide that you want to react do
something called a shift reaction where
you react CO with water h2o and then you
produce more hydrogen and then all the
carbon goes to carbon monoxide so yeah
and and yeah you don't you you can't get
away from the the energy penalty because
you still have to separate the co2 from
the hydrogen in the end and that's where
your energy penalty is how much are you
counting on the hydrogen if you didn't
if you didn't use that hydrogen just let
it then how much worse would oh yeah you
need the hydrogen yeah I mean the
hydrogen if the hydrogen is then what
you use for combustion so you combust
either hydrogen and oxygen or hydrogen
and carbon monoxide with either oxygen
and air so yeah so that's your energy
source so basically you're kind of
making a gas so you convert the solid
coal to a gas which you then
combusts - or run through a gas turbine
so you mostly cover Gio's sequestration
in the stock there have been some recent
technologies to let's say mix this with
lime and converted into semen I think
Cal tries to India or their efforts to
actually use this as a feedstock or
maybe at the non production so what what
what do you think are the technologies
particular solution right so the
question is is co2 reuse obviously
everyone would way prefer to do that and
the work in terms of mineral carbonation
or making cements there's a company
which you've probably met with and I
can't think of their name right now
who's working on using co2 to make
cements so I think those are great
things but if you look at the scale I
saw a fantastic statistic well
interesting statistic that if you look
at the whole chemical industry that that
the scale of the co2 compared to that if
you look at masses of co2 compared to
the mass of chemicals produced in the
chemical industry it's a scale of like a
hundred to one so so even if you know
all these feedstocks you could start
making from co2 it still is just a drop
in the bucket you know the only thing
that compares at scale is obviously
fossil fuels which which makes sense
because it's their derivative from
fossil fuels so another question how
does how do the production of CO compare
to co2 like worldwide as ratios and is
are there some sequestration techniques
as an is it big enough that it warrants
sequestration different sequestration
techniques for carbon monoxide yes you
know I I don't know the answer to that I
I don't know you know who which
industries are producing you know
they're probably using this video I
think
I didn't investigate the steel industry
yeah yeah sorry I just don't know enough
about that I was wondering what you
thought about some of the other ideas to
consume co2 like algae I mean obviously
that's not solving the net problem we
then make oil and burn it but what are
your thoughts on that yeah again you
know the idea is appealing because again
we use algae even a lot of potential
reasons for algae I think it again it's
a question of scale the the amount of
acreage you need to deal even with a you
know million tons of co2 is is huge and
I don't have that number you know off
the top of my head right now but but the
scale is absolutely gigantic
there are also water use requirements
you also have to do this in a place
that's hot and you know there also you
know challenges with maintaining the
culture so you know I think they're
they're interesting I don't think we
should be doing it's way too early to be
discouraged I think they're really
important research problems in terms of
whether they'll you know really come to
fruition as a way to deal with this
giant amount of co2 we have today I'm
kind of skeptical but in the future we
can imagine a world where we have way
less co2 but there might be snow that we
still might have some co2 and in those
cases you know if it was 10 percent of
what it is today maybe you know these
ideas really you know have a have a lot
of merit
I guess the overarching question I had
was just this perception as being
somewhat of an outsider to the CCS
community now that the process has
stalled in the last few years that it
doesn't have the momentum that people
thought it did a few years ago and I'm
wondering how true that is and and maybe
there is a lot of movement it's just
more behind the scenes and committees
and such now right yeah well I think
what you're referring to is there were a
lot of really large projects that were
announced that that have stopped and
you know there are the BP projects that
the you know df1 which was going to be
in the UK there's df2 which is sort of
in limbo actually moved probably to to
the Bakersfield area so so where there
were those and then there was FutureGen
and and yeah so I think that SaskPower
project basically they just all ended up
costing more than people we're willing
to pay I think at the end of the day and
part of that was just because this huge
escalation and capital costs that we've
seen with everything so it's not so
specific to CCS it's just concrete and
steel are very very costly so those
things happened I think that there's a
lot more quiet work that that is being
done I think people have gotten tired of
announcing projects and then you know
pulling back on them BP has you know
announced the movement of his project
from Carson to to the Bakersfield area I
think I think that's encouraging the
Australians are very aggressive with
planning for large-scale demonstrations
the the SAS power has renounced plans
for their project again scaled back so
people are being somewhat less ambitious
and I think there's you know until
there's regulatory certainty that you're
going to have to pay for carbon I think
it's not going to have such an incentive
for people to to consider these you know
multi-billion dollar projects which is
what they are you know it's a lot of
money and that's no different in Europe
where you might argue there is a little
bit more regulatory certainty even
though it's a short short-term right now
yeah I think that's true you know but
the Vattenfall project is going ahead so
so things are moving it's just not quite
as fast that certainly the community of
people is growing I think what we've
seen is a lot more interest by the
investor community a lot more interest
by the insurance community so it's sort
of a growing group of people but
certainly it would have been nice had
more of those early projects gotten off
the ground because to me the most
important thing is real projects real
data transparency and experience that
I think that's really what's needed so
we're running out of time
extra we're 20 minutes over time so one
last question all right well I have a
few questions but let's see I'll just
pick one well I mean the first one is so
there's there's two different ways of
doing IGCC one of which extracts all the
co2 from the system and one of which
extracts much with the number is like a
half of it or something right
is it correct that the one it extracts
all the co2 from the from the system
requires the same high temperature
materials or processing that the oxy
fuel appears to need if the co2 feedback
thing doesn't work I don't know yeah
sorry
I'd like to give you an answer that I'm
more a specialist on the storage side so
so I really can't tell you and I you
know the the issue is about optimization
of you know to do the shift or not do
the shift I haven't seen a lot of
publicly on that it might be that that's
being done more by companies who see
them as providing those you know
products you know the GES and the
Siemens and it seems like it's
completely politically motivated and as
a result they're just trying to match
this co2 emissions of natural gas power
plants so they do the halfway one right
yeah can I ask one more question okay so
you know I look at these cost numbers
and I can't make them work at all and I
wonder is the expectation that the
pipeline lengths have taken the co2 from
the power plants to the sequestration
fields would be like the current rail
links between the
the coal mines and the power plants the
reason I ask is because the average rail
link in the US average distance coal
gets moved to a to a power plant 628
miles right now in the US and that's
kind of actually happy to see hadn't
seen this before your Dakota to Canada
already yeah they seem to be on the
order of that size so that's nice
because it means that somebody's have
got experience with moving co2 over that
kind of distance right and actually the
people who Kinder Morgan who owns most
of the co2 fields and sells co2 to to
all the people for enhanced oil recovery
there are over 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers
of co2 pipelines in the United States
but the economic analysis typically that
have been done restrict the the pipeline
like like the McKenzie numbers they if
it was greater than 200 kilometers it
wasn't included in their analysis you
know and and I think down the line if
this is ever really done in a serious
way people will look at optimal
locations for power plants in
relationship to transmission lines
sequestration sites cool train lines to
trains to get coal to places so you know
I I don't picture ever just replicating
the current power generation system we
have today
that would be so unoptimized ah in about
two weeks by a professor that I'm sure
Sally knows well Julio Friedman from
Lawrence Livermore
I believe it's Monday the third but
we'll give you details on that so you'll
have a chance to ask follow-up questions
