Jeffrey Begum I'm from the University of
Washington computer science and
engineering department and today the
work I'm going to be presenting web
anywhere screen reader on the go this is
work in collaboration with my advisor
Richard Ladner and also Craig prints and
a Cavender Jeremy Broderick and many
others in the computer science
department and so at the University of
Washington I'm part of a group called
web insight and the goal the web insight
project is to learn about the
accessibility problems that mostly blind
people face on the web and then discover
and develop solutions for improving
access and so why find web users face a
number of challenges when they're
accessing the web and so I'm just going
to say a few commonly mentioned once
first you know images that lack
appropriate alternative text they miss
out on information contained in those
they may have to deal with complex
webpages that weren't designed for
efficient access with a screen reader
and they also may have to deal with
interfaces that were developed primarily
for use with a mouse and while all of
these are problems and all of these are
things that we in the web insight group
are working on today I'm gonna be
talking about a totally different access
problem and this all stems from the fact
that people are increasingly using the
web to access information when they're
not at their own computers so you may go
to a library and access your email you
may check the bus schedule from the gym
so you know when to run outside and get
your bus or you may when visiting a
friend check-in for your flight using
their laptop the problem with this when
it comes to screenreader users is that
to use a computer screen you by screen
reader user must have a screen reader
and that screen reader costs about a
thousand dollars
and so one want to talked about today is
a web application that we've developed
called web anywhere that enables access
to the web by just visiting a web page
and I think a while the majority of my
talk is going to be about this about
this web application screen reader I
think the general theme I'd like to get
across is that there's a lot of problems
that are inherent for accessibility in
technology associated with web 2.0
however what we tried to do it in the
web insight project is use these same
technologies to actually improve things
and so what I'd like to start with is
just some very basic background material
on how a screen reader works and what
sort of accessibility issues are
inherent in new technology that's coming
out so this is just a screenshot of the
University of Washington homepage and
I'm going to play a sound of what this
sounds like okay so I see some very
interesting expressions okay so in that
about 30 seconds we got from I hope I
don't move out of the camera here but we
got from the top of the page here along
the top portion along these links and
then down to about here and so if you're
a screen reader user this page has been
compressed into a linear form and so up
to this point you know nothing about all
this other information whereas a visual
user the user just looking at this page
gets some sort of summary we're not
really paying attention with to the
other information that's that's
displayed here and I just wanna mention
I think I'm already doing better because
last time I played the screen reader
actually in this exact auditorium I
think three doors shut simultaneously
so that's what a screen reader does and
that's what we're trying to work with
here okay and so just to reiterate so
the web 2.0 technology I think is
presentable to challenging a promise for
accessibility and some of the challenges
which I'm going to discuss here in the
next slides are dynamic changes so how
do you convey dynamic changes made to a
webpage to something where the context
is very limited to what it's reading at
that at a given moment also many
interfaces are actually inaccessible
using a screen reader like I mentioned
before with the mouse but web 2.0 can
improve accessibility by helping us to
understand accessibility and helping us
to overcome accessibility challenges and
that's what I'm really going to talk
about our group doing today so here is
Gmail you're probably familiar with this
this is an email that I got about a book
I have due to the UW library if I'm
looking with this if I'm reading this
with a screen reader and assuming you
somehow I got to the the main part of
the message you know maybe it looks
something more like this where all I see
you know in my current context is the
material listed will be due soon overdue
well what I didn't really what I didn't
realize is that while I was real
istening to that I got a chat message in
this case from myself my best friend and
the reason I didn't realize that is
because the screen reader has a limited
context and it can't
alert me automatically anyway that
something has changed in the page and so
you might say oh well just what the
solution to this is it's just alert
somebody when something's changed in the
page and so I want to bring up another
example this is Google Finance which I
really like this page it has all of
these fun numbers and it updates almost
constantly so you can get the almost
up-to-date view of all these this
financial information but if we do the
same thing so you know maybe my context
here is this this is what what's being
spoken to me at the given moment then it
turns out that pretty much the whole
rest of the page has changed while I was
listening to that you wouldn't want to
be want to be alerted to all of these
different things
changing at the same time so if I go
back you can kind of see something's
changed okay and then as a final example
this is a storefront for wolf camera and
this is an online retailer of all sorts
of different electronic devices
including cameras so say I'm interested
in Xbox 360 games i can choose
electronics go down to video game go
down to xbox and go down to xbox 360
games you may argue whether or not this
is really a great interface for this but
the point here is that all of these
things are only accessible if you use
the mouse so the only way this this
drop-down menu works is by clicking on
each one of these individual item items
and so if you're using a screen reader
you're unlikely to be using a mouse and
so this interface is actually unlikely
to be accessible to you and so instead
you're presented with by the screen
reader something that looks more like
this and so you know I wouldn't want to
have to go through these 30 or 40 links
to find what I want and not to mention
the you know 300 or something that are
actually contained of that menu and so
this is just one more example of
inefficient access that you may have to
put up with if you're using a screen
reader okay so that was kind of a
whirlwind tour of some of the problems
that a web 2.0 can present to screen
reader users and now I'm going to show
the first example of how we can use that
same technology to get a better first a
better sense of what the problems are
and so this I'm going to present a blind
and sighted browsing comparison and then
I'll go on to talking about what the
media talk is and that is the web
anywhere on screen reader on the go on
the go okay so we conducted a study
which we call it web Institute and we
called it that the Institute part
basically means we've reserved observing
our participants in their natural
environment and their natural
environment here means using their own
equipment their own assistive technology
browsers screen readers etc what we were
really interested in was observing
excessive accessibility from the user
perspective and so in this case that's
really important as you can see from our
graph over here this is domain
popularity of the
that were visited by our participants in
this study this is over a period of a
week they viewed about 21,000 different
webpages and what's interesting here is
that you know Google tops the list at
somewhere around I think around 4,000 or
so of the pages that people visited and
what's important about this from
accessibility standpoint is that this
means that Google all of a sudden means
a lot more your a lot of the
accessibility that you experience on the
web is actually dependent a lot more on
Google than on some of these other sites
and if you take the top three which just
happened to be Google MSN and Yahoo that
they share about one third of all the
visits from our our user group which
means that really their ex pon scible
for one third of the accessibility that
you actually experience on the web and
so that's why we really we really wanted
to view this from the user perspective
and why we treated all pages equally
that our visitors our participants
viewed and so to enable that we used a
proxy based system that users it was
based on a product by Richard adder a
tall called user proxy and the idea what
this system is users connect to a web
proxy and when pages are retrieved
through that web proxy JavaScript is
added to the page that allows us to
observe actions and things that you
couldn't observe with a usual web proxy
and so this might sound similar to say
Google Analytics which but in this case
we don't have access to the actual pages
themselves from the start and so we use
the proxy to insert the JavaScript as
opposed to just inserting it ourselves
okay so some of the observations we had
in terms of efficiency it's it's pretty
well understood that it's less efficient
to access the web using a screen reader
one of the things we found overall blind
users spent about twice as long per page
as compared to their sound excited
counterparts we were able to isolate
several specific tasks that all of our
users did and one of those was
surprisingly or not surprisingly
searching Google and so we have two sub
tasks and
the one is arriving at the Google
homepage issuing are entering a query
and then hitting the submit button or
hitting Enter enter and we found that
for that sub task blind users actually
took about twice as long as their
sighted counterparts to do this for the
second on Google was once the results
page came up to actually find a result
and click on it our sighted our blind
users took about five times longer than
our site their sighted counterparts to
find the result that they are interested
in and click on it so it just gives you
an some sort of some sense of the
efficiency difference in blind versus
sighted web browsing we were also
interested to see what kind of effects
the accessibility of the pages
themselves had on what our participants
did and so images being one of the
standard examples of inaccessibility
they so we're really interested in
images that lacked alternative text and
we found that images that lack the
appropriate alternative text that is
alternative text that appropriately
described what the image was about we're
three times less likely to be clicked on
by our blind participants as compared to
our sighted participants and so now the
accessibility of the page is really
influencing behavior as opposed to just
making it harder or less efficient for
users to browse the web
we also found we were just in
in terms of web 2.0 style technology
we're interested in dynamic updates to
the page and so we looked at dynamic
changes to the page and for our
definition what we meant was any content
that was added to the page with
scripting after the page had loaded and
so we looked at how many times are
various our two user groups blind and
sighted interacted with this content and
so we found that our blind users
interacted with twenty times fewer of
these things that were they were added
to the page after the page has loaded
then our site than their sighted
counterparts so again they're not either
able to see that this stuff has had
happened or they're just avoiding it
our site are blind users visits visited
seven times fewer pages that used ajax
technology so again they're voiding
technology or pages that use this
technology which isn't necessarily
inaccessible but definitely indicates
that it could be a page isn't
inaccessible and surprisingly though we
observe no difference with how many of
the pages that are users visited that
contained Flash content and so we're
kind of surprised by that so we looked a
little deeper we found that about half
of the Flash content that they viewed
was happen to be ads and so probably
didn't really matter that to them should
didn't really affect the experience and
many of them actually played sound which
can you know be just as easily
experienced with the screen reader and
without and a few of the flash a few of
the Flash content objects were actually
vital most of them just were
supplementary to the main content of the
page or they provides like visual
effects things like that so again
whirlwind tour of web 2.0 and some of
its effects on accessibility and so now
I'd like to get to the main part of this
talk which is the screen reader on the
go and I'm gonna start by motivating why
we need a web application that works as
a screen reader okay so what i'm going
back to web 2.0 so the advantages of web
2.0 application a web 2.0 applications
are many first ubiquitous access greg
was talking at lunch how he was
traveling a few months ago and it was
great to have Gmail because no matter
where he was as long as there was a
computer with internet access Gmail was
there and so this is the same with many
of these applications I have here
screenshots of Gmail I also also have
one of Google Documents and so well I
don't think many would argue that these
at web applications provide the same
level of user experience as say like
Microsoft Office or some of these other
traditional alternatives they're very
valuable and I use them myself just
because I can access them from anywhere
in any computer that I happen to be at
and you know they're great for the
developers too because they have this
lightweight client UI and this the more
heavy-duty server-side components to
make it easier to release an update in
this the development cycle becomes a lot
faster and so the problem here is that
blind users may miss out first of all
there's the accessibility problems that
I talked about I just talked about but
then there's also the problem that to
use these web applications you need a
thousand-dollar screen reader to be
installed on any computer that you're
going to visit and so that's probably
not true with the various places that
you can access the web when you're
traveling or when you're going about
town and so who are these these blind
computer users and while they're
actually a sizable population and so
there's about 10 million visually
impaired people in the United States
about 1.3 million blind people in the
United States and if you're wondering
what these particular pictures are this
is from an event that we went to about
two weeks ago and about half the people
in the front row and myself and this was
event we were where we were teaching
blind high schoolers to program
computers and so I think I think it
helps to put a really personal
perspective on who who this really
affects this accessibility really
affects and it's ER it definitely taught
us a lot about how screen readers are
used and the types of things that people
want to be able to do and one of those
things that people want to be able to do
is say this benetech and Bookshare
website so this is a great service it
provides free access to about 34,000
books it's anyone who they call is print
disabled and that means that anyone who
has trouble reading a traditionally
printed book the problem with this
website is that again it requires this
thousand-dollar screen reader to access
all of this free content because while
this is on the web the screen reader
itself is quite costly and definitely
not free like like these books are
and so some other things you might do
just to drive this point home
I'm sure this being Google you've
probably thought of many more but you
can check the email check your email to
Jim make restaurant reservations check
when your bus is coming maybe settle an
argument with a friend or see who won
the game and many many many more and
where can you do this well you can do it
at the public library a lot of them have
public terminals you can do it an
internet cafes which are exist in pretty
much all major cities at the airports
often have they have often have public
terminals or you can do it from a
friend's laptop and so while there are
many options if you're trying to access
these many options as a screen reader
user you really have to consider it
slightly different you have to have a
you have to find a public terminal with
a screen reader you maybe you could use
a smartphone but again it needs a screen
reader maybe a PDA with some sort of
access screen reader refreshable Braille
display and maybe for the phones so I
know people here are working on Google
for one one and that's another way of
limited access to the web there's many
so there's many trade-offs with these
various options that I'm going to
explore in the next couple slides some
that come immediately to mind are cost
availability and then the functionality
of the device that you're using and so
to put all this in perspective I went on
delcom yesterday and I looked to see
what kind of computer I could buy for
the least amount of money and so I went
through the whole process here and I
found that I could actually get a
computer for about $350 this is without
a monitor so maybe you add a cheap CRT
monitor for like 25 bucks 50 bucks you
get up to about 375 $400 and I like to
point out this lap this computer while
it is the cheapest that Dell offers new
it's actually much more powerful than
this laptop that I use every day and and
presenting with right now
and so to explore this further I'd like
to place some of the various
alternatives to a traditional screen
reader or for screen reading on this on
these two axes and so basically there's
the XS axis here is from low cost to
high cost and the y axis is low
availability to high availability so the
first thing we have here is just our
traditional screen readers which are
about a thousand dollars and so they
have low availability because they're
unlikely to be installed on most
machines you come across and the
licenses prevent you from installing
them on multiple computers they have
fairly high cost with $1000 and so they
get placed down there in the lower-right
system access mobile is a screen reader
on a USB key and so what this USB key
basically has is a executable that you
can then plug you can plug this key into
a computer you come across run that
executable and then you have a limited
screen reader that can allow you to do
most things including surf the web and
so that costs 400 dollars and so that
gets a little bit more highly available
it doesn't get maximally highly
available because is if you think about
it it's not it doesn't seem likely that
most public terminals are gonna allow
you to run arbitrary executables on
there on the machines but if you go to a
friend's laptop or something like that
you can probably use this USB key and so
again it's it's not the cheapest thing
at 400 dollars but it's not it's not
that bad of an option so a smartphone
with mobile speak pocket this is pretty
pricey at about five or six hundred
dollars for the phone itself and then
another five or six hundred dollars for
the mobile seat pocket which is
basically a version of a screen reader
that runs on smartphones like this and
so I'll put that very highly available
and slightly more more costly and it's
it's important to note that it's
unlikely that someone would use just the
smartphone or just the system access
mobile they're probably buying this on
top of the initial thousand-dollar
screen reader that goes on their primary
computer and so another option that a
lot of people
have is a braille notetaker which has a
professional Braille display along the
bottom and that is basically acts as a
laptop or a PDA and also has this
Braille output and it can also double as
an input device for your primary
computer again very high cost and it has
fairly good availability though because
it can access wireless systems and and
the thing that I'm purposely leaving out
of this of course is you could have a
laptop yourself
I personally don't carry my laptop
everywhere I go and I'd be afraid to I
think I have broken this thing more
times than I like to count but the idea
is more that you want to access the
computers that are available to
everybody else okay and then as a final
as a final alternative here I have
Firefox which is a Firefox extension
that acts as a screen reader just for
Firefox and I put that at kind of lower
availability although very low cost and
the reason for that is that first of all
you have to have Firefox you have to be
have permission to install things on the
machine although perhaps less permission
than you would have to to run an
arbitrary executable and this would
allow you again to browse the web using
a screen reader and so what we really
want and what you've probably guessed
that I'm setting up here is something
that goes up in that upper left-hand
corner which is high availability and
low cost and so that's what we're hoping
that this webanywhere project that we've
created can fit somewhere up there where
it's almost free because it's a web
application and it's highly available
from any machine that has a web browser
and from anywhere that has internet
access and of course there's some other
free alternatives that have slightly
different functionality so the National
Association of the blind in India
actually have their site completely
accessible without a screen reader based
on a flash object and so you can
navigate their entire site using this
flash object even if you didn't have a
screen reader of course it only works on
their site
but at least that gives people the
option to access their site without a
screen reader and then goog-411
obviously a very different type style
but it's still kind of the idea of
accessing the web from anywhere and this
in this case just using any cell phone
that you happen to have and the
information is limited to what is
provided but still some still along
these lines you could imagine I
implemented something like a screen
reader in in a phone like that okay and
so what are the barriers to ubiquitous
access well screen readers require on
each machine screeners are expensive and
mobile devices are even more expensive
so the important question to ask then is
why are screen readers so expensive we
just showed that they are actually much
more expensive than say an entire
computer with Windows loaded on it and
the reason is basically there's a small
market and these applications need to be
incredibly complex to deal with the
diversity of applications that exist
there's not a single API there's not a
single way that text is represented on
the screen or that interaction is
actually written by programmers and so
they have to go in and figure out how
all of these things work and basically
shoehorn them into something that fits
with the screen readers model of how
things should work and so all that
effort combined with the low market is
what leads to these screen readers being
so expensive and so that expense means
that before I talked about the us blind
population and now I'm going to talk
about the world blind population which
is about 20 million strong and so the
vast majority can't afford screen
readers in fact less than 1% of blind
people throughout the world actually
have a screen reader I'm just an
interesting fact one out of three blind
people actually live in India and I've
been told that they estimate the
National Association of blind in India
estimates that only between 1,000 to
2,000 people in India actually have a
screen reader like jaws or window eyes
installed in the machine and many of
these if not most of these are actually
cracked versions
and so we really want to solve this
fundamental problem there's so much
information so much benefit to accessing
the web you know we need to do something
about this difference in price $375 new
computer and a thousand dollar screen
reader it just doesn't work out for it
the economics just don't work out even
the United States let alone countries
where these things might not be as
available anyway okay so what we wanted
to create with all this background was a
screen reading web application and
there's a lot of benefits to doing this
that make it easier than creating these
screen readers the general-purpose
screen readers that I mentioned before
first is you really only have one API to
support so ignoring problems with
getting it to work on the three or four
major web browsers really all you have
to do is if it is create something that
can interpret and deal with the Dom of a
web page and once you've done that then
you've already created most of what you
need to access the web from a web
application what's great about is it's
for affordable it's almost free and it
can be accessible from you know any
operating system browser and anywhere
that a computer can play sound and more
than just one group benefits the first
blind users on the go as we talked about
the second blind users who are unable
otherwise unable to afford a screen
reader and third web developers who
don't want to pay a thousand dollars for
a screen reader but yet want the ability
to check their web pages for
accessibility with a screen reader which
but has been shown to be one of the most
effective ways it's actually ensure that
your web page is accessible so now I'm
gonna actually talk after all of that
introduction I'm going to talk about the
actual thing that we created which is
web anywhere so web anywhere web
application where the interface is local
it's created in JavaScript speech is
created remotely and then played back
locally and that's a summary of the
system so I have a screen shot here I'm
going to do what you should never do and
that is give a demo live to an audience
okay so I squid if i switch to firefox
here i'm gonna reload this so everything
might work okay so what I did here I
loaded the web application the web
anywhere web application and it started
speaking to you and what it did is it
basically it's just telling a first-time
user or anyone who's forgotten the
instructions for using the system and
what's great is without using the mouse
I can I can go to the location bar here
it's basically like a little mini
browser inside the larger browser and so
I can type any URL that I want to now
visit so say I want to go to Google you
know as I type it it's actually playing
the letters that I type and all of this
again remember that all this speech is
actually being generated remotely on a
server at the University of Washington
and brought back here and so I typed
that so now I know what I've typing I
can also review what I've what I've
typed and make sure I typed it correctly
so I go to google.com buy anything
so yeah it's it's it's actually if you
click this more button there's a lot of
links down there and so even though
they're invisible to the visual a visual
browser it's it still picks them up and
so the thing that you might be surprised
about is that Google and the screen
reader here
because this is a web application this
top frame this top frame is actually
located at on a server at from the
University of Washington whereas Google
comm here appears to be located on
google.com and so they shouldn't be able
to talk to each other so the JavaScript
on the top frame shouldn't be able to
talk to the the lower google.com frame
and so what we've done is just made it
appear to the browser that google.com
has has been retrieved from our server
as opposed the same server as the top
frame as opposed to google.com itself
and so these this brings up some
interesting security issues with
cross-site scripting and such that all
I'll dress in a bit I just wanted to
head that off in case anyone was was
wondering about that all right and so so
the screen reader provides much of the
functionality that a normal screen
reader provides so I can tab around and
it'll it'll keep track
I can also jump forward so because we've
been reduced to this linear interface or
linear view of the web one of the major
things that screen readers provide for
web browsing is the ability to skip
forward in content and so if I if I hit
a control key I can jump right to the
first form element and said Google
search I can now type in my so I'll look
for web insight which is our project
name and so I can find a submit button
and then I can search
so it'll proceed reading this page I can
also because Google implements or adds
headings to the search results I can
actually skip ahead and go to the result
that I obviously want which is our our
page and I can load that and it'll read
that so basically it's just performing
the normal functions of a screen reader
a screen reader but it's all based
entirely on the web and so you can
access this from any computer that you
you happen to be visiting and so you
know I can choose to go somewhere else
it works pretty well so this is this has
a lot of links have you heard 367 and
there's no headings
I'm sure there's ways to skip around
with a normal screen reader although and
I can skip around with the tab key so
this is all actually running from my
cache - oh I'll warn you I didn't want
to risk a live totally life thing but
you know so so I hope you're convinced
that you know it actually works you can
actually from a web application of web
page that you visited you can get all
the speech all the screen reading
functionality you need to browse most
web pages okay so return to my my slides
here
okay and so like as I as I kind of
explained as I was going along there's
just webanywhere frame this is where the
all the JavaScript all the sound players
and all that stuff live and then there's
this content frame which actually loads
the content that the scripts in the top
frame read to the user if you go to a
new page I'm it looks like I'm at Google
comm but actually it's at this
complicated thing that looks like that
makes the browser think it's at the same
address as the top frame okay so the
architecture looks something like this
on the server side we have a reverse
proxy which does that thing that makes
it look like Google comm is actually
existing on our server and that's just
with the Apache web server configured as
a reverse proxy the page gets sent off
to the client side where the web aney
where script is able to see it interact
with the transform page decide what
sounds it wants the the what sounds it
needs to play to represent the page and
the interaction and then it sends those
requests back to the server where the
text-to-speech is performed and then it
comes back to the client side where the
embedded either embedded sound player or
flash player actually plays those sounds
so the speech is generated using the
freeware festival text-to-speech program
and it's then encoded into mp3 using a
lame encoder we keep a cache of speech
sounds obviously think some things get
repeated a lot like link web in site
that gets repeated a lot in my browsing
history engine just in general things
like link title image things like that
that are part of the interaction get
repeated a lot and then people tend to
visit the same pages and so by having a
cache we can improve performance
playback is either the flash via this
flash object called sound manager -
which is really just a JavaScript
wrapper around a flash object that plays
sounds and then we've done some
prototype systems with embedded system
our embedded players that use like
QuickTime or the Windows Media Player to
play sounds
and also we have a Java sound sound
player the sound the length of the sound
if you think about as I'm reading along
this page I could choose to send either
I could sent I could choose to produce
sounds for a variety of lengths of the
webpage so one approach you might think
would be the simplest was would be to
send the entire webpage off and produce
what the sound would be for that entire
webpage and then back on the client side
just choose where in that sound file to
start playing based on what the user has
done it turns out that it's the better
balance for latency and also the natural
sounding Nisour the speech I know didn't
sound that natural but it could be a lot
worse if we generate them for logical
sections of the text and so in this case
each dom node at a certain level gets a
sound generated for it and so there's
some examples there at the bottom and so
most sounds end up being about 2 to 5
seconds long and about less than 10 10k
and so the examples here so if we have a
heading h1 web insight we send the
string heading 1 web insight and the
analogous things for the images and
anchor examples there and so because the
speech is generated on a remote server
one of the major concerns here is the
latency of determining what to send and
then sending it and getting our response
back and that does end up being the
major concern for latency for the system
and so what we what we've been
experimenting with is to use prefetching
of Dom elements that we think are likely
to occur next in the the users browsing
and send those off to the server ahead
of time and so while the user is
listening to a certain sound that is
previously retrieved we can be fetching
a new one and so we just use Ajax
requests to essentially prime the cache
and currently we're just doing this in a
very simple way with a DFS search of the
Dom tree or DFS order of the Dom
elements we're sending those off in that
order to the server for prefetching and
we found that even a simple approach
works pretty well initially the latency
is about 20 milliseconds to 880 or 800
milliseconds 200 milliseconds to 800
milliseconds on average and that
prefetching actually improves us by
about 20 percent there's obviously some
opportunity for smarter prefetching so
if you know that the users gonna be
tabbing around a lot or if they have
been doing that in the past then you
might actually instead of DFS order
through the Dom you might want to fetch
things in tab order or some other order
that you've determined okay and so
there's a number of remaining issues
though my demo actually went off pretty
well and so I'm happy about that but
there are some remaining issues the
first is losing focus because this is a
web application the only thing that
speaks is that web application and so
and the only thing that can gather input
is that web application and so if a
pop-up happens and it removes focus from
the web at the web anywhere web
application then all of a sudden you
can't produce speech you can't gather
the keyboard input of the user and so we
aggressively block pop-ups we also
aggressively block the redirection of
web pages away from our reverse proxy
which would cause errors in the
JavaScript in terms of like basically
cross-site scripting errors we also
restrict the keyboard it's not just
possible so that control keys that would
remove focus from the web browser are
caught and suppressed and the problem is
we can't control all keys so the
operating system doesn't like it when
you try to capture you know alt tab or
Control Alt Delete things like that and
yeah and there's still all the security
concern of avoiding of how avoiding
cross-site scripting isn't always good
and so then from the user perspective
there's a remaining issue of how you
actually get to web anywhere in the
first place because to use the system
you actually have to get to that web
page and so some I think reasonable
proposals are you know maybe if you're a
library maybe there's a
librarian she looks pretty friendly
although that's just a random picture
from Google Images I think she would
help you and there's some built-in OS
functionality even you know XP has some
limited screen reading functionality and
these stuffs even better and the Mac has
some reasonable screen reading
functionality that would allow you to
get to a webpage you probably wouldn't
want to use it to actually browse the
web or to use another application but it
all you have to do is get there so to
help you bootstrap into the system and
then you can just get help from others
pretty much anywhere there's a public
terminal there's probably somebody there
that if nothing else wants to take your
money for use of that public terminal
and so you probably get them to help you
we did a preliminary user study we had
three blind youth web users one female
and two remotely located and a fun part
about two of them being remotely located
was that if you've ever tried to use
tried to test a prototype screen reading
system with someone who is already using
a screen reader it's very confusing
because there's a lot of things talking
at the same time and so the task we it's
a very simple task we had them all do a
google search and some unstructured web
browsing they were all able to do these
tasks just fine they occasionally lost
focus that's the problem with the
pop-ups that occasionally happened with
during the unstructured browsing but
they were all able to get back with some
minimal coaching just reminding them to
you know hit alt tab until they got back
to the browser window and it and to help
control that the web ania where system
actually if it loses focus and then
gains it again it'll announce itself the
next time that it gains focused so you
know oh i all tabbed you know and it's
back okay and so the comments were were
interesting first of all we had no
feedback about latency being bad so we
were really concerned that because
speech is being generated remotely that
latency would be a major concern and
they didn't actually experience that and
I think that's because in general the
latency is actually really low
connections are pretty fast and the
sound fires are very small most of them
were actually really excited and what
they really wanted was just more
features they
wanted to act more like their desktop
screen reader and obviously you know you
haven't put everything all the features
that the desktop screen reader has in it
in there yet although there's no that's
really an engineering problem it's not a
there's no reason we can't do that
and they wanted they also wanted the
ability to customize to their
preferences so some of them used jaw the
jaws screen reader some of them use the
window eye screen reader and they wanted
the keyboard commands to be the same
with the system as with the ones that
used to okay and in terms of future work
really you know we want to follow our
users feedback we want to implement more
features we want to make it more robust
improve protections against losing focus
and then with secure sites we want to
enable access to secure sites and we
want to at least maintain the browser
protections we have some ideas about how
to do that and we're hoping that hoping
that that those will work out and then
once that's done we want to really want
to release this and get it out get it
out there so people can use it so in
conclusion the screen reader users are
limited by cost and availability of
assistive technology web 2.0 provides
this challenge in both opportunity and
one of the things that we think can be
an opportunity is this Web anywhere
screen reader which provides a screen
reading web application is a low cost
alternative to screen readers for both
the blind users on the go and also
people that may not be able to otherwise
in for forward a screen reader okay and
so with that I'm done and I invite you
to visit our website and talk to me and
ask questions and all that good stuff
yeah
during the fact that your every
everything is now anything so the one
thing that we could do I mean I thought
about this a little bit I think that if
you could actually embed the embed the
the screen reading script into the page
itself as it came through and maintained
the same and Spacek aliy fool the
browser into thinking that they are
separate domains then that would provide
some of that protection how exactly that
works from the engineering side I'm not
I haven't quite figured that out yet but
I think that's really what you'd have to
end up doing
it's not quite yet available for anyone
to use there's a couple of reasons for
that
the one is basically if if we release
that it's an open proxy out into the
world so we have to do something about
that probably not maybe Google would but
no that's that's the major reason so the
first thing we need to do is somehow
restrict this the flow of traffic
through and then also there's some you
know we'd like to improve it a little
bit before before users users try it out
you can package it up and
yeah that sound mean I would love to
have the opportunity to you know
actually yeah try it out in a limited
environment like that before releasing
it off to the world all right right so
yeah we talked we should talk about that
anything else
all right well thanks everyone for
