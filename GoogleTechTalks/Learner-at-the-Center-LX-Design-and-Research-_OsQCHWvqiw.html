merits everyone um Lisa is a former
educator current parent and current
practice and research manager at Pearson
and she works within the research
innovation network last year she brought
a participatory design method question
according the same one we use here at
Google to Pearson and she's established
a couple of different co design students
with children and today for this talk
Lisa will focus on the intersection of
usability instructional and
participatory design and Pearson's
digital learning solutions alright so at
Pearson we are always learning as the
world's largest learning company and it
just so happens that a couple of weeks
ago a fun fact about Google crossed my
email because we have those little fun
facts of the week and it was on the
origin of the name Google so partially a
typo right so that got me thinking what
if autocorrect had been on right and
that typo was not allowed to happen I
have kind of a love-hate relationship
with autocorrect myself you're typing a
text your husband honey can you please
pick up the kidneys I'm going to be
lamer than usual so yes this one alright
so yes the typo is interesting to me so
we'll go ahead and get started and I
want to start with this and this is from
back in the 50s does anyone know what
this is
any guesses inbreeding trainer
good guess
I have candy that's was asking me if
this is left over from Halloween it is
not it was purchased for this purpose
there is nothing in the skin okay you
get you get one for trying 100 grand so
this is the program teaching machines
these were BF Skinner's from back in the
50s and these were supposed to
revolutionize education and although
we've seen rapid increases in computer
installations and internet access around
the world in the country whether
computers look like this or look like
this we know from looking at a variety
of resources that the use of computers
does not automatically guarantee
increased learning outcomes and we know
that if we look at different
implementation models whether it's a one
to one implementation or some type of
other blended learning online learning
that some studies of computer usage will
show increased learning outcomes some
will show no increases and others will
show worse learning outcomes but why is
that well for years there's been a lot
of hype around the potential for
educational technology to completely
transform teaching and learning right
and we know from looking a lot of
classrooms around the country that this
potential has not fully been realized
and it's left many people thinking that
classrooms that computer use in the
classrooms has been oversold and
underused
but it's not quite as black and white
right we need to remember obviously that
computers are one tool only useful and
used well and especially in the case of
digital learning solutions designed well
so we can look at a model we can look at
Michael Pollan from stratosphere who
inspires us to look at digital learning
experiences and the fact that they
should be elegantly efficient and easy
to use promote deep learning and then
also ears a sibling engaging and it
Pearson the learners at the center of
all we do okay and so at the center of
providing that experience for the
learner is learner experience design or
the LX design which you guys likely saw
in the title of this talk and over the
years there's been a change in kind of
the lexicon to describe some of the key
roles involved in bringing digital
learning solutions to lek and one of
those has been
notion of LX so it's emerged between
usability and instructional design so
we're going to kind of double click into
that learner experience design and tease
that out a little bit so any
conversation around elegant efficiency
and ease of use needs to involve
usability obviously so you'll have our
standard ISO definition here looking at
effectiveness efficiency and
satisfaction and we have usability
activities that are inner woven
throughout a product development
lifecycle and so everything from initial
interviews that we might have with users
to uncover their mental model of sona's
card sorting all of these different
types of usability activities so that's
kind of one component of that LX design
and then we have an instructional design
and when we talk about instructional
design we're talking about a systematic
process for the design of instruction
and regardless of whether that
instructional design model is the
traditional a de analysis design
implementation evaluation or it's an
instructional design process to support
more agile types of environments it's
going to involve these types of
components around analysis the design
and development and evaluation and
implementation and so when we talk about
instructional design usually starting
with some type of needs assessment in
which we're looking at the environment
emerging technologies developing some
type of instructional intervention and
then implementing and evaluating that
and so how do we get a irresistible
engagement component well four years at
Pearson we've been conducting research
with kids mainly in the form of
usability testing and I really like this
graphic that comes from dr. Alice
Sanders out of Ohio State University and
make tools where she kind of puts it on
this continuum of seeing yourself as an
expert and engaging with kids as
research subjects to test what you've
already built versus the participatory
mindset which is when we're seeing the
users more as our design partners and so
we have moved along this continuum from
expert to participatory mindset over the
years and of course when we talk about
participatory design we're talking about
exploring needs with kids and with other
users were iteratively ID aiding with
them and then a value
meeting what we create and making it
better and so as Beth had mentioned we
actually work directly with dr. Alison
drouin and the University of Maryland
human-computer interaction laboratory to
implement cooperative inquiry at Pearson
we've been doing this for about a year
and a half now we started with one team
where I'm office which is in Chandler
Arizona and we just started another team
out in the hoboken which is close to the
New York City area so we've got these
two Co design teams our kids range in
ages from fourth through eighth grade
they're in our office every week working
alongside us and you can see here
they're doing a bag of these bags of
stuff type activity and so at the core
of this learner experience design is the
learning Sciences right and when we talk
about the learning Sciences we're
talking about the interdisciplinary
field that studies teaching and learning
and so there's a number of concepts and
principles that we've learned from that
work everything around some different
topics and metacognition getting
learners to think about the process of
thinking about their learning the role
of prior knowledge learning progressions
we're going to get into some of these
today but this definitely has a role in
what we're creating as well mmm and as
you can imagine there this takes the
number of roles involved to bring these
learning solutions to life and so I sit
within Pearson's research and innovation
network that is a rd organization for
our k-12 development and each of these
icons actually represents a different
topic in education so there's everything
from educator learning and effectiveness
to data analytics to where I sit which
is product design research and efficacy
and so my team is conducting iterative
product research during the product
development lifecycle and collecting
evidence of efficacy and when we talk
about efficacy it goes beyond just
effectiveness and efficiency Pearson's
definition of efficacy is making a
measurable impact on someone's life
through learning and so this term might
sound familiar from the pharmaceutical
industry I've actually taken this and
apply this to the education sector to
take a stand and say the same level of
Rugal rigor can be applied in education
sector and we've publicly shared this
efficacy
and we are going to be doing reporting
in the 2018 timeframe and I think what's
really important to remember about this
from the learner perspective given that
the learners at the center is the
concept that's being conveyed here is
that from a learner's perspective this
efficacy recording will be able to
answer what are the outcomes that this
product is promising what is the
evidence that we know that they can be
achieved and how will this change my
life so that's from the learners
perspective who's using our products but
what needs to be in place long before
we're doing these randomized control
trials right long before were using
random assignment assigning one group to
treatment one to the control and looking
at the the effectiveness or the efficacy
of this product there's a lot of things
there's this review that's happening and
looking at that body of research and
learning Sciences there is identifying
measurable outcomes and in making a plan
for achieving or for collecting evidence
of those and then there's this whole
body of iterative product research and
so this process usability across this
instructional design participatory
design and all of those things that take
place before the randomized control
trial and it's from that body of
iterative product research that we're
seeing these heuristics start to emerge
so kind of broad rules of thumb around
learning and interaction design and
these are aptly named heuristics given
that these are not all been tested at
the individual level but they contribute
to the overall efficacy of a solution
and they've been reformed by a variety
of domains and resources starting with a
Nielsen Norman usability heuristics and
kind of building on from those
incorporating in some instructional
design principles learning sciences and
such so we're going to look at a few of
these today okay in the context of three
different learners we've got
seven-year-old Leila we've got
nine-year-old Frankie and higher ed
student Kim so we'll start with
seven-year-old Leila so Leila has been
diagnosed with hyperactivity with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and her treatment has actually included
working memory training so you might be
thinking what's working memory I know
maybe possibly the role of that less
do a quick little primer on working
memory so this is the fundamental brain
function that underlies most of our
conscious mental work it's what enables
you to understand what you're reading as
you're reading it and for a child let's
say who's working on math it's kind of
that brain space for solving math
problems so if you think about a child
who's adding 1 + 2 to get to 3 they have
to hold the numbers 1 &amp;amp; 2 in mind before
applying the operation of addition to
get there right okay I'm seeing some
nods yes we got we know it is alright
let's test your working memory now
you're ready for a working memory
challenge I'm gonna flash some numbers
on screen I want you to hold them in
your working memory and then when I say
you're gonna repeat them back to me in
reverse order and if you want to jot
them down or type them or just call them
right back out to me but at first I'll
show you the numbers don't write them
down as I'm showing them to you hold
them in mind and then you'll repeat them
back in reverse order got it okay here
we go
you
okay anyone want to call out repeat them
back in verse order or eight nine two
three six four nine eight
anyone else hey here's your check it was
two three six four nine eight and I
think the takeaway here is we have
limited working memory right and so what
that activity that I just had you do was
actually from a program called cogman
and I'm going to talk to you a little
bit about cogmed and some of the
heuristics in cognate so there are
actually three versions of cognate and
as online training program for working
on increasing the working memory
so there's jayam for preschoolers
there's RM for school-age and QM for
adults we're gonna focus on school age
for Leila here okay and this program was
developed more for clinical type
settings and it's been translated we're
translating into school kind of setting
as well and so for Leila one
implementation model is that she worked
with cogmed for 30 to 45 minutes a day
for five days a week for five weeks and
she saw increases in her working memory
capacity which led to you know being
able to resist distractions and kind of
be able to focus so we're gonna tease
apart cogmed and kind of look at it in
layers we're gonna look at the learning
sciences layer and then we'll look at
the learner experience layer so within
the learning sciences layer of cogmed
there are some certain principles we're
going to talk about each of these a
little bit so there's this concept of
neuroplasticity which I'm sure is
familiar to many of you back that the
brain is plastic malleable as it applies
to working memory
the main creator researcher behind this
so dr. torkoal Klingberg out of the
Institute of Karolinska install did the
initial research to show that you could
actually increase your working memory
through this rigorous training so that's
that idea of neuroplasticity coming to
life in the form of working memory then
we've got adaptive learning so cogmed
actually will adapt in real-time to the
progress of the learner as they're
moving through it and this is especially
important for cognate given that that
initial research shows an extremely high
of rigor and challenge needs to be
placed upon a learner in order to see
these games so that adaptive learning
piece is critical and then the four
transfer learning refers to the fact
that by training this tightly defined
cognitive function and increasing the
working memory capacity we actually see
those changes translated to behavior
changes in behavior being able to resist
the distractions and focus and for a
child in school you know being able to
do the addition and the things that we
were talking about so then we can look
at the other layer of this and that's
the learner experience right this merge
between the usability as well as the
instructional design so we're gonna look
at a few heuristics in this area but
first we're gonna look at Stan and Stan
is featured in cogman RM along with a
number of working memory challenges one
like the one I asked you guys to do so
that's this this is input module where
the learner here's a series of numbers
and then inputs them back into the
module in reverse order like you guys
did there's also data room in this one
the learner actually observes a series
of illuminations and then inputs them
back in and then asteroids similar
except the asteroids are moving they
have to watch what's happening as the
asteroids are moving and repeat back the
Illuminations
so we're going to look at a few
heuristics and the first one is
predictable and consistent so take a
moment and look at these three screens
now and see what you see is consistent
or similar across all three just to
yourself for a moment because I'm going
to give you a hint right now and a
bigger one so regardless of which
challenge the learner is in there's a
consistent set of displays and controls
for seeing daily progress for being able
to hear a repeat of the instructions and
to you know get this constant
information about their progress and so
to bring a couple of these to our
attention this one shows the number of
items that the learner has actually
accomplished so eight now that you guys
have done the six how do you feel about
this eight and then nine which is the
next step for the learners to be able to
accomplish right and so this
communication is is a really important
visual indicator for the learner as
they're kept in this constant state of
challenge because
this is hard in one session they might
get 50% of what they're doing correct
that's how challenging this is and trust
me I've tried this I don't then another
here stick we're gonna look at is
providing learner control so there's
another button on the screen that's
really critical for the learner in terms
of learner control and that's this go
button and this pops up after each of
the trials that the learner is going
through and it actually gives them some
them some control of a pacing because if
they want to take a quick little break
between one trial and the next that go
button enables them to do it again think
you're getting 50% of what you're doing
correct in one session on average that's
how hard it is and in fact the system
will even implement a short break if
you've gotten a consecutive number of
items incorrect it'll give you like a 15
second break just so you can pause take
a moment before going on to the next
trial and then another heuristic will
look at is clean and simple design so
the importance of a clean and simple
design like this is more important than
many people might think you guys might
know about the aesthetic usability
effect in which things that are
aesthetically appealing or visually easy
to look at or actually perceived as
easier to use and that kind of comes
into play here so the importance of all
of these heuristics kind of plays out
for us if we go back to the 1950s or
maybe back to your psych 101 class when
you likely learned that human beings can
keep in mind about seven plus or minus
two things at once right showed that
with our little example so you take this
you add 25 years and you get a
comprehensive set of instructional
principles known as cognitive load
theory and so to kind of tease this
apart there's these three types of
cognitive load the intrinsic is the
inherent difficulty of the particular
subject matter so think basic addition
versus trigonometry and there are
certainly things that instructional
designers interface designers can do to
help learners manage that then there's
the germane cognitive load and this is
sort of like what I like to think of as
the special sauce of learning this is
what's enabling the learning to take
place we always want to increase that
but let's focus a moment on the
extraneous cognitive load because this
is the thing that will distract
learners from the learning and so it is
completely under the control of the
instructional designer in the interface
designer and we should be doing
everything that we possibly can to
eliminate the extraneous load and if we
linger here another moment think for a
moment in cogmed how critical it is that
the interface of cogmed not do anything
to impose additional load on the working
memory as they're training the working
memory given that these kids already
have some deficits in working memory
there's another thing within the cogmed
program and that is the reliance on a
human coach to help ensure compliance
and this set of reporting engines to
help that coach to diagnose issues that
are taking place along the way
and that leads to comments like this
from learners being able to remember
what the teachers saying and focusing
due to these heuristics now obviously
within cognate there are far more
heuristics than this and there's far
more that the cognate program does than
just to eliminate the extraneous load
however this is an illustration to show
you how this intersection between the
usability the instructional design and
I'll make a bridge to participatory
design we actually have started working
with the cogmed team in participatory
design sessions to put together a series
of resources for learners so that they
can see the role of working memory
neuroplasticity know some of these
concepts in the language that's
comfortable and familiar to them before
they start working in cogmed okay so I
will pause here and see before we go
onto our next learner Frankie and see if
there's any questions comments
or we can continue to drive forward okay
excellent
all right with this one I'm gonna have a
question for you guys
so I'll plant that seed Frankie's gonna
lead to a question for you all right so
this is nine-year-old Frankie and right
now in his class he's working on a
concept called geometric measure of area
so to him he's just playing a series of
games he's working on some performance
activities doing some classroom
activities but there's a lot more behind
the scenes that led up to this
experience for him and that is the
insight learning system so this is
actually a project that's between
research and practice within the
research and innovation network that I'm
part of and it's a set of digital games
performance tasks and non digital
activities like paper-based
classroom activities that kids might
experience that are all built around
this concept of a learning progression
which is documentation to show based on
pericle observations how learners move
from a less sophisticated to a more
sophisticated level of understanding so
it's not like just the table of contents
of a textbook and it's not you know
scope and sequence in a curriculum it's
actually the conceptual jumps that kids
make in their understanding about a
particular topic okay and then a couple
other things you would see here is the
professional development and the role
that that plays in helping educators who
are going to be implementing that system
to understand all the components and
this concept of the learning
progressions and we'll dig into that in
a little bit so we can again look at the
insight program in terms of these layers
so starting with the learning Sciences
layer we've got some principles and the
learning progressions we've kind of
described that in terms of this being
moving from the less sophisticated to
the more sophisticated level of
understanding started in looking at
research you know that in math around
how students are moving through that and
then actually conducting research with
kids to observe them you know working
with little centimeter tiles and how
they actually approach this concept of
area then we've got assessment without
testing and this is where we don't have
to stop and test we can actually look at
non-traditional forms of data
in order to get that make those
inferences about mastery of content and
the games in this case our vehicle for
allowing that and so now we're going to
dig into a few of the learner experience
heuristics within alison ariel and so
first this is alice and she is featured
in a set of games a queen named Alison
Arielle and and so to look at the
heuristics we've got segmenting as one
of the heuristics I'm going to take you
back to this cognitive load theory and
we're going to kind of build on this a
little bit so this time we're going to
look at the entrance at cognitive load
and we're gonna look at how we're
actually helping the learner to manage
the intrinsic load and so let me pause
here when you hear area what comes to
mind for you dig back deep into when you
learned math what did area mean to you
Andy what's the first thing that pops
into your mind when you think of area
how do you calculate area
are squared to reach okay right so many
people will call to mind this formula
Africa very linked I quit
in actuality there's a lot more to area
if you want kids to truly get the
underlying concept behind area there's a
lot more to it and one of those things
is this notion of area unit interation
so first we look at geometric measure of
area so think back to those little
centimeter tiles you could use to cover
an entire figure entire shape or the
inch tiles just this notion of that we
have this unit right this area unit to
measure area that's like the first thing
that kids conceptually have to
understand right because just telling
them to do length times width they never
understand what it really means then
there's this notion of composites okay
so we're taking these little centimeter
tiles or squares and we're putting them
together right to cover this whole unit
and to end and then this multi-level
area composites so part of that is
recognizing that you can't use a
combination of centimeter tiles and inch
tiles and cable to calculate the area so
each of these very fine tuned kind of
levels of conceptual understanding are
reflected in this game or the set of
games so here's the first level of the
game
the first level is just that the learner
is going to stack bills of pay inside
the bar and help Alice with her tours
and so here we can see it's not even
done with complete precision but the
idea is just to get them used to this
concept that squares will cover the
spaces so you've got these little tiles
that can cover the spaces in subsequent
levels each of these levels builds on
that learning progression so again not
just a scope and sequence it's actually
a conceptual level of conceptual
understanding that the learner has so
batcave to a learner they're simply
wrangling up bats and putting them in
cages
but these bats are actually different
sizes so they have to put the correct
that size together in the one cage and
then in the other and then absent show
them that you know units of measure
arbitrary and we have to make
distinctions between those in skeeters
that's where this little game mechanic
called loony is introduced so they're
gluing these little webs spider webs
together in order to
catch mosquitoes so they start to move
to this conceptual level of composites
that you can stick these unit squares
together once we get to butterfly away
which is almost like a boss level there
are multiple sizes of butterflies and
different ways that you can kind of
configure them in order to fill these
hot-air balloons so they have to create
a plan they have to figure out which of
those butterflies when glued together
will actually fit perfectly right and
perfectly fill the hot-air balloon and
then they have other game mechanics
there's multi in which they can multiply
sections of the composite in order to
fill the entire space and so if we go
back to this concept of we've got this
intrinsic load right but we're managing
the essential processing breaking down
these games into the stages that we see
that are the phases that kids go through
and their understanding in the learning
progression are actually helping them to
manage that load then we're going to
look at another heuristic around
personalization I have a t-shirt here
because personalization in this case
it's like from multimedia theory that
refers to the conversational language
versus formal language so it's like the
t-shirt language or in code design terms
we're casual with the kids and wearing
t-shirts so if we look at the cognitive
load Theory again for this one we're
building on the germane load and we are
in this case fostering generative
processing okay so this is our special
sauce so here's what we're doing to
improve the learning not just help them
learn to manage the look but improve the
learning so that we know from looking at
research that that conversational
language is in part what will help do
that and so here we've got flat cat this
character who's in a very conversational
way introducing Alice and then this is
my personal favorite this is actually
one of the levels where there's a Yeti
with anger issues and they have to help
Alice find a way so it's this very
casual conversational language versus
the formal language that's used
throughout even in the way that the
feedback messages are communicated to
the learner
and then lastly still within the germane
load we've got this notion of guided
discovery so when we put a learner in an
open-ended environment like a simulation
or a game we know that those scaffolds
that we can provide along the way can be
really beneficial and so in this case
here you can see the Yeti level we've
got the learner will kind of with some
autonomy first start to kind of play
around and what they're actually doing
is pulling these ice blacks ice blocks
down in order to cover the gap so the
Allis can sneak by and not be seen by
the Yeti these little magnifying glasses
will actually pop up after they've been
working in the game for a couple minutes
and there are little hints little
scaffolds for the learner one of them
just kind of reiterates what the learner
supposed to be doing which is to you
know cover the openings with snow square
so there aren't a caps and then the
second one actually provides it provides
a visual cue around the number of ice
blocks that's required to fill those
gaps so they can see that the 3m8
so again an illustration of just a few
of the heuristics within the insight
learning program that kind of build on
what the winning scientist research base
is in order to create that learner
experience for the learner so this is
the one I'm going to start to get people
thinking a little bit about this one
because I want to kind of end after we
go through our Harrod student and with a
little discussion I described a little
bit this process of the learning
progression starting with research right
and then actually observing kids working
through using these little centimeter
tiles and things like this in order to
to calculate the area to demonstrate
their understanding of area the next
phase of this research is how can we how
can we both create the learning
progressions and then also validate them
just with data mining educational data
mining so know if there are any folks in
here who might be able to have a little
dialogue around that but I'll plant that
seed that's something we would like to
explore I'm gonna forge ahead and go on
to Kim which is our higher ed student so
Kim is a traditional higher ed student
he is doing part of his coursework
online he's using a product called
course Connect which is online
courseware
that can be launched in a variety of
learning management systems tailored by
an instructor that type of model and so
we can again kind of tease apart this
course connect and look at the learning
sciences research base first and then
we'll look at the learner experience
your aspects so if we look at the
learning sciences research-based there's
a few principles that we have one I
mentioned previously which is this meta
cognition or metacognitive skills at the
simplest level this is just getting a
learner to think about the process of
learning like thinking about how they're
moving through levels of understanding
specifically within course connect it's
getting them to kind of calibrate so if
they are somewhat confident that they
have mastered certain content it's kind
of telling them whether they have a mod
and there's a specific study guide
feature that I'm going to speak to that
kind of gets at this one the add up to
be within course connect has to do with
the adaptive scaffolds that are in place
that I'll talk about which points
learners to specific content they've not
yet mastered and then with prior
knowledge we know that learners are not
just Bessel's to be filled everyone
comes to the table with some
preconceptions some of those are correct
some or not but building on their higher
knowledge is what enables them to build
out you know more robust schemas so
looking at the learner experience here
within course connect and some of the
heuristics first a quick peek at course
connect there's levels of multimedia
included in here so various
interactivities all of this is chunked
down into small sections within the
course and so with segmenting because
Kim is going to be moving through and
you know getting his own mastery of this
content autonomously having this broken
down into small chunks turn is important
and we'll see even more how we filled on
that concept with an adaptive
scaffolding so for learner control
because he is in this online environment
doing this pretty autonomously again the
fact that he can complete this in any
order there's a clear linear
organization but he can go through and
complete this course in a nonlinear
format as well
we know that when we put that level of
learner control and a learner not just
with the pace but also with the
sequencing that it does impose load on
them and so this notion of adaptive
scaffolding is what enables them to kind
of more efficiently focus that task so
enter the study guide the study guide is
something that a learner can complete as
many times as they want it's rather
simple they take a quiz they assess for
each of the items that they're
completing their level of confidence so
either they say they're sure they got it
right or they're not sure and from that
a combination of the accuracy of their
responses as well as their confidence is
what is generated in this study guide
the study guide will show them where
they need to focus their attention and
it will actually direct link them to
those small segments so that they can
focus their attention and with greater
efficiency master the context so again
just a few heuristics within horse
connect specifically when you know we're
looking at having even more control over
the pacing as well as the sequencing
what scaffolds and supports that we can
have in place so we want to linger here
a moment on the irresistible engagement
we've spoken to it in a few different
ways as we've looked at some of these
heuristics what I'm starting to see from
the co.design teams that we've formed is
that certain trends and themes are
coming up in terms of what kids are
recommending as they're approaching
different design tasks that they are
almost becoming like you're a sex to us
okay and so I want to share a few of
those today so one of those has to do
with this notion of a quest and how
motivating having some type of you know
ongoing adventure in which there's some
big reveal or some big prize in the end
has been for kids so the quest that
theme comes up time and time again along
with this learn by doing and this has
actually come up in our usability
testing for years as well where kids
don't want to be front loaded with a lot
of instruction
they're not gonna read up they just want
to die break it in and they want to get
going and you know kind of learn as they
go so that's been another thing never
underestimate the power of a song a
jingle sound effect time and time again
when kids are acting things out they
always have their funny little voices
and their sound effects and their songs
another one is this notion of playing
behind the scenes and getting a peek at
what's behind the scenes this started to
come up in the context of some work that
the kids have done on this early
literacy mobile app or vocabulary
acquisition and so we were exploring
where then it you know kind of creating
this digital environment where kids
could build on their vocabulary
activities and have this rich language
experiences kind of like mom or dad
would usually talk with them and use
more descriptive vocabulary and so some
different retail environments like let's
say a pet store would come up and they'd
want to go in the pet store and have
these types of experiences well they
want to know what's happening in the pet
store after hours or if they're in a
restaurant what's going on in the
restaurant in the back like it's those
things that they wouldn't normally see
and those behind-the-scenes types of
experiences that they wanted to be able
to see them in these types of programs
and then customization always
customizing some aspect of the
environment or the scenario around which
they're interacting so to kind of bring
things to a close we know as we look
into the future we can look at
predictions that over the next 15 years
about 2 billion jobs are going to
disappear as robots and automation make
many traditional careers obsolete
according to the World Bank one in five
elementary kids are going to be in a job
that exists today so as we look at what
tomorrow's learners need to succeed
Pearson has taken a stand that any
learner who's using our products should
be able to know that it's based on
robust research and that it's been shown
to deliver meaningful and measurable
outcomes and we know that a prerequisite
to that is not just the the research
into the learning sciences but we also
need to make sure that things are
promoting the deep learning they're
elegantly efficient and easy to use and
irresistible engaging and so we have
this series of heuristics that will
support that
of cognitive load of like decreasing the
amount of extremists cognitive load and
yet in the second child it seemed like
there was a lot of different story and a
lot of different variation between each
of the different tasks that they're
presented and it doesn't that work
counter to that earlier heuristic so do
you mean this stories and then ask the
Yeti versus the butterflies they mean
other than dragging blocks around that
seems to be one of the few consistencies
amongst all those different things may
imagine looking at the screenshots
there's actually quite a bit of
animation going on even as they're
working through it not a focusing into
the task right so I think what you bring
up is is sort of that pull between the
learning Sciences and the engagement so
so the exact thing you're mentioning
there were definitely conversations
about how much of this narrative and
story line should we incorporate into
these games around geometric measure
area and and the bottom line is it was
through the research that was done with
the kids that kind of validated that
even though there were a number of kind
of different scenarios that Alice and
her friend flat cat were encountering
that that they were seeing a lot of
engagement from the kids around it and
persistence as well and so that led to
that decision but I think it's
definitely a balancing act in you know
looking at what we look at theoretically
as well in the research and then you
know validating that with research with
the kids
even the language under there was a lot
of back and forth line so you have this
video with encouragement just love the
ID they love to the anger tissue
what are their questions my answer and
then I'll take the one back at you so
how much of the research actually needs
the researcher personally present with
with the student the thing I'm working
on is is all MOOC stuff and so we're
trying to work out you know how do we
get effectiveness how effective you know
how can I provide support in what I'm
making to let this happen or is it
substantially more effective to have a
human in the room to say what did you
think about rather than have it make a
quiz right so it's an interesting
questions so if I'm going to kind of
repeat it back like how much of the
research requires you know face time
with researcher and a student versus you
know data which is strictly required how
much is substantially better right
because you don't have to put another
quiz in from the student to find out
what you could have just found that by
watching one right exactly so I think
that question that I was going to pose
in terms of the next phase of this
insight learning system research is
that's what we want to be able to
understand around that project
specifically because there was a lot of
face time with kids in the lab in the
classroom right to be able to validate
those learning progressions to see the
phases the conceptual jumps that they
made in their understanding around area
and that is the exact research question
the team has now is how much of this can
we do some you know scraping of the data
to identify those levels that the kids
are moving through without all of that
face time and we do have a center
devoted to these types of questions
specifically within our research and
innovation network digital data
analytics adaptive yes so for that
project specifically because the you if
you think about this is just one piece
of area if we could apply those types of
techniques to a broad range of you know
curricula and topics so that's what that
team is going to explore next so if you
have interested collaborating with that
team I can certainly make the connection
for sure great yes so then what is the
component of like the adult in terms of
the live classroom teacher or the parent
like what is their interaction with this
or how do they supervise great so I
think what I'm hearing you specifically
for the insight program where you had
the Alison area ranch yeah right so if I
could I could pull it back up but I'll
just describe within that insight
learning system the whole notion behind
that is that oftentimes there's kind of
a disconnect between right educational
games and and the classroom activities
and the professional development that
the teachers might have and so that's
where this insight learning system it
kind of glues everything together with
this learning progression and so with
that project which I mentioned comes out
of our research and innovation network
it's between research and practice they
actually went into classrooms they did
professional development with teacher
time here is this learning progression
right and so the kids would work on
those gains but then there were also a
series of classroom activities in which
kids would work together in groups and
they would do these different concepts
around area and so all of the kind of
aspects of that they also had some
digital performance tasks in which they
were you know demonstrating their
understanding of these concepts of area
all of those things were glued together
by the learning progressions the
teachers were you know facilitating some
of that in terms of the classroom
activities the kids were doing some of
the games so there's definitely a role
of the adult in that sort of blended
solution and then just as a follow-up
like is the intention for the games to
be played on a computer or laptop or
mobile device what is the like main
device sets for the intended use for
those particular games yeah I I think
that you know depending on what type of
implementation the school has whether
they've got a one to one implementation
program it's gonna it would vary a
little bit but it's designed to work on
any of those devices so it's you know
that that professional development piece
where you're actually look if you think
about it and I don't know how many
former educators there are in here you
know we we got a lot of good footage of
these teachers talking about you know I
had to understand this concept of the
learning progression and it's not just
you know the scope and sequences it's
actually like bring
- like what's happening inside kids
minds as they're moving through that
mastery and that aspect of training with
those educators was pretty critical
I thinks with questions
can I answer today what role do you
think engagement can play in adult
education in adult education yeah so for
like the kid persona mm-hmm that's
that's an interesting question I I think
it's probably about the same as kids I
don't know why it would be any any
different right because you've got
there's a lot more autonomy let's say in
an akin type scenario where he's working
within an hour online course but I think
adults should be just as engaged as kids
I really I really do and so I know so
where I sit is within our k12 group but
we do have some co.design that's
starting to take shape within our hire
and I know they have some co.design
committees will hire it as well and so
it's I think equally as important and
really do what is what's your stance on
that and yeah I wanted yeah it was great
to see what your thoughts were but yeah
I definitely would agreement with that
as well it could be some obviously some
of the factors that would engage kids
over adults are going to differ but I
think it's just as important to identify
what those are through research and then
incorporate those those entail solutions
what else
feedback so you've got you've got
feedback to coaches but I noticed when
you were doing the demands of the I need
tiny little increments of breaking the
thing down
do you have feedback on oh this wasn't
you know this this stuff was too big we
should have broken it down right do you
capture that and do you think something
like that back to the content creator or
is that measure for yourself before okay
so I think what I'm hearing you say is
like once the games were implemented and
I I'm not sure if I mentioned that the
games that insight program and got
Alison Arielle and games that was a
collaboration with glass lab they
actually brought those games to life and
so I think what I'm hearing you say is
in terms of feedback on now that we have
these games did we get the fine-grained
stages correct in the games and how
would we want to go back and tailor
those okay so suppose that you think
that you have you know five sub steps
and they're all about the same
you know height conceptually yes but one
isn't how do you notice that how do you
measure that and how do you how do you
service that bring it back the content
content creator that is a really good
question but I'm sure the main lead on
this project would love to explore with
you so I'm gonna maybe table that one
and have you talk with her dr. Kristin
Zerbo is kind of the one behind this and
this insight learning to Sun program and
she is the data mining kind of expert so
I'm gonna post that to to have you and
her talk about that so that can be your
first meeting how we should be true
anything else I can
thanks everyone um anything on VC that
we've overlooked okay we're gonna we're
gonna go to lunch if you just want to
continue chatting with Lisa oh you're
