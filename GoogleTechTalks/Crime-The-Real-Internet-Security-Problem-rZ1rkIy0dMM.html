so I hope so he'll make a hermit ass
today um I was five I think i believe
over ten years he first met in an early
days of the web invented game before
when I need pelvis taxonomy with all the
other early web hooks and Phil works
double security after verisign and mimic
that the WCC is he meeting interment in
December and he suggested that you know
perhaps companies like us could get
together and sort of figured out a wave
of coming coming up the team with we
fought both fishing mail and spam mail
and come up with concerted attacks that
beeping sense um well have so many good
ideas and security isn't exactly my
private you've seen the work so I said
the best way to may get some of those
ideas percolating through google what
should happen from here at all care so
thanks for coming up and take it away
thank you very much so thank you for
inviting me here i'm going to be talking
about internet crime more importantly
what can we do to stop it or minimize it
brief introduction to verisign not
because i'm here to plug the company but
because to know what I'm talking about
you need to know where I stand verisign
has a very simple business model we
paint a bull's-eye on ourselves we do
the types of things that when you
suggest doing them in a room the some do
you says I don't want to do that legal
hacking security risk up time we do the
stuff that is infrastructure that just
has to be there has to be reliable has
to be dependable we operate the DNS the
core dns we have 32 million names under
management 12 billion queries a day the
peak load is much higher
there aren't many people who do 12
billion transactions a day we do digital
certificates 400,000 websites we're also
into telecommunications this is
something that you probably aren't aware
of because we have a big internet
presence we do telephone switching crazy
frog our ringtone character had a top 40
he was top number one in the UK charts
for four weeks running this last year
what we really do though we make
ourselves a target so that other people
don't have to a DNS services are under
constant denial of service attack
something like a thousand two thousand
attacks every day that are worth
measuring my security services we have
three and a half thousand devices under
management those are all under attack
digital's difficult a fishing target
telecommunications a fraud target so I'm
not really here to sell you a security
product what I'm here for is to ask you
to help make my life a bit easier by
let's work to do see what we can do to
gang up on the criminals and make the
infrastructure more resistant to these
attacks so that we don't have to have so
many rooms for the computers fending off
the attackers so Internet crime how did
we get there note that I've changed my
powerpoint style to fit in with google i
thought that this would go down well we
can't afford them
so how do you get here well hacking an
Internet crime started really slowly in
fact the original hackers people didn't
really take them seriously because they
weren't really seriously trying to take
down the internet even the Morris worm
which was the most notorious hacker case
of the 80s you know the guy you know he
wasn't really trying to take down the
internet he was you know try to do
something was going to be cool and he
accidentally brought down the Internet
in the 1990s things got worse it was no
longer a small number of intelligent
hackers who were out to do clever things
it was now a large number of hackers who
are out to do mean things if you've read
any of the intercepted communications
from this guy you'll know that he really
was out to do mean things I used to be
at digital equipment corporation we had
to reinstall VMs on every single machine
in the entire company because kevin
Mitnick here got into the corporate
network that cost us several million
dollars so 1990s internet crime was
starting to become serious it was a
serious problem but still you know the
face of Internet crime were these lovely
cuddly script kiddies that you know folk
at the eff just loved to death and
wanted to get out of jail and suggesting
that sending these guys to jail for 5 10
years was unpopular today internet crime
it's not about the hackers it's not
about the script kiddies it's about
dollars or rubles or sense or yen it's
about money and that's the big change
that we see in Internet crime one of the
things that's happened all those teenage
script kiddie hat
of the 1990s the vast majority they grow
up they get some sense they get a job
and they stop one or two they can't get
a job they don't want to keep on living
with the parents and it's not just for
kicks it's now for making money this is
now their profession and this is exactly
the same thing that you see in
traditional crime most crime is
committed by teenage males and then when
they get to 18 20 21 25 they get jobs
and they have to make a decision I'm
going to keep on with the petty crime or
am I going to go pro most people go
straight some people make crime their
profession and that's what we're now
seeing on the internet and the worst
crimes are now directly caused by that
handful of people who've gone pro so
what are the crimes well this fishing I
would guess that everybody here gets
several of these a day I get about about
a thousand spams a day and about a third
of them are now fishing important crime
I'll come back to that one it's also
extortion in the old days the objective
of a denial of service attack was just
take the guy's site down you know cause
some mayhem caused some misery today
what they're after it's money and so
what you see is a denial of service
attack against typically an online
gambling site but pretty much any site
can be attacked anybody here know of the
million-dollar home page that guy has
been receiving blackmail attacks from
hackers
$50,000 or you won't see your website
again and here we have the crate rip
twins who were to London gangsters who
did the same thing in real space they
would go up to a business and say nice
business we got here it'd be a shame if
it got broke if you didn't pay them
they'd break it and this is one of the
things you see about internet crime it's
all old crimes there's nothing new in
the crimes the only thing that's really
new here is the medium and what did we
expect internet everything's going
online all the commerce is going online
we'll all the money's now online and so
now the attacks are following the money
it's like why do you rob banks that's
where the money is why do you hack the
internet that's where the money is and
then you have advanced fee frauds this
guy is a criminal from Nigeria who does
advance fee frauds I got this room 419
eater.com which is a site for which is
run by people who make a sport out of
baiting the 419 scammers so when they
get one of these Nigerian letters they
reply and ask them to prove their good
faith by doing silly things and if you
go to that site it's a great resource
because this this isn't just one scammer
it's not just ten scammers it's not just
a hundred scanners that they have got
that way it is page after page after
page after page they must have pictures
of something like 500 different
individuals on that site and those are
just the scammers who they managed to
trick to do one of these things for each
one that they trick there must be ten
more that they didn't trick
quite probably but I'm pretty sure that
no scammer will be caught more than once
or twice or three times with this thing
but another thing that's really
interesting when you go to the site the
backdrops are the same quite often as so
all the things that that's telling us is
that this is now franchise people aren't
making money from the actual 419 scam
itself what they're doing is selling the
ability to other people to do this 419
scam so you have a little franchise
industry in nigeria and that's the
reason why it's so concentrated in that
locality the actual advance fee fraud
gangs have new frauds and same basic
principle give us some money and we'll
give you a commission same principle but
a different setting for example if you
put a BMW an expensive car or motorbike
on ebay you like you to get somebody
from West Africa saying hey i'll buy
your bike from you here's fifty thousand
dollars and hit but i'll pay you fifty
five thousand dollars you pay five
thousand dollars to the shipper and will
gift a cashier's check and then the
cashier's check will bounce but after
you've paid the money on thinking that
cashier's checks our guaranteed payment
they're only guaranteed against credit
risk they're not guaranteed against
fraud so and you know i could go on for
the rest of the talk talking about the
scams I could go up and for the rest of
the day I've written a book on about
them it's about a hundred thousand words
the manuscript at the moment it's bad
it's ugly but what I really want you to
take home from this is that this stuff
is serious and these people are okay
here we're making a joke out of them but
there really are taking people's life
savings and the heartbreaking part of
the job that I'm doing is when you find
out about 70 year old eight-year-old
Graham
mothers who been tricked by these groups
and said they've sent them 30,000 40,000
dollars that they're going to need to
eat off so it's serious it's real we've
got to get a handle on it first let's
look at some of the tools that they're
using because if we're going to defeat
the bad guys we gotta take oh we've got
to look at the tools and neutralize them
first tool is spam when it started spam
was being treated like but as an
annoyance it was something Oh spam you
know just get over it you get spam and
then the volume started to get to the
point where email was becoming unusable
and people said oh yeah okay yeah you
got to do something about it I got spam
bays I'm okay I'm not getting any spam
oh you're getting spam well that's your
your hard luck I don't get any stopping
spam is about stopping crime spam is the
number one vector for Internet crime
every one of these crimes that I'm
talking about has spam at some point in
the life cycle the other common feature
that we have is botnets in the old days
the spammers used to actually buy
machines and send out and buy internet
connectivity and send out the spammer of
their internet connectivity there are a
small number of quasi honest spammers
still doing that you know these are the
people who are selling you the cialis
and so on so you know they're still
still doing illegal stuff you know
they're still selling your drugs
illegally but you know you pay your
money you do actually get the goods
something like 60 70 depending upon how
who you ask seventy percent of the spam
is coming from botnets which are
machines that have been compromised
turned into a zombie and here we have a
picture of a zombie
so the home computers connected to
broadband that's being compromised and
are now being controlled by the
criminals so this isn't even better
trick than the old gangsters used to
have when they used to steal getaway
cars the criminals use these botnets to
hide themselves they're using the stolen
computer instead of the stolen getaway
car but these criminals are found a way
of using the stolen getaway car and the
user is still paying for the gas the
owner is still paying for the internet
connectivity in the electricity the
botnets there are various estimates
about how large they are most botnets
that we can trace get into the thousands
above that actually synchronizing them
starts to seem to become a problem for
the herders but there are certainly
herders who have something like 50,000
machines at their disposal there are a
lot of you very large botnets out there
most of them are smaller and of course I
talked about spam well spam baguettes
botnets beget spam they use the botnet
to send out spam when they start to find
that they're getting low on machines for
their botnets they send out some spam
that has Trojans or if they don't have
the executable in the spam itself
they'll have spam that takes you to a
site that will do a drive-by download of
some trojan onto your machine and that
machine has then being captured into the
botnet so spam and botnets is a
self-perpetuating cycle ya think of it
as the life cycle of an insect yeah
actually that's a good question when it
comes to computer security that are
everybody lives in a glass house I can
show you compromises of every major
application being used on the internet
every major platform and every major
server application it only takes one to
break them the hackers are looking for
the most dollars so they have in the
past been concentrating on the most
widespread platforms however as soon as
Firefox got up to the point where it was
reporting 10% penetration we started to
see attacks against Firefox so don't
mistake not being vulnerable for not
being a target and one of the things
that happens here is that security is
very much like the problem of the car
alarm you have a car first-generation
car alarms most of them were not very
good because as soon as you put the
alarm on the car the thieves are going
to steal another car in the days when
only one car in 20 had a car alarm it
had to be a really special car before it
was worth working out how to undo the
car alarm now every car comes with a car
alarm from the factory there's a
difference have you got a good car alarm
what have you got a bad car alarm at the
moment we're all living in glass houses
and this is actually a very important
message that we've got to get home to
certain communities who are saying hey
we're secure we're using unix yeah
yeah I I used to as mentioned before I
used to work for deck and I remember
when unix started to first appear and
started to first displace VMS and we
used to make some comments about
security in those days as well and you
know didn't really make an effect
another tool that the criminals have is
criminal exchanges this is a site called
card a portal calm it's Russian the the
writing there is in Cyrillic this
actually was traced down to Russia yeah
the motto here Car'das of all lands
unite and they have a picture of landing
on their homepage doesn't appear that
they spent most of their time in class
because that's actually marks not Lennon
but we'll give them that the hackers use
the internet as a collaboration tool
they use it to exchange stolen goods
card a portal was used to exchange
stolen credit card numbers so you have
the guy who's doing the fishing and
stealing the credit card numbers now he
can sell those to another criminal who
is in the business of carding making use
of those numbers so these Carter portals
have been very important in in the
business of Internet crime and working
out how to disrupt these networks is
very important in terms of how we deal
with Internet crime so let's take a from
the opposition's favorite philosopher
well politician what is to be done it's
not just about measuring the world and
you know when you go to the conference's
you know you can sort of like give a
figure like sixty percent of the spam is
coming from botnets and someone you say
hey are you sure we're measuring the
figure in its 65 or no it's 62.4 and
well yeah we can spend all day measuring
the
problem and getting really accurate
assessments of how bad the problem is or
we can do something about fixing it so
what's to be done well one one good one
is let's blame the users or user
education as it's called when the
fishing thing first started was very
much like the spam thing and people are
saying hey the problem is that people
give away their credit card numbers on
the Internet just tell them not to do it
well okay you try and tell 60 year old
grandmother's that the message that came
from their bank with their bank logo
looks exactly like the messages from the
banks that takes them to a site that
looks exactly like the meshes and on
their site with some JavaScript that
pops a little gif image up covering up
the address bar so the address looks
like it's a bank you tell them to not do
something silly I mean these confidence
tricks only need to work a small
percentage of the time to work so user
education does play a part explain the
scams to people and people can protect
themselves but we need to do more than
just blame the user if we're going to
get a handle on the Internet crime
blaming the user can't be an acceptable
solution another option the law well in
the myths of Internet crime is that law
enforcement doesn't work well no law
enforcement does work and if you go to
the Secret Service website or the
Department of Justice website they have
a running tally of the cyber crime cases
that have been investigated and the
resort's that they've got this is a
shadow cruise website shadow crew was
another large card cut criminal
exchanged like Carter portal and shadow
crew was taken down about 15 months ago
now
and the Department of Justice has
received plea bargains from 15 of the
individuals involved sentencing to take
place next month and March the shadow
cruise site was estimated to have been
involved with fraud of approximately
four million dollars worth and there
were several thousand individuals who
were associated with that site so
they've got the kingpins and now they're
in the business of rolling up the rest
of the organization and making a
decision as to which cases to prosecute
it was also an international case
arrests have 15 rest in the US another
18 around the world law enforcement from
13 different countries involved so the
law can be effective the problem is the
law is also very very expensive cases
like shadow crew cost millions to
investigate it costs more to investigate
one of these crimes than the proceeds of
the crime two things that can be done
with the law trigger penalties when the
FBI are investigating their cases when
they're setting their priorities they
look at the number of years in prison
that will result at sentencing so if a
case is going to be a five-year prison
case that will get a low priority than a
crime that's a 30-year another thing
that happened is tripwire offenses in
the UK there's a very old law against
carrying housebreaking tools after dark
okay its current we all know that it's
criminal to break into a house but most
of the time when the police catch up
with the person they're not actually
breaking into the house they're either
on their way to the side the house or on
their way back so by creating this crime
of preparing for crime
you have a tripwire offense and one of
the tripwire offenses that was used very
extensively in the shadow crew case is
there's a criminal offense in the u.s.
having the equipment to create
fraudulent credit cards and most of the
people who involved in credit shadow
crew had that equipment in the house
okay so the FBI say great we've got you
instant five-year penalty just for
having that equipment okay now we'll go
into the plea agreement so tree roots
trip trigger penalties and tripwire
offenses are important and the law is
important because if you have a small
amount of law enforcement a small amount
of deterrence that will greatly magnify
the effect of all your other offenses if
you make it criminal to supply
information about security
vulnerabilities to somebody with a
reasonable expectation that that's going
to be used for criminal ends that is a
big deterrent to a lot of the
specialists who make their living by
providing that information so the law is
important but if we're really going to
get a handle on this we've got to change
the internet we've got to make the
Internet resistant to cry we've got to
make the Internet infrastructure crime
resistant okay well wasn't that the plan
all along and for the past 15 years
every survey that has come up has said
that security is the number one priority
for virtually every you group of users
you can imagine enterprise CIOs say our
security it's our top number one thing
users say oh I'm very worried about
internet security it's a constant
refrain but actually know people are
concerned about security but what they
really want to do is to get their job
done and the security that's being
provide
has been of the wrong sort it's been of
the sort of here is a bulletproof vest
that you can wear 24 hours a day just in
case somebody might take a potshot up at
you and that's a good stuff the worst
stuff is here's the armored car that you
can sit in all day or here's the bunker
that you can retreat to people number
one priority is always getting their
work done and if you put barriers in
between the person and their work that
are there for security they will find
ways to evade them and we see that in
every company you put barriers in front
of people they will work out a way round
so okay we're black to blaming the users
but yes that's not very productive one
of the problems that we had is that the
perspective on internet security is very
very much the same perspective that
we've had on information security
information security it all came out of
the military they had secrets that they
wanted to keep they had information that
they wanted to move around the
battlefield so that the person receiving
it could be sure this came from our
control not the other guys actually
that's number one use of battlefield
cryptography it's not about keeping
secrets from the enemy by the time the
broken the code the missile will already
have landed the gun will already have
fired well they're really interested in
his integrity during the Second World
War and the First World War there are a
couple of cases where communication
systems were broken and people are
sending messages of the sort okay aim
the guns here you get the idea so
permission based security it's all about
building walls it's all about here's my
castle and I'm going to defend it
here's our my assets I'm going to keep
control of my assets I'm going to
protect the confidentiality of my
information I'm going to protect the
integrity it's all about building walls
the problem is that works great inside
organizations but when you get to the
Internet you've got to go beyond the
walls I live in assists my I come from a
city called Chester Chester's unusual
because it's the only city in Europe
that has the complete cycle of medieval
walls if you are inside the walls you
were safe if you are outside the walls
where you're on your own now we're in
the Internet age everybody spending an
increasing amount of time outside the
walls we need to make it safe outside
the walls as well so how do you do that
well you got to change the paradigm the
way that you may that England was made
safe beyond the walls was by introducing
police introducing people who would
investigate crime and create a
reasonable expectation that if you did
crime you would do the cut time we
abstract that principle it's all about
accountability if you do something bad
on the Internet you have to be held
accountable if you want to do something
that requires a privilege a permission a
use of resources from somebody else
you're going to have to establish your
bona fide ease and prove or at least
establish to the other person's regional
expectations you're not going to abuse
that trust so accountability it's a
three phase three pronged approach
authentication know who you're talking
to accreditation know something about
them doesn't need to be very much if you
look at slashdot slashdot is just the
same as any other blog it just happens
to have what is it quarter million bread
users these days / starts comment system
isn't very much different from the rest
of the blogs the difference is that
you've got a reputation that follows you
around and if you start doing silly
things like putting graffiti on to other
people's comments your reputation
suffers you suffer consequences so
that's the third tier authentication
accreditation and consequences and
that's the way that you put security
systems together to work in the Internet
as opposed to within the castle within
the castle permission based security is
king outside the castle you need to have
accountability because you're not going
to know all the bad things that could
happen to you in advance and you
certainly aren't going to be able to
create a list of them and type them into
a computer in a form that the computer
can understand the way that you keep
social systems stable is accountability
okay how can we add that to the Internet
one other thing we have to make it
usable earlier i had a little rant about
blame the user you also have to don't
confuse the user either if you look at
the typical security user interface they
require just far too much effort from
the user I how many people here have a
Wi-Fi box at home how many people have
encryption turned on how many people
spend more than an hour getting their
encryption system to work right and
reliably yes especially liked the bit on
windows XP when you're typing in a code
that's an essentially authentication
code a having to type it into this box
that's 128-bit key you type it in and
hexadecimal into a box that doesn't show
you what the key is and then you have to
confirm it it's an authentication can't
the access code point Tyler I'm not
going to go there because my blood
pressure ok how we're going to get a
handle on fishing fishing is due to two
failures in the world around as to
security set failures one is insecure
credentials you can't steal a password
if the password changes every time you
use it unfortunately the passwords
that's been stolen most often credit
card numbers the early credit card the
early fishing fraud actually was because
of an even worse problem that's now
being fixed so I'll mention it to you
and that was if you had this credit card
number and you had a bit of computing
power and a bit of ingenuity you could
work out what the ATM PIN was yep
the credit card the ATM systems
interface security was designed in the
1960s and was not particularly good so
there's credential theft we can
introduce Trevor trust sorry we can't
introduce try to channel as I get to
that but the other thing is the
impersonation of a trusted party
impersonating the bank so fishing is
about the credential theft it's about
impersonation so let's go through those
in term one solution is theft proof
credentials this is an oath token and
this is my authenticator for inside
verisign it's a pki token so i can plug
this into the laptop and that'll allow
me to log onto the VPN for the
corporation it allows me to read my
encrypted mail to allow me to sign my
mail etc etc you can't always connect up
via USB sometimes you're typing
something into a web form sometimes
you're accessing external application
you press the button on this and it's
saying wait now a new one time password
comes up every time the button is
pressed now one time password tokens
have been around for about 20 years 20
years is significant here 20 years is
the length of time that a US patent
lasts and the idea of oath which is
initiative that verisign has been
spearheading is to have an open standard
for authentication tokens before oath
these were $45 per user per year and
they were being used exclusively as an
enterprise security device for a select
number of enterprises you turn it into a
commodity standard you make it
non-proprietary you allow any
manufacturer to make them unfortunately
these are in my slider all branded with
verisign but Aladdin make them gemplus
make them all the card almost all the
card
manufacturers you can imagine our making
these tokens or a part of the earth
initiative so that's one thing however
it's going to take us a little time to
replace these things with these things I
at some point in the future I believe
that you will have your credit card and
there will be a little window and some
electronic ink an you press it and new
number will come up each time but it
will take us an awful long time to
change that infrastructure and until
then it'll still be possible to steal
credit card numbers and all sorts of
other valuable information by
impersonating a trusted party so we have
to close both loopholes we have to make
the credentials theft-proof we've also
got to stop people being able to pretend
to be anybody who they choose on the
Internet all right it's all right to be
anonymous you know on the internet
nobody knows you're a dog so bubbles is
happy there but anonymity is not the
same thing as impersonation I have the
right to be anonymous if i choose i have
the right to be sued anonymous that is i
have an identity but the I online
identity is different from my offline
identity what I do not have the right to
do is to pretend to be city bank or bank
of america or Microsoft or anybody else
I don't have the right to impersonate so
how can we establish a system that will
allow us to authenticate ourselves
securely and this is a can demo it
doesn't actually have code behind it I'd
prefer not to have to write code behind
it but it demonstrates some of the
features that I think could be put into
security schemes and how simple and how
usable we could make a security
interface so this is vmail and imagine
that this is the first time I'm coming
to my to this site I'm going to come to
vmail that's going to be my portal to my
existing pop3 or
I mail account out there in the ethernet
so i'm going to type in or other alice
is going to type in her email address
password ok well the first thing is did
you notice that we never told the system
the pop3 account or the outgoing mail
server or the incoming mail server or
all that half hour of configuration that
I get phone calls from my mother asking
me how do i configure my email to talk
to free serve ok I'm in a different
country I'm in fact I'm on a different
continent i'm debugging somebody's email
on the other continent turns out that
somebody had missed done the
configurations well the first thing is
does this thing call the dns and this
thing called this the SRV record and the
SRV record is there for advertising
services so if you have an SRV record in
the dns it could advertise the names of
your the locations of your pop3 server
your imap server and all the other
configuration information that the user
normally has to type in and this is
something that could have been done
eight years ago but it wasn't because
hey we do protocols we don't do
usability I'm not responsible for the
usability of problem three and my map
what I am responsible for is the
security settings we can pull up the
security settings in exactly the same
way so lesson number one never make the
user configure anything don't ask them
for anything more than in using the
account email and their password that
should be sufficient so question number
two and we're going to get a message
from a bank and we want to be sure
that's from that bank or from that
trusted party
okay this is another not the demo page
and this is because if I don't show you
this one I'm going to get questions on
the next one email can include HTML and
can exclude JavaScript that is true just
because email can include embedded
images javascript etc etc etc doesn't
mean that you have to show it to the
user okay sounds fair enough so with
that in mind now let's see how a user
could receive a message from a trusted
source and be sure that it came from
that trusted source so here we have
again very similar web mail with a
message it's talking about zotov okay
there's something bad on the internet
and the other standard letter that I get
out pretty much every day it's coming
from security at I defense com that's
not coincidentally a very sign company
the reason why i use verisign here is
because if i use anybody else's brand
will have problems with the filming okay
now we also have the same day we've got
a second security alert and this
security alert is saying the first ones
a hoax how does the user know which
one's the hoax on which is the real one
well we have fairly educated users I
mean you're an insecurity specialist
before you get this but how many people
really are that alert to see that its
security at one defense com not I
defense how many people are really that
alert to notice okay there's some bad
spelling and even if it is bad spelling
I mean like there are people who can't
spell it who work for banks and so on as
well so this is the traditional pro you
know we've got this email and we just
don't know whether it's genuine and
whether it's false okay so the
technology that we could use here called
a digital signature and we can sign the
message and we could use s/mime and we
could just
distribute it securely the problem is
how does the user know from first glance
that this message is genuine and not a
spoof and what we need to do is to have
a user interface that is so transparent
that people start to pick up the
security user interface without having
to read the manual on what the security
use interface does so what doing in this
one is that if you look in the top
right-hand corner we have the logo I
defense okay and the way that we've done
this is if we click on this club bring
up a little panel it'll tell us
something about it so what happened here
was that this message was signed
digitally using the domain keys
identified male met email signature
standard what's right specification dkm
is a signature specification that I
believe gmail has been applying to its
outgoing mail for some time originally
developed by yahoo and cisco and
verisign microsoft's send mail PGP
pretty much everybody in the security
world is part of that effort and is
backing this specification what we've
done here is that we've added we've
taken the domain key spec and we've
extended it so that you take the domain
key signature from the DNS and you can
verify the signature and then that wreck
the record that gives you the key in the
DNS also gives you information say hey I
got a digital certificate and I've
proved that I really am who I say I am
to a certification Authority in this
case verisign but there are other
various authentic certification
authorities in existence in a
competitive market free market rules and
that certificate also makes use of an
extension to the x.509 specification
that is an ITF standard called the
logotype extension and that contains the
I defense icon so the upshot is that
when I get the sign Deacon mail message
the client can show me that icon in such
a way that
I can be sure it really is from I
defense and if it comes from it if a
male came from somebody else with the
icons in it the icon could not appear in
the chrome it could not appear in that
security bar it would appear in the body
of the message so you've still got some
ability to do some user confusion
however we now have a very tight way of
saying if you see that message there for
the first time we can say you can
actually rely upon this message coming
from who access it is at the moment we
do not got that an email which is really
quite amazing i mean like public key
cryptography has been around for quarter
of a decade they're being four different
ITF working groups that have reported
back who been developing security and
for email we're just starting a fifth
one but this would be the first time
that would be able to know with
confidence that this mail really did
come from who it said
absolutely and you better what make sure
that it's a competent person doing that
authentication not Renta CA yeah you
don't want Fred the Builder just issuing
this okay there's two lines of defense
here if we go back to the security pain
I was going to come to that in the
slides but i'll do it now you'll notice
that there's two logos there's a logo of
I defense and there's a logo of the ca
ok so the idea here is you know that
you've got somebody to hold responsible
if something goes wrong and you can hold
I defense accountable or if it turns out
not to be I defense you can hold the ca
accountable ok now you can imagine that
it would be some cas in the world who
will be less than one hundred percent
reliable who might allow extremely big
bank corp to come along and get a
certificate without really doing much
checking at all however in this new
world your own low your own reputation
your own identity as a CA is going to be
online as well and so if you do that
you've got a self if you you can
accountability scheme if you default if
you make an error you're going to be
held accountable because people are
going to stop trusting your logo as soon
as you can say slash dot you know the
first person who puts out a burger
certificate with a logo in here is going
to make the headlines on news com
slashdot if they're lucky more likely
they'll make front page of The Wall
Street Journal so you've got
accountability you've got consequences
for everybody not just for the holder of
the certificate
an attacker can just move the entire
flow because my defenses
Oh is the secret
so if i can get you to enter your
password and it's my site
I create entire fitting
six year old grandmother's
when would sound better this was put
into gmail yeah I have to start from
some trusted base okay I cannot work for
nothing I have to have somewhere I trust
in order to build yeah I need a rock to
build my
yeah and this actually is one of the
things you know I tried to argue against
so much flexibility in the user
interface a while back and didn't win
that argument you know people would say
hey people want the ability to pixel
place their gifts I say well yeah people
would also like to be secure and now yes
you've got to have some regimentation I
mean like the security of this scheme
depends upon the chrome that graybar
coming across you have to make sure that
nothing else can get the images into
that chrome I have to have some part of
the user interface that is trusted in
order to bootstrap the whole system and
we have to get to a point where we're
developing user interfaces that
communicate this is the trustworthy part
and this is the part where anybody can
party and this is actually the subject
of a workshop that's going to be held by
w3c that's coming up I believe it's
April there's a call for papers out
there for that that closes tomorrow so
so you can extend this concept of a
security that note that
yes that's the other point yes the for
this to work it's gotta be ubiquitous if
I go into a bank the bank has the logo
of the bank on it the ATM in the foyer
has the logo of the bank the statement
has the logo of the bank the you know
every piece of paper I get from the mail
has the logo on the bank the idea of
secure letterhead is every email every
website every instant message
communication every sit communication
every voice over IP communication every
protocol that we haven't thought about
yet so by building upon these existing
standards we can hook this that trust
into any system you choose ok but the
question is how many game is rolling
there are two areas that are really good
for getting the ball started area number
one is websites there are 400,000
verisign issued ssl-certificates already
out there adding doing the additional
authentication and then adding a logo in
there is not a complicated task it's one
that when I talk to ya every single
person I've talked to has a famous 50
brand is on board the minute that I talk
about this so I'd love to see Firefox
I'd love to see Internet Explorer have
the ability to use that top right hand
corner you know the point where that has
that silly icon I'd like that icon to be
what it was originally intended for by
dave raggett yo do you remember that 13
years ago dave raggett showed this more
or less this exact scheme I'd like that
to be the logo that says yes this is
really bank of america or this is really
citibank or this is really you know
whoever needs to establish themselves in
trustworthy way so
then well actually we should we should
remove the brand the trusted bank dress
in bank calm is going to have to be
authenticated by a certification
Authority and that certification
Authority is going to need to meet a
certain bar of trustworthiness and
that's another part of this problem that
is partly under way and I showed you the
feedback system the other thing will be
high assurance criteria there's an
organization called web trust that you
have to get audited by to become a CA
the problem with web trust is that the
criteria for becoming web trust
authorities are not very high you say
what authentication you're going to do
and they check that you do it you don't
have to say that you do very much and
that's why there are now certificates
around there where the only thing that's
been checked is the domain name now the
main name only certification is
perfectly viable we do it ourselves on
the thought brand we don't do it on the
verisign brown but we do have a label
well we that we use for domain only
certs it prevents DNS attacks it
provides you with proof that it really
is the other party's public key so there
is value there however if I'm going to
hand over my credit card number if I'm
going to interact with the this person
thinking that they really are who they
say they are I want to have more
authentication I want to be sure that it
really is that Bank that owner of that
logo and their ways that you can check
for that for example registries of
trademarks if somebody's using a blow go
to represent themselves they should at
least have a trademark application in on
it now you could have a fraudulent
application however if we've got an
address where legal process can be
served and the crooks give it to us well
we'll send the FBI round or the Secret
Service or whatever and we'll deal with
them that way so yes he it's a very
important question I believe it is
soluble but I don't want to get into the
10-year history of CH
services okay actually this is my last
slide this demo actually also has as
well as having the email signatures it
also has transparent crypt encryption
built in so you can receive encrypted
messages and send encrypted messages
without the pain that certain user
clients but put you through so just just
wanted to mention that so Google Ads of
gardens we've discussed this before it's
not just about making the party you talk
to you accountable the trust providers
must also hold themselves accountable I
think that that's what's wrong currently
in the SSL world and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
