help me his name guy who's it no but I
am being your master of ceremony this
evening for the Bay Area Python users
group or enthusiasts whatever we want to
call ourselves and tonight we have this
special program of four demonstrations
of integrated development environments
and I'm gonna be first okay it is Dennis
Reinhardt whom I'm chilling in for cuz
he's not here tonight and also I am the
first speaker and I'm going to be
speaking about Emacs and developing
Python code under Emacs and I apologize
that we didn't seem to be able to get
the resolution set up so that you can
see the actual slide show so it's a
little tacky it's always something you
know okay so my integrated development
environment starts with my data hand
keyboard because it's really important
to me to watch out for repetitive stress
symptoms because I am a sufferer of that
if I'm not careful so this even has dots
in it I'm gonna show misspells - well
I'm sorry so I hope that you could make
out that I have a very special keyboard
that has like five switches on each
finger and I'm very relaxed all the time
and this is a pillow for a lumbar
support in there somewhere
okay these are the reasons why I use
Emacs one is to avoid mousing because
mousing is a big issue for people who
have trouble with repetitive stress
symptoms and another is it my fingers
know it I've done it enough yes please
I do not I have no trouble at all with
my day to hand I get a little trouble
when I go off to the mouse but another
person might have a different issue yes
please
true
Emacs works fine over SSH oh what a good
point I'm not making that point but now
I wish I was but we should keep going
because I'm allowed exactly 18 minutes
says each of us are and so you want to
get through to the demo part okay so and
it's very a big reason why I just
continue to love it is that it's very
flexible in complex situations and I'm
going to be demonstrating a complex
situation to show you that I love it
that it does automatic backups it has
saved my neck many times and I'm just
simply a new fan and I'm also gonna ass
and of Richard Stallman okay when I move
over to the demo side and we have to all
cross our fingers that it all shows up
somewhat alright I'm going to demo these
things accessing a repository I'm going
to show you a complicated situation in
fact I'm going to talk about the
situation first I want to show you
killing yank it's one of my favorite
features it's Emacs version of cut and
paste very quick and flexible I want to
show you how to edit all the files in an
application because it keeps track of
all your files if you tell it you have
to set something up I'm not going to do
the setup I'm going to show you the
result of having set it up and I will
just show you my automatic backups from
doing all this okay going down to the
next one
here's my complex situation I've been
working on and the thing we're gonna be
debugging is my PI demon and it has a
socket it's up all the time and it has a
socket listening to for requests from
our webmail interface as well as from my
MTA which is exim because it allows you
to speak to a socket through the
configuration file it's really powerful
Mt
and all these things also talk to my
sequel so my situation is that I have
all this kind of setup knit together and
I have to get in there to debug and mmm
in order to prepare for tests while I'm
running and I'm running live now with
this thing we made is that while I'm
running whenever a message comes in and
this is on my life system it sends
important details to my Python daemon
over that socket uh if it is just
routing a message I'll be calling route
mail it will be calling wrong mail from
what is set in the socket and then my
route mail will make some decisions and
send instructions back what I do to
prepare for testing is that every time a
message comes in I store on a separate
little file the conversation that
happened over the socket so that if
something goes wrong if something breaks
or lands where I didn't want it to I can
fight it and test it again through my
code so this Python daemon not only has
route mail in it it has everything that
all those interfaces might want to call
so that it's up all the time and you
know that that's a benefit that's a good
thing you want to do if you're trying to
make a big Python thing okay here is my
route mails pretty much all there is to
it and when it's calls from the Python
daemon the Python daemon calls main and
that input there is a socket so that my
route mail I instantiate a message
object and it reads that socket and does
what it needs so depending on which
program
I call it gets different information
over the socket it knows its own
information and so I always have a
little function called PDB so that I
make fewer mistakes I name it the same
thing every time and it then calls the
same name but it gets makes a fake
socket and you can see here that that's
what happens something called a fake
socket
which overrides some things and so
that's what gets passed in to me
so then I am set up through my program
to be able to test the program aside
from the big situation while the big
situation is running it's really a nice
thing because I can change my program
and test it without it affecting my big
situation now we're going to talk about
Emacs and what is really handy be out
Emacs is macros Emacs stands for editing
macros and in fact my favorite thing is
make a keyboard macro because you can do
it right on the fly whatever you need
and you do control X open paren and
whatever keystrokes you to do in the
middle then you can do control X close
paren and you have that set in a
keyboard macro and subsequently I can
say control X E and it's going to do it
and in fact I can say escape one
thousand control X E and we'll do it a
thousand times so this is a really handy
thing to have going in your development
environment I think I know all
environments are definitely handy so ok
now we're ready to go over the demo and
we need for everybody to hold your
breath and hope that nothing goes wrong
oh I don't see it here but it's up there
that looks wonderful
ok we're gonna log in as root you laugh
at me for logging in through my laptop
and we're gonna be at dormant and we're
going to do I can't see so you have to
scream at me if I'm making a typo
demo notes and my plan is to follow
these notes ok
so first I'm going to bring area minimax
god thing and so I'm going to make a
shell and now I'm have access to
everything in the shell while I'm still
in Emacs and I'm here and I'm gonna do
an SDN so SVN is right here reverb - are
from when i practice
I messed up everything and it should be
able to do a revert I don't need to be
on the network to do a third so that's
all I have to do to access my ass at the
end it's right there handy for me and
then I want to zero here is a file that
was made by my Python demon with the
input output and so these are the the
things that Exim sends to my Python
daemon and you can see it's calling
route mail I'm gonna get rid of that
output at the bottom of the screen
although it really doesn't matter smart
enough not to care but it's near the
output is in leader and to cut I'm doing
ctrl K and here I'm gonna do ctrl K
again and again and again and ctrl K is
how you cut and it cuts the line up to a
newline character or it cuts the newline
character so every line I have to do
ctrl K twice as long as I'm doing ctrl K
everything that I cut is in one kill
ring entry it's called a kill ring entry
one entry and was a control Y it comes
right back and in fact there's a control
Y I can do it again but let me get rid
of all this because that was our point
and we want to say that as temp X
that's good right here I want one I'm
doing good
yep okay now I'll need to look at that
anymore except notice that what this is
saying is that I Marilyn at delivery
comm is sending mail to X X Y X 93 so
this is a new address to my system and I
have to and my program is going to put
it in my database so every time I run a
test on my debugger I need to get it out
of my database to start my test again
and so Emacs is gonna do all this for me
with just a few keystrokes once I set it
up so let's get rid of that okay I'm not
telling you all these things because
they're not so interesting if you're
landing stuff okay now it's telling me
to let me get this in my kill rate next
actually just so I have that one because
that's the hardest to type okay and then
it told me that I should see the 2x him
because that's where that's called from
and I want to show you know now what I'm
showing you is Python debugger stuff
because it integrates with that and if I
start my Python in this directory and my
debugger in this directory and there's a
dot PD BRC there then these breakpoints
will be set and this is a very handy
thing because I can reset the
breakpoints here without changing my
setup and you'll see what I mean now cuz
we're going to set up a macro a keyboard
macro
make sure I have that all on the screen
so you can help me okay here we go
first of all I'm gonna do the starting
thing and control X open it should tell
me down there defining keyboard macros
so so far so good now I'm gonna call
du/dy uh that's a little Python program
that access is my my sequel so I have a
little interface and here I'm going to
cheat by doing that and I get that out
of my database and then I want to quit
that do program and now I want to go to
Python and I want to import PDB and I
want to import screen if I make a
mistake route mailed uh no dot you're
not my students you know okay so I'm
importing around mail no and then I want
to say PDB run and here I say route
mail dot P DB because if you paid
attention you'll see that temp X is the
default file name although I could give
them file name and the arguments there
okay is it am i doing good
alrighty oh that's a good sign to see
those break points alrighty we're in now
let's see what I'm most likely to forget
in real life is to close off that macro
then I've done a whole bunch of extra
stuff so now I'm in my program let's see
I don't know why but sometimes and today
and I don't know why I must be the
weather it doesn't show my source code
but if I pull my source code up then it
seems to be keeping track so yeah Here I
am now I'm in the debugger and I can if
I want to set a new breakpoint that it
remembers I put it in that dot PDB RC
and I can do everything you can do with
it debug
we're gonna print up we don't have that
one yet well let's print self duck
status that's a nice thing see it's
always comforting to see okay okay get
that okay so so let's continue on out of
there and now I'm done and so there
might be things I want to do and see oh
I didn't get the shell all done
zealous there now I'm in a position to
do control XP and I'm right there again
that's applause for Richard Stallman
that is so cool isn't that okay so what
let's go back in to our demo notes and I
want to do just a little more about the
kill ring and I'm just gonna kill a few
more things now I have three entries in
my kill ring and I want to show you that
if i do a control yank it shows me my
most recent kill but if I do them it has
to be right them and escape yank I get
them the next most recent kill and again
and again will come around there's that
most recent kill again so it keeps I
don't know how many keeps but I know
everything is configurable in emacs so
it keeps reminding me
I mean keeps all that in my kill ring as
long as I don't bring down my Emacs no
I'll keep my UNIX up for days and days
by the way days and days for these for
all these reasons ok so now then I set
up tags I gotta check my time because I
have to just quit if my time is over and
I start a little late
well anyway well do you think we're
missing Mike Mike are you here yet
ok no this timing that's up there on the
board is the for for demo timing so
that's the big thing and if there's time
I want to show you time finding ashlag I
mean a tag and let's
do that by that let me put my cursor
someplace interesting like that and
let's see if this works
oh gee and I want to do escape dot and
it looks for the local most local thing
it might could have a tag about Lou tag
being the name of a function and it's
going to find me a function definition
and okay I like that one
and it's asking me of this where I want
to be yes it is
and there's that function definition but
sometimes you might prefer you don't
want just function definitions you want
actually to find all occurrences and
let's skip that and let's skip to the
tags query replace because that's more
powerful isn't it it's scary how
powerful that is wouldn't you say
okay let me get the whole thing up there
search and replace and get the whole
thing this is when I practice so let's
do what I practice and so I do escape
x-tags query place and I'm gonna take
all my instances of alias and turn them
into other and this is like a regular
replace and that if I say yes it happens
I'm going to say no this time and this
time I'll say yes and it goes on to the
next either those it goes on to the next
yes if I get bored with that I can do an
exclamation and it finished that whole
file changing everything it will or not
if I put it in lower it doesn't I don't
know I only have one functional you know
something where that came from but if I
put in lowered it does not and it
replicates the case it sees if I put in
something else than it does and I'm sure
that there's ways to make you can do
regular expressions to in this yes
please
oh I wish I had shown you just a
different one because if I had done in
out it goes from one to the next it'll
take you to the next overloaded function
definition it goes right through them
just how you want it to work
and so here let me do this and then I'll
get off the floor I am going through all
my files program files that have been in
the word alias there we go and the buns
is all files processed now what you
might want to do is save each of these
right there I saved that one and then
get out of it but now that's tedious
hello so I'm just gonna get out of Emacs
itself and then it asks me at the bottom
and do I want to save them and I'm gonna
say yes to some and no to some oh yes
let's get out now let's see any file
that has a squiggle on it was the old
version before I did this save it does
that automatically I don't know if you
can stop it I suppose you could eat
anything that has a pound sign on it
that's one that I said no I don't want
to save so it keeps a backup anyway even
when I say I don't I need this I don't
know about the rest of you better I need
this and in fact it keeps his backup
quite recent so that when my power goes
down it has a recent backup and I can
configure if I want to do after that
after so many keystrokes every so many
keystrokes or so many minutes ok I'll
quit now and we will move on thank you
very much and we will move on
anyway here we have okay should I let
you introduce yourself here we have
Keith dart and he's gonna talk about VI
n which is maybe or do you see them
sim that's what he says and I have my
notes real handy about where you work
and what a great programmer you are all
right he's a contractor at Google so all
righty
okay this as most most ITES today are
graphical pretty much so I'm going to
demonstrate them in its graphical mode
vim has a two modes basically who uses
curses and it also can use graphics and
as Marilyn said with Emacs you can also
use it over SSH or telnet or whatever
you want from a remote location
okay
and I have a little presentation here
and I'm ready to I'm gonna do a little
presentation first and they'll get into
the demo just like Marilyn did okay so
this is some BIM the ultimate idea for
Python that's what I call it and it's
created by a guy named Bram Mullen our
that's him and the contributors by
legions of people programmers over many
many years so it has many many features
it has lots and lots of basic editing
features similar to Emacs in many ways
but I'm not going to cover all those
because those are the basic editing
features I'm going to concentrate on the
integrated development side of things so
so but it being a general-purpose text
editor like Emacs you can use it for
many many types of text editing
functions not just software development
but also are you know writing emails or
editing a lists of text or whatever you
need that just plain text and for that
purpose it's you can use you can use it
for well since you use it for everything
you become accustomed to it and editing
config files and whatever I start using
it for you know anything I want to do
including
development and I really dislike having
to learn another editor in some other
and development environment in order to
use their system so what I've done is I
have put together a system of my own
which is kind of centered around vim
some of the features of BIM are
it's basically command driven you have
two modes basically an insert and then
command mode where you use the same
command keys and that enables you to do
some commands a lot faster because
they're the same keys that you use
regularly global editing features you
know global search and replace and a
simple command line
it's multilingual supports Unicode has
automatic commands when you load files
or certain types it can automatically
run some things and set some up for you
syntax colouring for many different
kinds of
the source files including Python of
course edit multiple files session
recovery just like Marilyn was saying at
the very last it it saves a swap file
and if you crash or if your session if
you're going over SSH or something your
network goes down you only lose a very
little man of work it's highly
customizable many many different options
you can't even cover all them in in days
probably and but it has in addition to
that plugins you can extend the
functionality you can integrate with CMS
systems like subversion and CMS has a
tag system like Emacs that can jump you
to different definitions of different
things you can run make from it in the
build system integration has a
client-server mode you can load a file
in it from a client invocation command
and best of all you can embed Python in
it so you can actually extend it in the
Python language if you want to ok vim
follows the UNIX philosophy of doing one
thing and doing it well and working with
other programs UNIX itself is an IDE the
the old traditional UNIX that was
developed was designed for developers
basically it then works with other
programs very well use external filters
you can call make as I said and the
graphical one supports drag-and-drop and
you can also call shell scripts and do
you know anything that you can do from a
shell script and also as I said as
client-server mode so you can invoke it
in different ways - usually the graphics
mode or or tell the server what to do so
in order to integrate an ID component
what I have done is I have my use Python
or I develop a Python so I have some
tools written in Python also to assist
in developing Python setup libraries I
have also some shell scripts some vim
plugins I can invoke a interpreter in a
shell which I use rxv - unicode terminal
for that or I can invoke it from a shell
I also have some integration with a
graphical file manager called rocks
and if ever heard of that but also I'll
demonstrate that later can generate tag
files with the C tags or exuberant ctags
you can call as I said subversion or
perforce or CVS from it I have a system
where you can bring up the Python
documentation in a web browser I use
epiphany for that or you can use the dev
help program which it comes with gnome
and of course you can call you can run
your text through anywhere external
filter like sort or format or or grep or
anything like that that you might need
that anything and you can do from a
command line you can filter through
right inside your editing buffer so if
it becomes like a centre of control of
this system
I have shell scripts to allow a single
instance of them to be running cuz vim
has in its latest incarnations or rather
it's rather heavy weight anymore so it
kind of has a long startup time it's
kind of lost that advantage that it used
to have the Emacs but I had compensated
for that by running a persistent vim and
then telling it to load files from a
shell script that I always keep up I can
use rocks file or to drag and drop files
on to it and it'll load the file I have
built-in macros and setups for you know
running the the Python I'm using I can
check things out or edit them from or
tell it to go into edit mode from them
using some of the plugins and there was
also a pipeline debugger that runs in a
shell so Kay onto the demo and we can
observe them in action and by the way
this is an s5 presentation runs in a web
browser I don't know if you know what
that is okay so we have here Michelle
this is our XP
unicode plus Z shell running in it and
we have a rocks graphical filer and open
to some source code and so I could scan
my list here and I can say pick one and
pick this one and I double click on it
and that will it's already set up to
invoke a shell script that will in turn
start up them and now I can edit them
this way if I have because of the auto
commands and damn it's already set up a
Python mode that has some macros already
pre-configured and also creates a
pulldown menu so you can run it in
terminal but since it exits right away
it the terminal exits or you can run it
interactively which invokes another
terminal and runs the or invokes Python
on this file in another terminal and
enters its and invokes its interactive
mode and then what it does is actually
because it's running as main it runs the
main section here this is very common in
Python where if name equals main and
very often I and lots of other people
put little tests in here self tests and
so when you're developing you want to
cycle through a change and then test it
and change and test it you just invoke
it with a couple keystrokes and start up
a new shell and then you can run your
test and and then at the end of it
you're in an interactive mode where you
can do some more poking around and
checking ad hoc testing if you wish
and see the other feature that I do is I
remap some of the keys like ZZ is
usually exit stim but I've changed it to
where it simply closes the buffer and so
that the VM stays persistent now if I
double click on this again it just pops
right up very quickly if I double click
on another it pops that up again and
then I have keys map to all its left and
right where I can switch between the
files very quickly and I can cut and
paste between them oh by the way this
redness is another set up is is that if
in Python sometimes it's sensitive to
mix mixed tabs and spaces and if a file
has has tabs in it when it's in spaces
mode if they show up as these red hash
marks just to alert me that that they're
you know bad so I have an also a tab
tabbed editing mode word where it always
inserts tabs and that's what I use I
have to switch it to when I'm editing
this file this is a long time ago I
started editing the Python using tabs
only but nowadays and a lot of other
people use spaces so I can switch
between using spaces and tabs by also a
another keyboard macro the let's see
another feature of vim is pressing the
pass or the the star will search and
they automatically highlight a keyword
or whatever the cursor is under so if
you want to make sure that you have say
an identifier that spelled the same as
it isn't where you define it or use it
you can do this and you'll make sure
that the highlighting matches the word
this way and you can also jump around to
those key words very quickly like this
the let's see any questions so far
anybody got any questions so I didn't
have a lot of time to prepare so I'm
just kind of going at hoc here yeah
oh yeah yeah you can do that you select
you can use visual highlighting capital
V select your section and then you'd use
an alts and then or no Caniff time sorry
and then this left or use the delayed
greater than or less than signs and it
will shift that whole block that way and
if you do the UK which is undo you can
undo what you did
so err kitchen or you can do control are
to redo what you did so there's also a
undo ring or in vim by the way I'm using
vim 7 here which has some extra features
also but you can see that I've own
indented that one but I can I can always
go back and forth
oops between them like this so that's
that's very easy to do I've also added
well the vim 7 add some balloon help
features like a lot of other IDs have so
that if I put my mouse cursor on there
on a built in keyword it'll pop up
something with the the dark string for
that but this is just experimental right
now so it only shows the built in
keywords it doesn't show anything else
so if I put on something else it shows
an exception I need to fix that but if
you just want to know like say property
function call is it'll pop it up right
there for you just by mousing over it
like this alright I mentioned drag and
drop there's another way you can open a
file just pull it from the filer and
drop it into there and it opens that
file and then I can then switch back and
forth between them oops anything focus
it
like this and again just running a
couple keystrokes away I can I can
invoke that save it automatically run it
in and into a terminal and then I can
you know inspect my code or invoke
something and do some ad hoc testing
that way I also have some unit tests
built in and I'll demonstrate the
debugger that I have this forcibly
interests or is an exception just to
demonstrate the debugger I don't know if
you can see that and remove this this is
a kind of a somewhat enhanced debugger
and it has some commands that you can
show the the local variables that are
compiled and in addition it will show
any that had been stuffed in there later
it shows what it was called as you can
see your place in the your source file
with a little arrow there and you can
see your your your back trace also and
it's colorized just to make it a little
bit easier and you can do your usual
going up and down the stack showing your
your location and listening your files
again if you were to get an exception
when you ran an interactive from the
interactive mode earlier it would
automatically pop you in the debugger
and then you can debug it from the point
where it failed so it's very quick to
cycle do the development and test cycle
by doing some edits running the few
keystrokes to start it in a terminal if
everything works you'll get the the
interactive prompt if it throws an
exception and throws you into this
debugger
and that's all automatic oops
habit okay so you can you can do that
and let's see what else what else
sorry
oh um tags you me so what you me oh you
mean like collapsing and stuff yeah yeah
yeah it has the this latest feature of
them has the ability to collapse but I
don't actually use it so I don't think I
even set it up but it can do it but I
don't think I can demo
oh yeah I think there is a plug-in that
does that but I don't use that either
so I don't have it here pardon I
probably should but yeah just I'm just
showing how I typically use it
Oh any question I actually wrote it
myself say it says I just took the video
the original pdb code and then I have a
CLI framework that I had written
previously and kind of melded the two
together yeah yeah actually I have an
open-source project that I also do that
you can also it's on subversion if you
want to get it I can tell you later
though about that if after this you can
ask me about it yeah I don't bother with
it right now but after this
demonstration I'll show you where it is
okay so let's see any other questions oh
my up okay
Wow
okay yeah well yeah it says syntax
highlighting of many many different
languages not even languages but but
config files and also it can meld them
together like if you have Python
embedded in a template of some kind of
web application framework it'll
highlight all of them you can also
customize all the colors and oh I was
going to show you also the the other
extra feature is that because python has
this special keyword called yield I've
had a special colorization for it that
that reverses it so that you can
immediately tell that you have a
iterator function I mean a generator
function without having to look there
and for the yield yourself it kind of
jumps out at you so so xcode is the ide
i use when i'm programming on my mac it
is a free ide developed by apple and
they ship it with OS 10 so if you have a
mac you can either it came with the CD
that has this on it you can download a
version from apple's website two decent
Python environment it's mainly targeted
actually for objective-c for Java for
C++ those are sort of apples main
languages but it plays well with Python
it makes a decent Python environment and
if you're gonna be developing
applications for Mac OS 10 it makes a
great environment because it integrates
really well with apples interface
builder it grates well with their cocoa
application framework
I have sort of a summary of this talk
and a few extra links to resources on my
website you can get to that through the
bait piggies website my name is a link
to my website you can get the resources
there or you can talk to me afterwards
I'll be glad to give them to you so
let's go ahead and start looking at it
the first feature it's kind of bad news
no debugger so Xcode has this nice
graphical debugger you know stack traces
and you can go ahead and just highlight
the code that you're stepping through
but it doesn't work with Python so you
have to look somewhere else if you're a
big fan of debuggers you have to use
something like PDB right
perhaps oh there's an app though it's a
nice environment so what you get
kind of depends on how important a
debugger is to you it has sort of the
standard graphical debugger features the
nice thing about it is that it's
actually it's a native Mac application
so if feels right at home on your
computer you have the same keyboard
shortcuts that you're used to you have
the same control layout and so on so it
it feels right if you're used to using
your Mac the editor sort of a standard
you know you have the syntax
highlighting it has it has some level of
code assist I have yet to find a good
code assist that works well with Python
something about the dynamic nature of
the classes if you start adding number
of variables in class methods the code
assist doesn't really know about it but
you know you can do things like start
typing rate and it pops up a thing that
helps you it works somewhat but not
really well enough for me to use it all
the time
the interface is quite flexible sort of
the standard layout is a separate window
for every source file and then one
window for the main project but if you
don't like that you can tell it to group
all the source windows together you
could turn that window off if you wanted
this thing to be smaller and just kind
of sit over at the edge and if you group
them all together then they're all in
one editor you can flip back and forth
with the menu if you're more sort of
from a visual studio background you want
it all in one giant window you can turn
this on make it fullscreen so kind of
set up the way you want let me put that
back
when you're actually in the editor they
have some nice features they have this
perhaps was not the right file to
demonstrate that they have dropdowns
basically gives you a summary of the
file which I can't find a good one to
demo that with so you know it shows you
the class the methods that are there and
you can select one it jumps straight to
it you slept a different method it'll
jump to that method if you like putting
lots of classes and want a file that's a
nice feature another way to jump around
they have a thing called bookmarks I
haven't seen this in any other IDE I
assume it's there and I just haven't
noticed it you can set bookmarks so I
bookmark than the main function of my
app but block this class definition you
can jump back and forth that way they
have a finding project kind of a
standard thing so I can find every
instance of convert I could do a global
replace if I wanted to replace all of
that if I decide I didn't like the name
convert anymore
it has integration with subversion
perforce CVS it it's not something I'm
going to demo because I don't have the
network connection it uses the file
merge program to do the comparisons
that's another Apple application it
looks like that it gives you a nice
side-by-side graphical diff
it has an integrated help system which
is helpful if you like that sort of
thing
like Keith though uh normally I have a
web browser running with the help loaded
in that so it has the integrated help I
don't use it so that's just sort of the
the basic environment again a nice
Python IDE but where it really shines is
if you want to make programs for OS 10
using Python then the integration with
apples tools really starts to shine
there's two main tools I'm gonna doing
for time I'm doing alright
sure let's go ahead and make a new
project a lot of the help or Xcode in
python comes with this PI obscene
project it's basically the Python
bindings for the cocoa application
library and they also give you some
extra tools like these project templates
came from them so a lot of the credit
for how this works goes to that project
so we can just either set up a quick
little project right here unfortunately
my computer shows this bug where it
doesn't make the executable for you
it's supposed to
let's see if it runs
all right so there's just a quick
application the template the project
template has already set up our district
tales file for us so this is the disk
utility a sort of takes care of that you
don't to worry about it and it runs it
through a dist you tails packager that
gives you an dot app which is sort of
the app bundle is the way Mac os10
programs are packaged so behind the
scenes when I did that run it packaged
it all up into an app and ran it so you
don't have to worry about that it kind
of takes care of it for you
the other thing that you get is the not
that interface builder I close that one
this is kind of like Glade Visual Studio
has something kind of like this you can
I want to go ahead and just make a
little decimal to hex converter just to
show sort of how they would just drag
out
sorry
the little lines that it's giving me
positioning guides they sort of help you
line stuff up according to the aqua user
interface guidelines help you get
everything consistent the cocoa
framework has a pretty strong
model-view-controller architecture so
that can I takes care of setting up the
view let's do the model this is kind of
a weird thing you can define classes
through their interface builder so I'm
gonna subclass NS object call it numbers
instantiate the class so now we have our
model object apple gives us some
controllers for free I'll add one of
those and then we will hook up the
controller to the model connect it and
the last thing we need to hook up the
views to the model I'm going to do that
with bindings which is an apple
technology for basically getting the
data back and forth between the view and
the model well bind this one to a key
called decimal and this one to a key
called hex so I'll go ahead and save
that I'm also going to set that flag and
that flag so as I type it'll continually
update so that's the interface hi
obscene gives us a tool called nib class
builder you run that on the interface
file that we just made and it spits out
sort of skeleton code for your various
classes I'm going to steal the numbers
one that we just made I'm gonna paste it
in here
and then to save time I'm gonna cheat
and just fill in that class the rest of
the way I'll sort of explain what it's
doing briefly but I don't want to go
into the details decimal it's gonna get
hooked up to the decimal key that we
bound the one text field to the other
text field we bound to hex and it has a
getter and a setter and then the last
thing that to do is tell Coco hey when
we change decimal notify everyone that
hex has also changed because those two
are tied together
have to import this library and I have
to add that as well
hopefully it'll run
all right
so if we type in different stuff we get
different values if we type in you know
something down here we get that so it's
kind of a weird thing to have this
interface builder that's also kind of a
graphical code editor it's a little
weird but it's very powerful it fits
well with Python it's very fast Python
is very fast one more thing I wanted to
show just throw on a button there to
quit I think I have time
the quit button will basically call an
action on one of our classes so I'll add
an action to our app delegate called
quit and then I will connect the quit
button to that action and I'll save it
and we'll jump back go ahead and write
the quit when you're using PI op see all
the colons that objective-c likes to use
turn into underscores so that's why
there's underscores there
and s application is a Coco class shared
application picks up our application and
we will tell it to terminate
so that's what it takes I could look up
a button has any questions yes yes
unfortunately I have not the largest
thing I've made is not available under
this user account
it's basically a simulation of stewing
behaviors for little AI creatures but
it's not terribly large and it's
certainly not in a releasable state all
right again
the sample code here and some links to
references are on my website thank you
mark that was really neat yes well I
mean I I think was very nice having
those those other presentations and and
I really appreciate them because I did
learn some things I was really impressed
with this last presentation the
Macintosh I definitely want to get rid
of this PC business and get on the Mac
like my like my daughter and wife but at
the moment business seems to prefer the
the PC world um well the first thing I
hope some of you noticed about about
Wing IDE is that bringing it up the
first time is mighty slow this is a
three year old laptop and it's so it's a
1 gigahertz penny and nothing really
special 760 you know three quarts of a
gig or whatever of memory so it's not
especially powerful in terms of what we
have available today but so it does take
a little bit of time for it to come up
that I think is is my major concern
about this I think these other things
are fairly minor but that's that that's
sort of something if you have a slow
machine you might want to consider the
winged ID runs not only on Windows but
on Linux and Macintosh as well so runs
across all the platforms and really
that's one of things that attracted me
to Python in the first place which I
imagine is probably some of the things
attracted you to Python was the fact
that it was so cross-platform
and that meant that you could really
write it once and run it everywhere and
wing I have not used wing on any
platform except Windows but I what I do
run a lot of Linux systems and also met
VST systems but typically as servers and
not so much in the in the sort of
desktop environment but not only can you
get a wing to work on those environments
but if you need to they will let you
compile the source code on your machine
if you have some particular weird OS
that they don't completely support so
the first thing you see about this when
you bring this up are these wing-tipped
if they're just little love just like
you might expect in any sort of
environment I find them kind of useful
if I can at least spend a second looking
at them just an any complicated tool
like this it's hard to learn at all and
so it's really a matter of learning that
piece of it that you need to get your
job done at least that's the way I look
at it so what I'm really going to show
you where stuff that I use in nowhere
near the whole the whole environment
because it's way too big doing this to
show you in this short time if I knew it
all anyway which I don't so so here's
here's this environment I thought the
first thing I do is show you how the
these different windows make available
certain features so let's start with
this one on the bottom what we have is
this is where the exceptions in stack
and so when we're running some code will
be get to will get to see the stuff here
and I'll show you that right now
we'll just come up here start a new file
I'll say y equals 0 or 9 divided by 0
rather something that generates an
exception hit f5 this allows me to set
some arguments if I'm gonna have a
command line type arrangement if I want
I don't need to have this each time you
can see there's a checkbox right here I
can uncheck this now this come up but
but the purpose is here I'm gonna leave
that on so when we exit and we're gonna
save this this random file that sounds
like a good plan and that seems like a
good enough place at the moment
and anyway we unfortunately have a 0
division error and there it is and weak
and we could find out where it is and
you can see that this is very simple but
if you had a large complicated program
this would tell you where this exception
occurred it would necessarily be divided
by 0 just be uncaught exception and I
found this really really helpful plus
there's the stack data in this case it's
not especially interesting but but there
it is as well over here are a number of
different and I just made that go away
our number of different tabs which are
useful for
seeing what your program is doing in
this case debug io is what your program
when your program prints to the poor or
accepts input this is where you do it in
this particular window but what makes
python at least for me so so powerful is
the ability for me to drop into a shell
type something else you know and try it
out what does that do oh okay great so
now I know what it does if you don't
mean if you don't use that feature of
Python you're really not using the power
of it but I think about about wing is of
course maybe you have some sort of
complicated thing that you're developing
right here and you generated some big
list you do some test case or whatever
it is you say well you know what what I
really need is I need to you know add
something here so I can split these like
this or I can say well geez give me give
me let me insert gee another Python
shell great so now I have an another
shell there which is completely
independent of the first and I can do
that sort of ad infinitum and and this
Holt so I'll get rid of that stuff now
show you a little bit about this on this
side has your is your project and source
key pending that's and source browsers
and then down here is the so-called
source of citchen which I'll show you
about right now so I'm going to type in
a little program to show you just sort
of how this how this works
so so oh wait let me get rid of all this
stuff I have here first please the first
thing or rather this thing I want to
tell you about the Edit about the
editors are it can emulate many kinds of
editors it does visual studio key
bindings VI vim key bindings brief Kim
bindings key bindings and of course the
only important key bindings Emacs and
and and and that's why and that's in
fact why I bought this product I looked
at all of the different products out
there and I said which one has Emacs key
bindings in sort of an IDE because I'll
probably use extra features but I know
I'll use Emacs so anyway this is what I
have it set for at the moment in it and
they and they've just come out with this
new 2.1 version which which better
emulates really max because it was a
little bit funky at first but it's but
it's actually a lot nicer now so anyway
so I'm gonna type in this program it's a
small so you can see immediately you get
this source assistant right so so it's
just like standard I des type that from
in this case it knows happens to know
I'm typing two keys to do this and
remember when you get good at this you
can really go go
okay so and then now that's a mistake so
let me go so let me show you how that
works so I'll type FL what I really
wanted was this one here and I can type
tab or escape tab gives me an escape
gets rid of it and then just stops the
symbol at that size so okay so this is a
pretty simple application I and excuse
me while I type it in here for a moment
but when I try this in the back just
before here I made a mistake doing it
that was actually pretty cool because we
could see how the debugger work works
but let me just type this and you can
see that some of these are available but
not all hope and I should bring up this
and you because now as I'm as I'm
working on this you can see that I'm
getting some additional information
about this this type box the likely
class and what it is and and some
definition about it so it let's see so
let me just keep going though wrong
right okay and
oops so you I find this feature helpful
but you have to also remember that most
of the time the typing in of the code is
not the is not the thing that really
takes the time it's debugging afterwards
and I think that this thing is I'll tell
you some of the features of that in a
moment too
you probably some of you already see and
know what this does but I'm almost
almost finished here get this the big
forever while loop of course you get
your automatic indentation in fact
there's one of it let me show you a
quick feature here so I can take some
sort of subset of this stuff like this
I'm using the mouse now and I can so
we've sort of indent that sort of as
much as you want or indent it as much as
you like you can match indents to other
other pieces of code so doing that so
you can grab code and paste it and
really fast and quick very fast and get
it where you need to go mostly I think
this is sort of it I think it was like a
programmer amplifier which is why I
really really rather like this let me
finish this here so we're almost here
can't spell
pause that's wrong eyes there we go
okay
all right so that's the that's the rest
of this program now in order to run a
program we hit f5 or you can do some
other things once again let's save this
and okay
and if I have made some mistakes that
hopefully will tell us but if they
haven't oh I guess I didn't make any
mistakes I apologize for not making
mistakes but anyway this is this this
little program that we just typed in
right here and of course um you know
this is it's the standard Python stuff
that there's all the right scaling
remember now we're running we're running
right now under way so if we had some
debugging statements in there we could
we could stop at at that point to make
some changes and there's another really
cool feature about weighing and that is
that if you if you have an exception and
take an exception and it's unhandled or
something that sort and you get into
that environment you can change
variables right there and then rerun
that piece without having to start it
over from scratch so if you have a bunch
of state that got set up and you have a
little piece you want to play with you
can do that with Wayne so anyway so this
is anyways and as usual just sort of us
sort of standard environment let me just
change gravity a little bit there and
you know we'll see a little bit of
difference so anyway so that's pretty
easy to use that's and that's that I
wanted to show you one of the larger
projects I didn't and so the first thing
I want to point about this is that try
doing some of this stuff under idle some
time because idles TK based and I found
that that was really really hard when I
first started writing Python I had to
very quickly right at GUI and I really
have written one other GUI in my life
one of the GUI application my life and
it was pretty darn simple so I felt a
little bit intimidated but since then
since you know there was a GUI built in
I just said well let's go try it I mean
let's go try TK what the hell it can't
be that bad well it was okay for a while
but what I found was the trying to run
idle and then tryna run TK was really
driving me mad and so one of this is
this environment there's no real problem
with that the I ended up using using the
same project so that that did run TK so
let me just find that here from I know I
just get that proud of that thing here
for a second
this is probably pretty gross doing it
like this but too bad so so anyway this
this consists of just a number it's just
looks like just a big pile of Python and
that's certainly what it looks like but
again if I execute this under under here
there's a sort of let's see so I'm gonna
open up something here this is some
giant files so this is its it's a pretty
pretty reasonable I mean it states for
what we needed it certainly served our
purposes and it just and it works fine
and you know has buttons and they they
kind of do their thing and all this
stuff sort of works so but this is all
TK and and I never have any any problem
running writing these simple TK apps in
in wing IDE I wanted to mention some
other things that this thing had in
addition to name two bookmarks yes I
think it's WX but um is it that right
yeah
yes well if you eyeballs environment is
built out of TK widgets and so when you
use it either gets confused and so you
you have slop and or or it crashes or
wedges or in some way or something like
that and it just doesn't happen so what
I find is that TK actually is sort of
okay for small things that you want to
whip together just so you have some kind
of control panel but if you want to do
something really real which you which
you want I think is is something else so
let me let me close this project and
also let's get rid of this too which I
will oh yeah I I don't need to show you
you got uni max guy stuff like this or
stuff like this right I mean you know
all that stuff so it does all that and a
whole lot more so let me just close this
off and show you show you how well how
its integrated in this environment so I
do have so I finally figured out that
yes I want to use double x windows
because it was so more power so I should
so what I can do is just take for
example this this thing here and drag it
over here and and there it is so there's
this application now this screen
resolution isn't quite right for this
this particular thing but you know if
this is a this is a WX application run
inside of wing idÃ¦an all these things
all these things are removal and they
sort of work but they're just not
connected to anything right and these
things here whatever but they're fairly
easy to connect and I can show you some
of that code what I also want to show
you is how that was built this is a
separate application called WX designer
I mentioned I try to sneak this in
Maryland because I use it a lot so this
this thing here all this this crap here
you know I I changed a little of it to
my name and stuff like that but most of
this most of this stuff is in this other
file now bring over here like that and
oh this crap here I'll show you
man there it is there it is all this
application it's all generated by by
the the builders so outlet so let me
show you that too now and then out then
I'll wrap up and tell you a little bit
the last few think a few features about
this that I think of pretty amazing so
this is the WX designer that that I that
uses this and this is that particular
notebook that we just saw this is not
part of wing this is part of the WX
designer it's a different program that
cost money but it integrates well with
with wing and you can see that that even
though wing is written in WX having this
additional application right n WX
Thursday there's just no interference
and it works very smoothly even on these
ole occult really old machines so anyway
this is this this is a this is what I
did in order to build build this thing
up and it's just like you would expect
for any sort of builder is this stuff is
here and you can type in there and
change it and whatnot you know anyway
each of these is available and you know
their peculiar coding mechanism does
take you too long to figure out what's
up with most of this stuff does yes I
believe it's written in Python it's
certainly slow enough
okay so that's a it I don't have the
exact number here it's it's it's I think
it's around 30 bucks if you want the
personal edition if you want the
professional Edition it's 180 bucks
which is what I'm showing you here and
if you get it on multiple operating
systems like like two up or if it's
personal it's like 30 and 45 and 60 and
it's like one 182 something three ninety
five four three hours so for one two or
three operating systems there are some
features that are disabled in the in the
personal version but for example there
is some really nice stuff here this
thing this thing can do and I've never
tried it though
but Alex recommended this to me a long
time ago I said Alex you know I'm
looking for an excuse me just say I'm
looking for an IDE and I really want
something sort of reasonable he thought
for a really long time he says try wing
you know hard time remembering the name
but it's just try wing because at one
point they had a a plone bug that they
just could not fix he was on some
project it was some nasty plone bug but
with this he was they were able to run
it run clone under this and find this
was apparently a pretty rare strange bug
so um and some guy that they brought in
was a really sort of wizard at this sort
of thing so I realized well you know
being pretty good at this might have
some future job opportunities so I
wanted to be good at that
but it also has integration with CVS
version perforce at sea and if you and
of course plum and zope and I think a
few other sort of a sort of stuff that
we use or we could use all the time
anyway
uh-huh that's interesting
boy let's see what else yeah unless
there's a unless people want to play
with this or I know anymore about it but
that's pretty fast overview yeah Ezard
did it yeah I'd know I'd know how to
keister there oh I shouldn't hold on to
this because this is random axis and so
if you have something you're interested
in talking about and sharing with other
people you might raise your hand now and
spend a minute telling us about it and
then we'll find you when we're finished
and get together little groups or
questions whatever you are guess it's
random access job opportunity to
announce hi my name is Dave Patterson I
work for avatar communications in
Redwood City and I'm in the software QA
group and currently were developing a
test automation framework built in
Python so I think that this might be the
perfect place to come and find
candidates so if you need any or if
you're interested come talk to me and I
have some information for you thank you
thank you Dave
anybody else
hmm well what do you think should we
close down a few minutes early and then
go into oh we got one oh goody hi yes
okay just a couple of things um who's
going to ask on in Portland this month
that's sort of a Python conference I
think Rob I think you're giving a talk
there too right okay
anybody else om he's giving a talk to
its the 20s tutorial day it's like the
23rd and then like the conferences on
24th through the 28th so Wednesday
through Friday or 25th through the 28th
so it's like Sunday Monday Tuesday Yeah
right so two days of tutorials and then
three days of conference so that's
coming in like two weeks for those of
you who are going try and take notes at
whatever talks you go to maybe we can
give a rundown at a future Bay Piggy's
meeting okay so that's one thing second
thing is I'm also working part-time for
a company that's looking for people so
Python my sequel sequel object web where
cheetah alright so come see me for that
and also I'm having another public
Python course in August that's about a
month from now and it's gonna be at the
San Francisco Airport location so if you
have a team that needs Python training
come see me
so that's Oh book update a lot of
editing going on right now I've finished
all of the all of the the red ink type
stuff and so now the compositors and the
typesetting people are putting the final
pages together and the book should be
out kind of end of August - beginning of
September right around the time when -
five comes out coincidentally and and it
new start of the next school year - so
you can pre-order on Amazon today all
right thanks
thank us here we have kin can see heart
oh I just thought I'd mention that my
former well hopefully to be former
employer I now work at the internet
chess club but my employer before that
needs to replace me and I don't have
time to keep working for them and find a
replacement but what I need is somebody
who knows soap and embedding things
Python on hardware so if your hardware
person and as a person talk to me
thank you can JJ we're always looking
for speakers for Bay Piggy's next month
we have a speaker for half the meeting
but and he might go the whole meeting if

out of paper things like that anybody
wants to chat to talk about hardware
