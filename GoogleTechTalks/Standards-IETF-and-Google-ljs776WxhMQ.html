visiting Googler from Trondheim Norway
which is nine time zones east of here
and I'm here to talk about things that
affect both sides of the Atlantic and
the other side of the Pacific team
namely standards ITF and email address
internationalization now that's she
talks for the price of one in case you
missed that because I thought hey I'm
here now actually I can talk about
anything I wanted I'll talk about
everything I wanted so just just to
check if anyone's awake you have you
have opportunity to ask are you
interested on three points standards at
Google
IETF and email address
internationalization so who's interested
in standards at Google a lot of people
ITF slightly few people email address
internationalization even few people
okay I'll start start long and go short
at the end but lots of room for asking
questions so
the others said that so the standards it
integral it is really about okay
Google's doing standards work Google's
in fact sending a lot of people to a lot
of places doing a lot of talk and a lot
of writing
that's what standards work is talk right
and talk some more so why are we doing
it what does it matter and how can we do
it better well the standard interview
plan was intended to help you find the
answers to that question now and it was
intended to make sure that Googlers know
what we are doing in relation to each
other one of the more embarrassing
situations you can be in is if you come
to account sustainless group and and say
stand up in the meeting and say this is
the dumbest I've ever heard of
nobody should ever think of that and
discover that the guy is presenting it
was also working for Google it's okay to
have the argument actually because
sometimes Googlers do dumb stuff to
surprise me but it's not okay to be
surprised by that in a public setting
so the standards intergroup that was set
up to find a way to gather the
information about standards and
standards work inside Google we're not
in the business of creating standards at
the interior but we're not in even in
the in the business of saying what you
can and cannot do that's your call your
manager's job but when we have
identified that it's in Google's
interests to participate in standards
making outside of Google
we urge implore X and exhort you to come
along and share the information so other
Googlers can find
so the way we have started doing that is
by talking
I mean Stannis work is all about talking
so we talk to each other's - we started
a series of tech talks check the fish
for details this is one of them
this is actually a tech talk about the
idea because I'm upcoming tech talks
about html5 which is important for
anyone who wants to use the web 10 years
from now C++ which I've heard a few
duelist like to use in a daily work and
Yaba and just today I managed to twists
the arm of someone in the legal
department to say promised to give a TED
talk on patents and intellectual
property policy as seen from Google
which can be a all too interesting area
it's the kind of interesting thing you
you don't want to be interested in but
it's necessary to know if you go to our
site go slash standards which is a go to
I actually stole from the user-interface
team or convinced them to give to me you
will get the lowdown on what standards
group we know about that if we
participate in and I name names of a few
Googlers that participate occasionally
you will find information like specific
standards that you need to know about
and all that stuff of course I like the
ITF page on that site best because
that's what I've been writing you'll
find the information about a lot of
working groups and a lot of Google is
participating in those working groups
but what you'll find in most cases when
you go to the site is that there's some
information missing
the martini information missing that you
know please add it it's our site all of
us
so questions about standards intergroup
let's there are two and we the reason
they are two is that where have been
slacking deleting the one on the one on
the waking there one on the site but we
at least managed to get the draft of the
front page on the wiki says go see the
site's version because this is out of
date I don't think we're more if you
discover the third one drop me Lana I'll
kill it well there's always a thousand
ways of getting to the same sites at
Google so some sauna might actually be
different paths but the standard site is
the one that way been the only one that
has said that the standard interview
bill has worked on for a year so all the
others are clearly up to date so the
question was why are the so many
standard site there are also some pages
that people maintain on Stannis of
interest on ourselves and if they don't
have pointers on the standards wiki
understand a site I hate the word site
by the way if they don't have points on
a standard site to their page they're
being bad boys and need to be reported
to the Stannis police that's me but
people do what they do
other question okay you know what okay
so the question is do you have a regular
meeting that we have a weekly meeting of
the intergroup clip itself that's
usually an sayyida and a few others so
that that's more or less to check that
anyone who's promised to do something
eventually gets beaten over the head
because he hasn't done it we also have a
mailing list which is what I think of us
the more important most important place
standards this guess where anyone has
welcome is welcome to post Sonny's
related questions and participate in the
discussion about the right answer it's
what the right answer is
the question is how does that funding
for stannis work work and the answer is
very ad hoc I mean the the person who
sends the Heda to to work on standards
which he does more less full-time at the
moment it's Vint Cerf or internet
evangelist well the person who signed
the check for sponsoring next IDF
meeting was Christa Bowman of the open
open source office and most of the
people who go to Stannis meetings go to
the meeting on the on the dime of their
project because the project thinks it's
important for them to go so yes it's
very ad hoc and so he does been trying
to collect information on how much we
actually spend only its various
activities it's difficult
very ad hoc and very personal initiative
and that's how Google works and that's
how it should be but please share the
information
sorry Vint
well his apart from evangelizing his
working of chair in the ideas on the
International domain name
internationalized domain names I don't
think is actively involved in an in oh
yes it's also involved in an
interplanetary internet working an
iterative or I forget forgotten what
they call it this week it's long long
delay interment connectivity networks
and it goes around the world telling
people how wonderful open networks are
which is important
sorry
who here is working on standards just a
few people yep you need to get out more
because I mean the whole thing about the
Internet is that it hangs together
because people are able to communicate
and the reason people are able to
communicate this that I agree upon how
to communicate and if you have agreement
on how to communicate that's a standard
the whole GData initiative for instance
is funded founded upon a number of data
format standards that have come from
outside Google that we have picked up
built on and used and the reason why
these things have become popular is that
people trust us and trust the standards
that they know what things actually mean
what they're supposed to be be like and
trust us to follow the standards so
communication is actually essential for
standards no standards are essential for
communication and since communication is
essential to Google but yes follows now
switching topics internet Engineering
Task Force IETF main developer of
Internet related protocol since forever
or 1981 whichever comes first it's an
organization that is a bit unusual among
standards organization it that in that
it's formally composed of individuals
not companies people who come from all
over the all all over the space like 40
different countries at the last meeting
from very many different backgrounds
research institutions universities
network operators internet service
vendors and a few people from Google
I think we found six of us at last I def
meeting Dublin and the unusual thing of
being as an organization of individuals
is that we do not claim to represent our
employer by what they say at an IDF
meeting which is very important to get
the conversation flowing because then
you don't have to check back with
headquarters to figure out whether they
agree with you or not but I think it's
quite googly and the weight the whole
organization is founded this because
people pay to show up to meetings of
course it's a bit of a bizarre thing
that most of the important work at the
IDF happens on mailing lists which are
free to participate in anyone can sign
up anyone come participate and not pay
anything at all well the whole
organisation is being run from the
profits they take in on meetings but it
works and from the internet society
a lot of stuff that happens at the IDF
is not Google's business we depend on
the fact that people make standards that
make the internet run that makes it
possible to do open networks and have
packets delivered from one one end of
the world to another because that
enables us to deliver what we do which
is effectively one service everywhere
but we care that those things get done
get on competently and that they're not
hijacked by people with interests in
making sure that they can't control the
internet because the experience of
people doing stuff in networks is that
if a central authority controls the
content
innovation is stifled if you have to
modify the core of the network in order
to make new things work they don't
happen and so in order for that to be
the changing flexible communications
media that we call the Internet we have
to have open standards anyone can
connect if they have the business
agreement to do so we have a consistent
way of viewing the service from one end
to another that doesn't depend on
everything in the middle and of course
the ITF also talks to end-to-end
protocols I have on my list here a
couple of slides native
the list of I deleted that I had the
list of what criticals the idea actually
worked on things like the DNS like HTTP
like TLS which happens to be the only
security protocol that is has
significant deployment on the world on
the Internet today it's also a rather
useless security protocol for a few
things but that's another matter so I
put up this slide because having the
fundamental core principle of ITF in
your mind is useful and think about it
the goal of the ITF is to make the
internet work better
it's not the goal of the ITF has not to
be a large standards organization it's
not to make people competing it makes no
make the internet work better and it's
an open process organization trying to
achieve technical competence through
having people volunteer to do work and
we have this funny thing called the
rough consensus and running code
we reject Kings presidents and voting we
believe in rough consensus and running
code rough consensus roughly means that
if you can't convince most people that
you're that you're right sharp if you
can raise a technical objection and
people can understand it and find it
valid
we don't have consensus we have to fix
it and you can't be overridden by a 51%
majority at the time people develop the
first Wi-Fi crypto the web there was a
when a number of people in the standards
development organization of that they
actively that said this is security this
security is broken this is going to make
people vulnerable to attacks - sniffing
- whatever evils occur but there was a
51% majority in the room that it was
more important to have the product out
and had to have the product secure
that's the insight as a classic example
of the ITF doesn't work like that
and of course if you can't make it work
it's wrong there are lots of things you
can make work that are still wrong but
if you can't make it work it's
definitely wrong so running code prove
that it can be done not the only
organizational space
some of you might have heard of a small
small group called the w3c or world wide
web consortium or organization that's
slightly older than the ITF called the
International Telecommunications Union
which dates from the 19th century and so
on so forth
ITF thinks of itself as taking care of
the core of the Internet and whatever is
necessary to get the job done so reason
why as numpy is in the ITF is because we
decide that in order to make the
internet work it has to be manageable in
order to have a heterogeneous network
manageable we have to have a management
protocol that they actually agree on and
thus we created SNMP now whether SNMP is
a good or bad protocol is a completely
different discussion but it's there and
it's much better than nothing there's a
working group in a in the ITF called
better than nothing security buttons
just there are people who have severe
doubts whether that is actually true but
anyway that's beside the point
so the way ITF works is everything
anything and all things are publicly
available you put all documents drafts
notes ministry and standards under that
freely available for anyone to download
and want to read anyone to copy and I
want to the published copy is off its
open damn it which of course means that
of the 30 odd rfcs I have written there
are literally hundreds of copies on them
of them out on the web and every so
often Google alerts fine and finds a new
copy and tells me about it
that's the most important the largest
source of alerts for my name and the
process open anyone anywhere well anyone
anywhere is allowed to participate at
every time any time except for two
people
now there were actually two people who
made such obnoxious fools of themselves
that we decided that these two people
are not welcome as ideas participants
the two out of six million is that a bad
bad and open decision making that is to
say there's no Star Chamber we don't do
things in secret we do things by having
discussions calling for consensus and
seeing how it goes
you're supposed to be able to figure out
what happened well sometimes you know
sometimes it comes figure out what
happened and sometimes even the people
who made the decision to contract can't
figure out what happened but that's just
life the question was whether we get
people from companies with a vested
interest saying people to filibuster
well the mostest I'm at one IDF meeting
where there was an important meeting
that it was not a vote there was
consensus called and a number of people
came walking up the stairs and say we
had two meetings in the same conference
center and the ITF was to the right and
the other meeting was left and a bunch
of people in suits came walking up the
stairs and said Oh where's the vault on
IPSec and that must be over there
we don't do votes any idea so they all
run run over there and came to late for
the meeting
well it has happened that people show up
that seemed to have the effect of trying
to derail the process mostly I think
that it's because both people are too
full of themselves sometimes I suspect
that they have been sent out by the
companies to make trouble for the
stannis process but without the company
telling them they're just all that way
by Nature
but in general I think people are fairly
well behaved
one reason being that actually it's a
culture of personal participation if you
stand up in a meeting and make it and
make your best effort to derail the
process well people will say that the
Redman company try to derail the process
but they will also say that Jim X it's
not a credible engineer so you lose face
personally so that happens intellectual
property rights is a lock everyone hates
it but we have to deal with someone said
that the word intellectual property
rights are actually a horrible example
of hijacking the discussion by defining
the terms it should be more like
government-granted monopolies on certain
things there's a requirement in the ITF
that because it's an open process we
can't even consider things that are
secret we have had examples of people
working for no such agency coming after
participants are saying you shouldn't
really do that and without being able to
say why that's very hard to deal with
because it's an open process but in
general its openness anyone can
implement anyone can come see what
impetus anyone can see the basis of
discussions so seekers are out the other
thing is that the ITF as an organization
is small and does not have billions of
dollars in cash reserves which means you
make the rules so that suing the ITF is
either pointers are useless that among
other things means that the idea of
never ever ever says this patent is
invalid or this document belongs to
someone or anything like that it just
can't say it we can place the
information in front of people and let
them to draw their own conclusions which
very often will mean that will be the
conclusion that this patent show doesn't
know what he's talking about but the ITF
doesn't take a position so on patents if
you know about one of the few patents
Google has and go to an ITF meeting and
you hear about something that is about
this patent
the ITF will ask you for rear to a
disclose that you have the patent that
Google has the patent and B it will ask
you for a reassurance that it will be
able to it will be available than their
fair and equitable license whatever that
means the working group will then decide
usually it will flame you for having
patents at all and then it will tear
your license like license statements to
shreds because it's not it it's not what
they would like to see and then they
will go on and and standardize the
technology anyway though it decides on
each individual individual case Google
doesn't want to be in the business of
stopping standards from happening so we
have a very liberal policy of saying if
as that patent is related to a standard
go talk to legal they'll write your
disclosure saying it's okay we won't
harm anyone and then get them to make a
disclosure now that was the tech the the
background of how the IDF works I am
I suppose you're thoroughly confused as
to what the purpose of all this
exercising and ruling rulemaking and
talking talking and talking and talking
it's all about so I'll do a few slides
on what does last time we had six people
join up for the IDF meeting and we
actually got three of them to contribute
to the notes on what happens so if you
go to the standard site and search for
IDF 72 you will find the URL that is
clearly invisible down here and where
the notes from the meeting so
making a report from the IDF meeting is
like the story about the people the five
people who met the elephant in the
darkroom ipv6 ipv4 all ipv4 addresses in
the world will be allocated by october
2011 that means a dramatic change in
their marketplace on how you build
networks we have haven't the foggiest
idea of what it will shift to but it
means that people who think in terms of
gia plans now have the end of ipv4 or
free ipv4 addresses within their GM
plants which has led to some people
taking ipv6 more seriously including
google and one of the problems we have
with ipv6 is that if you have an ipv6
only node it tends to want to reach
stuff out on the internet of ipv4
devices like yahoo.com
I mean google.com you can reach over
ipv6 or I think it's it's not good will
come you can eat your rock music but
there are other sites and Google
surprisingly and not pity is a mechanism
by which you can use ipv6 to cut to
connect to a nut box
that translate your ipv6 and ipv4 which
means that you can still get to anywhere
you could before even though you only
have ipv6 on your box the bad thing
about it is that it doesn't work for
some cases in particular it does some
bizarre mangling of DNS packets that
people don't like especially people who
think about security I mean who needs
the Kaminski bag when you have when you
are have official permission to mangle
the packets
so a year ago I the ITF said that I
pivot net pts declare historical because
we don't like it anymore and half the
community applauded and they are the
other half coming half went to went
crazy say you can't possibly do that
you're declaring yourself irrelevant and
whatever but they're now trying to
actually fix the problem since that
getting some standards for being at an
ipv6 site and connecting to an ipv4 site
that is actually are actually useful and
not too harmful we'll see but Google is
actually getting a lot of practical
experience from ipv6 and it's better
than a lot of people thought given what
some people thought that's not a strong
statement it
a year ago many people were worried
about the fact that we're creating new
routes on the Internet at a rate that
was higher than Moore's Law we've
currently passed two hundred and seventy
thousand routes in some other route us
on the systems and it doesn't seem to be
slowing down this little break here is
the last time someone got worried about
the issue by the way so worrying in
public sometimes helps but this is where
when we started getting started getting
worried about the issue last time and
you as you see that has absolutely no
effect this worse maybe it's because we
have a lot of proposals for solutions
and all of them have spectacularly
failed to get deployed and nowadays
people are so worried about ipv4
extortions that they kind of stopped
worrying about this one which worries me
DNS is there another fun topic the
domain name system has a feature called
DNS rack which is a way of putting
digital signatures on all the records in
Adina's well of course there are a few
more details like key management
I mean it's so useful to have a digital
signature if you don't know whether it's
just the key or not so there are a few
problems but the Kaminski attack where
Dan Kaminsky showed that you could make
any recursive resolver in the DNS
handout fake data in about five minutes
kind of scared people a little bit they
rolled out the fix which means that
Moore's Law will actually allow us
another 18 months before before we're in
a
as bad a situation again so we need you
should do something serious about
security of the DNS because we're doing
so many things by just looking things up
in an DNS and saying oh that's the truth
we'll do what that tells us that's it
would be kind of nice too hard myths and
one of my other hats this as a board
member of ICANN the organization that is
supposed to take care of the root--so or
sometimes it feels like it's supposed to
be the organization that takes care of
asking the Department of Commerce has
permission to take care of its own but
so signing the route is not the IDS
problem the technology is available
people who are interested in Daedelus
that technology need to note the keyword
and like three because that's an
important part of getting the probable
solutions but that's a leader one of the
nice things I managed to help through it
I can was that the root of the DNS
system is now available in my opinion
six major win and next year we will have
something other interesting in the roof
namely records that have don't have any
ASCII characters in them do you know
what this example I picked up actually
says what
it's Frank so now we have the domain
name Frank tangled Frank time that's
what that's the bad thing about picking
up examples when you're when you country
in the language remember so I have
worked a little bit on the problem of
getting this this standards for
internationalized domain names revised
because the standards were frankly not
that good and one thing I encountered
was Hebrew letter Hebrew letter Hebrew
letter dot three com.com now anyone can
try to guess it which sequence do these
do these letters occur on the wire I
mean if you if you don't have enough
headaches do mix left and right and
right left stuff in domains
why the question was why and he also is
not why not
I bet seriously if you have a user
interface where every single thing in it
is he Arabic characters and go right to
left and you're sending mail to your
grandmother and you're eight years old
and still haven't learned what an ASCII
character looks like having stuff that
has to be in the user interface and
isn't Arabic letters is actually a pain
now if I had to do this I would be in
trouble because I can't not only can't I
read those letters I can't even remember
them and so we have to find some way in
which the non ASCII characters are to be
allowed in DNS in identifies on the
internet and the kindest thing I can say
about this the solution found which is a
IDM is that it's the least horrifying of
the alternatives
at the at the time this was being
discussed just about everyone in a
discussion was I did Chinese Japanese
Korean or using Latin script since then
the Russians and the Greeks have also
joined and I mean the Israeli people who
were part of the discussion at that time
so nobody with his brains working would
ever want to put Hebrew letters in the
domain name it turns out that they were
not only they're not the only people in
town there are people doing Hebrew
letters in the rain hands now and so we
have made it very clear that the need
exists or people will use it if possible
but sometimes I wish the experiment had
failed who is responsible for keeping
our local acts
it's the registry the same one that is
supposed to take care of not registering
Microsoft with an with a zero and you
know how well that has worked so given
that we have reduced this to a
previously unsolved problem we do have
some recommendations for for what kinds
of rules the registry should have in
place and doing things like having both
Cyrillic and Latin and same domain name
is a really bad idea even though
toys-r-us would really like it so we
hope that at least some registries will
follow the recommendations but I mean
the ITF has no enforcement power
whatsoever I can have some enforcement
power on the first level registries but
if you want to
yes sir I am stupid calm and put Hebrew
names under that there's no enforcement
and mechanism in the world that will
prevent you from doing it of course I do
hope that your users will say stop doing
this to me is that Frank and Frank
bangles here yeah I decided to use the
same example so I would only screw up
once so this is actually what I'm doing
in the IDF
oh I've this so this is the last part of
my talk which is about email in Asia or
email in context with we're having to
use SKS conceptual onion and unusual so
a couple of years back where that was
actually before I started at Google with
these three years back and some of us
realized that people were doing various
hacks to get to this functionality to
have email addresses with
strange-looking characters in them they
were using the doing Hanks in different
ways and incompatible ways on my ways
that would create trouble
so the ITF a few people got together and
proposed to the ITF that the ITF should
make one all those trouble happen in one
place we want consistent trouble so we
started a working group called email
address internationalization eai with
the goal that it should be possible to
use email without a ski anywhere where
people cared about it that doesn't mean
that we pull all the ask out of the
protocol because protocol is protocol
inside the message the from header will
still be Fr
M : but what the identifies that the
user sees that no user interface can
possibly translate without doing it even
worse than Microsoft's exchange this has
to be internationalized able identifiers
so instead we could have done an ugly
hack like we did with the US and said
okay we'll just encode some part of the
ism anyone who looks at looks at what's
actually being sent will recoil in
horror and hide behind this and lets the
user interface again we decided not to
do that instead we created a
specification for how to put utf-8 text
into the email addresses and headers in
such a way that between cooperating
entities we could just send you the
effect safely and once we escaped from
the cooperating and this we could
downgrade to something that if not
pretty at least did no harm so the bad
news is it took a while the good news is
we're done basically the specifications
are published or ready to be published
the technology choices we did included
one particular thing that has very large
constants that is there is no
standardized way of encoding and
extended email address into an ASCII
address there are a number of technical
reasons for that but the main reason is
anything we can think of or one of the
main is meaning that any way we can
think of it doing this it's ugly enough
that people don't want to be known by
that name email address equals identity
so instead we said if you send a message
with a from address with squiggly
characters in it these are Norwegian
squigglies instead of the Chinese
queries are usually you also include a
piece that says this is my ASCII address
if you don't know what this stuff is use
that and so at the downgrading gateway
if the message hits are downgrading it
wait wait you can say okay
I know who this guy is it's that name
and we'll take away this take the eraser
out and say we'll use this instead and
that works
well what prevents the first one from
being bill at microsoft.com and the
second one from being something
completely different
well nothing actually it's the same
thing that prevents the first one from
being Bill at Microsoft come by itself
which is again nothing so we have
reduced it to a previously unsolved
problem there are actually cases where
people would that that way at least
discussed and work group with people
would want this address to be on one
system and this I'd just be enough on
another system perhaps they have a
system here that is able to handle
internationalized mail and our backup
system that is that is able to handle
ascii and not internationalized email so
if the group decide that we can't make
the decision for people how this
addresses should be related you just
have to
SPF that's a good question yeah SPF
would check this domain in the SMTP
envelopes because that's the way it
should hang together I think Frankie
element is writing a draft about that
but I haven't read the draft this I mean
the the Microsoft extensions to SPF and
would probably have to be updated to
handle this not properly because they go
into the into the headers not just the
envelope the original TF goes into the
envelope and the answers are different
for what question was whether the email
provider needs to have both the funnier
when they ask you as a domain name and
if they go into the right same place yes
if the if they go into different places
No so if I was experimenting with this
stuff at the very flaky provider I can
say okay he owns album that I know and
my regular provided album Dada know so
he gets everything that I don't want to
entrust to the to the experiment
I expect the default to be that to say
the normal case will be that that they
are controlled by the same provider and
that they actually end up in the same
mailbox but there's absolutely no way we
could mandate that and several technical
arguments why we shouldn't mandate that
technology choices page 2 when we
downgrade we downgrading means that you
throw away information of course we try
to not to throw away too much so when we
strip out the fields the funny funny
characters from the fields and encodes
what what cannot be stripped out we add
downgraded - headers to say this is what
it was before it got downgraded so that
if a main user agent is very intelligent
it can offer to display what the sender
intended it's that are what actually got
delivered
of course they sold it opens up a few
holes for spoofing that are quite easy
to imagine so the there are words that
in the document that say now if you
expected you have the original version
and what it got downgraded to and if
what did the Gotama gate to isn't what
they expected to be there better give
the user a warning but that was one of
the reasons why upgrading that is
creating what you think the user sent
instead of what they donate to is
explicitly said you never never ever do
this in the network you do this at the
users and site or not at all
of course transferring mail is not the
be-all and end-all you also have to
deliver the mail to the users IMAP and
POP all the popular protocols so in
order to have things behaving they all
new ways we installed a flag in both
protocols saying I can now ask for you
to behave like you know how to handle
you to hate me if the client doesn't
tell the server that the server will be
responsible for delivering only all all
Steinle even downgrading it David Astor
at one point we actually considered
whether the server should offer to
upgrade the mail so that all this town
green stuff got taken away but for all
the reasons we previously discussed no
we don't do that
yes
when downgrading the most common thing
that there's a long specification of do
this to this to this that to that but
most communists are seat 20 and 20 47
years the question was what what all
these fields being downgraded - the good
news is that the documents are actually
out as RFC's so you can look at the
header format and even to pay attentions
and the delivery status notifications
which had to be upgraded - because we
have put in those specifications that
that you could only deal with asking the
most important document that's missing
from this list is downgrade which is
finished essentially I just have to send
out the final message to the manias
thing you have the final chance to - to
object the last thing that happened to
it and then to send it to the ice tree
which was which will then approve it as
an experimental protocol these are
formal formally these are experimental
protocols that is there they are not
standards track they're not constantly
finished I hope that we got them right
so we don't have to change them but
we're not handing out promises we're
also hoping that we get the pop and I'm
at a nameless considerations out these
are documents that are existent draft
form we can download the draft and time
you like as usual any idea and I'm hope
that next year we will be able to say
okay we learned something we change the
standards in this way in this way in
this way otherwise it's now started
because we already have implementations
five different teams including
affiliates and four of the ACM next have
implementations that have a web made
clients where you can type
amazed they have modified an TAS that
are able to support both transferring
the messages to consenting adult antes
and to downgrade the message that if
necessary well the interesting thing
that there was that all of them when
they wanted to demonstrate
operation to all systems use Gmail as
the old system and nobody's demonstrated
how how I usually interface that
supports but I would look so we'll see
how that goes
sorry
yes bi-directional scripts that was just
a question for clarification I have not
heard anyone shaping to commercial
products yes but people tend to be cagey
about that summary last slide of the
presentation and I'm out of time so it
kinda fits many things going on at the
ITF and else wins tennis world Google
needs to know about a lot of what's
happening and there are a few pieces
where we really should try to influence
it because how it comes out matters to
us not just that it happens and the
reason to participate this that's the
way we learn that's the way you figure
out where we can be effective and make
things happen and that's what standards
in the group it is all about okay open
questions not wrong
maybe the city meadow without you
the question was whether really it
matters whether I used my Google address
or my personal email address when I join
I def mailing list personally I use my
personal email I mean this this one has
lasted me through three and Pryor's not
so it doesn't matter if you are it's
good to be open about who you are and
who you work for so that nobody can can
blame can't claim that you are trying to
secretly influence something secrets are
bad but if you want to use your personal
email address because that's got better
spam filters or better whatever no
problem yeah
so the question is why that didn't the
WGC clone the IDF model well that counts
actually connected to what Tim
berners-lee thought he was doing or what
they thought it could be selling what
w3c started off by promising not to be a
standards organization they imagined
that they would be a technology
development center with a with a staff
of tens or hundreds of technical people
actually doing and driving the
development work that takes serious
money and so the only place they could
figure out how to get money was from
memberships by corporations the ITF is a
shoestring operation by comparison to
the obvious EC the number of people who
get paid for working full-time in a in
in a IDF is approximately six on a good
day
a question was WTC wanted to be a
research organization and then how they
fall fall into be understand this
organization well it turned out that Tim
berners-lee also like being in control
and the ITF tends to want to be to have
relevant expertise on the standards as
it's developing after a while it was
pretty obvious that HTML all the people
who were expert in next HTML we're all
already going to they do enter the w3c
and so having an ITF standard for the
for HTML was kind of pointless I mean
why do it when nobody's listening
HTML 1.0 was actually an idea standard
one the first one the first one that was
remotely resembling sgml valley sgml
syntax so wqc developed into owning
specifications I think that's the polar
specifications not standards and it
seemed to work well for them and they
also ventured into things that ITF
wouldn't touch especially figuring out
new ways to do new stuff I don't think
the XML could have never have been
developed in the idea in the IDF there's
just so much complexity that in there
that we could never have managed to
agree to all of it the IDF tends to have
poor complexity but things fell out the
way they did there were a lot of
politics and company policies involved I
didn't participate that much India in
the WTC so the details will you left to
ask my next not even Rama
but that's how I think it happens
what is that so the question is who get
who is paying for implementing standards
and why and so I've seen some variants
of that scenario one is where nobody
wanted the standards anyway and one is
where the standard comes out and
specifies that there should do 15 things
and people do 3 of them also called
and a number of examples including it
including in your HTML and other places
where people actually implement all the
standards but then that they add on
their own extensions the reason why
people implement standards is because
it's generally because they want to
interoperate so in the case of where you
have either no dominant market player or
dominant markup a that is that has
customers that are asking for stannis
conformance you find that people
implement standards sometimes badly
sometimes where twists and tweaks that
nobody ever would think of I heard that
I heard a number of rumors but people
generally implement standards because
because they want to interoperate and as
long as the drive for interpretation is
there and as long as the customers are
smart enough and insightful enough to
say to tell the difference between
something that came to be a standard as
something that actually conforms to the
standard those standards will live some
standards die because sometimes because
they're bad standards
sometimes just because it was the wrong
stand at the wrong time
the most difficult thing you can do in a
stylish process is try to replace one
standard with another standard it's just
a little better it doesn't work people
keep on extending the old standard until
it dies from its own complexity so yes
there are a lot of that lot of dead
standards on someone deserve to be
others are say about that others are
just biting the time but there's no
funding central funding authority of
implementing standards companies do it
by themselves
so the question was whether the ITF has
been more successful bugger than that WC
and if so why and I paraphrase that a
lot so I would say that it's mostly true
even though they were what w3c has been
successful in its area and one one
possible reason for that this big is
actually a flipside it's a lack of
resource that the ITF has never had
anything apart from the volunteers
coming from the companies you know to
build the standards and the ITF has
insisted on not just taking things that
come flying over the wall it has
insisted on needing them until they're
done and that process when it works well
tends to simplify things and simpler
standards have a bigger chance of being
fully implemented so I think we've been
lucky I don't I don't know if it's
possible to clone that model the grid
forum tried the global grid forum tried
they just adopted that clone of the ITF
procedures I don't know how successful
they were but it takes a community and
communities are fickle things so lock
play they get played in my mind and
great part into it and I hope the WTC
managed to manage to have some luck too
okay my times out the questions think
there and out no questions from the
remote thank you all for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
