back these are the security talks the
best part of these talks is these tools
that are going to be talked about or of
going to be available to you
so first is gonna be costia from Soviet
Russia so he's come a long way to give
this talk so Kostya served the Brioni
and one thing he said he likes to do is
hike I don't know about him but I had
been hiking up and down the stairs here
at Google so that's hiking enough so
with that he is going to talk about
address sanitizer thread sanitizer
memory sanitizer dynamic testing tools
for c++ and we all like to call a CNT
sin and M stand so with that here you go
across tier
thank you Tony for introduction and for
inviting here and thanks everyone for
coming so dynamic testing tools for C++
C++
I've heard this word only once in the
previous talk and not at all in any
other talks here so raise your hands who
is interested who cares about C++ code
here okay thank you very much those who
didn't raise their hands
wrong answer you do actually care about
C++ and here is why so all the major
browsers are written in C++
all the major operating systems are
written in C++
all the major databases are written
either in C or C++ language interpreters
like Perl Python whatever are written C
Oh C++ and even if you are using Java
you are actually using one of the
largest C++ code bases in the world so
this is why you actually all have to
raise your hands let's continue I will
be talking about three different tools s
and T sin and M sin the similar in
spirit but they find different bugs
let's start from the first which is now
more than two years old address
sanitizer or a sin fines addressability
bugs in C++ so these are buffer
overflows including stairs
Heep and global buffer overflows it also
finds use of the free bugs or dentine
pointers and some some other interesting
bugs as well it is a part of to two
different compilers this is now in
release versions of both LLVM and GC C
compilers the compiler model instruments
all loads and stores and does some
tricky stuff with the with the stack and
Global's the second part of the tool is
the runtime library which is basically a
complete malloc replacement it does
memory allocation for the user and does
some bookkeeping for to produce good
error messages so let's start from a few
examples for those who for those of you
who don't go to never code it in C or
C++ C and C++ are not very safe
languages for example if you have a
buffer of 100 elements and you are
accessing an element say 101 no one will
stop you and this is like shooting your
own leg but every sanitizer will
actually stop you on this slide you have
a global buffer overflow the smallest
example I could write four lines all you
need is to compile this this test with
compiler with a special switch and you
will see a report which tells you
everything about this bug you will see a
type of bug says global buffer overflow
you will see where it happens and you
will see the description of the buffer a
similar example with stack buffer
overflow the difference is that now it
shows the stack variable which is
incorrectly accessed the same for he
buffer overflows now it shows you where
the allocated buffer has been allocated
and the most interesting and the most
frequent actually in C+
plus is you use after free bug since C++
is not garbage collected users have to
destroy the object by themselves and
sometimes they actually access destroyed
objects this is happening pretty often a
few boring details about how it works
and why it is actually very fast
we were playing tricks with the address
space of the application process we
divide it in three parts the upper part
belongs to the application application
does what it wants to do there
the lowest part is forbidden it's
unprotected and the middle part belongs
to the tool it occupies one eighth of
the address space and we store our own
metadata in that in that piece of
address space so what do store there we
need to note that any aligned 8 bytes of
the application may have only nine
different states with regard to address
stability so and and first by it's a
good where n is between zero and eight
and eight minus n by it's our bed so
since n is since 9 is less than 256 we
can encode this this number in one bite
and this is what we store in the in in
the shadow area this is this slide shows
what the compiler does with the memory
accesses in the user program so given a
memory access whether it read the right
we divide the address by eight or
shifted by three will load the shadow
byte and if it's not zero we report an
error very simple this is this slide
actually shows the instrumentation for
eight byte accesses smaller accesses are
just slightly more expensive they add
like 3 arithmetic instructions
so this is a marketing slide my favorite
first of all for those of you who have
heard about the valgrind
by the way who have heard about valgrind
good so if you know well Durand ACN is
ten times faster
sometimes hundred times faster and it
finds some of the bugs that doujin
doesn't the memory overhead of the tool
is also tolerable usually within two
times and the the best part about the
tool is that actually we have quite a
few users and those users are happy and
they're finding bugs every day and as we
speak one of the major customers or
users of the tool is chrome they they
have found many many hundreds of bugs in
in the recent one and a half year the
tool is used not just for tests like we
have chrome has a continuous integration
testing as many previous speakers
described and a sandy is used there but
Chrome security teams do also do in
fuzzy on two thousand machines twenty
four by seven thousand means the
generating more or less random test
inputs Oh smartly random I would say and
they throw these tests into the
instrumented Chrome this way they found
really a lot of security bugs which is
even more entertaining from my point of
view is that external security
researchers also do find chrome bugs
this way and Google pays money for every
every such bug so if anyone here is a
security researcher you're welcome to
join the bounty hunt
of course chrome is not our only user we
know that the tool found many bodies in
Firefox freetype in in both compilers in
perl in mysql you name it i don't know
any project that has been extensively
tested and
which had no bugs detectable okay let's
go to the second two data races are also
well known to cause problems one of the
problems is flaky tests which were
discussed today what
unfortunately data races are also known
for causing causing deaths in real life
so it is it is quite desirable to find
them let's see what what we have about
this second tool it is also using
compile time instrumentation and it is
also a part of both compilers both major
open source compilers LLVM and GCC the
major major part of the tools again
runtime library which is again a malloc
replacement
it just has different algorithm inside
let's let's see how it works and what it
does this is the simplest data race
example I could write in C++ we have two
threads that are concurrently accessing
a single global variable so no
synchronization or locking nothing
and again if you compile this test with
a special switch you will get a warning
message which will say that you have a
data race it will say which variable the
the the race is happening on it will
tend to show you two stack traces for
the first memory access and for the
second memory access what does it do
what does the tool do with your program
it simply inserts function calls into
your program before every memory access
and also at the function entry and
function exit then would play the same
exact tricks with the
address space of the application well
very similar at least we divide the
address space into four parts the first
and the third part are protected no one
can touch them the upper part belongs to
the application it's actually quite
enough it's like 32 terabytes of address
space you don't need more and the the
second part burns to the tool we we
store our metadata there how does this
metadata look we divide metadata or
shadow into what we call cells every
cell is an 8 byte is an 8 byte word
which represents one access to a given
memory location it has thread ID that
has so called a pause which is a scalar
clock it has few bits for position and
size and one bit to indicate whether it
was a read or a write access and this 8
byte cell fully represents one memory
access there is no additional
information anywhere so for a given 8
byte word of the application we have 4
shadow cells which means that we have 5
times memory increase memory usage
increase
let's see let's see what does this tool
do with this shadow suppose we have this
8 byte word someway in the application
and the user code is accessing the first
2 bytes writing something to the first 2
bytes so we fill in the the first cell
telling that this is thread 1 April 1
the range is from 0 to 2 and this is a
right suppose later another thread is
reading last 4 bytes
again we were feeling another another
cell since there is no intersection
between the memory ranges within the
eight byte word there is no chance that
this is a data race then a third read
x-axis comes it is a read from the first
first four bytes and now we have
intersection between the memory ranges
between the first axis and the third
axis at least one of the exercise was
was right and now we need to figure out
whether data race is possible so the
answer to this question is the same as
the answer to the question whether epoch
one happens before April 3 I will not go
into details here but this is a very
fast constant time operation which
basically involves a couple of memory
accesses to the global state it is well
described in in literature
so the one of the tricky parts of the
tool is to how do we show the stack
trace of the previous memory axis once
you have a data race you can easily show
the current stack trace but not so
easily the previous one we for this we
have per thread cyclic buffer of events
events like function entry function exit
and memory axis each event takes 64 bits
and if the access happened too long ago
we may lose the the data but the buffer
size is configurable and the maximum
size is enough for any data race we have
seen so when when a data race actually
happens we replace this event buffer
this is the separation is slow but it
happens just once when you report the
bug so the the overhead of this too is
significantly more than what the
previous two
but still quite tolerable and to the
best of our knowledge it is the best in
class among similar tools so the
slowdown is somewhere between four and
ten times and the memory usage increase
is 5 2 X 2 to 8 times this tool already
has quite a few trophies in Google we
started deploying these tools tool in in
the server side and have found many many
hundreds of bugs in our C++ what I
didn't tell yet is that this tool also
works for goal and which raise your
hands who knows about the go language
good now you all know about going crazy
and the goal and which is is very
interesting you language who doesn't
which doesn't have have buffer overflows
use of the free or anything like that in
C++ but it still has data races and I
think the tool more or less found all of
them in in all of the existing go code
there is there is quite a bit of it but
not as much as simple sponsor since our
code is using some of the open source
technologies we also found races
therefore for example one bug in open
SSL was worse fixing and there were few
benign races I don't agree that they
benign but ok so what we're just
starting to deploy the tool with chrome
we already found a few races and I
expect steady flow of birds in the
future the advantages of the - of this
tool compared to all others we believe
that it's at least an order of magnitude
faster than any other tool like this and
it natively supports atomic operations
which means that if your code does very
low-level synchronization using Atomics
will still understand it most of the
other tools don't there are some
limitations this tool today only works
on 64-bit Linux so it will be a bit hard
to support it
to some mobile operating system and it
doesn't touch libraries or inline
assembly or that's all okay let's move
to the third tool the first two tools
are already working and they're finding
bugs 24 by 7 this tool is working
progress we have not deployed it any way
yet the tool code is called memory
sanitizer and it finds uninitialized
memory reads let me show you an example
and this is again a funny thing about
the C++ language which I by the way love
it's my favorite language you can create
a buffer it will contain some garbage
you can read this garbage you can use
this garbage and no one will ever
complain well the test may be flaky the
the nuclear nuclear missile may go into
wrong direction but otherwise no one
will notice
except for M sin of course well grant
also finds these bugs but the speed of
Belgium doesn't allow you actually to
use it as widely as we expect this tool
to be used again you compile the code
with a special switch and it will show
you it will show you where the
initialized access happened and it will
also show you where the memory was
allocated which was never in initialized
after okay so how does it do
surprisingly it also uses shadow memory
this time it is one bit to one bit
mapping and every bit if it is set it
means that the corresponding application
bit is uninitialized or poisoned or
whatever initialized memory is returned
by malloc so once
Melik the buffer the whole buffer is
poisoned and initialized memory also
comes from local stack objects when you
enter a function if you have a local
stack object
it starts from being poisoned we have to
propagate this poisoned bit through
arithmetic operations I'll show you why
later
and once the constant values is written
to a memory location the corresponding
shadow is unpleasant meaning that we
have initialized it so this is again the
direct mapping which makes it extremely
fast if you want to to compute the
shadow corresponding to an application
address you just subtract some large
constant from it or you actually unset
one of the bits in the address this is
the same iteration here one of the one
of the problems of many tools that find
an issue high streets is that they
report what they think a bug is very
early and what I think are false
positives here is a simple example
suppose we have a struct in C language
which has a one byte object following a
four byte object so who knows what is
the size of the struct no one eight
bytes correctly so this struct is eight
bytes because there is a hole due to
alignment you have one byte object than
three bytes of nothing and then a four
byte object so when you allocate this
object it is all initialized then you
initialize x and y it gets UNPO isn't
but the hole itself is still poisoned
and if you are doing some some some
things like mem copy with this object
you you are copying uninitialized bytes
and some of the tools are reporting bug
at this point which makes too
unusable valgrind is one of the few
tools that don't do this and our tool
doesn't do this either so we have to we
have to propagate the shadow bits
through some of the arithmetic
operations like addition bitwise and and
so forth enough about this also need to
know who is actually who actually
allocated the poisoned memory like you
have two calls to malloc then you add
the results putting it into some third
value and then you figure out that this
value is uninitialized you need to know
which malloc is guilty and memory
sanitizer does it by using yet another
part of address space it stores their
locations of the of the it stores IDs of
the allocation site like malloc or stack
stack frame the memory sanitizer has
very moderate overhead it's like three
times slower than the native run and it
uses two times more memory if you want
to get origins it's twice worse but
still quite tolerable the tricky part
about this tool which which is not about
the first two tools this tool actually
has to see all the memory accesses isn't
in the program otherwise it will report
false positives so we need to compile
everything lip see lip C++ all the
libraries that that the program depends
on depends on and this is actually quite
doable in in a wide range of cases like
we can handle LLVM itself for larger
programs like like chrome for example
it's not that easy chrome depends on
77th Street libraries and Linux so we
have to do some dirty tricks to
instrument the library
at runtime as I said we didn't deploy
him send anywhere significantly but it
already has some good trophies we tried
it on on a proprietary console
applications modern million lines of
code of C++ it was not tested by well
drained previously we found 20-plus
unique bugs in just two hours we then
tested that with well drain twelve in
finds the same but in more than 24 hours
and MSN gives better reports for snack
memory and we have found a few bugs
elsewhere so to summarize what I just
told we have three tools for C++ and one
of them also for gold language a sin as
we believe as a must use for everyone
who is developing your tests in C++ or C
programs today it works on Linux OSX
Chrome OS and Android on x86 on arm and
a little bit on PowerPC work in progress
is iOS Windows BSD clones etc and this
is a part of two major open-source
compilers clan and GCC TSN is a must use
if you have threads because then you
most likely have data races today it
works on the x86 Linux and it is also a
part of two major open-source compilers
MSN is a work in progress tool which
finds users of uninitialized data
stay tuned of here if you are interested
at this point I will be happy to take
questions thank you
so I learned tooth really important
things here one cost you love C++
because it keeps them employed and the
second thing is if you don't use his
tools you are shooting yourself in your
legs so use the tools okay um just uh
I'm gonna give you one pre-announcement
then we're gonna take a question we are
gonna have drinks after G tax today
we're gonna do the same thing we did
yesterday about shuttling everybody up
and then to please do stay for
Claudio's talk after after the questions
here it's going to be about XSS which
affects everybody here so with that
please first question Alec Monroe to
bring things back to I think we're the
languages most of us work with I know
say Python for example has shed skin and
psyche on that can compile down to C++
and well generally when programming
Python we don't worry about address
wrong address or memory sanitization but
we do worry about threat issues we do
have data races there and I'm just
wondering if there's been any work to
look into whether you could use
something like thread sanitizer to
actually test Python code for databases
my knowledge about Python is quite
limited but I know that there is
something called global Python lock or
something like this which means that
python is actually single threaded if if
you try to remove that global python
lock then you're in a big trouble and t
sin is is your friend but other than
that you probably don't need it thank
you thanks to a question we have one up
here on the moderator it says does
address sanitizer catch accesses outside
the current buffer but within another
valid buffer yeah that's that's a good
question so you may have two buffers one
which was expected to be accessed and
one which is extra actual access because
the index was so far away that it jumped
to another buffer and there is a red
zone between them so if if you are
accessing like one kilobytes one
kilobyte ow
outside of the buffer will not detect it
yes but the most frequent accesses are
within the first 16 or 32 bytes and this
is what we get get reliably great all
right class a thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
