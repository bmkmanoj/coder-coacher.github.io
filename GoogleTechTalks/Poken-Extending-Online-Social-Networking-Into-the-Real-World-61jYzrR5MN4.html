for giving us the opportunity today to
present to you our project my name is
the fondue trio and i'm the founder of
pokin see a couple of names here up on
the slide because they're here in
attendance gabriel kleiner chief
software architect and brian hasson and
product manager sitting right here you
might have heard of pokin because we we
are Swiss were based in goes on about 10
people now working for the company and
what I decided to do with the talk today
is instead of pitching a company product
that's all and turn it more into an
interesting philosophical discussion and
add a lit up jet object-based networking
as an extension of web duo so hopefully
that'll get some pots going in your
minds and lots of questions at the end
so we can all share and enjoy so what is
pokin pokin is your social key chain I
have a pokin on my keychain here today
as do many people in this room I it's a
small device that we've designed created
and we manufacture manufactured in China
but all the design the engineering takes
place here in Switzerland looks like
this since on a keychain a little USB
stick with a cool looking body there's
many different designs I have a gorilla
here and here is a beat and how does it
work well as we asked early on in talks
a lot of people are on social networks
we didn't ask specifically how many but
statistically what you'll find is that
most people are on several networks
whether it is traditional social
networks like facebook myspace hi5 so on
or other communication communication
tools that are becoming more networks
like msn skype google talk even youtube
which now has the networking feature
built in so what poken does is enables
you to connect you directly to someone
on all of the networks that they're part
of simply by touching them in the real
world through the way it works is I have
this on my
and I'll just high for another pokin
like this two hands come together they
glow and we're virtually connected now
the way we've decided to build it is as
a sort of virtual business card because
we're bringing the concept of business
card into the virtual world today you're
all still using paper business card with
the paper business card contain it
contains your name your email address or
phone number a few different ways of
getting in touch with you but you have
many other ways actually today that
people can get in touch with you as we
mentioned through all of these different
networks so what we do on our through
our portal is enabled you to create a
little business card with your
traditional information and little icons
that appear here for all of the other
networks that you're part of and once
you pokin someone you get access to
their little pokin card in your account
and you can click on any of those icons
and go directly to their page there's
ice all go into more technical details
where we also have an API that we're
building and offering to the social
networks so they can actually build
fokin functionality directly into their
websites so that's another exciting
angle and the goal really is to be the
to be a tool that links all of your
different all of the different ways that
somebody can get in touch with you now
when you log in to our website either
through your broken by simply inserting
it into your computer and letting the
auto launch feature launch the website
or whether you log in by going to do
bogen com will let you create a few
identities you can create one or several
and with the device you can actually
choose which identity you want to share
with someone by just clicking little
button on it so here we have Brian
posing here for his social identity more
sort of fun party one and he created
also a business identity there that will
conduct contains for his business
networks it might contain his LinkedIn
it's saying other means of contact that
he would share with a different type of
audience when you have poked ined a
number of people
extra cover poke into the computer as I
said automatically uploads all of your
new contacts and this is how it appears
we have a screen where it will show your
new friends their little cars the date
and time at which you pokin them so we
really bring in the reference of the
real world event that happened and we
found in our in user test the sauna land
cover this a little bit more as well in
the next slide that having a reference
to a real world event is really a very
intriguing and new elements that we're
bringing into websites because people
tend to remember something in the real
world you'll remember for example that
two weeks ago you were with your friend
Bob and you met somebody but you might
not remember their name so perhaps you
connected to them on facebook or on
another network if you have 500 friends
or more you'll have trouble finding them
in your facebook friends because you
don't remember their name with pokin
what you'll do is simply scroll back in
time and say well I remember is around
two weeks ago roll back find the event
say hey there's there's Bob my nose with
Bob and there's Jim or whoever this
other person might have been that you've
met so we're bringing that time element
into the mix for social networking now
what we've really focused on in our
project and in our in this product and
really the mantra of our company is is
keeping it simple they saying objects
and what everyday objects they use must
remain simple must be something that you
really don't need to think of how how to
use it you should be you need to turn it
on you shouldn't need to configure it
you shouldn't need to do any kind of
parameterization should be able to swing
it out of your pocket just poke and put
it back in your pocket so in this case
we developed device that uses USB
because USB is ubiquitous any computer
it works on any operating system because
there's no software necessary and no
drivers what we do is we simulate a fat
file system f80 file system that any
computer will detect and we just have a
virtual file on there and
the data that you that you collected
throop opening that's uploaded to the
website and sorted and put into
structured so the information can be
displayed on the web the technology that
we use for poking a lot of people ask us
you know is this RFID is it bluetooth
because these are terms that they'll
have heard but they don't necessarily
know a lot about and so I can tell you
today here that no we don't use RFID we
don't use bluetooth we don't use Wi-Fi
we actually have to develop our own
wireless technology to answer this
particular need there's no technology
out there that's available that was
answering what we'd identified as the
the the need for two small portable
compact devices very low power that you
wouldn't want to recharge you want to
worry about parameterizing or whatnot
that you that would communicate at a
close distance when you bring them
together for us what was really
important was the the human aspect of
the interaction when you're meeting
someone you don't want to have to stare
down at your mobile phone and enter his
phone number you shake their hand you
look them in the eye and we wanted to
keep that so when you're pokin you can
look them in the eye and actually you're
pokin look each other in the eye as well
and you just high for so the while RFID
would have where is the technology that
some of you know from swipe card and so
on it works as an active passive
technology so you have an active reader
that's built into a door that's built
into a bus if you could carry around a
passive card but you can't swipe a card
at a card right in the case of other
technologies you'd have to parametrize
them you'd have to have bigger batteries
you'd have to have all kinds of
different constraints that when to offer
you this simplicity of use that we were
looking for the information that we
collect so when we're high five and you
actually we don't exchange any personal
information all we exchange is a an
identifier code each pokin is a unique
ID and we exchange that and a timestamp
and it's all encrypted with a private
128-bit
key again unique in each device so we
have a very secure aspect of the the
interaction between the devices and a
unique event that's created by 11 unique
identifier meeting another unique
identifier at a specific time the the
reason that I wanted to focus really on
the simplicity that from the sort of
philosophical perspective of the product
of pokin what we looked at is sort of we
looked at trying to model the simplicity
of the web simplicity of some actions
that you do on the web like clicking and
model those and bring them into the real
world and for us the simplicity on the
web is you see a button you click it it
changes state you know you expect these
things it's very simple you don't have
to think about what's going to happen
what you're doing so on and it logs in
action on the web it locks the action
because it knows what IP address that
click has come from and so on and so
forth so there's a little number of
secure of technologies that ensure that
when that information arrives in the
server it knows that that click happened
within that browser at a certain time so
we take that into the real world and on
the pokin you have a button here that
you can click just as you would click on
the web you'll have feedback because it
might change color so we have different
modes and we log the action rather you
click the button or whether you are
high-fiving or high foring in this case
and that's really what I the parallel I
wanted to draw with the simplicity of
use on the web and the step advice now
what we're focusing on is bringing a new
service to the web and to the web
community through objects and we're
taking actions from the real world that
we capture in these objects and we bring
them into the web and offer them for use
on the web through a standard web
interface through an API so somebody
using our API would not have to worry
about all of the heart
we're stuff that's going on about the
fact that pokemans are interacting at a
certain time in a certain place or
anything like that what we do is we
exposed this data through an API just as
if it was data that was coming from
software so for the web it's quite
interesting for web developers they
could they can use the actions from the
pokin and build it into any kind of web
system but not having to worry about
everything that goes on behind and I
have a little bit more technical detail
about why that's something that that is
of interest in the end that we do and
that's quite complex and you wouldn't
you wouldn't want to have to worry about
in every single case of wanting to
integrate and objected to a website this
is the architecture that we use and the
way I've modeled it here is representing
sort of a standard web architecture the
web layer API Oh connecting to other for
wealth for offering information to
external parties OpenSocial container
where information come can come into our
system some core services user account
social network connectors authorization
so on sitting on top of a database but
what I've added here is this branch here
which is the object and the and this is
what we treat internally but that
doesn't that we don't that doesn't show
to the external to the outside world
where the interaction between the
objects we capture the the information
we can time shift it so we know that
this interaction has happened and if it
was in software you know that it
happened you know immediately that it
has happened right because it's
connected through the web so you know
that it happens at a certain IP address
at a certain time and so on the
information comes to you directly for in
the case of objects the information is
captured within a device and then it's
transferred to the architecture at a
point in the future it's transferred to
the when the person connects their
object so here what I'm modeling here is
that the information goes through a time
shift because we have to figure out what
time it actually really happened in the
past
and then decryption this is because
while when you're in a wired web there
are a lot of secure technologies that
connect you and the user and you know
where the event happens and now we have
reliable systems but that make sure that
we know for sure that an event happened
at a certain time to sort of life in our
case that's what we offer you is that we
have the encryption we have the security
that the secure exchange between the
devices and then we know when that
happens by decrypting that information
and putting into the database so it's
then exposed through the web through the
API in terms of the technologies that we
use for the Sabelle our systems were
very much open source you see a lot of
familiar names up there and if there are
any questions about any of those at the
end Gabriel will be available to answer
them but we're yeah everything is open
source pretty pretty much now another a
very different angle to our project I've
told you about the technology I've told
you about sort of the philosophy behind
it the simplicity of use how it works
what I want to tell you a little bit
about now is well our business because
it's so very different than a
traditional web to start up because we
have a hardware angle we had we have
manufacturing we have logistics we have
sales we need to make money actually we
are making money which is good not many
very young web startups that launch two
products you know a month ago can say
that they're making money but we're
actually making money which of the night
and so what another reference that we've
taken here is saying okay we have a
product that fits into social networking
why was social networking so popular why
is it so big on the web because it's
viral because it one person will tell
their friends will tell their friends
and it spreads right the traditional
funnel you might do mass advertising you
may tell a lot of people there's a
product and then it trickles down to one
person walking into your shop and buying
it so what we're saying is we were
thinking is saying okay
well this is a product that we want to
model on the virality of the web the
viral aspects of web and social
networking products so let's try and
replicate this in the real world how do
we replicate a viral funnel in the real
world well our distribution model is is
really draws addressed some strong
parallels with social networking and the
virality of social networking so what we
do is when we sell you poke ins on our
websites they come in a pack like this
12-pack so you can buy 12 poke ins at a
time a day an interesting discount from
the price that they're at in the shops
programs are in retail by the way that
your image of Switzerland that men are
big in dominate a lot of other shops
soon more shops as well so you can buy
them here into a soda for 25 francs
apiece in the shops or you can go to our
website and buy a 12-pack now 12 pack is
a more interesting financially comes to
about fifteen francs apiece so the 12
packs 180 francs net and what it what
the purpose of 12 pack is is to model
this viral aspect in that you as the
sponsor of the pack you having bought
the back when you give those poke ins
away or sell them off to your friends
perhaps with a little margin but in your
pocket you're the sponsor and you'll get
points for that and you'll get points
because since every pokin has an ID we
know what goes on with every pokin and
we know that ultimately you're the one
that sponsored it so when people from
the pokings in your pack poke and other
people you get points they get points as
well because they've pokin but you also
get points so you get points when you
poke in someone you get more points when
you pokin a pokin from a pack that you
bought because we want to push you to
show your friend how she was pokin that
you're giving to him we're selling 10 so
if you pocono pokin from pack that
you've bought you make more points like
that it means that you've actually
showed them how it works
you become a promoter you get points
well at a certain level you'll get a you
get a discount code that you can even
email to your friends so they get
discounts off of buying poke ins if they
use your discount code you get points
you get points for a lot of different
things filling your profile data on your
account and so on so we're really taking
that the concept of you know I I want to
have a lot of friends I want to increase
the number of well increased my
visibility in a network like social
networking does with number friend we're
shifting that and saying well there's
another way to increase your visibility
and to be part of something and that is
through a point system graduated point
system graduating through different
levels of the token fan of poking
fanatica program promoter and you can
get lots of things out of it now it's
not all commercial you can get increased
with the increased levels you get access
to more features and eventually prizes
so on so it's really modeling that
morality virality that we have and
taking it to the real world in a viral
distribution way how does how can we do
that actually it there's some real
challenges in terms of logistics and
even manufacturing to be able to do this
kind of thing just the fact that we have
unique IDs and every device and that we
have to be able to track where every
device comes from and where it goes and
we've built that all into our system so
we actually have logistics stations in
the factory that track when the devices
are being put into a pack and so we know
what IDs are in the pack of tokens that
you're buying so that we can then give
you points for all the activity that
goes on with them so there's that side
of the project that's quite quite
interesting and quite novel we don't
know of anybody else that does it in
this way for for distribution now
from a sort of local distribution
perspective we can have promoters
sitting pretty much anywhere in the
world that if they pick up on the system
want to make we want to have a higher
and more active involvement in
distributing tokens locally we have
legit local logistic stations that can
be very very easily set up as in this
case for example in a dorm room
basically it's a computer with web
access barcode scanner and all you need
to do when someone buys a pack of tokens
either over the web or directly from you
on a university campus just scanning the
barcode and associate it with his
account and he'll be part of the viral
distribution system it's a very very
easy and simple process this is a label
printer so you can print a label with
the person's name and throw it in the
post if they're not someone that you're
interacting with physically but you want
need to send it to them somewhere across
the country that's what we do currently
from lowes on for example for Swiss
distribution so all the web orders
coming in are scanned and and associated
with whoever might have bought them
using PayPal and sent directly to the
user the same day so Switzerland you
generally receive your pack up opens
next day or within two days is pokin
successful I put this picture here
because just to show we're still really
in our infancy the company has been
running for over a year but we just
started really we started sales four
weeks ago but we've managed to generate
quite a buzz and it's been extremely
exciting four weeks in funny because the
buzz is coming from places that we
didn't originally expect it to come from
so in this game you see in this map for
example that the real activity at the
moment just in the past two weeks I'd
say 10 days is in Holland some people
have picked up on the viral distribution
model and gone gone absolutely wild with
it and it's fantastic to see that where
we see is people that are basically
thinking hey i can buy a pack of tokens
and double my money in it
a few days and then a few days later
that by two backs and a few days later
they buy four packs and now we've keep
the set those same people two weeks ago
that bought one back there buying 40
packs and it's really exciting to see
that because that's exactly what we were
trying to replicate in the real world
and take from from the web so what we
have here are shoe statistics and okay
they're not huge numbers because again
we've been running for not that not very
well long but currently with web orders
regino 102,000 Vokoun's and that's
growing quite quickly you mean that's
just really in the past few days we've
seen numbers go up really quickly fans
all over the world a lot of amateur
webshops popping up people buying phones
from our sites we only sell them in 12
packs so a lot of people have set up
their own little web shops to sell
individual polkas and so their web shops
popping up but everywhere six of them we
noticed in the past two to ten days fan
videos spontaneous poking meetups that
are being set up in different cities we
had no part in Dayton in creating that's
really from the fanbase that it's coming
and even applications the one of the
applications that popped up just a few
days ago is 42 auto launching the pokin
on a Mac as you might know on on windows
there's auto launch when you put a USB
stick it auto launches an executable on
the Mac you don't have concept of auto
launch if you plug in the USB stick the
drive appears on your desktop so someone
wrote a Mac application basically
detects if a token has been plugged into
the computer and automatically launches
the file on the website another
interesting stat here the actually made
it to the top 10 most twittered words as
you see the list here google here oken
here windows in DG unfortunately so just
a few stats from from this past week now
why is it why is is it picking up why do
we feel that there's an opportunity here
why do people get excited about
this product well if you look at it
really answer the well bring benefits
and answer the needs of several of the
stakeholders in social networking first
of all from the users perspective we
make it simpler to connect people you
don't have to think of asking someone or
are you on Twitter are you on skype are
you on msn can you write down each of
your logins here can I send you an email
asking you what your what your aim
screen name is and so on and so forth
you just say hey do you pokin yes I
pokin high five and you're done manage
contact in a time time fashion that's a
really interesting one that a lot of
people see but benefit and finally about
integrating into standard social
networking website so really building a
product but that really can be seamless
and that doesn't require that you change
your old habits and you just build on
top of what's the existing from the
social networks perspective as Rupert
was bringing up you know social
networking has gone through a big hype
in the past five years it's been
something really exciting people have an
extremely active on it on different
sides people are very active well this
is bringing something new I think it's
something that seems to be reviving
relationships and it's not because
someone is already your friend on
Facebook that you would not pokin them
you can very well you know even if
they're already your friends on Facebook
it's still poking them it's still fun
it's a it's a moments that you're
sharing in the real world and that
really brings in an extra little element
into the relationship so that's
something that people enjoy we found
that people enjoy this even whether
they're on social networks or not so
that's why I put another point here
reach new markets through physical
distribution channel that's for the
social networks what we found is there
people that are some people that are not
on social networks that are buying folk
ins and that actually it's sort of a new
and nice introduction to social
networking for them these are people
that are maybe that we're afraid of tube
sharing too much data of the complexity
of the interfaces of social networks of
the fact that you know it runs on a
computer and it's complex this is simple
and they really enjoy that and they'll
go around
poken people and we'll have that a
little business card a little pokin card
that might not have any social
networking accounts on it they might not
use social networking at all but they
enjoy the simplicity of token and for
web activities and events one of the
most successful distribution aspects
also fokin has been through web
conferences and events and so long where
people meet up in a specific place and
want to want to exchange contact
information so those are all benefits
that we're bringing to the consumer
finally I wanted to conclude my slide
comes up here on yeah just a little
observation about the web and about you
know my title says here you know this
may just work who knows but web one
problem when the main problems of web
one is authentication saying how do I
you know how do you make sure that the
person you're interacting with on the
web is who he says he is so for banking
that's been solved through hardware it's
been solved through physical device and
many of us carry around these RSA keys
to log into our bank account so there
are people that say that you know what
why wouldn't this be done none of cell
phone why don't you have why would you
carry an extra device around well you're
carrying an extra RSA device around
because the problem was not solvable in
the cell phone it solved through this
kind of device and the parallel here is
the web to challenge which is exchange
of ID so the roots a social web
connecting people and what we're saying
is well maybe the way that's going to be
solved is also through a similar concept
and with a fun little social keychain
like pokin that's my last slide so thank
you very much for your attention the
floor is open to questions which Brian
Gabriel Dave and myself will be happy to
answer
before the questions actually maybe I
can just give you all some focus so you
can have a feel for what they're like
maybe you can just pass them along take
one each and I'll handle questions well
that's going on
uh yeah yeah we do it now we do it i
mean we're giving away free program now
that's part of our marketing budget
right but we have large advertising
customers that have bought large numbers
of moments that we've branded and that
are not only branded physically but that
give access to a branded website web
portal that's the pokin portal but
branded for that customer so we do that
so you could run across free poke ins in
Switzerland or in other European
countries since we've delivered quite a
number to advertisers
yes that's the the traditional a fax
machine challenge so what the way we
decided to tackle this challenge I was
with any sort of network product where
it has more value when some when other
people around you have one as well is
well first of all through the viral
distribution saying well why don't you
buy 12 pack and give 11 to your friends
like that well they have some than you
can poke them with them the other angle
that we decide to tackle is by
developing a sort of advice as a fashion
accessory rather than a geeky tool
because it would have been a much easier
to develop pokin as a cheap-looking you
know very geeky USD or other little
plastic box but we put in a lot of
effort to make it into a fun funky
little critter and actually you'll find
that a lot of people like having one not
necessarily because they're poking with
a lot of people yet but simply because
it's a conversation piece and whenever
I'm in a in a bar in a restaurant or
whatnot i'll actually i used to keep my
keys in my in my pocket but i'll just
you know take it out put it on the table
and you'll see that people sometimes
look at look over and want to come and
ask you you know hey what's this thing
it looks quite intriguing so there's
really there's a fashion aspect to it
it's enjoyable as well
no the character is just a cap but it's
the cap that brings sort of the
personality house and you know you'll
notice that people different people
choose different designs we have four
different design the ones I I get we're
here but actually we have many more
coming up
we actually have a lot of requests from
companies that are interested now in
developing just the caps and not
necessarily as different characters but
also for branding purposes just saying
well there's USB stick you know can we
have a branded cap sure why not
yeah well we've decided to target the
real sort of heavy networkers first
which are the kid the young one with the
16 to 25 year olds that are on
University campuses that are really
networking enclosed environment so
that's why I read if we started with
this device but it's very easy for us to
course with our whole infrastructure
with our technology to port it to any
kind of form factor
there's either that or I mean most
people i mean the let me just tell you
go back and tell you actually where the
idea originally came from i went back to
studies um two years ago did an MBA and
and was studying with 90 people for a
year very very good very very close to
all of them and then there were all my
friends and the end of year I realized I
had some people connected on this
network some people had my skype some
people had my anthem you know I hadn't
taken the time to take the NIT list of
90 students and search for every single
one of them on all of the communication
tool that I use and that's when I said
well there's got to be a better way of
doing things there's got to be something
simple and Hogan came out of it so you
can just pokin people around you and you
know yeah maybe you're already connected
on Facebook but chances are you're not
on Twitter on msn
we have yeah yeah well we are we're yeah
we're there's all kinds of different
angles that were you know other in our
roadmap and that we're considering for
the future from a technology hardware
detected point of view it's a difficult
subject to answer because location
technologies tend to be bulky expensive
and require a lot of battery power so
it's sort of the opposite end of the
spectrum from you know what we view as
as being the optimal form factor for and
use usability for this device but there
may be other ways of extracting location
information that we are using a sense
you can two people poke and wherever
they upload their contacts from that may
give you an idea general idea of where
where they were when they met who notes
they might upload their contacts an hour
later they might upload them six days
later if they do it one hour later
chances are they weren't very far from
the place where they met
yep yes absolutely it's being addressed
me there's a lot of things that as a
start-up any good start up we have to
throw together really quickly to get to
get it up and running and open our beta
so there's some some networks there that
yeah we ask for your password that's the
only way that we currently have to to
sync sync up with your account so we're
on our way to implementing Facebook
Connect for example which would let you
connect a facebook or rather than our
site and we have other means as well but
it's a funny thing what the other yeah
the red like to answer this question is
that I've had this comment come up a few
times and it's always from very very
tech community but you'll find as our
case study shows that the vast vast
majority of users don't care at all
about giving rated passwords because
they do it by the hundreds every day on
our website so yes we're where I mean we
don't keep the passwords we don't store
them we really just use them to to to
connect to your account on that network
they're not kept but most you know
everyday people don't care
no I mean if we've developed it were its
proprietary protocol innocence but we're
open we don't know what the huge future
holds for us or for other people but
what I have to say is that yeah you're
obviously referring to cell phones or
other portable devices a lot of people
we get a lot of comments people saying
I'm or the tech people than the average
user that quite like having a funky
fashionable simple device to use but
it's a lot of tech users will say hey
can build this in the cell phone answer
them well it is built into your cell
phone why don't you use it like what
it's not built in my telephone well it
is you know there's about 10 apps on
iphone so that you can basically you
know beam your information to another
iphone this is functionality that was
brought in to the palm for 10 years ago
you know beaming the v-cards through
infrared and I mean nobody uses them why
because you have to install software
because there's the interoperability
issues and even on the iPhone you know
if you might say let's develop an iphone
app well there are some the iphone you
that people haven't installed them
because there's a gazillion apps on the
App Store because you'd have to have
installed the same app as your all your
friends and so on so forth so we've just
decided to address the question from
another angle sort of surprising angle
and say hey you know maybe there's
another place to look for connecting
people
they're an in the account creation
process you're asked which networks your
you'd like to add to your card it could
be if we had time to add all of them
until now but in the past two weeks we
haven't had time to add all of them but
we're currently working on that and
we're about to publish yeah avi
you
we have priority
I think it's yeah I think it's this size
and I guess any sort of deployment of
any web app which language is you choose
to but first if your web is your apps
you know super popular in Russia you
know you scramble and add Russian
immediately we're into the same kind of
challenge I guess we have maybe a little
bit better handle on it because there is
a physical object part of things so we
know where it's being shipped so at
least between the time that we get
through the order and ship it we know
that we have a few days before it
arrives the consumer and maybe in that
time we can add his network but we're
also looking at addressing that from the
other perspective and building I mean
publishing an API that would enable you
know polish network to add themselves
rather than us having to do the work and
that's where the the fire mentioned you
know some people are developing pokin
apps it's fantastic that auto launch up
on the Mac we had thought of you know we
had thought of developing something like
that put in a roadmap and then somebody
develops it in half a day it's like wow
hey great so another feature thought hey
we're going to be nice to have all
broken users on a map so you know where
the people are about focus within half a
day there was some Dutch developer that
put up a website with a map of where all
the broken users are and even tracked in
real time through Twitter so is a pretty
exciting
yes there is and it's a it's on the
website for basic users it sometimes
causes that a little bit of confusion
why several identities who has several
identities well we do but yeah you can
that that's what the switch is for so
when you just high for when you just
poke in someone as is it'll be your
standard profile or whichever one you've
selected is your standard and then if
you double click you'll cycle through
different modes so the first double
click you'll see there's this little LED
very discreet inside the body that the
blanks on the key but it hidden by the
body we call that discrete mode and what
that does actually is you ghost the
other person so in that mode when you
high-five them you're getting their ID
but you're not giving them yours so it
sort of that fake phone number thing
except there's it's better because you
still they still have a chance of
getting your contact info because you
can unco slater you can go look at their
profile and then say okay I'm going to
uncurse them but we have actually this
is a feature was coming up I maybe
shouldn't have talked about it pizza we
have lots of features that are not yet
to release on the website on the
production site and that are coming up
in the next few weeks and then you can
cycle 3 through three other modes so you
can actually put ya up to 5 profiles
linked with your broken and a question
it often comes up link to that is you
know what if you lose you're pokin you
know if you lose everything no you don't
because it's again it's just an ID so
she lose it first thing I do is go in
for website and disable auto login if
you had activated auto login because if
you activated auto login it means
anybody plugging into pokin will be
automatically logged into your account
so you can just select no auto login and
then when you get a new pokin connect it
to your computer launch the the file
that's on at the start start pokin or
have it auto auto launch and instead of
going through the create account
procedure just link that poke into an
existing account and you can have as
many poke ins as you want in your
account
when the oven they plug it in that's
what pops up on their screen you declare
it live
well actually this is the high for and
there's a very good reason that it's the
high for is because there's a social
network name no we decided to go with
four to avoid any confusion but actually
the axe is called poking and poking is a
verb it soon it's in the urban
dictionary you'll notice the online and
it's going to make it into more standard
dictionaries very soon I pokin you pokin
let spoken do you broken or you know hey
that's really buggin meaning that's
super cool as you wish yeah it's trip
intransitive just as long as there's
those five letters in there pokin yeah I
pokin do you way back and I'll poking
you again
opening yeah any other questions or
comments or you know we're always happy
to get feedback even if you just want to
yell out you know this absolutely sucks
I don't believe in it just do because it
opens up the discussion and great things
might come out of it well nobody thinks
it sucks that's encouraging thank you
very much have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
