they have new Googler gross
so I'm going to be talking about some of
the recent technological developments
that for the first time let us go in and
measure all the optical aberrations in a
human I sort of in a real amount of time
without hurting the person getting that
information I'll be talking about what
we can do with it and potentially using
that to make the vision even better my
background is in physics but I sort of
got into the eyeball business and i have
to tell you eyeballs it turns out are
really cool they are amazing i won't be
talking too much about eyeballs just
about the optics of them but a few fun
facts you know your retina can perceive
as much as a single photon striking it
which is pretty remarkable the cornea
itself tissue in there is the only
living tissue in the human body that
doesn't have a blood supply it gets all
its oxygen directly diffusing from the
air so if you lived in a nitrogen
environment your corneas would shrivel
up and die eventually it's cool
fantastic stuff but we're going to be
talking about the optics of it the eye
as a camera and there are a few main
pieces that are important you know this
thin side adjusts the light a little
more and it's how you do accommodation
if you want to change your focus to read
some muscles pull that in or out and
does you better focus and then
everything gets imaged on the retina the
back so if you are looking at a point
source of light in this example say star
something far away by the time the rays
reach your eye they're coming in pretty
parallel so that's sort of the
assumption that i will start with and
this talk if everything goes right they
get focused through the services and you
get a nice point at the end then your
eye is called Emma tropic and i'll be
using that word a few times it means
well focused i well proportioned and I
with no problems it's a theoretical type
of eye but we'll get into that later if
you are nearsighted you have in my Appa
guy
right the light comes in it focus the
light focus is to strongly comes to an
image before it hits your retina
something like that the Greek origin is
the word squinty eye anyone imagine why
myopic is called squinty and Greek right
yeah sure because people who are myopic
tend to squint to see better in fact a
lot of vision problems do it but this is
the most common and it's fairly obvious
why when you look at that many few
arrays are coming in so what was a big
blur is now just kind of a small blur
you can manage to go through the day
myopia is the most common visual
complaint that people have generally
there's nothing wrong with the cornea
their eye itself is longer than average
so the image gets formed there's nothing
there and hit it light goes on gets a
little messed up and in this case too
long is pretty relative it does change
the geometric optics but in a small way
and it actually induces a little bit of
a stigmatism kind of on the the axis you
would expect so that's not too useful
for you it does not contribute to
refocusing exactly there's been a lot of
debate and research into what causes
myopia it generally starts between the
ages of five and ten and kind of
develops up to some point and then stops
getting worth worse there seems to
definitely be a genetic component your
parents were nearsighted there's a good
chance you will be and there's also a
definite environmental trigger there are
some sort of studies of example an
Eskimo culture in which there were
essentially no visual problems or you
know myopic related visual problems
until public schools came in introduced
reading and then you could watch the
prevalence of glasses sort of track up
with the ages as the kids came in so
there's both reading seems to be the
problem case study
if you're not my opik the chances are
you're a little bit hyper opik most
people who go through their life without
wearing glasses at least adverse are in
fact a little bit farsighted one or two
diopters is pretty common and generally
they don't really notice it until you
start getting older your accommodation
doesn't work as well and all of a sudden
you can't use that accommodation to pull
it in and focus it and people have to
start wearing reading glasses so that's
the optics of the eye how well do you
see we measure that with this chart
everybody's familiar with that chart
it's a hundred and fifty years old which
is sure which is pretty amazing there
you go the you're supposed to stand well
first off you put it a standard size not
this giant projected one you stand 20
feet away and you essentially read down
until you can't read anymore and you
look at the number to the right and that
tells you what your visual acuity is the
it's always presented in two numbers
2020 the first one is the 20 feet that
you're standing away and the second
number is how far away a person with
normal vision would have to stand to
read it so if you're at 20 20 that means
you have pretty much normal vision the
biggie on the top and it's almost always
a need for some reasons and have to be
is generally the legally blind point so
people who cannot read that even with
correction they're legally blind people
who as the 20 40 this is the point where
you have to wear glasses if you're
driving according to the DMV and in fact
the chart goes significantly lower and
there are people that can see all the
way down to those those smallest lines
this is usually 20 20 2015 20 10 28
something like that and this is sort of
used all throughout the world and it's
really old what it turns out that up
until now it was about the best way we
had maybe it still has to measure how
well someone can see does anybody know
what they call 2020 in France Royale
with cheese no
66 so they put it into meters and go to
the closest unit so you have this basic
model of the eye people have been
creating models for a long time this is
called the ghost ran for surface model
and I don't remember when he was doing
it but something like a hundred years
ago you know sort of tracing by hand
describing all these services as basic
spheres or variations figure out the
index of refraction here's a zmax model
some of you guys are talking about zmax
last time it's a basic model of the eye
but if the problem here is that it's a
real gross oversimplification and until
recently we haven't been able to do
anything about that the reason that it's
an oversimplification is that even a
pretty well focused I doesn't actually
look like this this is an exaggeration
of course but it looks something like
this that's not a nice smooth lens
surface you have little imperfections
each one is contributing to an overall
degradation in your optics so you've got
all these services the front surface of
the cornea of the back surface of the
cornea of the lens at each point you can
introduce some more problems in fact the
lens can be all kinds of crazy things it
can be tilted off center and the index
of refraction of all these materials
isn't uniform for example it varies
across the location and sometimes it
varies in a nice regular symmetric way
and sometimes it varies in an asymmetric
way as minerals you sleep on your side
and you get more minerals on one side to
the other or something so all these
things can go in there and modify it so
do we think those matter well they
matter for some people some people they
have pretty healthy retinas and you put
glasses on them you try but they're not
happy they don't see any better you know
there's not an obvious reason just from
looking at the right right away why they
don't see well other people they see
well in some conditions but you change
the light and then they don't see very
well and finally there are people who
look pretty normal but they see just
exceptionally better than the rest of us
and that's an interesting case too
ideally we could all see like that or
maybe we
that's a question for other people to
answer so my question is how can we
measure these aberrations so everything
I'm talking about here everything that's
an imperfection from the perfect optical
system I'm calling an aberration and to
measure this we want to use oh here's a
few approaches that we could use sort of
direct measurement we could take a
holographic sensor and jam it in the
back of someone's eye ball when they
were looking at a point source of light
and measure everything that's
objectionable for a couple of reasons
here's a better solution and in fact
something that people tried for a number
of times instead of putting in all the
Rays at once you could shine a small
light and just part of the eye and then
take a picture of where that spot got
focused you can repeat many many times
moving around and eventually build up a
map of all the of sort of where all
those rays would end up and this is
time-consuming and error-prone but dumb
in the 60s and 70s they did this type of
experimentation in a very limited way so
here's a better way instead of sticking
a sensor back there just stick a light
bulb it's much smaller and because the
Rays can be traced either way with with
general equivalents let the light come
out here and measure the aberrations out
here where you can put a big sensor and
it won't bother the person and that's
the approach that I was using and it's
generally been adopted so what we're
really going to measure out there is the
wavefront many of you are probably
familiar with the idea of a wavefront
that's the wave definition and imaginary
surface joining all the points in space
of a wave that have the same phase
that's okay it's a little confusing i
like the geometric interpretation better
if you think of all the Rays coming out
from some particular here's a plane wave
there's a point source the wave front is
just sort of a an imaginary line which
is perpendicular to all the Rays at any
point so you could trace it anywhere
it's sort of by hand and imagine what
that wave front looks like and that's
what we want to find that's a
description so we're going to take the
eye
rather than putting a light bulb in
there we're going to shine a small laser
right down the top and make a bright
spot in the back on the retina just
about where the fovea is in fact so
people get nervous when you're talking
about shooting a laser into the retina
and rightly so it's something you want
to do carefully with this little power
as you can manage and sort of the
equipment that's out there I'll has a
rating for how many seconds it's safe to
put a person on there we used infrared
light so the person didn't see anything
but there's a thermal effect and it
starts to warm up the red man you don't
want to keep them there for more than a
few minutes and in fact we're able to do
this all in a couple seconds the
aberrations are similar for different
colored light how they're related but
different so yeah and that's important
but it turns out that you can
characterize everything by measuring in
one frequency so and that's what's
important going forward no in this case
so you could do that and then you would
be you would be essentially measuring
the errors at different angles in
peripheral vision in fact we have such
sort of you know the fovea you have most
of your important cones in one small
place and so for our purpose what we
were carrying about is just down the
center of the line of sight and in fact
you could do that and there's been some
research into that but your resolution
is so low off access that it's not as
interesting oh it's still interesting
but it's not what I did and so this is
what we were doing was a single point
the light comes down reflects back out
so we can sort of imagine this wave
front coming out at first it's perfectly
spherical it's propagating out here it
hits their lens picks up a bunch of
funny spherical aberrations it goes out
of the lens most of the aberrations that
are picked up coming in get cancelled
out by the other side but not all comes
up it's the back surface of the cornea
it's the front surface of the cornea and
then it comes out here so at this point
is sort of the theoretical wavefront
coming out of there I which contains all
the information or whatever was wrong
with their I at any point we don't have
to know where this is sort of a
description of everything that was wrong
inside the eye so this theoretical
wavefront is out there what do we do
with it well this is a technique that
was originally developed for telescopes
when you had aberrations and the idea is
to sort of take a piece of originally
used to be some black paper and you'd
punch a few holes into it and you put it
close to your light source and you make
turn the crank the light source up so
it's nice and bright little light gets
projected through the holes you can put
up some type of sensor they used to use
film now of course we're using a ccd or
something related and each one of those
spots will make a little mark there so
if you were to look at the image that
you would get it would be something like
this you would have a hole for each spot
but it would be moved and the amount of
displacement would tell you something
about the angle of that light in fact
all you'd have to do if I go back here
right you can measure the distance from
here to here by looking at your camera
and knowing where it should be and you
can measure the distance from a nearby
construction and you can sit okay the
angle of that Ray is theta and Phi and
so because you know where the hole is
you've now characterized the position
and the angle of each of those rays well
we talked about the phase of the wave
front it's not the phase of the you know
of an individual photon the e field or
something so that doesn't tell you the
phase directly but you can infer it
positioned in the direction improvement
so that was called a Hartman screen what
was shown up there Shaq came along and
and now it's called a Shack Hartman or
Hartman Shack device depending on which
one you like more and replaced a little
tiny pinhole with an individual lens so
you're gathering a lot more light as
important in our case because to make
our image right enough we have to crank
up that laser that's that's blasting
into their I we don't to crank it up too
much so the the more light we can gather
the better job we can do so
romance the spacing was such to avoid
aliasing with respect to the geometric
optics and then was the mask so in I'm
the telescope case yeah the mask was
moved with mall in fact the original
version well the original version was
just a piece of paper with one hole and
you could trace it then they decide it
is better to make a little strip you put
it on the telescope and you rotate it
around every 10 degrees or something you
could get a nice radial description of
what was going on which is well suited
for the type of errors that you would
have in telescope lens is really what
i'm doing here is i am creating in this
case a sequence of nine individual
cameras i'm just using one ccd but each
I've got nine separate lenses and i'm
creating nine separate images of this
spot in the back of the retina and in
reality i want to do this in two
dimensions so this is an example of the
type of array that's used this is one
that's actually used in astronomy the
ones we used him ophthalmology we're
smaller than that about a third the size
or so in this case sixteen hundred
little tiny spherical arrays and you
could sorry that lenses you can just
sort of barely see them in there and it
turns out to be quite a quite a job
constructing something like that so
they're fairly expensive and they do it
by taking a very thin sheet of I think
it's silica in this case and they sort
of engrave a bunch of cylinder lenses
running down one side and then cylinder
lenses running the other side along on
the other side and so your net result is
something approaching the lens if you
make it thin enough right as the light
goes through so you put this all
together it's called a Hartman shock
sensor and from it you can theoretically
infer what's the shape of the wave front
that's coming out so this is an example
kind of an image from a person's I you
go in there and measure it you can see a
spot from each one of the cameras and
hidden somewhere in that positional
information where the spot is is
information about the person's I there's
a few other things in there too this
reflection here what you're actually
seeing is or this is kind of bright spot
here that's what they call the purkinje
reflex we're putting in that laser near
the center of the eye some of the light
is bouncing
right off of the normal portion of the
cornea so you can look and say okay this
is actually the highest point in the
cornea right there that's interesting
some of these spots are nice and bright
either of them has sort of some strange
defects you look up here you don't have
a nice spot you have kind of a jumbled
mess and so you can look at the average
and say what that is but you can also
tell that it's not a very flat wavefront
just within that little spot you've got
some something going on it's messing it
up so we want to take that we want to
correlate so when you build your sensor
you're taking a normal picture of the
eye and you're taking this Hartman
shattuck picture the eye and you want to
calibrate it so you know where each of
those spots corresponds to in terms of
their actual you know optical I and
that's going to be useful for later if
you want to try to use that to correct
their aberrations you need to figure out
where each one of those spots belongs if
you have a really highly aberrated I
you'll see some strange patterns the
spots will be squished in one axis and
elongated in the other or you can have
almost anything going on and to do this
properly you have to know where each
spot you have to know which hole or you
know which lens corresponds to each spot
and so this is sort of interesting image
analysis problem you end up creating
this graph that kind of compares
adjacent spots and builds up a web what
you think is the most likely
characterization then you figure out
which one is in the center by looking at
the purkinje reflex and you can go in
and decide what the slope is for each
one of those points so now you have the
surface which you've described and there
are few more subtleties here right
you're measuring this some distance away
from the eye but you're actually
interested in what the wave front is
sort of right at the surface of the eye
where it's important to them or at some
point inside so you have to sort of back
out how that wavefront would have
changed from where it came out of there
I to our it measured that's interesting
information there are a few ways to do
it essentially you've got a bunch of
slopes and you want that you've measured
you want to know what was the surface
that created those the obvious way sort
of direct integration it doesn't work
too well because of the noise in the
system there's a few other there
decomposition is pretty popular many of
you are probably familiar with the
Zaraki polynomials a set of round basis
functions that have been used in optics
for a long time have more recently
started different methods a Fourier
reconstruction works pretty well because
the well if you're in Fourier space
going back and forth between us a
surface and it's derivative it's just as
simple as doing a sine cosine transform
so that's pretty easy what do we expect
those wave fronts to look like so here's
our sample near sighted person when we
first described and we had raised coming
in and focusing in the wrong place now
we're putting in light and we are
measuring the raises they come out right
and we expect something like that so
that's the kind of wavefront that a
nearsighted person would probably have
in fact this is a measurement from a
patient with about 2 diopters
nearsightedness it's mild just about the
gospel when you wouldn't need to have
glasses most people with one and a half
diopters don't bother wearing glasses
most people with to do so it's just
about like we'd expect now here's a
couple more interesting cases that are
not quite like we'd expect these are two
more people who both have about two
diopters of myopia two so all three of
these people are essentially wearing the
same glasses but in this case there's a
significant amount of positives for
collaboration on the left the patient on
the right has a significant amount of
negative spherical aberration so you can
see even though the same glass is the
best fit for each of them they're going
to have a substantially different
viewing experience wearing those here's
a few more funny ones before our
interesting ones this is just sort of
pure spherical aberration with a few
ripples there's kind of a phase map on
the left and then a 3d interpretation of
it on the right so this is someone who
didn't like classes at all didn't find
any glasses that help them but
especially at nighttime they had poor
vision and you can sort of imagine why
that is if the pupil was stopped up nice
and small it's relatively flat in here
but when they have the whole shape in
there some of those rays are going to be
focusing one direction so I'm going to
be focusing the other here's a patient
with what's called mixed astigmatism so
there's actually an average sort of a
saddle shape an average trend he's
slightly hyper opik
along this direction and slightly myopic
along that direction and in looking at
the wavefront it's tempting to imagine
that that's kind of the shape that's
wrong with their corny hand in some
cases it is but in most of the cases
it's a combination of things at
different surfaces so we are measuring
all the optical aberrations in a
person's eye what can we do with that
and one of the things that I'm going to
be talking about now is using that to
understand how they see the world a
couple of things we can maybe estimate
how well they see in a way that's more
meaningful than putting up a letter
chart and asking them to read and we can
kind of understand if they have things
that complaining about things they don't
like can give us a sense of what they
really look like help us determine maybe
how to fix it so the basics here is
using a point spread function which is
almost a reverse of the measurement we
took in the beginning but we couldn't
actually measure their point spread
function so we're sort of inferring it
from all this information right the idea
as a person is looking at a small point
of light it interacts with their eye and
it generates some image on their retina
here are some real simple cases person
who's nearsighted sees kind of a fuzzy
blob a person with astigmatism right so
that's near sighted on one axis this
other axis it's a fairly well focused
mark but along here you have significant
blurring so if there are lines that are
running this way it looks pretty sharp
in focus to them but a line running this
way will not be in focus here's our
emmett rope again this guy sees pretty
well now even he doesn't need glasses
has good vision there are some ripples
and you can see some of the effects down
there but they're small so this is a
pretty limited set what I've shown you
so far what I really want to do is
realistically perceive how a person
would see something so I got a bunch of
smart people in the room knew about eyes
and I had them kind of tell me
everything they thought affected how a
person sees optics and physiology and
then everything that I was sort of able
to characterize
I threw into a model the idea being that
maybe we can actually predict what
people see so the approach is a
geometric model this is a graph that
kind of puts together a few elements
here is an actual wavefront that was
measured now I used a sixth surface
version of the eye here I'm just kind of
shilling a simple one surface you got
rays coming in they're affected by the
wavefront they come down and focus in
fact these are real raised from a real
patient I've magnified the scale by
about 10x to make it bigger but you
capture the light from all the points
you put it through all the physics that
you can and some it all together and you
end up with a point spread function sort
of predicting how that person would see
something here's some simple examples
and i'm starting with just one
wavelength for a sense of scale scales
tricky when you're talking about this
because it's not that into it if so in
many cases i will throw on a letter e
onto these graphs and that's basically a
resolution indication of the 20 20 e on
an eye chart so roughly this is five
minutes of Arc on most of these graphs
and so if the features of your point
spread function are small compared to
the e then you can see better than 20 20
if the features are large compared to
the e then you cannot see 2020 so person
who cannot see 2020 and a person who can
that's just one wavelength of course an
important part of our visual experiences
that we were seeing in white light now
for just to back up a little bit and to
answer your question we measured it in
the infrared and now we're talking about
something in the visible spectrum so you
have to go in and figure out how would
those you know we measured it one way
that your question oh and what would it
look like in a different way and that's
not too hard if you understand what the
dispersion formula is for all those
services and so that's part of what's
going on here so chromatic aberration if
you're looking at white light your eye
focuses the blue part differently from
the red part from the green part and it
turns out to be a significant effect you
know over a diopter in the range that we
really care about here's red light kind
of model in a myopic eye is coming to
that
soon if we were to put in the same light
with a blue we would get this right so
he becomes actually a little more
nearsighted when we put in the blue
light so there's one wavelength at this
whole series of wavelengths weighted
proportionally over the white light
spectrum kind of that we care about so
it fills it out doesn't change it too
much in these cases though we can do a
little bit better than that because we
can go and we can model the visual
response to those wavelengths and we can
come up with a color version of it so
now assuming that the persons looking at
a white source of light we're making
some predictions about what they're
going to see in color this is
diffraction-limited case a color airy
disk if you will and here's our mixed
astigmatism patient again is interesting
you can see the blue light is better
focused in one direction and the red
light is better focused in the other
these are two eyes that have roughly the
same amount of D focused except one of
them is nearsighted and one of them is d
focused in the other direction the
farsighted and you see kind of a
shocking fringing effect going on and it
turns out that is a real observed effect
it's just sort of on the on the edge of
human perception but it is real if you'd
look at our nearsighted patient again
where was the blue light we talked about
that was the red you put them both
together and you get something like this
in fact this is sort of what we see are
nearsighted patient is imaging after the
point of best focus and so he has kind
of a blue frames on the outside our
farsighted patient is imaging before the
point of best focus and so he has
something like that on there of course
the eye doesn't respond to light in a
linear fashion so that becomes important
in a way that's useful in dark
conditions but it's actually irritating
you've got aberrations because light
that otherwise wouldn't matter too much
it starts to show up and bother you so
in fact if flight gets too bright it
begins to saturate the receptors and so
you have to decide how bright do you
want that light to be it's not just kind
of a theoretical point you have to put
some actual value to it and we'll
proceed from there how you do the
reconstruction seems to matter in the
beginning we were using zarnecki
polynomials which are relatively smooth
and well behaved and
historical reasons but there's they
don't capture all the information that
we use to measure and so we experimented
with a higher resolution reconstruction
essentially using all the points in a
more realistic way and this is the sort
of of a type of output you get and this
turns out to be pretty close to what
people actually see if you are slightly
nearsighted or farsighted and you look
up at a street lamp for example at night
without your glasses you'll see
something like that it's fuzzed-out but
there's a fair bit of texture hidden
inside there what seems like the basis
functions you really want to be kind of
wavelets that correspond it to the
standard geometric aberrations well
that's but what are the standard yeah we
have to measure the high resolution and
then and so that's that's what the sirna
key functions were originally in the
telescope days and in fact they would
only use something like eight or ten
separate functions and that would do a
pretty good job of describing telescopes
they were right here exactly exactly the
human eye yeah people tend to have
storage like they were out playing and
their brother threw a rock and it hit
their eye and ever since then they've
seen funny things you know at night and
so then obviously they've got some kind
of chip or scrape on their cornea and
that's something that's not necessarily
well defined by a smooth basis function
well it then that's a field of study the
bottom line is it seems to be that we
want to use as much information that we
can the first attempts didn't capture
everything here's our patient with the
high spherical aberration see that looks
pretty similar when we when we use the
higher resolution reconstruction but
here's someone who had significant
problems and they're you're getting
entirely a different effect this person
was complaining about a double images
when they look the things you can't see
that here but you can get a sense that
yeah they might get to sort of distinct
images when they looked at something
there how much with that
changing the spatial resolution in the
lens array that you use for the capture
just synthetically averaging it down
saying a factor of two in each dimension
and then going through I'm just
wondering if you've captured the data
with enough fidelity whether there's
almost like a gifts phenomena in the
sampling so it that's a good question
and and the way you do that is by right
increasing the resolution until you
don't see changes anymore and I I didn't
yeah right so and the answer is when you
decrease the resolution by a factor of
two you see in most cases you see small
changes that aren't very significant but
there are some cases what you do see and
so there's probably no as you make it
higher there's a smaller and smaller
percentage of the population for which
it matters and I don't know exactly what
that is here we're getting close in fact
since since I've stopped working on this
they've gotten in and double the
resolution I don't have that information
you had about how that's working but
obviously it's a drive they want to do
that this is sort of a repeatability
test a number of people who tested
several times throughout the day and so
what you see minor changes due to
accommodation your eyes get tired over
the day how you blink a lot your eyes
get dry you have something to drink all
those things change your optics a little
bit but they don't change it too much
they're unique enough that you know with
50 different people you could probably
identify someone by their point spread
function so that's the theory does it
work and the answer is that it seems to
this is um a patient who came in
complaining about poor vision
specifically they had artifacts they had
things they were seeing that they didn't
like and it was kind of hard for them to
describe what they saw so they were
given a small piece of paper and we set
up a target a little little white light
in front of the grid and they were asked
to close one eye than the other and draw
what they saw then we took them we
measured them when we did this point
spread function prediction and this is
what we got so it's not perfect but it's
a pretty darn good match it's probably
within the limits of the artistic
ability of the of the patient which is
probably more artistic ability than I
would have so
so it seems to it this is a long way
from a you know up study on a thousand
people while you might try to go in and
really prove it but it looks very
promising so it's a little it seems a
little voyeuristic to me you're going in
and you're saying k what does this
person see you're putting yourself a
little bit in their head and so that's
interesting in a way you get a sense of
how they perceive the world in a way
that we really haven't been able to do
before and so one of the things that's
hard and grappling here with is the
sense of scale this is someone with bad
vision not terrible there's probably
people in the room with worse vision
than this and here's someone with good
vision a little tiny bit of sphere and
cylinder and some some of those higher
order aberrations I've got the e in each
of them but if I put them on the same
scale you really get a sense of what
life is like this person has pretty good
vision person here not so much in fact
you imagine if that's what you're used
to you know navigating the world with
this is just phenomenally bad another
sense of scale that I find works pretty
well the full moon is about 30 arc
minutes so you can throw it up there so
mr. good vision can't look up and see
the moon you know count the moiré on
the surface whatever to see if pretty
well mr. bad vision he can tell there's
a moon there because there's a fair
amount of light but it's spread out over
a significant portion of the eye and in
fact if you threw up a flash like you
might think that was the moon too yeah
yes it's pretty bad and people get
before they become well pathological
cases you'll have people that are two or
three times worse than that in terms of
the and the whole sprint up this this is
probably about a 90 95 97 percentile of
bad case and over here the good case
that is better than your average person
and that's a so we're doing this we're
predicting what people are saying here's
some of the fun things we can do with it
one of them is image convolution what
you talked about before you have a point
spread function you can apply it to a
surface and imagine ok well how someone
going to see with that so we have color
at our disposal so we can go in
take an object and analyze it from a
color point of view and predict what is
that person seeing in this case under
white light so here's our 2020 eye chart
and at first glance you might as well it
doesn't look very sharp and focused but
this is the 2020 line when you're
reading the 2020 line the only test is
can you tell what those letters are and
there's obviously enough spatial
information you can go through and read
those letters and you can probably go
through and get some of the letters off
the next line so this person has vision
that's better than 20 20 or at least I
can make a pretty strong prediction
about what their visual acuity would be
according to the snellen test anyway
just by doing this but that sort of
raises the question what kind of light
are we interested in well we have some
choice here is a patient with good
vision in this case we've given them a
solar spectrum and calculated what the
eye chart would look like to them I
think the 2020 line is here so this
person has great vision when you're in
white light now if we were to go in
let's say they were looking at the eye
chart all they had was a little blue LED
flashlight they turn that on they still
see pretty well now they're looking at
just one wavelength now instead of a
blue one if we were to give them a red
LED flashlight this is what they're
seeing same i say my chart but because
the aberrations are affected by the
wavelength they're getting a
substantially different image in fact
now there because it's so spread out
there getting a few points that these
kind of double images that people hate
this is the spectrum under a sodium
street light which is mostly 590 with a
few spikes around there and so this
person might be really happy and you may
have noticed this yourself might be
really happy reading a newspaper and
fairly you know white light but you get
into a limited spectrum you try reading
it all of a sudden it's hard to focus it
doesn't seem clear and it turns out this
this is a you actually use these
chromatic at least this is what we think
will you use these chromatic aberrations
to help as a focusing visual cue you
know the eye isn't the camera you're
trying to focus it just like a normal
camera but you can't do these fancy
splitting the optics and recombine and
so your eye is always looking for
information will I improve the image by
focusing out focusing
and because blue lights a little more
tightly focused than red that's one of
the cues your system uses with which of
those two is in better focus it'll move
it in that direction so if you have a
white light spectrum which is continuous
you have a nice gradient your eyes sort
of trained to use that to help you focus
if you're looking at an artificial white
light spectrum so some of the compact
fluorescents if you look at the spectrum
they basically just have a few big lines
and most of their energy is there and
you can say it has a certain color
temperature and it's approximating in a
certain spectrum but it's not really
when you go in and look at the point
spread function instead of giving them
kind of a nice averaged effect you're
getting three sharp distinct fact
effects that are all focused differently
and this is probably one of the reason
why some people just people with maybe I
is their little messed up don't mind it
too much but people who have good vision
or people who can correct well with
their glasses so they have good vision
they tend to not like the compact
fluorescent lights or some of them
that's probably one of the reasons
because their eyes confused about these
cues it's got multiple images it's
trying to decide which one to focus on
and it gives you a headache so some of
the newer lights have a more broad
spectrum that will obviously be the
direction we need to go in to make
people happy with we don't have to limit
ourselves to little targets like that we
can go in and simulate things in the
real world this is a person with my how
the person who should be wearing the
glasses to drive just barely but didn't
bring them these are the headlights for
a BMW at 100 meters away in this case we
can also model the light source so those
are the halogen lights if the driver had
instead opted for the xenon we can go
ahead and that's what the person would
see so we have this ability to kind of
recreate high dynamic situations and say
what would this mean to the person what
would it look like everything I've shown
you so far has been two-dimensional but
the model of the eye that we've got his
three dimensional and there's some extra
information in there that's useful so
I'm going to start with is a patient who
sees pretty well this is their point
spread function just sort of as they are
zero diopters they don't penny lens in
front of them if you would artificially
hell here's a there's an easy for scale
if you were to artificially
put a lens in front of them and make
them far side a little bit they would
have this kind of farsighted point
spread function you could also put a
lens in front of them to make them
near-sighted and you'd have this sort of
blue fringe nearsighted point spread
function so dioptric power is one way to
think about the difference between these
but you could also imagine them as being
before and after the imaging plane
because as you move forward and backward
from the imaging plane the power changes
so you can sort of establish them in
three dimensions in some sense then you
can go in and fill in the intervening
points and create a description sort of
the volume of light as it's coming down
to the best focus and as it's going back
out so as we call volumetric point
spread function there's a variety of
ways of calculating these but here we're
taking all the information we have in
the model and really trying to
understand this is the light a lot in
fact it's coming in from that direction
coming down to the best focus and if we
could see the light as it was coming
into their eye that is more or less what
it would look like and in fact surprise
surprise it looks kind of like this Mon
we had there now this is a volumetric
point spread function for a simple
operation free I completely flat and it
doesn't seem that interesting until you
put it next to this this is the same
thing for an eye with a single
wavelength of light so this person who's
looking at the single wavelength of
light or alternatively who didn't have
any chromatic aberration he has a really
nice focus at one point right there but
as soon as he gets a little bit before
after that the focus just goes to act
really quickly over here because you've
got all these frequencies of light and
they're all focused slightly different
so you actually have a nice compact
point probably that's useful for seeing
and reading over almost five of these so
the fact that we have these chromatic
aberrations gives us an improved depth
of field you can pick up features much
more easily that's another one of the
reasons people really like polychromatic
light here's our mixed astigmatism
patient so you'll see
better focus on one axis out here better
focus on the other out there no point
where everything comes in but with the
right combination of cylinder lenses you
can do a pretty good job of correcting
that person here's someone who has no
hope of being corrected you could put
glasses in front of them all day and try
changing the focus or changing the
cylinder but there's no point along
there where you have a nice image and so
this is the type of person who's really
complaining and unhappy with what
they're seeing at different pupil sizes
so obviously when people have small
pupils they've gotten so this one is
sort of unfair because you've got
diffraction effects that I've been
ignoring and down in the one millimeter
one and a half millimeter range will
start to show up and decrease the
quality but up at two or three this is
where people see pretty well and also
they have a pretty good depth of field
you get nighttime conditions 6 7
millimeters is common the point spread
function is not nearly as good and if
you get off a little bit it gets worse
from one measurement so you don't you
measure you measure them at the max you
measure them in a dark room and because
you're able to tell which part of the
system the aberrations are associated
with you can figure out how it's going
to change as the pupil size constricts
down there are very small effects so and
that's something that probably would be
worth including I didn't but it's a good
question one thing that people tried
with early was there's little drops of
atropine you can put in a person and it
paralyzes the muscles in the eye and
your ppls get very big and you look like
you're on drugs and it turns out that
changes the wave front of the eye
because you've got kind of attention all
the time and these muscles in your eye
and when you paralyze those all of a
sudden that tension goes away and so
that turns out to be a bad way to
measure people but give them a few
minutes in the dark room seems to be
best everything I showed was for daytime
conditions using the same aberrations
you can model nighttime conditions where
you've got a different diameter
different to the people a different peak
response so here's the same patient in
both conditions
obviously it's a little worse on the
right but sort of the interesting thing
here in the daytime if you look their
best focus is just about here at the
retinol playing and they can see pretty
well at the night time because their
most sensitive to different wavelengths
wavelengths that are focused differently
and because they have different
aberrations in the periphery of their I
I which are only available in the pupil
is open their best focus is actually up
here a little bit so this person i'm
guessing has what you call nighttime
myopia which is a fairly common
condition in which people see okay
during the day but they find they need
some weak glasses at night so if you can
go in and measure them can you correct
them so i'll go through this real fast
people have been trying to correct
vision for a long time rumor has it that
Nero had an emerald monocle that he
would wear her to help with his myopia
it's probably not true but it's a good
story the first definite spectacles came
out of Italy ground courts Benjamin
Franklin so things stayed the same for a
long time bifocals stigmatism you guys
are familiar with ery from his work he
had a stigmatism himself and so he sort
of invented a cure for it is amidst
personally created the first cylinder
lenses in Houston himself and they went
on to promote the idea contact lenses in
fact have been around for over a hundred
years the early ones were made out of
glass you can imagine some of the perils
of Allah of wearing that the idea of
modifying the I permanently to make it
see better as a compelling one and sort
of the first effort was this doctor in
Colombia and his plan was cut the cornea
off with a knife freeze it turned it on
a wood lathe to change the shape and
then sew it back on and they didn't try
that very long but they learned some
interesting things one is that actually
sometimes it worked and two is that the
eye is amazingly it does a good job of
healing itself and once you put
something on there and it stays for a
few months it's pretty stable so some
people actually came away from that with
good vision if it didn't work that well
radial keratotomy the idea was
discovered by
accident so this doctor in Russia he had
a patient got some broken glass same as
I maybe he was are your contact I don't
know he had to go in there and remove
all this glass in the process he had to
put a bunch of cuts into the cornea to
get the glass out six months later he
came back and checked on the boy and the
boy didn't need to wear the glasses
anymore so brilliant all I have to do is
put some cuts in the eyeball and people
will see better and it to a certain
extent it works the eye is under sort of
dynamic tension at all times so if you
make a cut somewhere every other piece
of the I would change shape a little bit
and he came up with some formulas about
how to cut and how many and being in
Russia it was sort of picked up by the
government and they made these
incredible assembly lines it's hard to
see here but there are eight patients on
the big rotating circle with eight beds
and they're eight doctors and each
doctor makes one cut that he's
especially trained for and then the beds
rotate so you can see happening and they
do the next cut and this was better than
the freezing but-but-but and it was
picked up a few other countries a little
bit so there are people and in fact some
of the early patients we saw who are
complaining about problems that had this
procedure done decades ago and some of
them see pretty well and some of them
have problems again we learned a few
more things sort of it probably because
it was happening in Russia and it was
set up so big and it was pushed by the
government it went on for a number of
decades before they finally admitted
that it really was not a good thing to
do and they shut down the process
there's still plenty of people who have
that procedure excimer laser came along
in the 80s originally for semi conductor
use they discovered there's a human hair
they discovered you could make really
fine incisions with it removed tissue
pretty cleanly and so dr. Steve trow Cal
in the 90s applied it to laser eye
surgery the idea was you want to change
the shape of a person's lens each time
you shoot the laser it takes off a
little layer of material so you can do a
treatment that look something like this
making a beam smaller and smaller and
when you're done you end up with
something that looks like a lens and so
you etch that under the person's cornea
and it changes their focus and then they
see better and it took some iterations
but in fact it works pretty well but
what we want to do is sort of a whole
level beyond that these are the simple
shapes these are the kind of shapes we
want to
correct you can't get there by just
describing this series of concentric you
know wedding cake layers one of the
interesting challenges here is that when
we're measuring that wavefront we found
that you need if you want to correct it
you need to do it accurately and sort of
our goal here you want to get an
accuracy of better than a tenth of a
micron of tissue and each laser pulse
removes almost three times that much so
you want to find a way to put these
laser pulses together that gives you an
accuracy and a precision much smaller
than a single laser pulse so it becomes
an interesting problem other problems
it's not really simple what happens when
the laser hits the I the second pulse
the first laser pulse doesn't change the
I very much it excites the tissue in
some way the second laser pulse remove
some tissue the third one does in a
different way so it's sort of nonlinear
projection effect so you put a laser
pulse down in the center of the eye it's
hitting a different shape than near the
edge so you got to take that into
account and we talked about the
structural changes with PRK as you
removing tissue the eye itself is going
to change shape as it relaxes and so you
need to take that into account and so
what we did was do lots and lots of
measurements and build a model that
predicts forgiven series of laser pulses
what's going to happen we're not yet
answering the question you know what
laser pulses do we do we just build the
model and a lot of this was done with
the pig eyes that was the summer interns
job was going in and cleaning these and
setting them up and we do lots of
experiments shooting the laser in
different ways and measuring what
happened and then we had to do some
experiments to figure out where the
differences between pegs and humans and
so on and so forth essentially then we
reduced to a sort of a puzzle you've got
these pieces which are the laser pulses
and you know the final shape you want
and you got to find a way to put them
together that gives you that output
except in this case the pieces here are
the actual all the things the laser can
do and the final shape we want to get is
what the the wavefront change we want to
induce on the I including all the
structural changes and everything that
goes on in fact the way we do that is we
use the model as a comeback
we use the model and do a global search
on it so we start with a random
treatment of pulses and see how well
does that correct the eye we go in and
we modify it we use kind of an iterative
stochastic evolutionary strategy so we
make little changes to the treatment and
basically you optimize the heck out of
this model so you can evaluate about a
thousand different treatments per second
and then you just let it run it takes
about 45 seconds per awe and current and
it improves improves what you saw here
was the treatment plan we wanted to
achieve this is the best solution so far
as it's doing its evolutionary search
and there's the difference between the
two so there's no way to directly solve
the problem but if you do your search
you can find out if there is a solution
that's good enough these are sort of the
details for that one you saw there it
turns out you're doing this one with
only 113 pulses that's roughly the size
and location of the different pulses if
you go in and model how each one alters
the cornea and how they interact you can
see after a few they start interacting
in a very complicated ugly way but the
blue the purple dots there indicate the
shape we were trying to get so to sort
of by magic when you stack them all up
they come out to be well it's not by
magic of course it's because we searched
through thousands and thousands of
possible solutions so the question isn't
you know how do we find the right
solution the question is there a
solution that would correct this person
real quickly so some of the challenges
you want to do the surgery the eyeball
is always moving even during the surgery
and you have to make sure you put each
pulse in exactly the right place this is
not a real eye but it's some its motion
of a real height from one of our
experiments and so the way you deal with
that is you have cameras that are
watching the eye and as it moves during
the treatment you riain the laser
between each pole so that it goes down
in the right place some of that motion
is associated with the heartbeat or the
breathing and some of it is people just
nervously looking left and right even
though they're not supposed to torsion
of the eye most people don't realize it
but you're i can actually twist quite a
bit left to right without it bothering
you too much in fact i could go and
probably rotate your eyeball 10 or 15
degrees and it it wouldn't hurt you too
much except for the grabbing your
eyeball part right you've got muscles on
the top and bottom that steer it but
there's no man
anism to you know set it like this so if
you're looking at somewhere then you
look to the left and then look up and
look down there's sort of a hysteresis
your eyeballs at a different angle now
and so that matters to last if we're
measuring these little aberrations and
this is another visualization of what
would happen if you tried to correct
those errors and you got the angle wrong
so so all right pretty good sharp focus
nice point spread function when
everything is aligned if you measure
them one angle and you treat them off so
you realize usually only change a few
degrees 45 but they can't change as many
as 15 which is what I'm showing here so
you need to get that right in fact what
we do that initial picture of the eye I
told you about we go in and we look at
features on the iris and then when it's
time to do the surgery we look at the
same features and we rotate the whole
treatment to line up on that I again the
laser is pretty safe and it's not too
hot but you want to do the treatment as
quickly as you can so in fact eyeballs
actually melt if you if you're not
careful they don't call it melting they
call it denaturing and it's was if you
heat up the eyeball it actually starts
to change shape almost like a plastic
bag if you put a blowtorch on a little
curl and wiggle so every treatment we go
through we analyze it from a thermal
point of view and say okay what's the
temperature then we rearrange the pulses
and change the timing in such a way that
will stay at a safe treatment
temperature but get it done as quickly
as possible so we put it out there in
fact it works pretty well this is
results from a study everybody could
pass the driving test ninety-eight
percent were at 2020 and if it is what
we were really interested in seventy
percent got to the 2016 or better point
without glasses or contacts and that's
really kind of the amazing result we're
taking a fairly big group of people and
moving them into the better than normal
category which was our goal and this is
an example of the point spread function
from one of the patients before and
afterwards so that's it that's the
eyeballs are cool and there's lots of
new technology you can use to go in
there and study them and lots of
opportunities so thank you
it's a little late but got any questions
so did you do any standard an optical
correction not laser ablation but rather
just with you know prismatic lenses and
one thing or another in your initial
tests to see how predictive so yeah
here's an interesting one of the things
we could do is instead of actually so we
had the model that described other laser
interacted with the cornea we were able
to sort of replace that with a model
that described how the laser interacts
with optical grade plastic and so you
could take a patient whose vision was
something like this and we could go in
take a lens we could calculate what was
the wavefront we would have to do to
pre-warp the light so that by the time
it got to their I it would neutralize
the aberrations that they already had
and so that was one of the safety things
we were able to do try this region
patient give them a lens have them put
on look at an eye chart and see were
they happy and it's sort of tricky to do
this because you've got these little
aberrations has to be very carefully
aligned you know with glasses it doesn't
matter too much but if you're two
millimeters off here all of a sudden you
could be making the problem worse
instead of better so it's not a good
solution you wouldn't want to walk
around with these in life although for
years I carried one of these in my
wallet is kind of an emergency monocle
and it worked okay but so that was one
of the things there were also some
experiments that I wasn't a part of to
use adaptive optics to kind of in real
time how you have a deformable mirror
that would measure and change these so
people could look around and see what
they were looking at it never really
turned into a product though I'm I need
to be clear I'm not advocating anything
the company that I worked for was is
what's called physics in fact they were
they were bought up by a bigger company
called advanced medical optics and the
procedure has has FDA approval now for a
fairly good group but not everybody
people who are real extreme vision one
way or the other aren't yet approved is
still kind of it's still early
experimental but it's increasing most of
the laser eye surgery is done in the US
and the last six months have been with
this type of technology
the doctors like it because they charge
more the company likes it because they
can charge more and the patients
actually end up seeing better so it's
pretty much one way but I I'm not
advocating it all for anything this is
just interesting work all right thank
