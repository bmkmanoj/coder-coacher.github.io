I'm an engineer here at Google and I'm
just going to briefly introduce Ellie
and Holden so if if you have you know
face the the challenge sort of you know
every year of thinking about your who
you're going to give to which charities
which causes which I'm sure we've all
sort of tackled that challenge it can be
really frustrating how do I evaluate
well you know what's the most optimal
way to give and if you're a Googler and
you're particularly analytic in your way
of thinking about this then when you
actually go to the websites of these
charities or you go to evaluators you're
often sort of dumbfounded by the lack of
information and sort of the lack of
transparency let's at least I have been
and so one of my friends introduced me
to Ellie and Holden and what they're
doing is trying to sort of bring a lot
more clarity to to that problem and I
think that's going to be particularly
relevant to anyone here at Google who is
you know really interested in being very
analytical about their evaluations so
without further ado I'll introduce
Eileen Holden from give well yeah hey
I'm I'm holding karnovski
Ellie's can do the first part of the
talk and I'm not gonna distract it okay
well thank you all for coming
and wanting to listen to my give well
I'm excited to tell you what what we're
doing I mean I think Omar gave a good
brief intro we're a non-profit charity
evaluator and our mission is to help
individual donors find organizations to
support that you can confidently say are
having a significant impact on the
problems they're trying to solve
now give well started with a simple
question which is essentially where
should I donate and that's a simple
question to ask but we found it to be a
very difficult question to answer in the
way that the we found that the type of
question that we were asking for example
is a question that is it say K through
12 education you know that's a cause
that's in the news a lot it's a known
intractable problem to improve
educational outcomes for children from
inner-city lower socioeconomic
backgrounds you know the types of
questions that I have when I think
about that problem or well what you know
what works and what works best is it
tutoring programs smaller class sizes
better teachers you know those are the
types of questions that I wanted to know
the answers to when I thought about
where to give and because those problems
are so difficult when we first started
talking about this
it was Holden and I and a few other
friends at the investment firm we used
to work at we decided to form a smaller
group of people to to try to answer and
work together to answer these questions
now we weren't giving a lot of money
away we each were giving maybe five to
ten thousand dollars but we wanted to
make sure that when we gave our charity
we could have confidence that it was
having a significant impact that we were
really finding the best organizations
and so to do that we set about
researching researching these causes and
we tried a few different ways of getting
information to start we went looking for
an aggregate source of information that
would tell us pretty much what every
charity what charities do and whether it
works and the first site we came to that
you might be familiar with is Charity
Navigator it's a pretty well-known site
and its approach is to rate charities on
a four star scale based on the financial
information they provide on their tax
forms and specifically they look at the
percentage of the money they spend that
goes to their overhead say salaries and
fundraising relative to the amount they
spend on programs the direct services
they provide now that's important
information to say we doubt though very
worst charities the organizations that
are maybe scamming you and using the
money for themselves but it obviously is
not the type of information that's going
to help you choose the best that's going
to help answer the types of questions
that I talked about earlier you know
with an education program does tutoring
work do smaller class sizes work do
better teachers work it has no bearing
on that on that question and so when we
found that we were you know we turned on
to the to another another arena because
we didn't find the information there
that that could help us
the next place we turned was charities
directly we said you know we can't get
an aggregate source let's go right to
the to the individual organizations and
ask them what they're doing and so I
personally was researching clean water
in Africa that that was the cause that I
wanted
to donate to and when I asked charities
for information essentially saying what
are you trying to accomplish and what's
your evidence that those activities are
best they answered by and large with you
know what I'd call a marketing slogan
the answers I got were you know $20
saves a child water for life and I said
well you know that's great you know I'd
love to give $20 to provide a child with
water for life how does that work you
know what what does my money get and how
does that calculation come out that I
could have confidence that that number
was a reasonable representation of what
was actually going to occur and when I
dug deeper they they weren't they were
either unwilling or unable to to go any
further with me it seemed pretty clear
that they were surprised that I was
asking the questions you know some were
some were sort of happy and grateful
saying those are great questions you
know we should be able to answer other
organizations were suspicious I mean I
think Holden Holden was accused of of
working for a competitor and trying to
get the inside edge on what this other
charity was was doing but so after after
those two those two attempts we took the
final try at getting information we went
right to foundations you know so
foundations like the gate the Gates
Foundation google.org other foundations
are you know they're essential mission
is to identify great organizations
research them and then support the ones
that are best and so we said hey
foundations have this information let's
go write to them and ask them about
their activities and seek their advice
about where we should give and when we
called them up they they would tell it I
mean the conversation was essentially go
as follows we'd say hey you know this is
what we're looking to do I'm interested
in education where should I give and
they'd say well you know go to our
website we have a list of our grantees
you can check those out and you know
we'd go to the website and and look it
over and see a list of names you know
500 organizations each with five words
about them and we'd go back and say hey
you know this what I'm looking for is
information on the best you know I have
a little money to give I really want
information that's going to tell me this
is the best organization to support or
gonna help me differentiate and when we
ask them for that they said look you
know we're not really at liberty to
discuss what one charity is doing versus
another why one might be better than
another you know that's confidential and
we can't
we can't take a stand publicly that
talks about what one grantee does versus
another and you know that was that was
disappointing and surprising but
nonetheless we came to the end of this
phase we spent about you know three to
six months working in these in this
small group at our investment firm doing
this research and while we were
frustrated with the lack of information
we could find we wanted to make sure
that we published what we had found so
other people that wouldn't have to go
through the same process that we did if
they were interested in supporting those
causes and so we put up an old-style
wiki that we we distributed internally
in the in the company that we worked at
and people could look at that to make
their they're giving decisions and as we
did that Holden and I in particular of
our group found ourselves really excited
and passionate about the research we
were doing you know I I liked my old job
at the investment firm but when it came
time to check out Friday I didn't want
to think about trading strategies or
markets over the weekend and when I
started researching charity I had the
exact opposite response you know it was
the infant it was the research that was
keeping me up at night it's the stuff I
wanted to work on over the weekend and
that led both of us to start thinking
about taking this at full-time making it
a project that we spent all our time on
because we were so excited about the the
work we were doing but before we were
ready to go full-time the major question
we had was you know how big a deal is
the lack of information that we have you
know we all
it's impossible to us that foundations
like the Gates Foundation have access to
great research they give so much money
well you know they may give so much more
money than I do that my $5,000 Holdings
money doesn't add up to a lot in the
scheme of things and so while I might
not have access to information it may
not matter much that I don't because the
money I give may not be that much but as
we started to look into the question we
found that the opposite was true that in
fact individuals make up the lion's
share of giving in the US and so for as
a way of framing it you know Bill Gates
gives about two billion dollars a year
his through his foundation the Gates
Foundation including the the Warren
Buffett gift and you know that's about
four times as big as the next-biggest
foundation in terms of
dollars given away every year and
individuals collectively make up that
part of the pie is more than a hundred
times as much as the Gates Foundation
gives and it's about six times as much
as all foundations combined and so when
we saw those when we had those two facts
held together the you know the lack of
information and the fact that all this
capital was out there with no mechanism
for identifying the best organizations
to go to we thought this was a problem
that was worth going after and you know
we think that the the reason that we're
in this situation the reason that you
know individuals have so much money to
give but there's no mechanism for
allocating it well is that charities are
not now raising money based on
demonstrating their effectiveness you
know instead and this isn't in my
experience from you know working part
time when I was doing this on the side
and in the last year doing this
full-time they're primarily raising
money through you know inducing guilt in
donors to say oh I feel so bad I should
give or through social social events you
know and that's the that's the same
thing we've heard from fund raisers that
you know that's the way that charities
are competing with each other to raise
their money and instead you know we'd
like to our mission at give well is to
change the incentives for charities to
put out to donors what the information
on the effectiveness of the activities
so that we can change the incentives and
force charities to compete on their
results as opposed to on their ability
to market and so in order to do that we
we raised about $300,000 from our former
co-workers and our former boss and we
use that money to offer grants to
charities in five different causes we
offer grants of about twenty five to
forty thousand dollars and we about 150
charities applied for our grants and in
the application process we told them
that all the materials that they
submitted would be made public because
we wanted to make a public website that
allowed people to use that information
to decide where to give in that process
you know over the about halfway through
our research we got some publicity
you know both good publicity because the
information we had put together was you
and great and bad publicity because the
mistakes we made but nevertheless we
think that the resource that we've
created now is something that doesn't
exist anywhere else and we think help
can help donors make more informed
giving decisions so I want to pause here
to take questions if you have any and
then I'm going to turn it over to Holden
to talk about some of the specific
things we found in our first year well
first of all what were your categories
we looked at two causes in the
developing world health and poverty and
three in the US child care education and
job training it seems to me that one of
the hardest things there is you know
weighing short-term benefit versus
long-term benefit did you actually you
know think about different ways of doing
that or you know I think we'll get let's
get to that question when we go through
the specifics of the research we did
right other questions all right so I'm
home karnovski I said hi really quickly
before and I want to talk about the
research we did over the first year and
the five causes Ellie mentioned and what
we found and you know just for me
personally I mean after a year again
this started with us being donors trying
to figure out where to give and I know
that I've changed my mind an incredible
amount on where the causes are that I
want to give so I'm gonna I'm gonna talk
about these and then I'm gonna talk
about what we're researching now what
comes next and some of the causes that
we may be doing down the line because
one of the issues about giveWell is that
you know we don't believe in using a
formulaic approach to evaluating
charities we don't believe in
one-size-fits-all and so we really can't
cover everything at once and and that's
something I'm gonna discuss is how we
prioritize and what's coming up next but
first I just want to talk about what
came out of our first year so first off
just talk about the US and one of the
main things we were focused on is this
idea of equality of opportunity and the
achievement gap which was originally my
cause in the sense that as an individual
donor I was giving five grand a year to
inner-city education charities you know
four four three
or so before we started give well and to
me this had always been the most
appealing cause because I sort of had
always operated under the assumption
that education is the key to opportunity
that if you can provide a kid with a
better education and it's something we
must know how to do because we get the
wealthier kids the good education that
you can make an enormous difference and
so these charts are a quick illustration
of that I mean it's certainly it's
definitely a fact that people who grow
up in socioeconomically better-off
households they have higher test scores
they do better in school they're more
likely to graduate they have higher
earnings in adulthood they have lower
incarceration rates and a whole host of
other factors and one of the I I have to
say that one of the most sort of
intuitive and appealing interventions we
looked at kind of early on for dealing
with this problem is the idea of
scholarships we dealt with one charity
that was basically offering scholarships
to low-income children for them to go
from their public schools which are
often very poor quality public schools
to private schools not the most
expensive private schools but their
choice of private schools often
parochial and in my mind this just
seemed like a you know a bankable
intervention it seemed like it made
perfect sense if you take a kid from
these poor quality schools into an
average one they should do much better
and the achievement gap should should
close or should you know at least
partway close and this is something very
interesting that in fact in a lot of
education it's very hard to find really
good rigorous studies of impact but this
was one of the exceptions this is this
is something that was studied using a
randomized controlled trial where what
they did is they offered vouchers they
offered they had a lot of kids in New
York City apply for these scholarships
to private schools and then they used a
randomized lottery to choose some of the
kids to get the scholarships and then
they followed both groups of kids the
ones who'd been offered the scholarship
whether or not they took it and the ones
who had not been offered the scholarship
and they tracked their test scores and
they tried to figure out sort of you
know presuming that any difference they
saw would be attributable to the
scholarships and the results are very
surprising to me so the
details are written up on our website
but the short stories in these charts
that the two groups started off in about
the same place underperforming on math
and reading not surprising there are
low-income kids and they were separated
randomly but after three years there was
there was no difference there was no
change um this is one of the first
things we found in the education cause
and I have to say that it was it came as
a shock to me that's something that
seems to make so much sense didn't seem
to have worked and to me you know it's
complex and there's debates and we've
written it up but to me this is evidence
of something that's not working at least
for the extent I would think so we
looked into this cause more and and just
a you know to get to the highlights I
mean this to me starts to explain the
conundrum and also the incredible
challenge of Education is that these
high income and low income kids have a
very large gap in proficiency the day
they enter kindergarten at age five and
and that's what this chart shows it's
about that gap is about as big as it's
going to get the day they enter
kindergarten and realizing this I mean
it's something that is is certainly
known in the field but wasn't known to
us as donors and is certainly something
that we never heard of charity bring up
really made us look at a lot of these
education interventions in a whole new
light now this is not to say that
education interventions can't work and
in fact we think we found at least one
that we we think does we would at least
bet on it or donate to it but it
certainly makes you more skeptical that
without proof to accept the idea of a
fairly simple intervention closing this
gap and so basically we went through the
charities that applied we went through
as much research as we could and we
found that there is very little as I
said strong evaluation that could really
isolate the results of programs in a way
that study that I described before did
there are a lot of studies where they
simply compared kids in a program to
kids not in a program and find that the
kids in the program do better but
frankly I think that there's large
concerns about selection bias in these
sorts of studies and just to give it
really to me what's a pretty clear
example a program called chess in the
schools finds that kids participating in
the chess program I
perform kids who aren't and to me write
anything to me I'm I'm not totally
shocked by that and I'm not sure that I
would attribute it to the effect of the
chess program as opposed to the kind of
kids who went in in the first place
so when you try to get through that we
did I would say fine basically one the
knowledge is power program that we would
we don't have that as strong evidence as
we would like it's up on our website but
we would back that they're making a
pretty big difference in kids academic
achievement and it's worth noting how
they do it which is that they really
take the attitude okay these kids are
behind they need remedial help we're not
going to give them a normal education
like the scholarships or any of them as
special you know education special
attention and you know like I said I
mean we we are pretty impressed by this
organization we think the data looks
good it's not the same rigor as what I
described before but it is written up on
our site however the organization that
impressed me even more and if I had
known about these guys when I was when I
was giving earlier I would have given to
them is the nurse Family Partnership
they are not an education program
they're an early child care program
recall that that gap is there by age
five and what they do is they send
trained nurses to visit pregnant mothers
during pregnancy and then up through the
child's birth day with the goal of
promoting nutrition not smoking during
pregnancy birth spacing are you waiting
between births for you know a long
period of time
safe supportive environment for the
child and this did not start as a
charity the first thing they did was not
really you know was not was not raise a
whole bunch of money although they had
to raise some it started as a study it
started as three studies performed over
many years in different regions with
different groups of people and using
that randomized methodology that I
described before where they selected
which mothers receive the visits at
random and they found you know I
wouldn't call overwhelming effects but
but effects that definitely appear
significant in terms of children's
cognitive development and in terms of
their disciplinary records even ten and
fifteen years after this program had
ended which to me is pretty amazing and
even more amazing is just the rigor and
the
instance II of this organization in
replicating that program making sure
they're carrying out the same program
that they found was working and tracking
the heck out of it so they can make sure
it's continuing to work as planned so I
gotta say these guys completely stand
out to us in the u.s. and you know was a
big thing to learn about them and to
learn about the whole sphere of what
those are so the even bigger thing that
I learned though is a donor comes to the
developing world aid which is the other
thing we looked into now Ellie and I
used to disagree on this when we started
give well as a part-time project just
for our own money Ellie wanted to do
clean water in Africa I wanted to do the
achievement gap and I have to say that
over time I've I've come around more to
Ellie's point of view and the reason is
that the opportunities to help people in
the developing world are amazing for
really tragic reasons I have to say
which is that the problems people are
suffering from you know in the u.s.
we've got a complicated web of issues
that no one really knows how to resolve
and a lot of expensive programs and I
would love to resolve them but men in
the developing world you've got children
who die of diarrhea because they didn't
have like a five cent packet of
nutrients that would have prevented the
dehydration or because they're not in
the practice of washing their hands to
prevent contamination
you've got people going blind or
suffering from infant mortality because
they don't have a vitamin A supplement I
mean vitamin A supplements you take them
once a year they're very cheap and so
just the difference in cost and
straightforwardness was unbelievable to
me and just you know not to say that
developing world aid is easy it's not
and I will get to that but certainly the
basic opportunities there's people who
are missing cheap simple things and
there's opportunities to really make you
know long lasting differences in their
lives we're talking literally preventing
death preventing lifelong debilitation
so you know that said I think it is it
would be a big mistake to just throw
your money after a big-name developing
world charity and one of the reasons is
that the activities people are carrying
out in those countries are all over the
map in terms of cost effectiveness and
in terms of just how reliable anyway I
would call them
so this is just one example Ellie
originally recall was looking into clean
water in Africa it's a very marketable
cause it's very appealing when you hear
about it as he looked into it more he
was asking more questions like alright
what exactly is the problem is that they
don't have water or they don't have
clean water they don't have clean water
what is that
you know what problems does that bring
about and a lot of the time the answer
turns out to be diarrhea is the main
concern Diary is a class of diseases
it's fatal you know for for young
children generally and I mean not it's
it's often fatal for young children and
the issue is that you can you can
improve someone's water supply but
that's not cutting off the only vector
for diarrhea usually when there's dirty
water you've also got problems with open
defecation with people not washing their
hands with flies carrying disease to the
food and so really when you really look
at the different options in our opinion
and in the opinion of most experts of
written academically on this the clean
water stuff is a very expensive and not
very reliable way to save people from
diarrhea and there are much better
options and so you know up here we've
got the clean water infrastructure and
an other infrastructure such as latrines
being 15 to 40 thousand dollars per life
saved and this is from an academic
report that we checked out and then
we've also got the way at the lower end
we've got hygiene promotion teaching
people to wash their hands which often
is effective even if the water is not
you know not very clean which is
surprising but true and then you've got
ARS which is this packet of nutrients
that prevents dehydration costs five
cents incredibly cheap way and reliable
and historically successful way to save
lives now all the way off on the other
end of the spectrum I would put programs
like behavior change programs a lot of
people are trying to fight AIDS through
sex education now that might be a good
idea but you're dealing with another
culture and you're trying to change
their sexual behavior and so what we
came out of the more we looked into is
that if you're doing one of these more
complex programs you had better be
monitoring the heck out of it and
getting a lot of facts about what's
actually going on on the ground and that
turned out to be a big challenge so I
got to say an international aid you go
to a lot of the big names
and we did we had care reply we had
UNICEF apply we had World Vision apply
Save the Children a lot of these guys
that you've heard of and we would ask
all right what do you do and what's the
evidence that it works and they would
say which program would you like to
discuss and we would say well all of
them you know we want to give an
unrestricted donation we would rather
you choose how to find it we want some
sense of your strategy and just a very
common thing we saw is that a lot of
these organizations are more like
coalitions of programs all over the
place and can't give you or won't give
you a bird's eye view of what's going on
what they do what they track and what
they know furthermore at the individual
program level the kind of tracking I'm
discussing is very rare so that said we
did find two organizations that I would
gladly gladly stand behind that I would
recommend donating to population
Services International is a social
marketing charity they sell things like
bed nets and condoms that can be
life-saving and they sell them not to
make money they sell them for you know
extremely extremely low subsidized
prices they sell them in order to better
get them into the hands of the people
who are actually going to use them and
when we looked at them we've got the
analysis on our website and there's a
lot of uncertainty in it but we've got
them in the ballpark of around a human
life saved for every thousand dollars
which just when you compare it to the
u.s. charities even the best one nurse
Family Partnership is ten thousand
dollars per child served with the
effects from there being a little bit
difficult to discern although we think
they're real so population Services
International very impressive charity
very well monitored and well documented
very clear and then the other one that
we grant is actually very different
partners in health not we didn't grant
them so much on cost-effectiveness or
anything like that but because they have
a very consistent strategy of building
community health programs that are
addressing all of people's needs and
that might sound pretty basic and simple
but it's not common there's a lot of
cases where organizations have AIDS
money they've got to use it for AIDS and
they're ignoring it not because they
want to because it's how the money is
they're ignoring you know other issues
malaria tropical disease
vitamin A deficiency etc and Partners in
Health is very consistent about going
from place to place and doing
comprehensive health care so we
recommend those two in that area and I
would say we're pretty happy with that
we think they're good but the bottom
line is I think we just have a ton more
work to do in developing world aid after
our first year my main takeaway is this
is a big bang for your buck area it's
better than I thought it's probably what
I would bet on as the best bang for your
buck and also there is so much more to
learn about there are so many unanswered
questions we have about a lot of the
other interventions that we've heard of
but haven't been able to find someone
implementing in sort of a proven way so
I mean I can go into that a bit more
it's also you know described on our
website but basically what we're doing
right now the research right now is sort
of focused on developing world aid
taking a different research approach
than we had before relying less on
charities to get us information and more
on them as the last step of the process
and doing more of a top-down approach to
identifying great interventions and
priority areas first and then finding
the organizations that carry them out so
that's what we're working on now and
then as far as the future goes one of
the big questions for us is donor demand
which is something we're going to get to
in one second and it's you know our
target market remember we're a startup
we started this with seed capital a year
ago we're just trying to get to know
right now our target market and I think
in a lot of cases the people in this
audience may fit into it and and that's
part of the reason that we'd really like
to hear from you and get your thoughts
you know we want to do things that work
for our donors and the target markets
based on us so we listen to what we care
about we listen to the survey data
submitted on our website we listen to
what our donors tell us and from that we
think that what we're working on now is
good and what's likely to come up in the
future would be global warming issues
and disease research things that a lot
of people care about and would like
better information on better public
information if there's other causes you
guys care about we would love to hear
about them so that's pretty much where
we are I mean do you want to Ellie do
you want to kind of close or do you want
me to all right so let me just close
with where the project is as a whole
and then I'll take questions about the
research and about this as I said we're
a startup we've been around for one year
and the goal of that first year was to
raise seed capital from people who knew
us our former co-workers create a
resource that doesn't exist anywhere
else
public info on this sort of thing on
where you should give and what we
haven't done yet and what we're working
on now is increasing the influence of
this research and specifically the
amount of money it moves and what we
mean by that is the amount of money that
people are giving to charities based on
our research if we can show that that's
a lot if it's a lot and we can prove it
then charities will be incented to open
up to share their info and to compete on
results not just traditional marketing
and if we can't it doesn't matter how
good our research is I mean people
aren't using it and so to do this we're
kind of aggressively pursuing what we
call a giveWell pledge and what the way
giveWell pledge works is let's say
you're a donor you would say I pledge X
dollars and then we come back in about
six months with our list of recommended
organizations which again right now is
developing world aid could be other
stuff later then you we would write up
the pros and cons of those organizations
as we did in our first year and you the
donor would pick one and write the check
they're not to us and so the idea is
that people who make you give a pledge
they're not supporting give well they're
not paying any of our operating or
anything like that they're also not
giving up the most difficult part of the
choice which is kind of these you know
these guys are curing blindness these
guys are improving incomes which way are
you going to go all they are doing is
they're saying in advance and formally I
will use your research I will let you
narrow the field for me and we are
pursuing that in order to have a number
we can point to that we can prove and we
can say this is the amount of money
riding on our recommendations so those
are the two things were working on now
is researching developing world aid and
trying to increase the amount of money
that's going by our research and just to
close I mean I would say this is key
because the biggest objection we've
gotten to our project from people in the
sector is not anything to do with our
research or the quality of our
evaluations you know generally get good
feedback on those although we'd like
yours we
the biggest objection we get is the idea
that donors don't want it donors don't
care and we've gotten like the sentence
donors don't care about effectiveness
our donors don't care if they actually
help people we've heard that too many
times to count that exact sentence I
didn't exaggerate and the issue is that
there's there may be some truth to it I
think a lot of the fundraisers we talked
to say donors give because of social
pressure because you know you induce
guilt with a with a picture of a child
and they want to relieve that guilt
they're not giving because they want to
actually help people they don't care
about the facts and this is what we get
and we don't identify with this we don't
agree because of where we were as donors
but to really to really find out that
we're right and that that's wrong we're
gonna have to find more donors who feel
the way we do and so that's the real key
to making this go and again to a world
where charities are not just competing
with the picture is about competing with
the facts so that's what we basically
are now and we've handed out folders
with our contact info and anyone here
who either wants to use our research or
know someone who might we hope that
you'll get in touch with us and you know
there's also a supporter forum on our
website so that's basically where we are
we also welcome just general questions
and general information about the causes
you're interested in what you want to
see us do so that's it we're gonna take
questions down I'd be interested in you
know giving a give well pledge or
whatever but there's probably a few
charities that I already give to that I
care about do you intend publishing all
the charities that you've rated and what
you think about them or just the ones
that you recommend yeah well as a
general rule we do publish we publish
everything so we put all the materials
on there and we say how we chose
charities and so we will you know you'll
get a sense of why the ones that didn't
make the cut didn't we're certainly not
hiding it on the other hand we tend to
focus on the best because it takes a lot
of work to understand a single charity
we want to save our time and we want to
recommend the best ones we can find and
so the short answer is you know there
will be information on everyone we've
looked at and there is but you know the
much longer reports and more infos on
the best ones if you go there now you
can see every
we've looked at thus far like so all
hundred-fifty organizations have their
materials we also say anyone we haven't
written up more fully we say why right I
mean generally what we found is that
you're much more likely to find have no
evidence of effectiveness in which case
you say we're sorry you know there's not
enough of a case to make to pursue this
organization further and for each area
we explain you know what that that bar
for evidence was who else is doing
anything like this are there any
opportunities for collaboration the
thought that crossed my mind was
Community Foundation's which exists to
give donors information is there any
opportunity to share the information
further than you already are yeah I
would say there's opportunities
basically where we stand the the there's
a lot of other people doing you know at
least conceptually the kind of research
we're doing in terms of I got a lot of
money where do I give it we don't know
specifically what they're doing because
of all the secrecy and that's what Ellie
mentioned this isn't this is a sector
that's got a lot of secrecy in it and so
we've talked to a lot of foundations
they're not comfortable being public
about whom they support and why but it's
something we work on and so we're trying
to create the pressure we're trying to
call them and you know we've even made
some preliminary headway with that I
should clarify who is doing similar work
who is willing to share the information
with you no one we know and that's why
we're here basically what I'd say
so just a comment and then a suggestion
even if a lot of your donors aren't
interested in the effectiveness of their
money it doesn't take a whole lot of
them to be interested because that's
still the you know three-quarters of the
whole pie right sorry all right you know
only a third of your donors rested I
mean if it were 1% it would be the size
that the Gates Foundation right so one
suggestion might be you know if I'm
thinking of donating I am gonna get a
company match it would be nice if the
company actually said hey there's an
organization that has no overhead that
you can use to figure out charities if
you want and if you can get what 20% of
the people from Google to use your
organization you know that's a pretty
big I mean that's a pretty big amount of
money or you're you know having
influence over it seems like just
talking to some big companies and saying
can we offer our service for free who do
we talk to at Google yeah this is
exactly what we've been you know I don't
know it's a good question I can try to
find out but yeah exactly what we want
to do is find you know we're offering
what you know right now essentially a
free service to donors we're just trying
to tell them we're doing this research
we'd appreciate if they would tell us in
advance that they'll use our research as
a way of proving the demand and we just
want it to let them know it's out there
so they can use it if it suits them
right I think saying you know you're
offering a free service and it really is
free then companies would yeah hopefully
have some traction well yeah we're I
mean we're working on it that's and and
yeah it's a great suggestion obviously I
don't think that I really explicitly
answered your question earlier about
long term versus short term results I
mean I sort of got at it but you know
what we've done is we focused right now
more on sort of proven scalable and cost
effective ways to help people directly
partly because we want to focus on
something that we have more confidence
we'll be able to study well partly
because we think that stuff from what
we've seen might be under invested in
for various reasons but you know it's a
matter of what our donors want and in
the future I think that we we've got our
eyes on some of the more long-term
global warming and just one one thing to
point out if you're interested is we we
audio record our our board meetings and
so you know well this one actually broke
right so we don't have the audio but I
don't sadly enough but at that but when
we decided between psi and PIH for our
grant in our global health category we
had this exact debate in our board
meeting where part of the board was very
interested in the direct short-term
effects let's say of population Services
International other said you know PIH
building the hospital have a longer-term
effect and so we had that debate and you
know we ended up voting in favor of of
psi 3 and 2 3 2 2 but that's the type of
questions that we're asking and the
exact types of debates that we don't we
see being had sort of in general but now
in in in the cantata civic organizations
and specific activities so one thing
that I find myself more interested in
charity wise is micro-financing oh yeah
organization so I'm wondering how you
guys if you guys have a plan to kind of
research that yeah yeah that's right on
the I mean that's that's right what
we're doing we actually we looked at
microfinance in year one and we have
written about it on our website it's
something that I didn't go into much
because the main thing we found is that
there's it's it's a lot of it doesn't
work the way that you often hear and
there's a lot of information that's very
important that's not so easy to find
it's on I mean what we're doing now is
developing world direct aid and we're
first doing health then doing economic
empowerment
the second category includes
microfinance and we're going to be I
mean we've learned a lot we think we're
gonna have a much better shot at
cracking at this time and finding
someone really good at this point we
don't recommend anyone in microfinance
we have a long report on our website
yeah explaining what we found in the I
we why we didn't find someone we're
confident in yeah another interesting
question which I don't think you or
anyone else can really answer our along
lines of theories of change is the world
going to be a better place in 50 years
if I give to public health versus if I
give to education I think a lot of
people have different opinions there's
not a lot of proof but it might be
interest
for some donors to make a decision after
reading discussions on this do you have
any thoughts on providing such
discussions do you know of any resources
that do that might give people a
perspective that might help them make up
their minds um it's a great question I
mean I think it's something that um it's
something that definitely it sounds
interesting we want to do it we've got
we've got a small focus on it in our
current project just in the context of
international aid in terms of the
debates over you know what's the way to
help a country escape poverty for the
long term it's not something we focused
on yet but we're we're planning to at
the very least read what's been written
about it right in academia summarize
what we've read in the context of
charity and I agree with you it's a
great question we can do more on it than
we are I have a question for you about
the governments that receive the aid
because I think this is probably one of
the most inefficient way of spending
money is to give a financial aid to
certain governments which just bill for
squandering have you tapped with your
research into that field and have you
been working with any foreign government
agencies about the way how they spend
their money or what they plan to do with
them I know how they structure the
International aid that's that's another
one of the debates we've been having a
lot lately actually you guys are right
on the conversations we've been having
you know basically what I can tell you
right now is that a lot of the research
we read recommends going through the
government's for sustainability reasons
and to be honest we don't find the
arguments that compelling and so one of
the things we've been doing is kind of
calling some of these authors and and
trying to get conversations with them
and say can you help us understand this
a little bit better I think a lot of the
trade-off is between kind of the idea of
long term sustainability is in these
people's minds more likely to come
through the government and yet at the
same time I think your point is right on
there's major concerns about corruption
and there's big questions so this is
something that we will be writing more
about in the future and I should mention
that for those who are who are
interested in questions like that and
the real details of what we're doing
we've got a blog it tends to be pretty
dry these days because it's just kind of
us saying what we're researching but if
you're really interested in these issues
it's good blog and we've even for those
that who want to be overloaded we have a
public email list or is a by invitation
email list but we're pretty open with it
and and hoping to make it public and
there we have like you know emails going
out all the time we've been having this
debate over it so so maybe you just
answer this question a little bit but
beyond like pledging money and telling
our friends are there other things we
can do to help with the research I don't
know if you're like backlogged on
charities to look at or yeah we have we
have a small I would say I mean the
primary way to help is is the pledging
and the friends but we have a small
group of volunteers that we have working
on research projects like the one that
Holden talked about before you know the
question of if you want to help a
country escape poverty does health drive
economic improvement or does economic
improvement Drive health and so if
that's something you're interested we
you know you can talk to us after or we
also have a form on our website where
you can check you know volunteering and
then we'll get in touch with you yeah
it's give up the net slash get involved
and it has it has all the ways that you
can help and you know yeah we do work
with volunteers especially I mean I
would say the the most one of the
easiest ways to get involved is to read
what we've written so far and tell you
tell us what you think about it it's
true
alright well if anyone else has
questions that they'd rather just ask us
from a closer distance please do come up
and we hope to hear from some of you
soon and thanks a lot for your time
really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
