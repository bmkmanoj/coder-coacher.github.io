our talk today i'm at dan a little while
ago and i was impressed with what he's
been up to dan runs Terranova a medical
incubation company in san francisco and
when they look at the medical space they
approach it the way or i think of it is
from a very much an engineering
perspective and i thought the
combination of engineering approach in
the healthcare and medical arena was
really nicely done nicely explained and
i think dan has some pretty innovative
thoughts to share with us thanks for
coming Dan great thanks Astra thanks for
having us thanks for having me here um
when astro first asked me to come he
said that he wanted me to talk about
something that i was interested in and a
space that i've been gaining increasing
interest in is actually the potential
spaces within the body my company fair
anova spins out company's subsidiaries
as it comes up with ideas and gets
backing for these subsidiaries so a
quick disclosure is that I have a
founding inventor and a financial
interest in three of the companies that
will be mentioning today on Nova
chandelle emetics and perry kinetics so
let's start off with what is a potential
space in anatomy a potential space is an
area typically that surrounds an organ
that is not visible typically has a
small amount of fluid in it but allows
that organ to slide around within that
space and it's not as you can see here
it does not appear during normal
functioning some examples of potential
spaces the subdural space around the
brain and spine this allows the brain
and spine to move within that area and
acts as a cushion against trauma joint
capsules here I'd show just the shoulder
joints but those are also potential
spaces allows the articular surfaces of
the joints to move around there is the
pericardial cavity the area around the
heart the heart moves within this sack
if it didn't if it wasn't able to move
freely within this sack
than the pericardial cavity then the
heart would actually have to move work
much harder in order to pull the
thoracic contents with it the pleural
cavity is similar its lungs move and
slide within this cavity if they can
expand and collapse within this cavity
the cavity that I'm most interested in
the one that I'll be talking about today
is the peritoneal cavity this is the
cavity surrounding all of the abdominal
organs the and some organs that are only
partially abdominal the intestines the
liver the spleen the stomach all those
are fully abdominal organs partially
abdominal organs include the bladder
kidneys and the major vessels that
course behind the peritoneal cavity the
uterus in women is also abdominal organ
a perineal cavity organ peritoneum
derives from the greek term parrot
denying meaning to stretch aligning
functions as a semipermeable membrane
with a very large surface area over 2
square meters and about half of all
blood blood flow courses through or
adjacent to the peritoneal cavity as you
can see from this picture the it easily
expands rapidly to accommodate over two
liters and chronically can expand to
accommodate much more than two liters
this is useful not only for hot dog
eating contest but also for pregnancy
larger devices are frequently first
implanted here because it can tolerate
such a large volume and then of examples
of this as a ventricular assist devices
the first pacemakers the first
implantable cardioverter defibrillators
were all placed in the peritoneal cavity
peritoneal dialysis is actually possible
due to this expand cell nature I'm going
to go into peritoneal dialysis a little
bit since this in my mind is the only
medically viable current use of the
peritoneal cavity the history of
peritoneal dialysis Steven Hale was
recorded medically recorded to have
removed peritoneal fluid excess
peritoneal fluid that accumulated in a
patient with liver disease
from their abdominal cavity and then
replaced it with red wine he did this
twice and the volume was such that the
patient became incapacitated presumably
because they were drunk from the red
wine that was placed into the peritoneal
cavity in 1827 Beethoven had multiple
episodes of draining of this excess
fluid which he also had from his liver
disease and this fluid is called ascites
again gee Wagner in 1877 discovered that
the perineum is actually a semipermeable
membrane and this was a big discovery he
pushed hypertonic solutions meaning
solutions with more solutes than the
body has into the peritoneal cavity and
saw that the overall volume in the
cavity actually increased as it pulled
fluid from the body he also infused
hypotonic solutions meaning solutions
with less solute content into the
peritoneal cavity and notice that they
actually decreased in size several other
scientists built on this discovery that
it's a semipermeable membrane and a
George Ganter became the first physician
recorded to treat kidney disease with
peritoneal dialysis by pushing this
fluid into the peritoneal cavity
allowing it to reside there and then
pulling it out with toxins intact
peritoneal dialysis today over forty
percent of all patients in Europe
actually utilized continuous ambulatory
peritoneal dialysis this is an infusion
of up to two liters two and a half in
some cases fluid into the peritoneal
cavity add well or it resides there for
about two hours or more in some cases
and then is drained with the toxins that
have moved into the peritoneal cavity
through osmosis peritoneal dialysis
catheters can maintain function and
patency for several years less than five
percent of these catheters fail if
they're placed in the true pelvis even
over a very long term and peritoneal
cavity provides resistance to
encapsulation that it occurs with other
implants if you place something in the
vascular system or in an organ or under
the skin
it very quickly forms a very robust
fibrotic capsule the peritoneal cavity
this process is much slower and begins
with a fibrin film coating and
preventing that fibrin film coating and
removing that fibrin film coating is can
be as simple as a very short burst of
fluid allows the implant to remain
patent for very long periods of time as
I mentioned peritoneal dialysis is
pretty much the only major use of the
peritoneal cavity in medicine today and
it's been alert I feel that this area
has been largely untapped technology is
currently under development that I'll be
talking about today involve the removal
of the society's or this excess fluid
one of the companies I'm involved with
Nova shunt performs this procedure
inducing therapeutic hypothermia vela
medics to large companies Medtronic and
daya port in Europe deliver insulin into
this cavity for more physiologic
absorption and then the last is patient
monitoring using this using this cavity
in for removing ascites or a company
called Nova shunt founded in 2006 and
it's based in Switzerland it utilizes an
implantable pump in catheters to shun
fluid excess fluid or ascites from the
peritoneal cavity into the bladder the
clinical data so far suggests that
there's been a reduction in overall
ascites formation and the bulk of the
patients in this clinical study have
been free of paracentesis or external
needle pokes to drain the fluid for the
duration of the study this is a
schematic of the implant you'll see the
two white cuffs on the catheters
actually are made out of a polyester
material at the body responds to it has
a fibrotic in growth into these cuffs so
that if there ever is an infection
associated with the pump it will not
move into the bladder or the peritoneal
cavity this pump is transcutaneous leary
charged and communicates externally and
it intermittently pumps
the blue catheter into the yellow
catheter and then the patient simply
urinates this excess fluid from their
body as opposed to coming to the clinic
and having the large cannula you saw in
one of the previous pictures stuck into
their belly another use of the
peritoneal cavity is induction of
therapeutic hypothermia this is thought
to be potentially protective in heart
attack stroke and brain injury and it's
been shown that it can be very
protective in cardiac arrest and spinal
cord injury one dramatic example of that
is the football player I forgot his name
now but the football player that walked
on Oprah six weeks after having a
debilitating c-spine fracture that
should have prevented him from walking
ever again he was very quickly placed on
therapeutic hypothermia his neck was
chilled and he was up his blood was
chilled as well and because they were
able to get to him so quickly they were
able to reduce the swelling and the
damage that occurs with typical c-spine
fracture this company utilizes a very
cold fluid less than four degrees
Celsius lavage of the peritoneal cavity
so this is a video of the access you can
see the access up top it's the long long
trocar there and the fluid here is
actually visible on x-ray we've added
something to the fluid to make it
visible on x-ray and what I mean one
that I click on the video here you'll
see that the fluid comes in through that
TroKar and courses down over the bowel
and it's you can just get a an
indication of the massive radiator that
the intestines and all of the peritoneal
cavity provide to the body not not only
for absorption and fluid exchange but
also in this case for thermal gradient
delivering insulin is another use of the
peritoneal cavity Medtronic as I
mentioned and I aportar two companies
that use the peritoneal cavity to
deliver insulin Medtronic uses an
implantable device this I am plan
pump shown here and this implantable
device has been founded have a much more
physiologic response with respect to
insulin delivery it's absorbed directly
into the portal circulation so it's a
more physiologic delivery manner than
subcutaneous insulin patients in this in
uh were asked to refill their insulin
every three months clinical study
patients reported exquisite blood
glucose control and on the the feeling
was that if this could be coupled with
an accurate precise blood glucose
sensing a good function as an artificial
pancreas the there was a study that
recently came out was published earlier
this year on sixty patients with over
360 patient years of having this this
pump and planted and it was a they did
not report any Indian epic shin of the
peritoneal cavity which is one of the
concerns you have with any peritoneal
device you'd be concerned about
peritonitis occurring in this case they
did have some infections related related
to refilling of the pump but they were
few and far between i think it was two
per 100 patient ears and the infections
were limited only to the pump site
because of the use of a cuff so the last
area that i think has a lot of promise
for the peritoneal cavity is in patient
monitoring the large surface area the
semipermeable semipermeable membrane
results in a very rapid fluid turnover
some of the early work my first exposure
to the peritoneal cavity was actually at
duke university where i harvested islets
from rats and then placed islets back
into the peritoneal cavity and islets
are the insulin-producing cells in the
pancreas the i worked in the chemistry
department and we actually coated these
islets with a an alginate calcium
alginate shell and then placed them back
in the peritoneal cavity and i was
stunned to find that these cells not
only survived they were able to have
robust exchange of insulin and glucose
in the peritoneal cab
without any direct blood flow and that
was my first exposure back in late 90s
to the nutritive properties in their
very rapid exchange of nutrients and
oxygen across the perineum membrane so
the we recently conducted a study in an
animal where we measured the we did
what's called a glucose challenge we
took a pig that was at baseline with a
blood glucose around 50 to 70 challenged
it by giving it a blood glucose of 300
and then dropping it back down to a
glucose of 70 or so and then monitored
the response rates of the various sites
where you're measuring glucose the first
site that we measured was the plasma
that's these green dots here and this is
the actual blood glucose you would
expect it to surge very rapidly because
we were actually administering the
glucose intravenously when we measured
in the peritoneal cavity you'll see it
that it tracked the plasma very nicely
there was a five minute delay between
the first exposure of the of the inn of
the glucose to the intravascular space
between what when the plasma and the
peritoneal cavity both showed their
first uptick in glucose on the in
contrast interstitial space measurements
underneath the skin is this blue line
here and you'll see it takes
approximately 20 minutes before there's
even a reasonable uptick that first
small uptick that would indicate that
there's been exposure to glucose so what
this this indicated to us is that the
peritoneal cavity appears to have a much
more rapid equilibration with plasma at
least for glucose which is what I had
suspected based on my early research
with eyelets and their ability to
survive in trends and based on only the
oxygen and the glucose within the
peritoneal cavity
this is a preliminary study what we've
only performed this experiment twice now
but the data was similar both times and
we're looking to expand this some more
so the the question then is what is
accessible from the peritoneal cavity
and if you go into exhaustive detail
there is quite a bit of information that
you can access from the peritoneal
cavity there the vital signs heart rate
respiratory rate temperature blood
oxygen saturation perfusion pressure of
the organs you can get a patient's
activity level in their position you can
get peritoneal pressure which is useful
in surgical follow-up you can get
electrolyte levels to track patients
dialysis patient for example could be
sent home with a peritoneal monitor and
once their urea and their creatinine
reached a certain level they could come
back in for their own personalized
tailored dialysis regimen as opposed to
the three times a week right now and any
miniaturize abode chip based assay that
can be placed in an implant could be
included in this peritoneal site with
the durability of with a durable implant
that's not going to be in capsules and
encapsulated and will have great access
to a fluid that's in very rapid
equilibrium with plasma so if this
sounds a little bit far-fetched I have a
little demo here that we created to show
you exactly what we expect or close to
what we expect our commercial design to
look like you can simply hold the
medical tricorder over the abdominal
cavity and from there you can gain all
the patients information so future
applications peritoneal oxygenation you
could simply lavage the peritoneal
cavity with oxygenated saline and that
will provide twenty to thirty percent of
the oxygen requirements for the body if
you use a perfluorocarbon or something
that has a higher oxygen content you
could get up to 80 and even higher
percent of the body's requirements the
they don't do this now is the peripheral
or urban could be seen as being
irritating to the peritoneal lining
artificial organs as well there's an
implantable kidney and plantable
pancreas that I discussed islet
transplantation and there's a lot of
other potential applications for the
peritoneal cavity that I think we have
been left and largely overlooked so
medical device development has
historically been based on organ systems
my my take on it is that I think we
should be looking to the spaces around
the organs to improve function and
reduce overall foreign body responds so
that's it any questions yeah
yeah if there was an essay for the tumor
say for example prostate PSA
prostate-specific antigen you could
track that over time if there was a
assay that was small enough to be placed
on an implant and intermittently exposed
the peritoneal fluid I in terms of
imaging the tumors and tracking their
size I think that this that would be a
little bit too broad of a scope for a
single peritoneal implant peritoneal
pressure can you can track very easily
but since the cavity expands so rapidly
and so easily the tumor would have to be
such dramatic so dramatic and size
before you saw a peak and peritoneal
pressure you talk a little bit about
yeah this is sort of a specific part of
the body but all over the place where
you can use it for but I'm curious about
your process for exploring a little bit
about tools that you can use sort of a
multi-purpose way to try different
things maybe a little bit how you learn
on animals how you transition to people
when you have to go to Europe first when
you complete phase ones here when you
get device exemptions just a little bit
about the process great thanks yep so
the question was how I go about the
process of exploring potential
applications of these implants and
devices within the body and the typical
process involves identifying a clinical
need so that's always the beginning is
the identification of a clinical need so
the best example I can use is for this
Nova shunt the company that pumps the
fluid into the bladder so it can be
urinated out I always doing my residency
at the Mayo Clinic my transition alere
and while I was at Duke as well getting
my MD I had treated many patients with
liver failure who had a large
accumulation of fluid in their
peritoneal cavity that needed to be
drained every two weeks or so and if
they're not compliant with their diet
they need to be drained every three or
four days
so I saw the clinical need there and
once I saw the need then I entered into
problem-solving mode and said why can't
we do this better I thought of all the
different places you could put this
fluid and I thought of all the different
cavities and potentially even shunting
it from one potential space to another
there's a device that does that it's
called a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for
hydrocephalus it actually takes fluid
from around the brain and spine and puts
it into the peritoneal cavity
surrounding the organs the abdominal
organs so I what we ended up coming up
with was putting the fluid into the
bladder the next step for us was to look
into the literature and past experience
to see if there's any reason why we
could not do that so we look to the
published sources of literature in the
previous experience to figure out
whether or not this could be done we
very quickly found that there were some
experiments done with a one-way valve on
the bladder wall into the peritoneal
cavity that were not successful because
the bladder is typically higher in
pressure and the peritoneal cavity it
shares a wall with a peritoneal cavity
so you add the two Nyssa T of the
bladder wall and it's usually higher in
pressure so we just we realized we
needed to use a pump so we looked to the
literature to see if there was a pump
that had ever been used and we actually
found a paper by Gregory Rosen blit
where they had used this clumsy awkward
pump that was just a drain that's
usually external that was anchored to
the iliac crest and they pumped it
externally and they had erosions was the
pumping and pushing on it with their
hand but that to us validated the
concept because he had a couple good
patients but actually were able to get
some relief with that so from there we
decided we wanted to improve on that
design and do something that would allow
this to be a much more broadly
applicable technology we started with
benchtop tests will almost always start
with benchtop tests developed a pumpkin
catheters challenge the bench top test
by putting egg whites and hard tofu
through the catheters in the
palms to make sure they can handle it
because there are particular in this
site ease fluid and then from there we
performed animal studies and there was
we performed animal studies based on
what our advisors told us they'd want to
see prior to a first in human experience
and first in human at least for the
foreseeable future is not going to be in
the US for any significant risk device
the FDA I worked at the FDA for a year
in the mid-90s and the sentiment there
now is very similar to when I was there
and it was one of extreme caution with
respect to industry it's a pendulum it's
swung pretty far the other direction in
the last ten years and now it's swinging
back so so we ended up going to Europe
for our first and man and now we've
we've done 20 patients now and we're
applying for a siiii mark in Europe
which we expect to get early next year
but we still are in the process of
negotiating an investigational device
exemption with the FDA and filing an
application to even start studies here
so for for all the studies that I've
done I have four technologies that have
come up with and spun out that are in
clinical studies now one of them is here
the other three are all outside of the
country and and they're going to
probably stay there for the foreseeable
future for the next couple years at
least so that but that's the typical
process is identifying the need vetting
it on the bench top doing what you can
to vet it in a preclinical stage
preclinical model determining what you
need to get to the clinical model and
then taking it from there and what would
skeptics say made an argument for body a
number of things
it seemed very clear and straightforward
howling yep truly there are skeptics
what did they say yeah so that the
peritoneal cavity traditionally has been
a problem for physicians it's been a
place where fluid accumulates where
organs stick to each other call
adhesions and causes problems or in some
bad cases ends up with an infection
called peritonitis so all of these risks
are actually significant if not if the
implant is not appropriately designed so
I think the main skeptics typically the
first thing another fellow physician
will ask me is what about infection but
that that for me the the data that the
Medtronic has with their implantable
insulin pump of over 300 patient ears
with not no episodes of peritonitis they
did have pump pocket infections but
those cuffs kept them from progressing
into peritonitis so I think that that
the concern is real the concern is out
there the perception is out there but i
think the data the root most recent data
is showing that that's a potential
complication that's been pretty well
managed with current technology yeah
yeah very good question that that's the
other issue is the peritoneal cavity if
you just put something in there and let
it sit there and you put it particularly
if you put it in the wrong spot it will
get encapsulated by omentum which is a
sheet in the peritoneal cavity that is
searching for perforations in your bowel
so it can surround them and turn it into
an abscess instead of a parent itÃ­s so
if you place the catheter in the
peritoneal cavity in the in the true
pelvis away from the omentum then one
doctor dr. Crabtree who is one of my
advisors and is a places peritoneal
dialysis catheters as a laparoscopic
surgeon he's found a 25 percent failure
rate over a very long period of time and
that's with inflow and outflow to the
catheter so if if you simply have
something that is sensing and ideally
sensing and delivering something to the
peritoneal cavity that sweeps over those
holes and pushes over those holes then
you can dramatically extend that by
ensuring that you're in the true pelvis
away from the omentum the implantable
insulin pumps have had some great
success with respect to remaining patent
they did have some occlusions but they
also placed it up near the liver which
is another area that is a preferred
placement area but if it gets exposed to
a momentum up there it gets clogged so
but they had some great patency rates
because they're just pushing fluid out
so one of the keys to it that I've found
over the years is if you're going to
design something for the peritoneal
cavity ideally it will have some sort of
an anti clogging feature I'm as with the
patient monitoring system where we push
a very small bowls fluid through that
catheter and over the sensors on the
intermittent basis it takes about a week
even for a flimsy fibrin filmed
so if you would do that on a daily basis
you can make sure that the fibrin is
expelled from the catheter and then
absorbed into the body but that's
another great question now that's
another thing the skeptics would ask is
and it is more resistant to
encapsulation but how do you keep it
from those cases where it does get
encapsulated by contrast if you put
something in the subcutaneous space
there's there's no way you're going to
prevent encapsulation people have been
working on that for years and years and
years so I mean other questions very
much great thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
