Burke in here today Scott was a long
time Microsoft guy he was part of the
original Internet Explorer team actually
several versions of the internet
explorer from the early days and he sat
on his own about three or four years ago
to start his own consulting business and
actually write books and he wrote a
great book called the art of project
management which is where he first came
up on my radar which is I think the
first project management book I've ever
read that actually talked about what
life was really like versus the kind of
pipe dreams of fictional Gantt chart
pert chart land and so I enjoyed that
book immensely and I was very excited to
hear that he was writing a new book on
innovation so he's here today to talk
about that book called the midst of
innovation so please welcome Scott thank
you so we good on volume people in the
back you guys look so comfortable and
the couches back there you guys can hear
me good you guys need to be smoking or
something to be perfect i think oh so
first thing i have to do is reward the
people in the front row giving you books
as no one ever sits in the front row and
yeah you get what you get one you get
one in fact I have plenty of books just
a hint now because they're empty seats
in the front two rows so if you move
forward this is dynamic book delivery if
you move forward you get books see
hahahaha check it out this is so much
fun
room yeah I feel like I feel like I'm at
the zoo at the feeding time you know now
you guys get paid a lot of money right
so like free books shouldn't be worth
that much all right okay hey you're in
the front row to you get a book if you
pass them into a good timing okay
actually I was going to get rid of this
whole stack so who well you guys heard
you guys are all the way in the front
right there you go again well done you
already have one I only need okay okay
here we go here we go all right the rest
will save for later okay so I have
successfully dynamically Rio allocated
space in the room i'm very proud that
was a little social experiment because
you guys haven't even looked at the book
yet you don't even know if you want one
but all right so thank you Ken for the
introduction thanks Ken and also chad
thornton tenue isn't here it was one of
the people who helped get me here so on
to thank him for arrange for me to talk
to you today so just so you know where
I'm coming from I'm going to talk about
some of the topics from the book and
some of the themes of the book that
actually aren't even in the book i'm
going to go beyond the book but i was at
Microsoft for about 10 years I was a
manager guy there worked on IE 1 through
5 working a lot of user interface
features stuff there then I worked in
the windows group for a couple years
working msn for a while before i left in
2003 it was four years ago since they
have been on my own as an author and a
consultant public speaker i wrote a book
in 2005 which was a best-seller for
o'reilly called the art project
management and it's my second book it
just came out it's for sale on amazon
right now but you guys are one of the
first people to actually hold copies of
it in your hand at least those of you in
the front row the rest I'll give out so
I have about an hour i'll try to end our
list maybe you can make it to your next
meeting on time and i'll say the last
two minutes for Q&amp;amp;A you ask a question
i'll give you a look pretty fair deal
yeah that means you got to stick around
for the Q&amp;amp;A it's all about incentive and
reward so the the book is about the
books called the midst of innovation
which is kind of a curious title the
idea was take two things like chocolate
and peanut butter that are good and if
you throw them together no matter what
happens a result will be good so the
idea was innovations interesting topic
mythology is interesting topic what
happens
if you bring these things together so
the book there's ten chapters to the
book each chapter in the book takes a
myth that I believe is popular even in
the tech sector even in companies that
are higher really smart people like
Google myths about how creative work is
done how new ideas become things and how
things move on to change the world so
each chapter talks about a myth explains
what the myth is why it's so popular
what the canonical stories are that
aren't true but that we believe how they
became popular and then the focus of the
book is how you convert that looking at
what the truth is how you apply the
truth to situations today that you're
dealing with that involve innovation so
that those are the three goals of the
book and I'm actually going to start by
talking about the word innovation
because i'm actually not a fan of this
word the word is used all the time and
it's usually a placeholder for actually
doing for actually thinking for actually
doing something significant if you look
at the word the many definitions of the
word the best the definition holds it
the best is this one that to innovate is
to begin or introduce something for the
first time it's a very simple definition
that criteria is pretty obvious but most
usages of the word go well beyond this
definition the most interesting thing to
take away about this definition is the
last comment am i doing that is my
movement causing that than me okay just
make it short so I earthquake warning is
that nothing like that I could all right
the most important thing to take away
from this definition of the word is that
innovation is relative and by that I
mean this if I were to tell you
something right now give you a new
algorithm for how to do something give
you a new idea that to you was new and
interesting and useful then you would
see me as an innovator but then when you
went to some other meeting or some other
company or went out with your friends
and you told them that same algorithm
for that idea they would see you as the
innovator and on it would go it's a
relative process so anytime you're doing
something you think is innovative it's
only because of the context in which you
are doing it at any given time there are
things that you take for granted is
obvious things that you think are very
simple very easy to do that someone else
will think of as innovative imagine what
goes on right now in the Western world
least one third of the world the whole
planet doesn't have regular electricity
24 hours a day so the idea that you can
do
24 hours a day would be an innovation in
many parts of the world so innovation is
always relative and we're trained as
engineers and managers and technologists
and designers that's we like to believe
there's a universal scale of innovation
that one innovation is going to be
better the next one and it's this
incremental thing you can judge that's
purely about this abstract measurement
and that's really not true the best
lesson from all the history of animation
that I've read animation is always a
social function it's always relative to
the context of the people who you are
trying to apply an innovation to other
common uses of the war that you're here
all the time sometimes the word
innovation is used to describe whoever
is first doing something not they've
necessarily done something well not that
even succeeded but they've done it first
so the first person to do it other uses
will were involved better that it's not
about who is first about who won who
created a better offering who got better
reviews who got more market share
they're often seen as innovators after
the fact simply because they had
something that turned out to be better
this is a lot of misuse of the word and
I offered you any time you hear the word
innovation should become sensitive to it
and ask people what they really mean
when they say that word because most of
the time they're being sloppy and
they're trying to apply all these words
and glom in them together and there or
they're trying to they're trying to
assume that the definition was something
that's concrete as this one when really
they mean something much fuzzier much
more ambiguous the last thing I'll say
about the word this is the last
etymology part of the talk is about the
difference between being successful and
being innovative that innovation is such
a buzzword now do you hear meetings and
conversations and business plans and
startups that spend so much time
focusing on trying to innovate as
opposed to trying to be successful as it
shows to trying to be good try to make
something that matters that will solve a
problem for people who are willing to
pay for it so in many cases much better
use the word is this progressive is this
successful is this an improvement will
this make things better for a particular
person in particular way as a much
better way to think about managing than
using the word animation okay let's
switch gears a little bit are there any
architecture majors or students here any
architecture no I can pretend to be the
expert all right good I don't want to
guess what century this church is from
raise your hand guess 13th any one other
guesses 1216 okay i'm actually not one
hundred percent sure but the answer I
believe is 11th century this is about
800 900 years old this church now when
this church was made this I know this
church is in Ireland into Northern
Ireland it's one of many churches you
can find if you spent an afternoon
driving around Ireland looking at old
churches and it's not particularly
significant in any architectural or
historic way it's one of many churches
you could find there like this the
reason why I call us out as an example
is that at the time this church was
built and the day it was made there are
many things about the church that were
innovative in that time everything about
this church that we take is obvious or
pedestrian or utilitarian because it's
like all these other churches we have
seen everything in there was one day
proposed and probably rejected by
someone the fact there's a stained-glass
window the fact that there's a steeple
those were all things that were added
and invented and created we discount all
that because today those innovations
have become successful and adopted we no
longer see them anymore as innovations
we assume that they have always been and
there's a word for this it's a word for
this kind of thinking just counting
innovations of the past its Chronos
centrism it's not my word it's a word
that Tom Standage coin in a book called
the Victorian Internet anyone here read
that book a couple people okay so he
talks about how the Victorian age the
Telegraph actually paved the way for
many of the things that we credit the
internet for that's a little caption of
that book but anyway chrono centers is
about this idea that the belief that
what is going on right now that the
things you are making right now are the
most important things ever in history
and the funny thing is it were not the
only people ever to have felt that way
that in fact in every age there was a
group of people that felt that way the
Incas the Mayans the Egyptians the
Romans the Greeks they all felt that
were they were doing was the most
important thing forever at all time so
this is history of believing that
technological progress and innovation is
isolated to the present to the moment to
the present moment now I call this out
for two reasons one because there's a
pattern here there's a pattern of
thinking about innovation and if you can
buy the pattern the people the
guy who proposed the first steeple we
could you imagine what that conversation
must have been like I mean the church is
generally not the most progressive group
to work with and if you have a new
technological advancement could you
imagine what those discussions must have
been like to have that first idea
accepted was probably very difficult so
there's a pattern around thinking about
how innovations get adopted and that
pattern applies very well throughout
time throughout technology throughout
time and Chronos centrism is the denial
that fact anyone know what this is a
picture of this is the second detour on
our history lesson section of the talk
yeah yeah I remember rightly solar
system model
you keep thinking we got someone else
yet it's in what Astra Astra label from
where from Greece okay dude Allah yes
very good antikythera so Antikythera is
a island off of off of Greece the Greek
island and this was discovered several
decades ago what it's believed to be
we're not quite sure if its function
what's believed to be is effectively a
very early version of like the Babbage
engine it's a mechanical computational
device and this is at least 2,000 years
old somewhere in the ballpark of 2,000
years old now there's a couple of
reasons why this is not a popularly
known example of technology the first is
that it's not entirely well understood
what its purpose was but the second more
important is Chronos centrism the fact
that a technology existed this long ago
that did some of the things that we're
so proud of today flies in the face of
our chrono centric beliefs about our
technological prowess there are many
examples of this as an entire book
called lost discoveries that catalogs
entire entire realms of technology that
falls the same trap where things that
were developed and invented and
understood and even used in some cases
were eventually lost and then
rediscovered and we're claimed have dumb
in dumb for the first time by a
different civilization this is the
schematic that was believed to be what
the device would have looked like when
it was functioning and our assumption is
it was used for some kind of it's an
astrolabe but some kind of navigational
either astrological or used for
navigational purposes for sailing we're
not entirely sure the last point I'm
going to talk about in this this history
part of my talk is about the fact that
there are two pivotal innovations in
this picture k anyone tell me what they
are there's actually many but there's
two that I'm thinking about yeah the
arch is one stress concrete is good but
that's not the one I'm going for ya
sewage very good so those two things
those two things were at one time
innovations and in fact in the world
today there are places where sewage is
not effective and that's why people die
from I think it's one quarter of the
world still does not have healthy clean
regular drinking water right so again
innovation is not diffused evenly
show this year because those two
inventions were pivotal the development
of civilization and civilization was
pivotal development of electricity and
computing and the internet and all those
things but at some point because of
their success those innovations were
taken for granted they are assumed to be
self-evident as if they had always
existed just like the steeple in the
church the stained glass and the church
once an innovation become successful and
becomes adopted which is the dream of
every innovator eventually become
something there's no longer seen as an
innovation so that concludes the history
portion of the talk so now I'm going to
go into mythology this is a liberal arts
tour through innovation so this is a
painting of a famous mythological event
does anyone know what's going on here
want to tell me this raise your hand
Prometheus and what is he doing well
it's close he's not giving fire here
stealing fire yeah so the Promethean
myth is one of the most popular myths in
the Western canon we like technology and
Prometheus was the guy least in the
Greek mythology which we as Europeans
have inherited in the Greek mythology
who liked people he liked mankind and he
liked technology fire is a metaphor in
many ways the metaphor for creative
energy it's a metaphor for power it's a
metaphor for the ability to create it's
all those things wrapped up in one and
of course is also something that allows
you to make tasty food which is
important this is a painting of a scene
that is very rarely shown in mythology
you won't find many examples of this
scene that much more common Promethean
example is this one the one at
Rockefeller Center so that's actually
supposed to be Prometheus holding fire
bra hi I'm prometheus I have the power
that's nuts what usually the image of
Prometheus that's shown they don't talk
about the fact there was theft involved
or that there's intellectual property
rights to be violated let's get past
that go right to the conclusion which is
I have this thing that I am in control
of now it's telling that this is the
center fixture if you how many people
have been a Rockefeller Center so maybe
maybe half of you it's actually a pretty
crappy ice skating rink so don't
recommend that you go there to ice skate
you should go there just because it's in
the middle of Midtown and it's kind of
to walk past it go out this Rockefeller
Center so the the sculpture Prometheus
it's there it's a center point for
Rockefeller Center and Rockefeller was a
huge robber baron billionaire a
millionaire guy very important guy for
late 19th century America did some
innovations some that were legal and
some not so legal but anyway that's the
symbol that they put at the center of
Rockefeller Center Prometheus holding
fire and this represents many things I
think two people who want to create two
people want to innovate that when you're
sitting at your computer when you're
programming when you're on your own what
you're trying to do you're trying to
create something for the world through
you and you feel like you are reeling
some kind of force and an image like
this a Prometheus gives that a very
externalized visible symbol you're
holding the force when when you're about
to release your software it kind of
feels like you have this thing in your
you're releasing it to the world you are
in control you are like a god there's a
mythology around creation that is
manifested by this image and you'll
notice that in this image as you guys
said prometheus is supposed to be giving
fire to people but it's not quite what
he's doing here he's wielding fire he's
like he's like it's like a weapon this
is like something he's in control so one
of the mists in the book the first
chapter is but the myth of Epiphany
which is the the myth that ideas and
creative force comes from somewhere
outside of us the to have an epiphany
means something happened in the universe
and by magic something an idea enters
your mind and that's where ideas come
from so there's a famous epiphany myth
that involves apples anyone know the
apple new can someone tell me the Newton
story briefly city under a tree hit on
the head and that's how this gravity was
discovered okay so how many both heard
that story okay does anyone know where
they heard it what book they read it in
what teacher told it to them okay a
little scary right that's I got the
warning sign of propaganda you know you
don't know where it came from but you
know it right so the story actually
comes from a couple of places a couple
of things we give you the short version
of the history of this myth Newton had a
Newton's biographer this is
late in his life his 60 or 70 years olds
biographer writing his life story and
nobody auger is trying to figure out how
do you get your ideas where do they come
from and Newton tells a story I'm
paraphrasing here but he tells a story
of how he likes to observe things in the
natural world he looks at the universe
and the things and he says well how does
that work why is it that way and he
mentions an anecdote about looking at
his window at a grove of trees and that
he might see a treat an Apple fall and
wonder why that happened so Newton late
in his life is telling a biographer
about observing an apple 30 years
earlier that's the story that is in the
biographers book so from there we go to
Voltaire Voltaire who was an innovator
who's a passionate guy wrote all kinds
of great stuff got in trouble for it was
exiled from his country for writing
great stuff Voltaire decide Newton's
ideas were really cool and he wanted to
promote them so he made the story one
step closer it's Newton is actually
sitting there watching the Apple fall
right in front of him and that's where
gravity comes from so Voltaire use the
story of Newton the Apple falling as a
way to promote Newton's ideas it's a
better story it's not outside of a
window far away he's now actually first
person he watches it fall and then
another 60 years go by and another
writer just really I believe this really
tells a story and it's like a joke it's
like an aside of what if Newton would be
hit by an apple it's a total side that
was told a hundred years later by
someone who had never met Newton and
never met Voltaire and that's the story
that we know which came from this iconic
this second a third it's like telephone
game second or third retelling of a
story that had nothing to do with the
original intention or meaning of the
story it's now been extracted out so the
Epiphany story as manifested here were
the Apple tale is that ideas come from
somewhere else that we are not in
control of who let's say for the moment
that Newton actually discovered gravity
which is a tall thing that say that
anyone discovered gravity given how many
buildings we had built before Newton's
birth but let's just assume for a second
we say that's true who is the
protagonist in this story the Apple the
apples do in the hard work the Apple is
motivating action Newton is a slacker
yeah he's lying it well that's it
he's lying there on the tree right what
is he doing nothing apple hits him on
the head and that's where the idea for
gravity comes from now the truth is
everyone knew about gravity they built
lots of buildings and the Romans have
built their irrigation stuff we could
build churches we knew about gravity we
could not define all the math and that's
really what Newton did he characterized
the mathematics of gravity and
documented it in a way that could be
reused for other purposes and it took
him about 15 years to do that 10 to 20
years before he that's how long it took
him to finish and publish his uh his
treatise the principal Mathematica i
think is what it's called so even if the
Apple it struck him on the head there
was still ten years of work required to
document do what he had achieved success
the myth of Epiphany so the first
chapter the book is all about the
different kinds of Epiphany myths that
exists why they're popular and what the
truth is given all the research that we
know about how creative activity
actually gets done what the truth is
about where creative ideas come from so
I'm going to switch gears for a second
and talk about them talk about
corporations I actually have three parts
just to have this middle parts about
corporations and the third parts about
giving you some advice pull from stuff
in the book and then we'll break with
ten minutes left for Q&amp;amp;A and I'll give
away the rest of the books so I want to
talk for a couple minutes about 3m
anyone here know what three M stands for
Minnesota mining and manufacturing can
someone here tell me a product that they
use made by 3m post-it notes so what
does Minnesota mining and manufacturing
have to do with office supplies nothing
they manufacture it okay but not in
Minnesota and not not with mining
supplies shoot 1m right so the story of
three I'm is fascinating for this reason
and all the research I've done in
corporations the history of innovation
3m comes up again again is a stellar
example if you think of innovation at
the grand scale you're thinking of
industry when innovate in industries
multiple industries 3m is a company that
has done this again and again where they
have started out with a base in one
industry found an opportunity in another
industry and develop into becoming a key
player in that other industry so I'm
going to tell you the shore
version of their story their their
incubation story they started out in the
late 1800s Early 1900s and there were
entrepreneurs and in that time this is
industrial age this is pre electric
electricity dominance in America
Industrial Age entrepreneurship meant
minerals it meant mining it meant you're
providing tools that were to accelerate
or contribute to the Industrial
Revolution the post the late part of the
Industrial Revolution so they discovered
there was a mine near them they could
buy that had this mineral that was used
for abrasive tools for like buffing and
scrubbing metal and invested all this
money in this mind they started mining
and they're like yeah we're going to
stock options is going to be great it
turned out that the stuff they had mind
was the wrong mineral it was the
equivalent of fool's gold it looked like
this abrasive mineral but it wasn't so
they're all their money was gone they
had decide what to do next and rather
than give up these guys were serial
entrepreneurs in the late you know ro
1900's they decided we're going to do
this again we're going to pick a
different mineral and they went after a
mineral that was used for sandpaper so
staying in abrasives are they going to a
different particular mineral and that
was where 3m started their successful
business and it took them about 10 years
not an overnight success took about 10
years that had a stable productive
growing healthy business making abrasion
materials to use sandpaper products
years go by its 1915 1918 don't remember
somewhere in there one of the engineers
who's making sandpaper that's his job
he's a sandpaper engineer right that's
his job title found his business card I
engineer sandpaper this is all new stuff
right at the time that was cool he could
go to a party and say that girls would
talk to him it was great so he uh he
shows up at one of his clients with some
new new offerings that have four
sandpaper and he notices that they're
working on a problem they can't solve
the problem is trying to solve it's an
automobile manufacturing company and
they want to make a surface and his two
tones of paint it's black and gray and
then what they don't have an easy way to
separate the two and reliably reproduce
this so he looks at this problem goes
well you know the sandpaper stuff I have
adhesive on the back of it it's got two
materials that are bonded together maybe
there's something I could do and he
starts playing so it's prototyping going
off on his own
he starts playing around he starts to
like some of his early ideas they're not
complete yet but he needs more time so
he goes to his boss and says hey I got
this idea for a thing for automobiles
can I get some time to do it and his
boss says 3m you know Minnesota mining
and manufacturing helping automobile
companies paint their cars is not our
business go away go back to work
engineer goes back to work he can't help
himself he likes his problem he keeps
working on the problem gets it further
goes back to his boss Paul says the same
thing goes back a third time boss says
the same thing eventually decides he
needs to go stealth he used to go into
skunk works mode and he knows he has
some budget control he can write
receipts for up to 90 dollars and
ninety-nine dollars or something so what
does he do he needs three thousand
dollars to finish his prototype he
writes as many $99 seats as he needs to
finish his prototype finally he has his
prototype and he shows it to this client
it shows it to his boss and it works and
it's masking tape this is the invention
of masking tape there was no masking
tape before that this is the invention
of masking tape there was no duct tape
yet masking tape now his boss eventually
conceded this was a good idea and they
made it into a line of business 3m now
has masking tape and that business grew
it grew faster than their sandpaper
business did the boss's name was William
McKnight and he looked at this and said
you know what I was so wrong about this
I was dead wrong you hadn't told me four
times to try this idea before I support
it I don't want to make that mistake
again and William McKnight became the
chairman of the company and embodied
this philosophy of trying never to make
that mistake again I'll talk more about
him in a second but that was that
mentality is what led 3m to go from
being a mining company making sandpaper
to be in company makes post-it notes the
in company makes highlighters being a
company that makes all this wide range
of products there are very few companies
that have succeeded on that scale
General Electric is another one but
their histories a little bit more
complicated so will you McKnight let me
talk about him for a second so William
McKnight wanted to say how do I make a
pattern out of innovation I screwed it
up the first time with masking tape I
don't want to screw it up again so we
spent a lot of energy as a manager
trying to correct the mistake that he
had that he had made he's actually the
guy I forget what you guys call it here
% time fifteen percent tempered twenty
percent twenty percent so that concept
the first the first use of that concept
that I found in corporate histories is
3m they call that ten percent time or
something five percent time but they had
the concept in their charter that every
employee has the right to go and protect
some percent of their time at work using
corporate materials to do whatever they
want let me read this this is a this is
from a philosophy document that William
McKnight wrote it's two paragraphs long
I'm breaking a cardinal rule of
presenting by having paragraphs of text
up there but let me let me read this for
you because it's really good as our
business grows it becomes increasingly
necessary to delegate responsibility and
to encourage men and women to exercise
their initiative I'm going to read this
one because that's making me dizzy this
requires considerable tolerance those
men and women to whom we delegate
authority and responsibility if there
are good people are going to do their
jobs in their own way mistakes will be
made but if a person is essentially
right the mistakes they make are not as
serious in the long run as the mistakes
management will make if it undertakes to
tell those in authority meaning those
delegated to exactly how they must do
their jobs management that is
destructively critical when mistakes are
made kills initiative it's essential
that we have many people with initiative
who were going to continue to grow so
that was his attempt and three
paragraphs to embody his philosophy of
managing innovation in a large company
this was a document that he wrote I
really can't look at that it'd be
embarrassing if I passed out in the
middle of presentation 1948 that was
when he wrote this but he lived this and
believe this for many years before this
is 60 years old this idea is 60 years
old so I want to ask you guys a question
I want you to think of think of your
manager or your previous manager or if
you want a manager at a company worked
for before Google if your managers in
the room you can use that as your way
out I want you to think of your last
manager the last person you work for and
think about whether they embodied this
set of principles how many of you think
that so the last person you work for
embodied they set this set of ideas okay
10 15 i'd say maybe twenty percent of
you say yes that's one out of five is
there a question yeah
that result okay the so I'm not sure how
does that change your answer the not an
individual manager who made that
decision to do think a certain way okay
so you and you would not give the
manager full credit or blame them fully
for this okay okay fair enough fair
enough so but about twenty percent of
you raise your hand so that means that
the other eighty percent of you have
worked in environments I'm assuming it
had some motivation or goal that the
innovative that failed to live up to
these principles so my point here this
is about the chrono centric thing again
these are a set of velocities that are
old I come from manufacturing come from
office supplies which we would perceive
as being techno centric minded people
all work in the tech sectors those are
antiquated dead industries but there's
something here's an essence here that's
essential to effectively innovating and
I put this is one of the themes of the
book one of them's of the book is that
these ideas are this is the hard part
especially this mistakes will be made
could you imagine a vision document or
plan or a corporate charter that said
that that your budget would say 30
million dollars we're going to you can
that's great that's fantastic good yeah
I've read that yeah that's fantastic you
what you guys I'm sure you believe that
you're the exception that it's it's rare
that companies would do that mistake so
we made it very difficult for most
managers to swallow even managers and
groups that are chartered with it's one
thing to say that mistakes are
acceptable it's another thing to make
one and then deal with the consequences
even an environment that says it's
accepting of mistakes there's usually a
passive aggressive or contradiction in
terms and how people deal with that
situation when it actually arises
another myth this is a myth that only
shows up briefly in the book is about
organizations size of organizations so
this is a picture of Saturn V rocket the
Apollo space program the space program
is in the Apollo 13 movie the space
program started and is 61 62 and the
space race mostly ended in 69 when we
landed on the moon for the first time
so in that period of time today we want
to guess at how many people were
involved in the u.s. space program how
many people you get a book if whoever's
closest gets a book 5,000 half a million
30,000 100,000 this gentleman is correct
it's 500,000 now I'm including you have
to figure that NASA was actually the
coordinating organization good answer
did you work for NASA okay I can't get
to keep the book anyway I'm just curious
so the reason one of the reasons people
forget that there were so many people
involved is NASA was sort of the
coordinating organization but all the
individual engineering work all the
individual innovations were done largely
where by different companies all the
spate you know the Space Age it's so
funny how they still use that in
infomercials that's sounding cool his
space age is 50 years ago that's what
all the space age technology took place
anyway all the individual components the
engines the air-conditioning units the
ventilation systems the coolant systems
the materials the metals all the
computers all those stuff were all
asleep reformed out to different
organizations different companies
Lockheed Martin all the different
defense contractors to put picked up
different pieces so all in total there
are 500,000 people that contributed to
the making of the machine that allowed
someone to go to the moon so innovation
is not something that's necessarily
bound to the size of an organization if
you have some set of principles and I'm
not saying these are the only principles
that have to be used but for some set of
principles and a leader who is able to
uphold them then you can innovate
ragazze in the scale the organization
because the goals are innovative so JFK
was the the figurehead at least the
beginning he died before this the
project could be completed but he was
the person said we are this is the goal
this is going to happen yes we've never
done this before yes sir a thousand
things we've never done before we're
going to do this by the end of the
decade so he started off the whole
project for the philosophy that embodied
a lot of what McKnight would agree with
and you can find other examples too i
mean the pyramids in egypt aqueducts in
rome you can find many examples of
innovations that could not have been
done if they were not in a large-scale
organization now one of the arguments it
comes up a lot is whether house
where differs from this or not the kin
software is software different kind of
engineering that cannot make great
innovations at a large scale and that's
interesting question that we can talk
about later if you want I'm going to
move on one of the things that's not
talked about in the space program very
much is the need for failure that
mistakes will be made we like to
sequester mistakes in our stories about
successful innovation we like to put
them in a box and say that's where the
failure was so Apollo 13 is a great film
that's what this pictures from great
film and very accurate film most of what
happens hook plays pretty much as it's
depicted in the film what's not depicted
are all the failures that took place
before Apollo 13 which there were many
in fact you can make a chart of all the
families that took place and there's a
huge number of failures took place
before the first man even went into
space how many people here to seen the
film right stuff the right stuff yeah so
okay there's a sequence in there that's
just a spaceship exploding after
spaceship for like two or three minutes
long and that was a again we're
sequestering the failure because you
could have made a whole movie just about
the failures so Apollo 13 comes up a lot
because it's this great heroic story
where no one was actually died but there
were people who died before Apollo 13
there were people who died in the Apollo
um paula was Apollo on the edge of the
engine tests right Paula won all three
crew members died and that was years
before Apollo 11 when we land on the
moon and several years even later then
the Apollo 13 mission took place so it's
interesting to look the reason why I
talk about the space program is that
that might be to this date the greatest
innovation in terms of technical
achievement that we've accomplished
internet comes up a lot but in terms of
the sheer complexity number of people
involved the space program putting a man
has to be in the top five or top ten the
interesting to have a debate about what
should be in the top ten but the space
program is definitely in there probably
a top three if you look closely at any
of those great innovations you will
always find series and series of
failures and that's how you learn to do
the things that people don't believe can
be done so I'm making those mistakes I'm
showing a picture of lunar lander for
one reason I want to offer you a
reference in case I bored you or you
feel like you know
stuff already there's a great reference
for creators that's tied to the lunar
lander a Tom Hanks produced an HBO
miniseries called from the earth to the
moon is anyone here seen that serious
okay only a couple of you so it's this
miniseries it's a good series but if
you're not into space you don't have to
watch the whole thing but I recommend it
all of you watch episode five from the
earth to the moon it's called spider and
what that episode is about is the
engineering specifically of the lunar
lander which was the most complicated
piece of engineering in the whole space
program because it was the only thing
that had to go actually from the earth
all the way to the moon with people in
it and bring them back so the
constraints that were on the design of
that problem was super high and what the
story is episode 5 it's like a
documentary on the design process the
engineering process of making this thing
and it's fantastic I guarantee you
you'll watch that you go like wow that's
just what the best team I ever worked on
at Google or ever else you've ever else
your best team experience was was like
and I want to replicate that I want to
show that to my team so how can we be
more like this 2 episode 5 from the
earth to the moon so I am on the home
stretch here good okay it's a fun game
to play to make something that you think
of is ordinary something that you think
of is obvious and try to go back to the
first instance of that thing so this is
a early prototype of the mouse thank you
no book for you I didn't ask the
question but get that honorable mention
this is a prototype of the mouse she's
made 67 68 somewhere around there sr i--
doug engelbart and you have to imagine
try to imagine we think of my says
obvious things necessary things
essential things how can we not have a
mouse when this was made in 68 or 69
Thorne opcs yet computers were isolated
very few people had them they were not
commonplace yet and some guy shows up
saying this is the future looking like
that not so good as you find you can
take anything you can take that video
camera you could take that microphone
these air systems these projectors and
go back and try to find the first
instance where
suggested this thing as an idea and
almost always the first instance looks
ridiculous looks silly looks like it's a
hack almost always and it's fun and go
back and ask yourself wait if this is
what the mouse which became as essential
thing in computing it's essential
element in making the internet pasta
making the webwork essential element
look ridiculous then what should be my
criteria what should be our criteria
when someone comes into my office
someone comes into my room so one shows
up and shows what should my criteria be
it has to be different than just a
superficial zuv looking at something
like this has to be something deeper
something else similar questions can be
asked about the myths we have about
great inventors when you go back when
you look carefully how they did but we
Harold them for the story is almost
always very different more complex than
we believe so Thomas Edison gets credit
for making invented a light bulb which
is a dubious claim because there a lot
of people who invented the light bulb he
was only the first person to succeed at
making the light bulb work as a business
in the system but Edison's greatest
invention may have been not any of his
patents not the phonograph not they're
not the light bulb it may have been the
research lab if you look at his patents
it's very rare that he shows up as the
only name on a patent all the famous
patents he has had plenty of people
involved in fact some of those people
should have been multiple patents of his
he was the first person that we know of
her first person who commonly gets
credit in the West in the business world
for creating a functioning research lab
that could reproduce innovation at the
Menlo Park research lab that eventually
became Edison con Edison the power
company in New York City so the story
behind Edinson is really a lot about
myth-making Edison promoted the idea of
himself as a lone inventor he promoted
the stereotype that a lot of programmers
like of this lone genius working alone
stuff everything in his hedge having
control over his the things he could
create being isolated and alone making
things happen in that way he promoted
that myth because he knew it helped
helped his business it helped focus the
attention on him while his group of his
lab could actually go and actually make
stuff so the story behind any great
inventor if you go you go back to the
beginning and you look
carefully how they made what they made
you almost always fine it's very
different than the mythology we've
created for them the convenient
mythology that we've created I'm
actually going to skip this side I'm
going to I'm going to sum up my points
hopefully I've said something useful let
me try to come at it from a different a
different direction here so the four or
five things I've talked about the first
is that innovation and design are
ancient as long as we have been here as
human creatures in this genetic form we
have been in innovators we've been
toolmakers we've been doing this for a
long time and the patterns and the
challenges are the same and if we're
smart we can look at other industries
and other technological challenges and
look at how they solve those problems
how they dealt with those patterns and
apply that to today the second is that
there's a mythology tied to innovation
once an innovation becomes accepted the
stories that we tell about it change
nobody talks about how we respond to the
first Mouse anymore it's obvious that a
mouse a mouse would be great and all the
people who wrote articles questioning
Engelbart and saying he was a fool and
an idiot they don't talk about those
articles anymore they don't talk about
those reviews anymore as soon as
something becomes accepted as a
mythology that forms and if you want to
be in you want to be an innovator you
want to be a star innovator you want to
come up with great ideas you want to
develop ideas and the things that help
people you have to break those
mythologies apart the force is it
organizations of any size can innovate
that's a misnomer as much more to do
with how the group is managed and what
the goals are what the intention is so I
have about 10 minutes left for questions
and I'm happy to answer question but
anything I've talked about or if you
want to ask me something else innovation
related that you hoped I would talk
about but didn't I'm happy to entertain
your questions and you'll get a book yes
you think Google has around it that are
questionable or ones we should be
wearing whoa okay yeah that's
yeah so that's an excellent question can
you pass this back to him that's an
excellent question it's just that you
guys outnumber me and I used to work at
Microsoft so I know there's a dungeon
underneath building 42 and I don't want
to end up there I I guess the the first
thing that comes to mind is there's uh
there's this double edged sword of
uniqueness the perception of uniqueness
and I think every great company has that
they believe that we are so different
we've done this so much better and
smarter and we cleverly unique and they
forget that just because you are unique
doesn't mean there aren't similarities
to other what other groups have done
early comes they've done that you can
learn from at the same time that it's
it's not either/or you can be unique and
still have situations that you can learn
from what other companies have done
except that's the first thing that came
to mind yeah I think when you mentioned
the how previous cultures have had the
same instance of it and it just sounds a
lot more like arrogance than being
better sure yeah okay yeah in the back
just carrots if you look at the story of
shock
yes did you mind coming forward I can
barely hear you thank you the transistor
that came out here and founded a
research lab that just hemorrhage money
for its entire existence least as far as
i know so i guess my question is how do
you at what point do you draw the line
between you know spending the money and
entertaining the ideas that might have
potential innovation or just losing
money until you whoever's got the money
it's paying you decides that they had
enough i guess i don't i don't quite
understand the question just rephrase
let's give me the last part again i
think quite how do you decide between
you ARB yeah but there are a lot of
things that don't turn out to be
products okay and if you have you know
if you entertain every idea that comes
across your desk secure to lose money
fair enough yeah so how do you decide
okay i don't think that is an answer
it's there's no algorithmic answer that
question because there are too many
variables there are way too many
variables and that's why innovation is
hard that's also why so many of the
books about innovation try to say if you
just do these five things you will win
and that's a lot that's one of the
greatest myths about this whole thing is
you can't possibly to put another way
you can do everything right that you
have control over and still fail for
dozens of different reasons you can fail
because a war breaks out and the day
you're going to launch like think about
this I wonder how many businesses were
supposed to do their business launch on
911 that went out of business they had
great ideas that had a great new new
product but because they were launching
on that day they didn't have the money
to come back and around again and launch
again they're all these things that are
out of your control if you are
innovating because you are doing
something new so how do you decide you
have to put into play a whole bunch of
variables and you can't control and
decide which bet you're going to make
which bet you're going to make and I
think a smart company and you guys are
famous for this you can't you can tell
me if it's true or not but that you you
want to have a lot of things going and
you want to have a cycle where every so
often you're looking at the hopper and
saying okay we've let these three or
four things go for two months three
months let's
pick two and fully invest them now and
we'll do that again in three months and
we'll keep going that's that's a pretty
smart organic Darwinistic approach and
that makes a lot of sense but there's
money it has to be spent to support this
incubator all right while you're waiting
for those things to surface yeah exactly
what you mean that innovation is
relative because surely if you do
something for the first time ever that
would be like an absolute innovation
when you mentioned the idea that you
know clean water is an innovation in
large parts of the world I mean it's not
like the idea is already there that's an
awkward sure how that would count as an
innovation okay well then I when you
start breaking down in the definitions
it gets fuzzy really quickly so I guess
what I me about innovation is relative
and that some of the ideas that you have
working at Google if you walk over to
the building across the hall and say
blah blah I do 27 ago yeah we know that
you keep going and go to the next
building over there like wow that's the
best idea I've ever heard that the value
of an innovation in the innovation scale
is always relative to people its
relative to culture that's what I mean
we like to think that there's this
technological scale of the universe and
at the top is God or divine power or
whatever at the bottom is I don't know
answer what you know there's some scale
you're always moving up the scale and
that's a very limited way to think about
innovation much more useful way to think
about innovation in this industry or if
you're trying to about how to make the
world better is to think about it in the
relative way I have this idea it's
useful to who rather than this idea
scores of 27 on my Universal animation
scale that that's my point does that
answer your question come up with
something that's the first time I've
ever been done but I'm surely that must
be innovative on absolute okay so give
me an example write the exam from the
book the light bulb hey Edison light
bulb no one ever thought of lighting
things before no never thought of making
an object that you could put somewhere
that would illuminate a room candles gas
lighting arc lighting go back to the
beginning of this you can always find it
where is antecedent there's an
antecedent some idea that was before the
idea you think is so amazingly unique
that let that set you up for it yeah uh
he's more complicated than that I think
that you have to here's what I'll say
any standard that exists you will find
an innovator who thinks that if i have a
new protocol that i think is better than
HTTP now with the standardization of
HTTP inhibits my innovation so i'm using
the relative arguing again any standard
that exists the matter how good you
think it is or we as a collective think
it is we'll be able to find a group of
people i think it's the worst thing ever
and is preventing progress from
happening so there's an inherent tension
in the history of technological progress
between it's like a pendulum that goes
back and forth in any field that things
get things are chaotic to be a push to
standardize them get standardized too
much it gets bureaucratic it still
longer growing and then something new
comes along and displaces it and it
starts again so I wouldn't say that it
inhibits it it's a necessary part of the
cycle you're always going through cycles
of standardization and then chaos and
back and forth yeah yeah like you're a
fan of innovation obviously have you
done any sort of study is to if you took
sort of another thousand most successful
businesses over 300 years how many of
them were underpinned by innovation and
how many of them just did something and
did it well yeah I don't know that I'd
say on the biggest fan of innovation
find some fascinating topic I think that
if you were running a small business on
your own with your own money you
wouldn't be innovating nearly as much as
you would be if you're in a big
corporation that has paying your salary
no matter what the outcome of your
innovation is and I think of like if I
had a pizza place for corner store
something and I had this business i'm
running i finally get it working that i
can make a living i'm probably not going
to reinvent my menu every week i'm not
going to reinvent it every month i'm
going to find a pace that i can manage
it allows me to control change so I'm
not getting left behind but I am NOT
racing the innovation so if you look at
the greatest corporations of all time
the ones that have lasted they tend to
be one that focus on bout that find a
better way to balance the expensive
innovation with low
periods of pulling efficiency out of the
previous innovation so General Electric
IBM who else Intel is a good example for
a while you could look at the some of
the car companies were actually good on
that kind of thing but not so much
anymore yeah in the back which point the
technological sophistication will become
so intricate that woman be able to post
between there is something unless you
have billions and billions oh yeah
that's definitely I think I mean you
guys a laugh at this but look at
microsoft windows right you have a
technology there that is 15 years old
and the complexities of people who work
on windows deal with it's enormously
large and that inhibits innovation at
some point that has to decay enough that
a new entrant could come in and be a
superior offering to people so I think
it's definitely true it's just a
question of how long it takes and how
long it takes before how long it takes
before a new entrant is able to actually
provide something superior from the from
the old entrant but yeah that happens
all the time I mean eating outside that
tech sector that happens it happened in
the automobile industry it happens in
every industry that someone's gonna have
to pass this all the way back but you
want to come up for that yeah so I had
several examples of cruising innovator
and
the space program where there's no
individual I mean Kennedy was there but
obviously didn't build the rocket
medicine society doesn't innovator but
you showed he had a lab behind food and
then you had the masking pink guy he
really did but we don't know who he is
oh yeah I think art fries the post-it
note guy I forget to I know his name I
just know it's not the real innovator
individual the group a diamond for
business it's a great question so
there's a chapter in the book there's a
chapter in the book called the myth and
loan the loan innovator that's all about
this question and that that's one of the
reasons why the patent system is so
frustrating it's because the patent
system forces us to identify a name it
says who and edit it is it Fred or not
fret is a gel or not Joe and when you
lure you break it down when you follow
the history of in it well I went I
borrowed from this guy I went and I
looked at what he had done there's so
many fuels that contribute to any
innovation so I think they all deserve
credit they all they all these are
partial credit so the guy the masking
tape guy I feel really embarrassed now
they don't know his name the masking
tape guy the masking tape guy it might
be art fry but I think our fries posted
notes anyway mask did guy his boss
William ignite eventually said yes will
you make night you had a boss who
eventually said yes so there's a
collection of people that are involved
they'd have to get some credit but I
think it's fair to said whoever is the
champion of the idea whoever has the
most at risk in supporting an idea those
are the people that deserve the credit
because they had something to lose yeah
making attention
time
before the front on okay joon-hee about
the fabric is it true the same set of
tools into the biophysical ten or twenty
thousand years or any innovation that's
okay I'm not saying it happen continuous
innovation has been going on ! to you
know ssl security for web browsing
they're both innovations sure which was
more significant would you would you
would you put those on the if you're the
universal innovator scaling system you
can possibly put those two things in the
same scale and I guess I look at the
patent system I'm like a wannabe student
or fan of the patent system i look at
patents as they go by and you look at
like the last hundred thousand patents
compared to the first hundred thousand
and there's this radical scale of
significance as a human being for what
they mean so i agree with what you're
saying that there's an exponential curve
to the number of things that we assign
as inventions but there's significance i
don't know that we can say that the
significance is climbing it seems to me
sometimes I feel like and this is
anecdotal I don't have data to support
me on this but some of it feel like the
significance of them is declining or the
the scale of them is declining anyway so
the book it before the dawn before the
dawn okay yeah oh you got one richard
ruse the author oh oh thank you very
good okay his name might even be in the
book I don't know it is ok thank you
feel better yeah
Google always comes up around innovation
I was wondering
I don't think they know I don't think do
they know you guys have fantastic
profile I mean you guys are the you get
you guys come actually you guys are in
the first chapter of the book I visited
I've been here a few times before and
there's a story from I snuck on a tour
that's the opening story of the book and
I chose that because if I'm writing a
book of 2007 it's a it's a good place to
start is what you know what makes a
place innovative but in terms of yeah
yeah I have to botanica with that number
you know I'm good yeah I know that but
you gotta figure it's three hundreds in
a room with some beer and they're like
oh come on i think it's Apple no have
you seen the ipod and they go back and
forth so the short answer is that I
don't think people know and you guys I
remember this when i worked at Microsoft
is I've read the high-profile articles
about my company may be like okay you
know like some of its right but some of
its whoa I haven't seen that so you
probably read those articles and you you
can you correlate for yourself how
Google's being portrayed compared to how
you experience google and you probably a
better sense of it than I do if you're
reading those things yeah
sidney NE ed and Andy okay finding in
the sense of you know even mythology was
about need funding the need to explain
as Wes and so I was wondering when you
talk about innovation and these things
that come up it seems like you look at
them from the standpoint of auger this
great idea and I'm wondering what you
see is kind of the precursors I've
actually doing the need finding the
studies that happened beforehand yeah so
uh there is a chapter in here I feel
like an idiot I don't remember what's in
my book chapter knives problems and
solutions so it talks about the fixation
and most people have that I want to be
creative I want to innovate I'm going to
sit down to innovate now versus the
other approach which is I'm going to
look and see what's broken I'm gonna see
what's not working and I'm going to try
to fix that and if I need to innovate to
fix that then maybe I will but I'm going
to focus on the need I'm going to focus
on trying to find needs so Maya position
is that needs there's way more examples
of people starting with a need and a
problem who innovated on their way by
accident because they needed to rather
than people who sat down said look I'm
going to prove how smart I am i'm going
to innovate today and just you know let
them use strike me so yeah there's
definitely there's definitely supporting
evidence that needs analysis and going
out to customers and paying attention
and observing is a fertile place to be
innovative or to start the process of
being creative maybe one more question
and then that's the spine yeah thing
about this
we seem to have a little luxury here is
that we do have twenty percent I'm where
you can just do something that has no no
accountability it's okay to fail it just
goes away space for rambling you got and
we had the end of the decade we're going
to be moon and we don't know how to do
any of this and we're going to have to
invent a bunch of stuff so is there
something that you've detected that made
it so that that could you could have
macro scale you know it's a great
observation and I agree with you that
they were in a difference in the
circumstances it was also nationalistic
they felt that if this was symbolic of
the cold war and that losing space would
be losing the nation that whoever got to
space first could drop bombs on the
other guy so there was this threat this
is real threat I mean if you guys work
at Google or if i work at some other
startup and I go under okay I'm out of a
job okay like that's bad but I'll
survive this scale this was much greater
so I think there is something to be said
for pressure the song Lee said for for
feeling like you're up against the wall
and you have to do this there's no other
way out like the Apollo 13 story I think
there's definitely support for that but
I don't think I've answered your
question because I've forgotten what it
was that's so excited about what you
said I just lost my cell phone yea
though you want to give it me again okay
how did they do it so I've read a bunch
of books about it and there's no magic I
think you just had a bunch of step they
had von Braun was another great guy
who's played a management role the guy
who managed the lunar lander he wrote a
book about the lunar lander process he
seemed like a solid guy I think a bunch
of the right things came together and
there's no one element that I would call
out and say okay we've got it now just
put that over here there were too many
factors there's no algorithm I don't
know how you replicate that in fact you
can look at NASA today and say how their
gee I mean I think I mean some of it you
have to go back and say JFK planted the
seed that was very clear and coherent
and concise that people could refer back
to maybe that was the closest thing to a
magic element and she had someone like
him who began it in the right way and
then he died
so this is like there's a lot there
might be a lot of mythological power in
that story but that's just my circle my
guess I I'm going to wrap up if you have
more questions for you feel free to come
on up and I'll hang out as long as you
guys want to but thank you for coming
and I hope you check out the brook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
