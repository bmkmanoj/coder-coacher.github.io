if you had a somewhat typical childhood
for a Googler or anyone else in this
industry you probably spent a good deal
of that childhood hunched over a small
computer making it emanate various
strange beeping sounds to the great
consternation of your parents and if you
remember that era of your life fairly
well you probably remember that some of
those games I had more sheep than usual
and that's the fault of one man who is
standing immediately to my left and it's
my great pleasure to introduce him who a
man who has been an independent game
developer for longer than I think than
I've been alive and is still going
strong and has a wonderful piece of work
in progress to show us ladies and
gentlemen mr. Jeff mentor okay all right
so while if you want hear me quite
correctly good good but uh I've been
producing games for well far too long
really it makes feel really old if I
think about how long I've been doing it
I actually found the other day I was
going through some old tapes dad down
and down at my mother's place and i
found an old cassette tape for the
commodore pet and i thought there is no
way on earth that I'd ever be able to
retrieve anything off that but I took it
home and with a little bit of fiddling
about I actually managed to get
something back from what someone my
first ever come with all pet games I
never thought I'd ever see again in my
life this was written in the 70s for
God's sake I mean it was 1979 it's it's
pretty rubbish but i'll just i'll open
with it just because it's it's curious
to see something from so long ago no I
remember that time we cold or basic
right now I think I could make this work
if i press that's one stop it's the
length there we go working
shift is fine yes oh I'm rubbish at it
mine is pretty rubbish game to be honest
with you it's not exactly easy to play
this is all hand assembled in 652
assembler in like half an hour a day
that was all allowed at college we had
we had one in Commodore pet in college I
haven't scored any points at all economy
trapping it but no I'm and also in this
game hi this is back in the days nobody
nobody never really heard of programming
video games and when you have arcade
games which people knew about space
invaders and asteroids and that kind of
thing in the home you had things like
pong and the VCS but the very idea that
anybody could sit down and actually
create their own games it was just a
lien college we had one Commodore pet Oh
between the whole college I think there
are only about four geeks in the whole
college we spent all their time in the
computer room making these weird little
games and we never thought for an
instant that there would ever be a
market for this stuff it was just
something which which we did and anyway
I left college and then I were to
university and then I was very bored at
university because I was there on a math
and physics course I really was
interested in math or physics I was
interested in playing with computers so
in due course I got kicked out and I
forgot hicktown i was there supposed to
be going back to a polytechnic and i
spent three months there and then i got
quite serious real and while i was awful
sorry i'm going to start making games
because it just it just so happened that
in the intervening time uncle Clive were
brought out the said accel x 80-in zx81
Commodore brought over the vic-20 and so
this arcane stuff which we've been doing
in college just just the for us suddenly
started opening up and I wondered
whether given that I couldn't be do
anything else because I was ill whether
I could actually write some games and
see if I could tell them and in due
course we did sell a few and probably
the first that anybody would have heard
of me in
North America is with this stuff joystiq
plugged in yes I believe I have this was
a game called grid runner which was
released over here by an outfit called
human engineered software and if I have
a good play as you can see it's
based on centipede but I mean centipede
oil I liked centipede I think at the
time I wrote this I'd only have a plane
sent to me about twice but I liked it
but what I didn't like about it was a
bit girly it was all a bit namby-pamby
then we have mushrooms and then flies
and things I want to talk a bit more
hard edge so I made good runner well
it's a bit it's a bit more challenging
than than pure sense because you got
that thing which goes on the satchels is
complete bastard but this actually did
quite well though it looks crude but at
the time we must understand this is the
early days of video games and and most
things will rubbish and certainly some
of things are getting well they were
getting away with selling we're
absolutely dreadful so even though this
is pretty poor looking actually played
fairly well and so it did it did pretty
good and after that we had all right
this was the sequel to good runner which
came out forgot six months later and
it's called attack of the mutant camels
I'll just show you a little bit although
it's very similar to go around so it
does have more level as you go on there
are actual camels in it and lots of
different things but damn it's a bit
more smooth bit more fluid bit nicer to
play
and this again did did fairly well i
have actually neglected to show you the
first game which I did for our human
engineered software sold on the Vic
because it's absolutely dreadful there
was a defender clone and it was horrid
the ship was about source of a bus
terrible terrible thing now that was
attacking Newton camels over here in
America but back in Europe attack of the
mutant camels or something entirely
different and I can show it to you I
find the white folder which is there now
this was attacking me to count
because tackle meeting cameras past him
whacking great camels it really doesn't
it you need giant camels whoops very
very hard to play I'm showing the 8-bit
Atari version because uh although the
original version was a Commodore 64
version the camel in the Commodore 64
version look like two fat men in a
pantomime camel suit made out of lego so
the sake of my vanity i'm showing you
the slightly better looking version what
notoriety difference play oh I'm gonna
kill this camel come on camel come on
die huh
Oh Randy enough Tom's will die I'll die
maybe I'll die instead well work oh come
one more guy yeah I blame the joystick
I'm sucking course at secular there
applause yeah anyway you may notice a
striking resemblance to a tire VCS game
by Parker Brothers that was called
Empire Strikes Back and it has the
walkers out star was in very much a
similar scenario to that Martin towards
your base they had to fly around and
shoot them and all right yeah I hadn't
really thought of copying that game
really but then there was this magazine
in the UK called computer and video
games and I was flicking through that
one day and they reviewed this Parker
Brothers Empire Strikes Back game and
they described the walk this is giant
mechanical camels and I went hmm hmm I
do like the idea of that and I thought
would be much better much more fun to do
with giant camels however I actually
really like camels so yeah this this
game although it was quite nice I didn't
really like the idea that you were
killing these camels so I made up this
convoluted story whereby the camels had
actually been abducted by aliens and
reprogrammed and made to fight against
their will and eventually they rebelled
and thus was born this
revenge of the mutant pounds this time
the camels are the good guys
when he gets take over I'm fight against
all manner of strange things like birds
and telephone kiosks and old boots and
all sorts of just odd stuff I may look a
bit rubbish but for its time when it
came out this was this was pretty good
on the Commodore 64 and it actually did
very well in Europe nobody's ever heard
of it over here unfortunately because uh
unfortunately human engineered software
didn't really get into the whole Beastie
game thing that jogger in turn so they
refused to distribute my stuff in the US
but this is my fond remembered amongst
British people of a certain age
and having done revenged mutant camels I
got into my stride and just about every
game I did following that with full of
beasties as for example this one
this is sheep in space which I do
believe is the first game ever to
feature an interstellar space sheep man
it's vaguely defender II I suppose but
it takes it a little bit further by am
having to planet surfaces and your
little sheep can fly around between them
killing the bad guys and you can swoop
down over a surface and try and kill the
enemies that are down there see the
sheep's of the legs point down and as
you get hit your sheep gets hungry and
if she gets too hungry then he needs to
look for a field let's kill that guy
well there's a field so if you land in
the field I know she beats and that will
replenish his chill but you must you
must take care cuz if you let your sheep
overly overeating is never good even for
sheepies you like to see very then it
explodes and this was this was followed
by all manner of games including the
incredibly stupidly name to Metta
galactic llamas battle at the edge of
time which I shan't trouble you with at
the moment but around the same time I
start to develop another thing apart
from games I had a fascination ever
since I was 11 years old but the music
of Pink Floyd and particularly the light
shows which they they put on with their
live shows are always ever since ever
since I started listening to Pink Floyd
but ever I listened to it the dark room
I would always visualize shapes and
geometric things in my head that went to
the music and I also got such a good
idea to idea of a color synthesizer so
company music and one day I hoped
somebody would build one and then I'll
buy one and use it anyway working on
going to a couple years and I thought
well actually I could start using the
same technology i'm using four games to
start experimenting with that kind of
idea myself and i came up with this
extraordinarily simple little program
called psychedelia
and all this was a little Kersey we've
run enjoy sick and well then when you
press the button and hold it down you
get patents that follow via kurta and
decane honestly and you can change the
symmetry on nice patterns have different
colors green one was always a favorite
why not you don't gates the stretches
and it doesn't do like much on its own
but if you imagine the sitting in an
early 80s bedroom listening to some nice
pink floyd perhaps having smoked a
recreational cigarette with your mates
then this was actually rather good fun
and we really enjoyed it and it was
funny because I mean when it got
reviewed people either really got what I
was shot or two really understood the
whole concept behind it or they just
thought i was absolutely stupid so I had
both the best and worst reviews of my
life for this I 11 go reviewed it
reviewed it on the on the spectrum and
just dismissed it as a load of absolute
hippie nonsense it's other guys from
some music magazine and there's a bit of
an old hippie myself said he found a
mere words too cumbersome to describe
the brilliance of it and it was it's
funny but it was the start of something
I mean I ever ever since 1984 I've been
developing this this idea the next stage
two which we took it was to implement it
on the 8-bit Atari which had a much
nicer set of display modes where are we
target bits up there okay and we called
it color space on there and a ton of
water mode the Atari had this lovely
displaylist architecture where you can
construct these curve type screens and
also you had a much richer color palette
than most of the other 8-bit machines
it's really wrote in a very nice machine
I did like the old Atari and we develop
this further to the Atari ST it kept
ticking along
but probably the next time anybody here
may have heard of me would be with like
it was this where are we there we go
tari iced tea bless it
this little thing
oops I'm on a little bit level huh all I
need to go amber this is Lama Tron then
it's based on rabbit rock I'm a great
fan of you do Jarvis work but I think
about Robotron is that it's really
really hard to play it basically will
eat your lunch in about two seconds flat
and I wanted to make something that was
actually a bit more relaxed than that
where you can settle in and a bit bit
more of a longer game and so I came up
with language on end up being look
superficially looks like road we ought
to except the stupid graphics it
actually is a bit more a bit more deep
in a bit more evolved you've got
power-ups you've got beasties to rescue
I just I'll stop again from the
beginning in a sec okay now this game
it's tremendously fun to play with it I
thoroughly recommend if you haven't seen
it before you should get out of a copy
on on the Steve emulator in player
because if people who like this kind of
robotron game then this is just lexicon
well forget that power up all the
Beasties run toward you to love you
kill zippy the pinhead and the pace on
this is a lot more gentle than in
robotron we can actually play this for
half an hour and just have fun then he
got power-ups and smart ones and all
kinds of stuff which you didn't you
didn't have any in Roberto and the nice
thing about this gate was that I made
this at the time when la myself I was
having increasing difficulty getting
distribution back home the video game
business was changing feeling something
which somebody like me could could could
successfully participating in to the
multi-billion dollar business of this
today let's turn off gotta go sounds get
McWhorter moo moo moo moo no at that
time in the UK nobody really heard of
shareware and so I decided to release
that game a shower we run a couple of
software houses with it and they just
had no no piss off it's not really what
we want and I'm having to argue with my
parents for days but idea of shower
because this was like real share it
wasn't like what they call
shareware today which is crippled where
this was real chair or basically you put
the full game out I just said to people
look if you like it said the survivor we
didn't really expect to get as huge
response with you know obviously I hoped
I'd get some response but the response
was overwhelming we got thousands of
thousands of thousands of responses from
people and not only did they pay five
quid but it's just thought of them sent
letters just saying how nice it was that
we trusted them to have this game and to
pay for it if they liked it and that
really rescued love a lot lavasoft back
then it was really it was quite a moving
experience because I would look like I
was being shut out by the industry and
then I was kind of rescued by the people
which was absolutely superb and that
kept me going Oh piss off dell support
Stevie feeling stupid thing only when I
hate it when you buy something from
dell's delivery boys it look it's a crap
all over your laptop um anyway so after
I've done armitron Atari started to keep
their army and that was when we ended up
doing something which probably is the
thing which most people would remember
me for if I can just get to it where is
it there is just need to load up and
wanna fall if you don't have this
envelope by the way should really pick
it up it's if you like your tea to cake
this is this is the boy
let's buy this there
I'd always love tempest went M plus the
arcade game it always appealed to me
because there was something about those
arcade games and particularly the vector
games which I particularly admired just
the the clean abstract nature of the
graphics or in with with with tempest
because everything was just geometry
there wasn't really the idea that was
trying to be anything it just existed in
its own little abstract world and i love
that passionately about it I mean to me
it's stood out more than any other video
game because of that and so when the
opportunity came up to work on the
Jaguar they said you know here's a list
of arcade games we were at Def Con and
everybody had to put their hand up for a
game what to do and when it came to
tempest I was like yeah me me me me do
that let me do that and it was bit scary
because at that point on everything I've
done before we had always been like
Thailand sprite-based and so I hadn't
actually had to do any math and moving
on to the Jaguar his first or whatever
and she put my hands on a polygon and I
thought I had to learn does the math
books off at least enough to get this
thing to work but it proved that to one
of those the pretty one of those things
that was more daunting to think about
that actually wants to do once you've
got you head into it's good fun but this
was where I more when I started the
process which i think is is pretty much
my my path now my way of doing things I
wanted to combine the kind of abstract
graphics that I was having in those
graphics toys that I showed you the
psychedelia with game stuff with a game
up tempest because it is so abstract you
can start to do that and so that's what
we did with Tempest i put here you can
see
it's a decent level to stop
also the music on this game was
fantastic when really wasn't just the
game that was good it was the way
everything for together in the audio on
this game is just stunningly good so we
kind of updated Tempest for what was
then the modern day and it seems to do
quite well despite the fact that Atari
apparently didn't really think much of
it the first time I went to the launch
party of the Jaguar in New York and the
guy who designed the Jaguar actually
made a point of taking me off to one
side and telling me that he thought ten
fifty thousand was absolutely rubbish
but it didn't use the machine well at
all the Atari didn't think anything of
it at all though yeah it wasn't one of
their prestige than launch titles like
Trevor McFerrin the crazy galaxy oh no
and so I came away from that while the
dis harmed and no I'm still going on
work on it and finished it off and then
came out to Atari for final test coming
to sunnyvale I just as I arrived the
final test some of the guys are getting
back from winter see yes they also come
up and say oh well done well done for
what apparently they take this thing to
see yes and it's been given them all
from one of the best games at CSI look
wait excellent and completely unexpected
and then it did it went out there and it
did fairly well and I had the
opportunity some years later of being
able to to sit in a bar with that guy
who designed the Jaguar who told me this
crap and make him eat his words that was
most fun and yeah what time at Tara was
good another thing I did what I was
there was further develop the whole idea
of the of the abstract graphical toy to
play with music and this is what we wait
like that I I need to attach one of
those don't we name it touch it man I
need to press that to close the lid and
we need to press something here until
all that disappears then I'll need to
press that everyone mera business now
this really was a the first of the
visualizes this was difference the first
time would actually have the ability to
make one of these graphics toys actually
listen to the music and respond
accordingly and this is pretty much the
ancestor of all the ones which you now
see on them on windows media player and
iTunes and that kind of thing always
basically the same set of techniques
it's just introduced but one thing we
always had on this which a lot of people
never had on there is is there always
interactive you could always pick up the
joystick and control them because always
liked the idea of it being not just an
entirely passive thing but also
something which you could interact with
and play a bit like an instrument then
it was fun unfortunately the Atari
Jaguar cd-rom salter about three people
so not many people actually other
transfer this but I know a lot of the
other visualizer guys did start out with
this stuff because I had a couple of
accounts me it shows i said yeah did I
mind that they've nicked all my
techniques the head well that's fun and
if you played with this today the planet
it stands up even to even to move to
some of the modern stuff anyway after
that unfortunately my time at Atari
ended on when I did Tempest and I did
the vlm I've been I've been freelance
I've been still Lamas off and after that
I decided to join Atari and that was not
good move it not discuss of what
happened to Atari but personally not for
me ugh I don't make a very good employee
and
and also I think Atari just thought that
they could lean on me a bit too hard
when i was in house Oh Chris after I've
done tempest and the vlm they gave the
defender 2000 now that should have been
an absolute joy but basically I wanted
to do it one way and my producer wanted
me to do it another way I want to do it
with like small graphics and the same
kind of abstract trippy stuff you see in
that in the light since basically in the
same style i was doing tempest and my
producer wanted huge graphics and
massive sprites because they were going
to put it on cd-rom and so i had to
always parallax scrolling on earth don't
really like doing that way but they made
me and i hope that with a bunch of this
dis our outfit in san jose they were
supposed to do all the graphics for it
or ember say to these people look
whatever you do if you're going to
design the graphics my game whatever you
don't make it so that you designed them
you have the backgrounds and then you
can't see the enemies in front of the
backgrounds because that really ruins
game so of course what they did always
you couldn't see the bleedin enemies
against the background and so I didn't
have I didn't really have the freedom to
do what what I would have liked to have
done and although defender to thousands
okay it's really it's not one of not one
of my best works I have to say and I
just think that my philosophy in
InDesign is a bit ok it's non-compliant
with being employed really I think
that's why I have to be freelance I I do
suck at doing conventional design this
whole idea that you have sit down design
the game right the whole document
describing the game give that to your
publisher who then approves it and then
they have to go back to the programmers
who make it exactly as it said on the
bit of I think doesn't work like that I
mean to me a game is a living thing
which takes shape as you form it i mean
i start out with a kind of idea where i
want to go and I kind of try and build
the tools which do that and then as I'm
doing that yeah something might
something mate may turn out good
something might turn out bad I mean they
haven't recently the space draw how this
one technique which has been in the
design for a long time and it sounded
good when I first thought of it and it
seemed okay when I first started
once again and it seemed okay when I put
it into a tutorial level but then when I
actually started building actual game
levels it sucked it was really bad and
so I need to try to check it out so it's
all right fair enough chuck it or what
and other things will also emerged as
you're playing around technology may
develop some some new technique and you
may wish to change the design actually
I'm not gonna do that I'm going to do
this and I think if you try and hold
yourself to a design that's graven in
stone before you set out then you end up
with a compromise the end of the day
because the thing isn't allowed to
evolve properly I need my going to
evolve and so quite often what i end up
with is almost not at all like what I
set out immediately oh I started out
saying I was going to do for example to
get space drive through the approval
process just to begin that Microsoft you
have to submit a document describing 30
seconds of game play whatever five
minutes ago a common what it was so I
just made it the hell up I couldn't say
what it's going to be like a year in a
year's time so I just kind of made it up
and said yeah it's gonna be really
bright skin really cool bro it worked
but I mean I can't work that way I
simply can't and another thing i think
that the data that is important to me i
know it's just how I work now and I
think makes it easier for me to survive
as an indie is the fact that I work
entirely in the abstract I'm really into
this idea of bringing together the whole
audio reactive like synthesize of stuff
and the video game stuff and in doing
that I make a different kind of game I'm
not making a game where I'm trying to
tell a story I'm not making a game where
I'm trying to simulate anything I'll
make anything realistic what I'm
actually doing and when I design a game
I'm trying to or try to get to a feeling
I'm trying to get to the pure essence of
video game it doesn't matter what the
graphics are saying as long as what
they're saying is nice it doesn't matter
what the audio is doing as long as it
fits in with what the graphics are doing
I'm trying to make a feedback loop that
includes you and the graphics and the
audio and everything it just gives you
that experience of getting into the zone
i'm not sure i'm not a storyteller and I
think that's the for me that's quite
good because it means if the telling
stories were being realistic
the hordes of our people to you know
design characters and and you've got to
dialogue and got to do all this stuff
which takes a lot of resources and it
seemed gets beyond this beyond the scale
so which what two guys can do lavasoft
has doubled in size recently with two
guys nice and just well and I'm so I'm
now pursuing this this work entirely in
the abstract and it's really good for me
because it means i can use my light
synthesizer tools to actually create the
in-game environment and all the stuff
that happens in the game the light synth
work eventually came to fruition i don't
know if any of you have got the xbox 360
and i've ever used the music visualizer
thing on it that thing is our design
it's an engine called neil and basically
neon is it sit in the year in the xbox
neon is purely a visualizer well it's an
interactive visualize up to four people
can use it together as well as the big
driven by the media but I always wanted
to use it as well as the basis for a
game and so now we're moving on to well
let's change here space to our
now space to office the first game is
built entirely on the neon engine and I
know basically I wanted to produce a
game which would appeal to people who
remember tempest 2000 however I don't
want it to just be another version
tempest for various reasons I've done
tempest 2000 I did ten past 3,000 on a
little-known system called the new on
which i'm sure most of you are
blissfully unaware up and basically this
problem will do i do I don't have been
tied in tied to the same game tempest is
based on an elegant but very very simple
design and much in the same way as llama
Tron started out being like Robo trouble
then expanded out into all kinds of
different directions became much more
fun I think in the process I wanted to
do the same thing and basically start
out from the starting point of tempest
2000 but move away into its own
direction so at the end of this when I
do a sequel to this it won't be tempest
blah blah it will be a sequel to space
to you offer it will be my own thing as
opposed to being hooked to Dave toy yrs
old game for the end of time I blessing
I love that game but it's time to move
on so it's time for the giraffe and I'll
charity and I'm sure when you first see
it open that's the one controller that's
the one controller I can actually come
out the slides fight yesterday on my
back to the screen well I'm sure when
you first see it you will think hey it's
tempest
and indeed you can put you can play it
like tempest but i'll tell you what i'll
show you what happens if you play a
clock tempest if you play it like spaced
you are i'll demonstrate on level 20
okay shoot the opening forget top
temple help them die
all right transition
okay so you see we've got 60 2500 points
playing as Tempest now let's play that
same levels face draw
oh I won't gets on top which if you did
a tempest for certain death / hair I'm
gonna have a special boot yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yes as you can see
my score is considerably bigger and so
the thing with this game is you can play
this purpose but if you if a flightless
tempest then you're hard to get any
points you certainly won't any extra
lives and you won't get anywhere on the
leaderboards you need to learn the new
techniques and all the basically all the
point scoring and progression techniques
in this game don't even exist in
temperature and in some ways this is the
anti tempest because in tempe she had to
prevent stuff getting from the top if
stuff got to the top then that was it
you were dead we were actually at a
smart one way whereas in this you really
want to get stuff onto the top and then
use this special technique called
Bullock which when when you'll ship is
powered up you can just push stuff off
the top of the rim and the more of it
you collect up to do the more points you
get yours because it's built inside the
the graphic synthesizer we can also use
the environment as part of the
difficulty of the game there are enemies
for example in levels 33 upwards called
feedback monsters and what they do is
when you shoot them or they're pretty
innocuous at first they lock us when
later levels they get quite bastardly
actually but first not risk but what
they do is when you're playing a level
that will cause the whole level the
flare up I'll show you I go to
a little bit disoriented result /
actually offer while you get used to it
and it's just a pretty just nice but the
whole thing about this game is a tempest
in original temple stories tempest in
the same way as Jarvis is Robuchon
there's a wonderful game but it was
absolutely brutal all right we're
killing you stoned a link with your good
feeling stone paving a few minutes
whereas a what I want to allow with
these games is is much more of a restful
experience we to me the act of playing
game in and it should be a nap in and of
itself a reward just playing it should
be fun so much fun that even if you die
even if you don't get the high score
even if you don't leave the road should
always walk away with a smile on the
face because the act of playing itself
should be a reward in and of itself with
this you can just settle in zone out and
I find that when I'm where I'm testing
it I'll go to test one level or no loss
up there and played 20 because i just
copied out love the feel of it really
really nice
I believe are you are believing there
being a nice difficulty curve it should
ramp up nicely I don't believe there's
never be spikes and different occur such
as you get with Boston for the height
boss don't engage oh it's horrible those
things you own up against a boss you
just hit a brick wall you've got to do
the same thing over and over and over
and over again you just get fed up with
it bosses get right on my teeth and so
there are no bosses in this game there
are there are yea though I said there
are some difficulty increments right
level 64 for example level 64 if it gets
level 64 I guarantee the first time you
get there you'll just go what the Smeg
is going on there and you'll die i'll
show you all right check this out
it is bonkers on meat hooks Chisholm
you
yeah we all notice I didn't I straight
away when you get used to it it actually
makes sense so the first time you get
there I guarantee you'll just go oh my
god my poor brain but the thing is all
right even if you die I so I do have
spikes and difficulty but they will
never hold you up because even if you
thought it doesn't take you back to the
start of a level so even if you died
five or six times you could still get
through the level because when you die
it doesn't send you back to the start
you keep the progress so you never hit
an absolute brick wall and okay you make
you may not get that far afterwards
because you could be down to one life
and your they get much further but you
never get that that complete and
absolute block that you get in some
games I really don't want to do that and
in fact I won't do the opposite we're
going to have them a set of boss rounds
there'll be a chill out round so every
few levels you'll get you'll get access
to the chart round and you just have a
chance to steal just do something nice
graphically or just better wibble the
thing around and do something fairly
easy pick up some points you know a
roller whatever I and chill out so the
whole I do this is its to take you to
the zone it's a take it to a place where
I had done of how many of you a
shoot-'em-up game player how many who
are being into that kind of thing there
is a place where you can go where it
just lose yourself assist you and the
game and the whole experience and just
the feedback of being a mass and it
becomes so pleasurable space giraffe is
designed to take you that and we
certainly hope that it will do i'll just
take you from some of the i'll scroll
through the actual level select so you
can see the variety of environments we
can generate with neon engine
this one on our testers
you see the eyes
it looks like temperature because people
are sure to come to this now my god
except about when they start playing
any old spectrum page will remember that
people
you
I which one of the ton of oats always
just looks like nothing else really on
xbox live arcade is good but I think a
lot of the stuff that's on it so far has
been a bit cuz it's all old old
emulations or its ports of PC casual
games or this and that and we need
something a bit more out there on that
was taught to me by the fellow that he
wrote all those songs guitars and mental
Appel arrays Stevens other stuff goes
above is that there's another one of
those just oh my god levels
era if everyone's got any questions or
asked about this and off everyone else
to play space trough and I'm more than
happy to to assist or what yeah okay I
swear it not bring you all the way here
just ask the special where's the pc
version that's what I'm what pc know the
pc version now I mean we're just just
getting ready to basically getting ready
the online shop in all seller we had a
great a nightmare with it basically it's
been finished for over a year and my biz
dev guy said there's the possibility of
hooking up with really big hardware
manufacturer to achieve some kind of
distribution said yeah that's a really
good he said hate you should hang out
and try and do that and so we said all
right we'll do that and it was just a
nightmare dealing with these people who
kept saying yes we'll do it yes we'll do
it yes we'll do it this will do it and
then like nine months down down the line
said no we can't do it and yeah I was
gutted because I'm I don't like Evan
finish coat but haven't released yet but
I think of what we're going to do now is
release it at the same time we release
paste you're off because it'd be quite
nice to be able to say well here spaced
you off hoping if you will be talking
about space giraffe and are all the
trippy neon backgrounds them Excel
actually he's the tool we used to build
that so we can release that at the same
time yeah
it's just a lot of games you listen
you're talking about your experience
very good um talk about my experience
writing with that yeah it's been
generally good the only time when we
came to to loggerheads as it were was
when they they released a supplement in
the in the UK version or the same over
here which was just a complete puff
piece for the ps3 and I wrote an article
which rather teutons tasks with that and
they got a bit upset about that and I
had to kind of change it back and be a
bit more polite but generally it's been
very good they they just let me write
about what I want to feel like writing
whether they haven't told me recently
that I should try and write more about
the actual process of development rather
than try and pontificate on the nature
of video games in general which I was
all really i was i was trying to avoid
doing it first and I didn't want my
columns be seen as just you know being
advertising for space to you are for and
it's pastry off speak for itself rather
than be be plugging it in edge every
month but alright that's what they want
to hear about you know generally they'd
be good yeah just right now people of
you need to write Java processes
whew my cell phone am here I will amend
you two choices but did distribution
process issue me changing oh yeah well
oh yeah I think it I think it's
important to work that way I think that
the reason that a lot of games have
become so boring and monolithic is
because yeah some publishers insist that
they only published successful formulas
so if a game doesn't conform to that it
won't get published and that's a vicious
circle you end up with about five or six
yamas and that's it so I think being
independent and having new means of
distribution such as online distribution
where you don't have to go through the
publishers at all gives people much more
chance to be spontaneous and be creative
in to vote in the in the development
process
okay so some people who know janae's
when you know what we've got
um yeah ask me if I've ever moved the
thought of moving on to the portable for
us I did actually do a few things on the
Pocket PC and it was quite nice and I I
really did enjoy myself doing that but
at the end of the day I like doing my
big shoot-'em-up so I like doing my
trippy stuff and I think I need a bit
more of an immersive environment or
immersive play area they find the small
screen a little bit off-putting cuz I
like stuff to be big and fill the screen
then you know and that on a big plasma
is what I want to see not something one
little tiny think but yeah I did have
some fun with that and it is quite a
good place for small Davis to go but
it's nice there is stuff emerging that
allows small devs also to work on the
console and work on the large scale as
well okay could you talk a bit more
about the difficulty of getting
distribution doesn't
difficulty getting distribution well I
mean I think half the bowel is you've
got to be known of it you really have to
have some work in hand which you can
show them or some awesome but on some
history which you can show people to
open up the channels and I'll guess I
was lucky with xbox live arcade but this
at the time that they asked me to start
working on it at least two other guys
there were really fanatical tempest two
thousand fans and so they approached me
and said come on do some stuff for us
once you're in there I think it's great
and also if you can afford to get in
there self-funding without actually
taking any funding from from the people
then that's great as well we've managed
to do a space to off basically boy we're
not eating for you but it does mean that
when it comes out we get a much larger
percentage than we would have got if if
we've taken funding from Microsoft but I
think in terms actually getting getting
into the channels in the first place the
only really work the only real way to do
it is to have something to show people
to have some form of demo you can go to
them and say look this is what's done so
far when X and a would be a good way and
I think to xbox live arcade you could do
stuff on X and a pretty easily without a
lot of investment in development tools
it would get seen and that would be a
good way of getting into xbox live
arcade I don't know what it's like on
the Sony cider and it's not that because
I'm really dealt with Sony but I'm
probably quite similar okay
provide shareware
um we haven't really looked looked into
that yet we made their actually bumped
into other guys from there yesterday
when i was at GDC it i'm thinking is
we're now nicely hooked into xbox live
arcade i think that's going to be our
thing but the guy was asking about
taking some of our old titles and
putting out that way on anything which
can make share more more effective has
to be a good thing i mean anything which
basically enables people to reach the
market more easily in a way which is
actually viable has to be a good thing
when shareware it can be a bit
willy-nilly when it when it doesn't work
it could be really disappointing you
could things like really good then it's
about three that's all what's the point
you know so yeah and anything which is
which which makes that more effective
it's a good thing oh look the biggest
gamer I know is Elaine down the pub she
plays far more games than any than me or
any of my gamer mates because every
single time I go down there she is sat
in front of that machines he's playing
some card game or she's playing some
very puzzling port his prey yo these
little puzzle games as she put it must
be a five or six hours a day I like um I
don't play I don't play much games I
don't know anybody else who plays that
much games certainly the casual gaming
market has got to be huge I bet popcap
of that those who are coining it in
there must be sure
you pushing games 3 6910 12 times day or
something do you knew much about under
on the pc and then push the xbox once a
day basically you've got the devkit
hooked up to the pc you can pile on the
pc and then it just it it compiles and
then just copies the XE over to the xbox
and it runs on the xbox it's not running
on the pc side at all so every time you
compile go a new version of this on the
xbox yeah yeah I've seen that yeah it's
really nice I like the photos and also
mention sheep even though they don't a
very cheap would like to be it felt very
pretty I do like that kind of stuff
mr. down sweater yeah there's every
chance of that happening I one more
another though there will be a space
draft version for the PC we're planning
or doing our own port but I think it's
quite likely that Microsoft will ask us
to do it for vista live arcade or no
multiple much but well maybe not for
space job I think space draft is space
draft but suppose you're off to maybe
you know I mean that's something which
we want to move into I when getting all
this stuff actually working first time
out on the xbox 360 and getting it to
play now I see we just thought the live
leaderboard stuff takes there's a load
of infrastructure there it's really
needs to be built up we can't really
spend much more time and development us
now we've got to finish it off to get
out the door if we're going to be cost
effective but having done a lot of work
to get this going there's a lot that's a
lot of work we don't have to do our
future games and that may give us time
to actually start implementing stuff
like online multiplayer which should be
fun absolutely go yeah sure right I
should explain pretty much how it works
I'll just take your briefer Fuji tour
I'll show you I'll show you at first
things on the toilet
strike
okay see that white glowing line across
the across the grid that's your power
zone imagine the whole grid is a power
meter yeah as you shoot things and do
various things the power zone extends if
you don't shoot then it drops away all
right now the whole essence of space
trough is that when the power zone is
extended stuff that's on the rim push
off so as long as that's there it
doesn't really matter about stuff down
that's not getting to the top so you can
let it Hakeem right the more than either
King rights however if you let it closed
down captain I'll show and you actually
do get caught there that will grab you
these things are power-ups if you grab
those it also extends the powers on and
you see each one you grab see you've got
two things on tiles there now those are
jump pods if you jump it not only jumps
you but it fills up the whole power so
you can use that to your advantage jog
over here to do that trick which i did
on level two you let them all come up to
the top don't worry that you've got no
power zone then you see if we jump fill
it up and then go when you get the moon
that's when you increase the bonus
multiplier anyway i'll stop playing and
you wanna play that all sore stop
studying it's up to you soon basically
the drought move early draft you eat
when the power settings extended you can
aim the shots with that as well that's
smart one and that's jump there's
trigger hands jump with witches home it
fires continuously
yeah there's really simple there's a few
levels on that yeah
what the tempest exact well now that
last that's just a remix that the friend
of ours has done but we've got various
people contributing music but I don't
know he'll owns the rights to Tepes 2000
using Council obviously there are people
over rights to at are you have the rice
to tempest but tempest 2000 where did
that go yeah I mean vaccine it's been
cleared by Jimmy quarter which we've got
in touch with I said you know do you
mind if we use that he said no he said
here so it's no couple over anything
from the power go ahead music yeah yeah
you will need to read that wiki page
there yeah yeah yeah they did
ok that foreign masters
yeah well over the experts and also of
the thing is if you do xbox 360
development the bicycle pc version
pretty much falls out anyway so you he's
got about the nintendo wii controllers
like many ideas yeah i would like to
work on the way when i was impressed
question finding time with i'd also
persuading intended to give us a Kip I
think we can do that
Obama
Oh
they they state that they still owe me a
packet of business in three Benson scrap
paper yet either as I god I don't I'm
there anything walking the guys I would
I hope they do do except get
tremendously funny yeah that's my
favorite gift yeah bless it
yeah Albin it's basically it's a shame
that the new on I came to market about a
year to like think earth in a year I
think one of them is a difference but
yeah how it's still a very good things
you fire but it sounds being a game
machine I mean thing is unless you want
to write anything more than very simple
games it really had to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
