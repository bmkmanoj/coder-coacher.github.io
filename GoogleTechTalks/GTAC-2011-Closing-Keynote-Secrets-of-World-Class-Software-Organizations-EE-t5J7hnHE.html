or five months ago we decided everyone
wanted to get somebody famous and so we
sent out an email to Googlers and they
said we asked them who you want you know
who would be your dream list of
candidates and we only got like four or
five I mean the the you know it's like
cream of the cream of the crop and then
when we got the list right how are we
gonna get any of these people here we
got one and he's written five books but
I've written five books so so if I'm the
I if I've been accused of being the
Octomom of software testing books then
Steve McConnell is the Octodad of
software development books now all five
of my books have sold well he has one
book code complete that's outsold all
five of mine combined I used this book
as a professor to teach software
development to my students I learned how
you know some of the most amazing
amazingly simple language to teach
people how to code comes from code
complete it's it's a fantastic book and
so on the same part
I don't appear on anyone's top ten list
they had a survey of the readers of
software development magazine who are
the most influential people in software
and there were names like Linus Torvalds
Bill Gates and Steve McConnell so Steve
welcome to GTA
thank you James well I'm not sure how to
what to make of James standard of
somebody's famous but I guess I'll take
what I can get I thought I would start
since this is the actually the first
time I've talked at a Google event by
describing my own personal brush with
someone famous and it's also how I heard
about Google in the first place I was
teaching a class in 1998 I think in
Atlanta or the Atlanta area and I had a
very nice older lady in one of my
classes and we sat down had lunch
together and she was interesting to me
because a she was an older woman who had
a PhD in computer science and B she had
a son who is a computer programmer and
she was one of the first people I met
who actually had a kid that was a
second-generation computer programmer
and she was very proud of her son and
she was very proud of the company he had
started and it turned out that her son
was Larry Page and the company that he
started was Google and so that's how I
heard about Google back in 1998 or so
and I guess it's nice to have a mom
who's out there selling for you and so
anyway yeah that's another good point
thank you so our topic today is secrets
of world-class software development and
it looks like James gave me a clicker
here so let's see how that works I don't
know okay so I think depending on who
you ask you might get several different
ideas about what makes a world-class
software organization if you ask Larry
page's mom she might say a world-class
software organization is an organization
that spells its name goog le and that's
not actually Larry page's mom by the way
at least not as far as I know and and if
you asked capers Jones estimation and
measurement guru in the software world
what makes something world-class he
would say something like well it depends
on Baldrige award winners and getting to
going through Six Sigma and having
defect rate per thousand lines of code
is less than X or some kind of answer
like that if you were to ask somebody
like what um free he might have said
well we think it's an organization
that's operating at CMM level five and
has highly controlled and repeatable
processes and is optimizing and so on if
you were to ask the guys who put
together the agile manifesto they might
say well it's a team that is remaining
very flexible to changes in requirements
and constantly responding to changes in
the business environment and being very
flexible and adaptable and so on those
are none of those are my definition when
I think about my definition of
world-class I ask a couple of questions
and one of those questions is can you
have a world-class software organization
inside a mediocre business that's
interesting question I think if you have
a mediocre business is it possible that
that somehow contains a world-class
software organization and James just
spoken in event I hosted earlier this
week which was the 2011 software
executive summit back in 2004 we held
our first I think first or second
software executive summit and we had a
famous well-known software guru at in a
panel discussion and we had a bunch of
executives in the audience and this guru
James can I trouble you to get my bottle
of water from the back thank you so much
and so this guru somebody made the point
about well we were describing some kind
of project and his crew went through and
described the project and described what
great technical work it had done and
what great architectural work they had
done and how it was delivered with very
high quality and he said and and he sort
of concluded thank you so much he sort
of concluded by saying well and somebody
said well how did the product do and he
said well it was one of those cases
where he had a great technical success
but a business failure and I think
practically every single executive in
the audience almost jumped out of their
chairs at the same time and said no
there is no such thing as a great
technical sick
yes and a business failure if the reason
is that it failed in the marketplace due
to not actually adequately understanding
the needs of the market and they
basically were saying we think at the
executive level technical success
includes taking ownership of product
viability and you have to take ownership
of that success in the marketplace it
was very interesting to me not just in
the nature of the reaction but in the
extent of the reaction because
practically every single person reacted
the same way so I don't think you can
have a world-class software organization
inside a mediocre business I think you
can have a mediocre software
organization at best and then there's
the related question can you have a
mediocre software organization inside a
world-class business and of course this
was the accusation that was leveled at
Microsoft for many years where many
people would say Oh Bill Gates he's kind
of mediocre technically but he's a
business genius and I would disagree
with that characterization fairly
strongly I think that just like you
can't have a world-class software
organization inside a mediocre business
you can't really have a mediocre
software organization inside a
world-class business because it's simply
not going to be adequate to support the
needs of that world-class business if it
is truly all things considered mediocre
and so my view of world-class is may be
a little different than some people
might think but my view of world-class
is a software organization that
effectively supports business objectives
of a successful business so effectively
supports the business objectives of a
successful business and so now let's
let's drill into that a little bit I
think that this means providing software
that is on-time on-budget with desired
functionality at the defined quality
level and in a sustainable way
I think there's some overlap here with
various things I've written over the
years about 10x software engineering
where we've got lots of research that's
found that different developers will
vary by a factor of 10 in all kinds of
dimensions productivity number of
defects they insert into the software a
number of the rate at which they remove
defects from the software and so on and
so on and researchers have also
ten x differences between different
organizations that are working on
similar kinds of products in both
productivity and quality so there's some
overlap with that now before I get into
telling you what I think are the
attributes of world-class software
organizations let me give you some
background on on where my ideas come
from one one a bit of background is that
my company engages there we go and I on
a consulting basis with at least dozens
of companies every year so we've formed
some opinions over the years about what
makes some organizations more effective
and some less we visit hundreds of
companies a year on a training basis and
so we form some additional opinions that
way we host events like the executive
summit that I hosted earlier this week
where we have in-depth discussions with
executives from literally around the
world and we get some ideas that way we
also participate pretty broadly in
industry organizations like the I Triple
E object Management Group local software
Improvement network and so on and then
we have also conducted research we've
done surveys of our own we've led
discussion groups and focus groups
online forum discussions and of course
we read what other people write as well
so there are a lot of different sources
of data feeding into this we've worked
with lots of clients and lots of
companies across really the full
spectrum of industries and I think
that's given us a pretty interesting
perspective I think most people tend to
work all in aerospace or all in all in
e-commerce are all in shrink-wrap are
all in embedded medical devices and we
get to see all of that stuff and that
gives us an interesting perspective on
what the full range of different kinds
of software and different practices
include now of those companies that
we've worked with how many of those can
we actually talk about well you know
guess what like a you would assume if we
worked with you
were covered by non-disclosure
agreements in the vast majority of cases
and even in the rest of the cases I
don't think it would be appropriate for
me to share details that we learned
through a confidential engagement so the
rest of what I'm going to talk about
definitely draws from our up close and
personal look at
all of these companies but the details
I'm going to give you our details that
have been presented in public forums or
published in articles or books or that
kind of thing so the color commentary
here is not not a secret so let's take a
look at a sample of world-class software
organizations and this was really just
intended to give you a flavor of
organizations that we've seen over the
years that I think really represent that
model of software development that is
fully and effectively supporting a
successful business the first one that
I'm going to present everyone hold back
a little bit is Microsoft and Note circa
1990 so this is the time frame that I
was on campus at Microsoft and I'm not
gonna make any claims one way or the
other about where Microsoft might be
today but back in 1990 I think very
clearly Microsoft was truly a
world-class software organization that
knock about Bill Gates being technically
mediocre but a business genius I think
absolutely not true Bill was the most
highly respected technical guy in the
organization it was very common joke in
the organization that Bill knew more
about your job than you did there were
many stories floating around the
organization about somebody who was an
architect level person and they'd been
working on something for months and they
went to a barbecue and they happened to
bump into Bill Gates and started talking
to Bill about their work and Bill asked
a series of probing questions that
resulted in them having to go back and
completely redesign three months worth
of work lots of stories like that so
super sharp guy I think most people
outside Microsoft never really
understood just how well-respected bill
was technically in that organization so
here are some of the attributes that I
think were significant one extremely
selective hiring at in that timeframe
Microsoft was mostly hiring people who
are fresh out of school they were
recruiting at Stanford MIT Waterloo at
University of Washington that was about
it other than that there were certain
people hired from other places but the
main recruiting emphasis was highly
selective another thing that was really
interesting and that was quite
disconcerting when I first got there was
a
level of completely unvarnished in some
respects uncivil bare-knuckle
discussions where people stayed
ruthlessly focused on the technical
merits of the discussion with absolutely
no consideration for anyone's human
feelings and I got I got the impression
some of the times when I was watching
these guys when I first got there for
the first first few months I'd watch
these guys go out in these meetings and
I'd think these guys hate each other I
think they're actually gonna hurt each
other and then it would somebody would
say hey look it's 12 it's time to go to
lunch and these two guys go oh yeah
where we gonna go for lunch okay and
it's like those foghorn leghorn cartoons
where the dog and the chicken chased
each other around all the time and then
the whistle goes off and they just sit
down and have their lunch together it
felt exactly like that so very strong
focus on on the technical work Microsoft
also had this really well-defined and
highly disciplined stage-gate process no
I'm just kidding they didn't have that
at all they had a total cowboy culture
and there was nothing even remotely
resembling a disciplined process at
least as far as the software development
practices were concerned and then there
was this very interesting cultural
dynamic where if you were in a meeting
and a technical meeting and people were
talking about should we go down paths a
or should we go down path B and you were
arguing about the technical merits of
these two paths there would often come a
time where somebody would say hey look
and typically the argument would be well
path B is expedient will get us there
sooner but path a is really the better
path technically and will be give us a
longer lived codebase and so on give us
more reliability and so on there would
be a point in that discussion where
somebody would say hey listen we've got
to do the right thing here and that
phrase had almost a magical power at
that time at Microsoft where if somebody
said somebody invoked to the concept of
do the right thing
people would sit back in their chairs
and it really did cause people to say
okay what is really important here and
at that time it was pursuing the the
path that was the best path technique
so some pretty interesting cultural
aspects Chris Peters made this very
interesting comment in the context of
Excel 3.0 excel 3.0 was widely regarded
at the time as the most successful
project that had been done in the
history of the company it shipped 11
days late on a one-year schedule and
Chris Peters went around in lectured
various groups at Microsoft they made a
video tape and lots of people watch the
videotape of the lecture and he pointed
out the goal is not to write code if we
could ship products and make all this
money without writing any code we would
your job is to ship products exactly on
time it doesn't matter whether you're a
developer tester program manager product
manager or whatever everybody's job is
the same and the emphasis here is
interesting because what they're saying
is the job here is not to create cool
technical stuff the job here is that we
are running a business and the business
is shipping products and shortly after
this Microsoft engaged in a quite an
explicit cultural reengineering program
because there was this thread of people
kind of getting just going down rat
holes on interesting technical
challenges but not actually doing things
that generated revenue and so they
launched this program where they gave
people these enormous shipit awards
they're these clear lucite things that
are about this big they way I don't know
10 or 15 pounds they're massive awards I
mean you could fear in an earthquake and
this thing falls off the top shelf you
want to get out of the way because it is
a danger but but Microsoft was very
clearly trying to communicate a message
that we are in the business of software
and we stay in business by focusing on
the business and shipping product I
think they did some other things well
too in the company that I had worked at
immediately prior to Microsoft it was a
very typical sort of bureaucratic
bean-counting company and literally if I
needed a pad of post-it notes I had to
go up to the tenth floor and I had to go
to a person who was standing in a locked
cage and I had to say I need a pad of
post-it notes and I had to give them my
my Department number for for accounting
purposes and then they would give me the
pad of post-it notes
and I would have to sign for the pad of
post-it notes and and so when I went to
Microsoft they just had post-it notes I
was amazed they had I mean this is all
routine now right you could go into a
the break area and they would have
post-it notes and pens and at the time
floppy diskettes and backup tapes and
staplers and everything else you could
possibly need to do your job and they'd
also had sweated some operational
details that I thought were amazing
again at the time if I needed a
whiteboard in my office I didn't have to
fill out a form
I sent email and they would to
operations and they'd send me a note
back that said put a post-it note on the
wall where you want the whiteboard I
thought wow I even have post-it notes to
do that and so I put the post-it note on
the wall and the next day when I came to
work there would be a whiteboard there
and same thing if I my computer went
down they would come in they would take
my hard disk out of the computer they
would stick it in a new computer that
they had just brought and then they'd
take my computer away never see it again
but my downtime I mean my other jobs if
I had a computer go down it could be
days or weeks until I got my computer
fix but there it was basically a matter
of 20 minutes or something like that and
the key thing here is the amazing
laser-like focus on making sure that the
people who are doing the work are
supported in such a way that they can
keep doing the work and that was a new
experience for me then another thing I
thought was interesting there was a
story that was floating around in
widespread distribution where people
would where the story went like this the
story said there is this case on the
product where there was a senior
technical lead and the senior technical
lead wanted to take the product this
direction and there was a marketing VP
and this marketing VP really really
disagreed and wanted the product to go a
different direction and the two of them
had a big argument and neither of them
could agree and the marketing VP ended
up getting fired and that was this story
and the thing that's interesting about
that is I never heard any names I heard
that story from at least five different
sources I never heard any names attached
to this story but culturally there was
very clearly a message being sent that
if you're a technical person you need to
stand up and do what you think is right
and the company will back you up and if
necessary fire the marketing VP but the
general idea being that you know if
you're a technical person you will be
backed up if you do what you really
think is right the work ethic was I
think extraordinary I remember one time
it was Friday night I was getting ready
to go home some people came by and said
hey you want to go to a movie and so I'm
like okay sure so we left about five or
six and we went out and we got a
hamburger somewhere and then we went to
a movie and when the movie was over we
all went back to work because what else
are you gonna do on a Friday night at
10:00 of course you're gonna go back to
work and that's what the culture was
like then I had a co-worker whose mother
was very concerned because on Christmas
day she called her at home she wasn't
there she called her at her boyfriend's
house she wasn't there she called her at
work and there she was where else would
she be on Christmas Day she had work to
do there's a story that I can't remember
if I've actually put this in print or if
it's been reported anywhere else but I
think is interesting back when Microsoft
and IBM were collaborating on os/2 and
why do you probably don't remember that
but it was an operating system and the
joke was half an operating system OS / 2
+ and so IBM was doing part of the
project and Microsoft was doing part of
the project and Microsoft really wanted
to deliver as close to on time as it
could and Steve Ballmer was not the head
of the company at that time he was head
of a business unit and he went in and
said to the os/2 guys what do you need
what do you need in order to make this
thing ship on time and the team didn't
want a big reward they didn't want the
promise of a big bonus they didn't need
you know on-site masseuses or anything
like that what the team said is you know
the one thing that would really help is
if we could get a washer and dryer
installed in our building then we
wouldn't have to go home to do our
laundry and that would really help us
get a lot more work done and I think
that's an amazing level of buy-in isn't
it if you can get your team so that the
only thing they asked for is a washer
and dryer so they can stay at work
longer
it's extraordinary level of commitment
to the project and that's the level of
commitment that they had now let's take
a look at a second company that I think
is is clearly also world-class by my
definition and that is that is Google
for this audience I probably don't need
to belabor the details too much but
we've got amazing amenities like the
on-site chef and haircuts and laundry
service and car washes and mechanics and
your own buses because God knows you
never want to mix with the regular
people that are on the regular buses and
and then we have and I think they're in
a lot of ways I see Google as Microsoft
2.0 and I think you know looking at it
from the outside to me that kind of
looks like it's by design it looks to me
like Google has studied the Microsoft
playbook pretty well we have very
selective hiring same as Microsoft in
1990 we have this 20% think time which
you know I'm not quite sure exactly how
that plays out I hear different stories
about how that actually plays out on the
ground but here are some stories that it
plays out at least at times pretty well
I think you know again from reports I
hear same kind of what I would
characterize as cowboy culture not a lot
of attention to process but you know
there are some people I think who are
working that issue a little bit and and
then we have this fascinating comment
from Eric Schmidt isn't this fascinating
the goal is to strip away everything
that gets in our employees wait we
provide a standard package of fringe
benefits but on top of that or
first-class dining facilities gyms
laundry rooms massage rooms etc just
about anything a hard-working employee
might want let's face it programmers
want to program they don't want to do
their laundry and so like I said I think
Google has taken some plays out of
Microsoft's playbook so let's take a
break for a minute we've been talking
about two companies Microsoft 20 years
ago Google today what factors really
matter when we when I make the comment
Microsoft a kind of a cowboy culture
Google's not paying a lot of attention
to process what factors really matter
well as some of you know I've been
fixated on software estimation for quite
a
long time and so I tend to see a lot of
the world through estimation colored
glasses if you will and the best-known
estimating model is a Kokomo model berry
being initiated this model a very long
time ago in the mid 1970s and and it's
been updated often since then in the
Kokomo model there are 22 factors that
are seen as having influence on software
project outcomes and the length of these
bars on this graph represents the
magnitude of the possible influence that
each of these factors has on project
outcomes so at the very top we've got
product complexity having the highest
individual possible outcome I don't know
if you can make out that number at the
top but it's a two point three eight and
what that says according to the Kokomo
model is that if you have a product with
highest complexity that will take two
point three eight times as much total
effort as a product with the lowest
complexity all other factors being equal
including size and lines of code so this
is just a measure of how intricate
complex Lakota is not how much there is
but how intricate it is and we go
through some other factors now what's
interesting about this is of the 22
factors 17 of them don't vary on a
percentage basis depending on the size
of the project there's static so if I've
got a 10,000 line line of code project
product complexity can vary by 2.38 if
I've got a 10 million line of code
project then product complexity still
varies by 2.38
but the five factors that are shown in
darker or into red those factors in the
Kokomo model which has been developed
through quite extensive data analysis
those factors are seen as varying with
project size and so at a large size
project like this five million lines of
code we've got factors like process
maturity that actually have a big
influence on project outcome we've got
architecture and risk resolution as a
big outcome precedent us has a big
outcome and so on but look what happens
when we go to a smaller size project
once we go to a smaller size project a
hundred thousand lines of code and
that's still a pretty good sized project
that's not
tiny project by any means now we have
all of these factors like process
maturity architecture and risk
resolution and team cohesion and so on
are in the bottom half of the list in
terms of their degree of influence and
the big takeaway from this is if you
look at how these factors vary at
different sizes is if you're in a
start-up mode or even if you're in your
first maybe ten years an awful lot of
your projects are gonna be more in this
size range but as you get into a more
mature business the nature of how this
works is the longer companies stay in
business the longer they accumulate code
against the same code bases and the
bigger their code bases get I met
earlier today with a company that is not
that old and their code base is 45
million lines of code for one product so
you know really big product and and the
thing is the factors that you have to
care about when you're big versus the
factors that you have to care about when
you're small are different and so you
know if I'm Microsoft or in the early
days or Amazon in the early days or
Google in the early days why should I
care about process it's a second-tier
factor but as I become more mature and
have bigger code bases I have to start
caring about it because it has more
influence over over my project now the
other thing that's interesting is a lot
of these factors you have no control
over they're handed to you by the nature
of the business you're in product
complexity is largely determined by the
the area that you're working in if
you're working on safety-critical
embedded systems you're gonna have a
high degree of complexity and you can't
really get away from that if you're
working on online business systems
you're gonna have a much lower degree of
complexity and that's a benefit that you
can leverage there a very small number
of factors that individual organ is a
that individual project teams typically
have any direct control over and those
are shown as in the red bars on this
graph and then most of the rest of the
factors are controllable only at the
organizational level so that means you
typically have to have somebody above
the programmer or even above the manager
level to make much of a difference in
those factors all right so let's
continue with our sample of world-class
software organization
mm-hmm this is a company that's a
Canadian company and they had invited me
to come up this is quite a while back
that was when my book software project
Survival Guide was fairly newly out and
they'd invited me to come up and do a
workshop for their managers and before I
went up I said is there anything in
particular that you'd like me to focus
on and they said you know if you could
help us get a handle on our estimation
challenges that would really probably be
the best thing you can do for us because
that's enough that we've just had a
really hard time cracking and if you can
help us make progress there that would
be a big win for us so as we as I worked
through the class I was trying to figure
out well what you know what is the
source of these estimation challenges
and I thought at first well maybe it's a
bad estimation then that's kind of one
of the obvious ones and turned out that
a fairly elaborate estimation process
one of the more elaborate processes I'd
ever seen actually I thought well maybe
they're not really calibrating they're
estimating models very well but actually
it turned out they had 30 years of
historical data they had collected
historical data on every project they'd
ever done so that wasn't the issue and I
thought well ok well maybe they just
don't have really effective plans maybe
their plans are really unrealistic and
it turned out no they actually put their
project managers through extensive
training on project planning
they actually tracked progress according
to plan they had a very disciplined
approach of revising the plans if the
project was getting too far away from
the plans so that wasn't it so I thought
well maybe it has something to do with
quality maybe they're putting a lot of
defects in and they're not like
detecting him until toward the end of
the project and I we asked talked about
that and it turned out they're actually
extremely disciplined they were tracking
they were doing full formal inspections
they were tracking defect phase escape
rates from one activity to the next and
I finally got to a point where I said
you know as far as I can tell you guys
actually are one of the better run
organizations I've ever seen just how
bad are your software estimation
problems anyway and they said well we're
probably being a little hard on
ourselves because we do deliver 97% of
our projects on time and on budget but
we
but we really can't figure out how to
get that last 3% and so that actually
was one of the first data points in what
I came to see as a long-standing pattern
which is a lot of the most effective
organizations are also the most
self-critical and we have seen that
pattern quite a few times since then and
the opposite of that is also true we
have also seen organizations I this is
not one of the best companies it's not a
peer for a reason I gave the same
presentation to another company and I
gave it two days in a row I gave it
first in one location and I got the
feedback form as I looked at the
feedback and and most of the feedback
was we already know this stuff this is
old it's not you know we don't need to
do this stuff we're past that I went and
showed it to the VP who had brought me
and I said you know are we really sure
we're on the right targeting the right
class here because the feedback says
we're not even you know we're not really
hitting the mark and he says you know
that's one of the problems we've got
here these guys are nowhere near as good
as they think they are let me show you
this graph and so he pulled up a graph
that showed me their actual versus
estimated performance and he had a data
set of 80 projects and out of those 80
projects they had one that was on time
and so that sort of overconfidence we've
also seen as a pattern where the
organizations that are the least
self-critical are also often the least
effective and so we've seen both sides
of that pattern all right interlude
number two what factors really matter
there's a book that describes an
approach that I really like called
discipline of market leaders and what
this book says is that there are three
value dimensions that companies can
possibly focus on one of them is
operations and operations basically says
we're just going to be as efficient as
we possibly can we're going to look for
fat in our process we're gonna try to
make our processes operate as
efficiently and as streamlined away as
we possibly can and that's one possible
route to excellence a second value
dimension is product leadership and in
product leadership what we're typically
focusing on and at least in our industry
is
innovation so we can focus on developing
the most innovative products possible
being the state-of-the-art leading the
industry that kind of thing and then the
third value to mention is customer
intimacy and so in customer and I see we
just under focus on understanding our
customers better than anybody else could
possibly understand them and so we might
not be that great technically we might
be inefficient operationally but we meet
our customer needs so well that we still
can be an industry-leading company and
the the idea behind this is companies
can typically excel in only one of these
three dimensions they can suffice in two
of them but they really only ever excel
in one of them and so thinking about
your organization which one do you
really excel in and for a lot of
technology companies it's going to be
the middle one the product leadership or
the innovation but there are exceptions
I mean into it as an interesting example
for many years into its claim to fame
really was knowing the customer better
than any other company in the industry
did and that when I was starting my
career
25 years ago Intuit had this famous
program of follow the customer home
they'd literally be at the software
store which we had back then and they
would watch the person buy the software
and they would follow the person home
and watch them install the software on
their computer and watch them start
trying to use it and it's extraordinary
level of customer intimacy which is a
little bit rare for a tech company I
think but but just to show you that it
can be done in a technical environment
so this is something to file away thing
in the back of your mind and say well
which which in dimensions does my
company really focus on and what
dimension might I think we should we
should try to excel in all right so with
that as background NASA software
engineering lab would be the next
organization I would nominate as being a
world-class software organization this
is an interesting organization because
it is extraordinarily quantitatively
focused they collect data on everything
they analyze data to the enth degree
they package the data up they put it in
manuals and estimating models and defect
production models and all kinds of stuff
like that
and so they're extraordinary
quantitatively in mathematically
oriented but they published a list of
their top do's and don'ts and
interestingly enough their top do's
include in this highly quantitative
organization do empower project
personnel doesn't sound that
quantitative does it do minimize
bureaucracy sounds kind of like the
opposite of what you might think with
somebody who's extraordinarily processed
focused they were the first organization
to win the I Triple E suffer processed
achievement award and they're saying
minimize bureaucracy do take periodic
snapshots of project health and reap
plan when necessary
so no pathological commitment to a plan
or the process and emphasis on doing
what works do foster a team spirit
that's pretty touchy-feely and do start
the project with a small senior staff
and it's fascinating to me that for this
incredibly process oriented
quantitatively oriented organization
that their top list of do's have more to
do with the people on the team than they
do with any sort of quantitative method
Boeing is another company that I'd like
to touch on for a moment
I think Boeing is a vast organization
and I don't really believe that every
part of Boeing would would qualify as
world-class necessarily but they really
are extremely quantitative and in some
cases they have been extraordinarily
effective when they were developing the
777 project for example they had a
five-year schedule for the avionics
software for the airplane and eighteen
months into their five-year schedule
they were tracking their progress
carefully and they identified that if
they continued on that course they were
going to over run by about 5% so that's
kind of interesting itself isn't it 18
months in they've identified a 5%
variance from plan and so at that point
they added some staff which when you're
eighteen months into a five-year project
you can still safely view and they cut a
little bit of functionality and they
ended up delivering their project this
off the avionics software which is
safety critical and several million
lines of code on time at the end of five
years and you know it's interesting
about that to me
I think some people's reaction would be
well yeah of course if you take
corrective action 18 months into a
five-year project of course you're gonna
deliver on time and yet how many
projects have we seen that didn't take
corrective action and managed somehow to
overrun that long schedule by another
year or two or three or four we've seen
lots of companies that do that and so I
think that's a pretty extraordinary
accomplishment similarly to Microsoft
during the time I spent at Boeing they
had a magic phrase in their organization
- it wasn't do the right thing it was
this phrase here if we can't find the
time to do it right where are we gonna
find the time to do it over and just
like invoking that phrase at Microsoft
in the Boeing context when somebody
wanted to take a shortcut that was
expedient in the short term but that was
going to undermine quality or or
undermine progress before the end of the
project someone would invoke this phrase
and people would sort of sit back in
their chairs and cause him to stop and
think and I thought it was very very
powerful organizationally the last
specific company that I want to
highlight for you is Symantec and I
think this is an interesting example
I think the fortunes of this company
kind of abdun flowed but I think they've
got some some very at times anyway have
had some extremely innovative practices
one practice that I find fascinating in
this company is what they call
uncommitted features of opportunity or
UFO's and the idea here is that if I'm a
developer and I finish my work my
assigned work early then as a reward for
finishing my assigned work early I get
to go pick one of these uncommitted
features of opportunity off the list and
I get to implement that on top of the
work that I already signed up to do and
it's kind of interesting isn't it and
there's so my reward for finishing my
work early is to get to do more work but
there's a great deal of organizational
cachet that goes into actually having
delivered one or more of these
uncommitted features of opportunities so
it's cool to actually have gotten done
with your work early and delivered a UFO
and I think the cultural message there
is interesting right the cultural
message is if you do your work well you
get acknowledged for being somebody
who's a high performer this organization
is in one at least one respect one of
the most interesting has one of the most
interesting accountability policies that
we've seen we've seen this in only two
companies but in their change control
process if the sales or marketing group
comes in after the requirements have
been established and wanted to make a
change then we all are used to maybe
seeing on the development side we'll say
okay if we do that that's gonna increase
our schedule by a week or whatever but
in this case they require the marketing
and sales organization to increase their
sales quotas in support of the change as
well so they're saying if you want us to
make a change that has a cost of
scheduled impact then you've got to sign
up for increase in your sales
projections because if you don't think
there's an increase sales potential then
why are we even talking about this we've
only seen two companies in the last 15
years that actually have that level of
discipline around there the business
side of the change control process I
think they have a very interesting
business focus one of their promotion
criteria is as they promote technical
staff the part of the criteria for
promoting technical staff is they
promote people who have a portfolio of
product wins it's not project wins it's
not technical wins its product wins and
that's the criteria for promoting
technical staff and I think in essence
what they're saying is you know at the
end of the day we are a business and the
technical work exists to support the
business and we're not quite sure what
the secret sauce is in this person's
work that leads to creating successful
products but when we look at their
portfolio of product wins
whatever that secret sauce is we want
more of it and we want it to have more
influence on our organization so we're
going to promote those people that have
a portfolio of product wins and and and
give them more influence over our
organization and one one person that we
know in that organization referred to
Symantec as a
class seat-of-the-pants organization I
think that's a great characterization
they're not trying to become excessively
formal or bureaucratic they are just
trying to to fine tune their own
processes for their own purposes as much
as they possibly can
so I think we're at a point where we can
actually draw some conclusions and you
might you might think back and we've
talked about Google we've talked about
Microsoft we've talked about Boeing
we've talked about MDA I've talked about
NASA and finally we used some examples
from Symantec what could these
organizations possibly have in common
well I actually think they have a lot in
common if we take a step back one is I
think there's an emphasis on top talent
now the top talent gets to find
different ways in different places if
I'm NASA I'm probably not hiring from
the same talent pool as Google but one
way or the other I'm gonna try to hire
the top talent that I can I think
there's an emphasis on support for top
talent whether it's the lavish perks
that Google provides in in present day
or whether it was what was seen as
lavish support for developers in the
Microsoft era I think we see in at least
an attempt to provide as much support as
we can now for a large governmental
bureaucracy like NASA there gonna be
some limits on how much we can do that
but you know there the support might be
just more in terms of you know letting
people work on this amazingly cool stuff
not everybody gets to work on a software
that sends rocket ships to Mars or that
kind of thing so you know there are some
offsetting benefits I think a strong
sense of mission you know when you're
working for NASA and you get to send a
satellite to Mars I can see how you
create a strong sense of mission I mean
that's pretty cool right are you steady
working on the software for the space
shuttle and you're meeting the
astronauts whose lives depend on your
software there's a sense of mission that
comes with that automatically but you
know when you're working for Microsoft
and you're working on the next
generation word processor it's really a
pretty amazing accomplishment that
Microsoft or any comparable company can
get people to feel incredibly invested
and making the fonts look cooler on the
screen or that kind of thing and and I
think in the software world we have if
you take a step back and you say you
know what is our track record on getting
people bought into having a really high
sense of mission and then what are we
actually working on I think we've got
some amazing success stories in software
for getting an extraordinary degree of
buy-in to things that are not you know
next-generation medical devices or
sending somebody to the moon but that
you know from some point of view might
be somewhat mundane and yet we extract
an extraordinary level of buy-in and a
sense of mission and I think that's true
across all of these organizations I
think we have a high degree of alignment
with the mission it's not good enough to
say we have a high strong sense of
mission if people are actually working
off at an angle to the mission you've
got to get all the vectors lined up and
the organizations that have done well I
think do a good job of aligning people's
personal interests with the interests of
the business the the very first
consulting assignment I did after
founding constructs more than 15 years
ago was one where I got hired by a
company in Vancouver and I got hired by
the I was mainly talking to the CEO and
owner of the company he said you know
I'm just really concerned I've got we're
working on this sort of movie special
effects software and I just don't think
my guys are I don't think their body and
I don't think they're really working
toward the deadline I give him deadlines
I just don't think they're really you
know very committed and in my mind which
at the time was still much more of a
developer mind than a business guy mind
my mind was saying oh jeez this is a
typical executive who's trying to apply
schedule pressure to his developers and
trying to hold their feet to the fire
this guy sounds like a jerk but I was
trying to get my company established so
I said okay fine we'll come up and take
a look so we went up and we interviewed
a bunch of the staff members and we
talked to the president owner of the
company and we talked to their lead
architect we talked to some of the
testers we talked to some of the
developers and we found out that he was
a hundred percent correct the software
they were working on was amazingly cool
it had all these great
graphics and they were doing literally
doing movie special effects and so they
did not care at all when the software
shipped all they cared about was you
know getting that one particular visual
effect to look exactly right and he was
right on there was just absolutely they
could have cared less what the schedule
was and so the more successful companies
I think do a much better job of getting
alignment with the mission like and take
some pretty explicit steps like
Microsoft did with the ship at award and
that kind of thing I think there's real
business accountability whether it's
Chris Peters telling people your job is
to ship products or whether it's
Symantec giving promotions for a
portfolio of product wins there is a
focus on accountability to the business
there is a commitment to quality clearly
if you are Boeing working on avionics
software your definition of quality is
going to be different than if you're in
Google and you're working on search
engine results but however quality needs
to be defined for the kind of software
where you're working on it there's going
to be a commitment to quality in a
world-class organization
I think frequent introspection is also a
common denominator the best companies
are pretty self-critical when they make
a mistake they look at it as a learning
opportunity and I think another thing is
interesting is that so-called standard
practices become highly adapted to the
local environment when I started working
as a consultant 15 years ago I had more
of an idea that here's the template this
is the right way to do it and then we'll
just see how much companies vary from
that template what we've learned over
time is that the companies that are
doing the best just break the template
because they have taken the ideas that
are in some sense standard practices and
they have refined them and refined them
and refined them in ways that work well
in the context of their organizations
but often in ways that are completely
non transferable to other organizations
because they're so highly adapted to the
local needs of the organization and
finally I think the best organizations
end up attaining a high degree of staff
commitment but this is something that I
think a lot of people miss the staff
commitment is not a cause it is in
effect the staff commitment is what you
get by doing a great job on all the
other areas getting a high degree of
buy-in creating a sense of mission
supporting the staff the best you can
and so on the result of all that is that
at Microsoft in 1990 people would come
back to work on Friday night after going
to the movies but that's not because
anybody's asking for it it's because
that's what people want to do as a
result of doing a great job on all these
other things I think one of the more
pathological patterns that we see is
organizations that think the staff
commitment comes first and they try to
force that and they ignore these other
factors and then they end up getting
neither they don't get the world-class
that contribution and they don't get the
the staff commitment either because
people just resent being asked to work
that much so that's my list of
attributes of world-class software
organizations and at this point I would
open the floor to comments or questions
hi thanks for your talk my question is
around staff motivation so you've got
you know a high class you know
well-trained engineer and he's really
good or she's really good at writing
cool software and what they really want
is to be rewarded for writing cool
software and what I'm hearing from you
is what a business really wants is
engineers who write who develop good
product and they actually need business
skills to be able to do that and I think
what you find is a lot of Engineers who
are like well I don't sure my project is
going anywhere I'm not sure it's a
really good idea I'm doing cool stuff
but I don't know that it's going to have
impact on the business and I don't know
how to impact that so what do you do for
these engineers who are lacking in
business skills and feeling like they
are lacking the ability to impact that
change yeah
well that is that's a great question and
it's a question that every business
should be asking and it's a question
that most businesses don't ask nearly
enough I can give you a simple answer
that will get you 80% of the way toward
the 80% of the way toward the solution
and the other 20% is really hard I think
it requires a lot more a lot more
complicated discussion but the simple
answer that we've seen and if I were to
publish rapid development today I would
include a chapter on this as a best
practice it's a short chapter because
it's not a complicated idea but it's
basically make sure that your technical
staff goes out and observes real
customers real users using the software
in a real environment and I can't tell
you how many upper level executives I've
talked to over the last five to ten
years that have reported numerous
variations on the theme of I had a team
who didn't seem to get the business
needs and they just didn't understand
what we're doing and then we took him
out and we spent a couple days or a week
at the customer site and the whole team
came back as incredible evangelist for
the needs of the customer and now we had
these meetings where they were talking
to the business analysts and the
business analysts are saying well we
should do this in the
was saying no no the customers do it
this way and so I think you get 80% of
the 80% of the answer that question just
by getting your team in contact with
real customers and depending on the
nature of your organization some
companies are nervous about exposing
their unwashed masses of developers to
their customers because they're worried
that they're literally unwashed masses
of developers and you have to find a way
to get past that because I think it's a
proxy for so many other things and some
companies will I think take a half step
that's not bad but it is a half step of
having their custom their developers or
technical staff take product support
calls I think that's ok as far as it
goes but I don't think it's anywhere
near as good as actually getting because
the developers out there seeing how the
customers are using the software I mean
hearing on the phones one thing but
you're looking at somebody get
frustrated and you know in trying to do
something that you thought was cool but
that you see somebody use it there's
like a little you know thing that goes
on the screen that adds a half a second
and you're like wow it's so cool when I
programmed it and then you see how
frustrated people get when it delays
what they're trying to do by half second
every time they try to do it you know
that kind of stuff is invaluable so that
would be my my 80% answer yep
you've talked about Google and Microsoft
20 years ago and some other examples of
world-class software and organizations
but what I wanted to know is what are
the signs of decaying of this
world-class organization yeah what are
the first signs well if I was Google
that would be the question I was at I
would ask and I actually was thinking
about that because I was hoping that
question would come up I think you know
if I look at Microsoft and I've lived
five years from Microsoft for the last
25 years
okay I've lived within five miles of
Microsoft for 25 years now so you know a
lot of what I'm telling you nearly all
of what I'm telling you is stuff that's
been printed in our local newspaper or
stuff I've heard at Starbucks or whatnot
so let me answer your question by saying
what I think are the major factors that
have contributed to where Microsoft is
today versus what I think was truly
world-class 20 years ago number one
don't get sued by the Justice Department
for antitrust right this whole this
whole motto of don't be evil you should
really take that seriously and I think
there are some cases where Google could
you know maybe take a harder look at
that and the position of being the
Challenger versus the position of being
on top of the industry the same behavior
that's fine as the Challenger is not
fine when you're on top of the industry
so you know I think that's a big one I
think that took a big bite out of
Microsoft's morale number two I think
here's something you can't do anything
about but aging workforce when I was on
campus at Microsoft the average age not
the median but the mean was 27 all right
1990 the median age was 27 it was
increasing 0.8 years per calendar year
so we fast-forward 20 years and I don't
know this I'm extrapolating now and I'm
probably wrong but you know if you
extrapolate that out the median age at
Microsoft today would be like 43 well a
lot happens to people between 27 and 43
and the ability to stay at work on
Christmas Day or come
back to the office after you go to the
movie on Friday night is very different
when you're 25 and you don't have a
girlfriend versus when you're 43 and
you've got two kids at home so that
aging workforce issue is one that you
just have to figure out what to do about
you know and unless you're counting on
high staff turnover you you know that's
just you have to figure out how to make
things work even as your workforce ages
and that's you know that's not unique to
Microsoft we've seen lots of companies
that deal with that issue I think
there's been an erosion of technical
leadership right and you guys have we
had Bill Gates who had been more of a
technical guy and after Mike Hallman
laughed he went in the office of the CEO
because bill wasn't always the CEO right
there was a long period where Microsoft
experienced explosive growth where Bill
was not the president of the company but
he stepped into the presidency in the
company and you know Google's a little
different because you've got Sergey and
Larry but you know I look at history
repeating itself with Larry stepping
into the CEO position after years of
being in more of a more of a technical
position so those are some things I
think about preserving the technical
core I think I think you know Ballmer is
done in many ways a wonderful job at
Microsoft and and you know kept the ship
afloat but he doesn't have anywhere near
the technical respect I mean he has zero
technical respect I think that's not
where he came from and making sure that
that company's maintain some really
extraordinarily respected technical
leaders I think is key as well so those
would be my main thoughts we have a
question over here but I just want to
comment as a Googler that was a brutal
brutal answer to listen to
do you have a strong opinion on the
correct size of a development team
especially for larger and more complex
products and then along those lines how
do you decide when to increase headcount
when not to Savin no actually I think
you know one of the things that's become
clear to me as I've been doing this for
more than 26 years now is there are not
a lot of software issues that are a lot
more about people than they are about
software and so if when you try to get a
team that has you know you can also
think of it as like you know a hardware
loop where you want to keep your highest
bandwidth connections the closest to
each other and if you start getting high
bandwidth connections across too big a
set of people it doesn't work and so
you've got to figure out a way to
organize your team so that you've got no
more than about seven that have the
highest bandwidth connection and then
you compose larger teams out of those
work groups that have no more than about
seven I think and you know onion you can
compose those two arbitrarily large
sizes in the in the work that we've done
over the years with companies we've seen
a number of what we've come to think of
as transition maturity transition points
we've worked with companies typically
anywhere from 50 technical staff to
about 10,000 technical staff and what
we've found is that up to about 50 the
organizational issues don't really
matter because you can literally know
every person at a size of about 50 and
you can have one level of management
when you get up to about so but if 50
companies tend to struggle because
they're not quite sure how to organize
it and they they start feeling really
inefficient once they work through that
organizational of hurdle they typically
add a layer of management add a layer of
structure and that takes them up to
about somewhere between 250 and 350
employees and I think this really
literally is powers of seven and at that
point they tend to struggle again and
have another organizational crisis where
they really don't know how to organize
the work anymore and the team
interactions aren't as efficient and
they make lots of mistakes and they get
into political skirmishes and so on and
so they tend to need to
through some sort of a rican ception of
how the whole organization looks
somewhere in that size range then once
they they overcome that then they're
good up to you know maybe a couple
thousand people something like that
and that can be an organization where
people are not working that coordinated
or it can be we've seen you know we've
seen project teams that you know
certainly have up to at least several
hundred people that can be organized
along those lines but at the individual
work group level there's actually some
pretty reasonable data from a guy named
Larry Putnam who's an estimating guru
that looks at business systems all of
basically the same size and the only
variation really being the team size and
what his data says is that when you
increase team size from two to seven
that your total effort goes up but your
schedule goes down not that much really
but it goes down some but once you
increase team size above seven your
total effort goes up just like you'd
expect but your total schedule also goes
up so as you get beyond a workgroup size
of something like seven you really just
end up with people tripping over each
other and working across purposes and
and inserting defects in each other's
codes etc etc so yeah I do think and you
know I don't think that has anything to
do with software I think it has to do
with how well people can communicate
with each other I'm sure there are
exceptions if I've got a group of people
that I've worked with for 10 years and
we've very slowly added people and got
into a workgroup size of 10 or 12 I'm
sure there are cases out there where
that works fine but general terms I I
think it's problematic
I think so presentation I mean yeah so
question kind of similar to the previous
one but not exactly the same so so we've
said as your company or your team grows
you have to concentrate on on other
things to still make it successful like
for example quality of processes you've
got I'm sorry the last part quality of
processes you've got but how you how do
you actually shift
like quality of processes has been more
important like say you've got a team
very good technical team who consists of
Cowboys who don't care about practices
and if you try to like reconsider them
they just don't want to do that if you
bring in like a protest guru from some
other company from outside the company
the your team can be might become
allergic to the guy so they don't want
to like except them to the team and that
the answer seems to be pretty simple you
just do it but I've been hearing about a
lot of startups that conduct that make
this a if you shouldn't be effectively
so what I search yeah that's a company
that are a problem or challenge that any
company that experiences a high level of
growth is ultimately going to run into
that when you're small there are certain
rewards of working in that company when
you're medium there are certain rewards
when you're large there are certain
rewards but you know there are some
people who really prefer to work in
start-up mode there are some people who
really prefer to work for a larger
organization as you grow you're not
gonna retain every single person some
people are gonna get older well they're
all gonna get older but some people are
are they're their life priorities are
gonna change and as the company gets
bigger and more stable and so on maybe
that's fine because the same things
happening to them other people are gonna
be looking for something new and
interesting and challenging and they're
gonna bail out and go look for some
other startup and I think that's just
the way it happens if I was a business
owner what I would focus on is creating
the highest possible strongest possible
sense of mission about my organization
so that they could at least I could
retain people based on being bought into
the mission even if there were other
collateral aspects of how the work that
is done that they're no longer buying
into
we could probably ask you questions I
really appreciate the presentation and
especially the honesty involved in it as
someone who is working for a company
being sued and who's getting old that
was a good one let's thank both mishko
and Steve our final two speakers in GT a
2011 thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
