called Martin Gardner 101 our speaker is
column okay he who's in the math
department at Spelman he had the
pleasure of knowing Martin garner during
the last decade of Martin Gardner's life
Martin Gardner died in 2010 and would be
a hundred and one this year which is
part of why this is called Martin
Gardner 101 column has had puzzles
published in the New York Times and he's
written for Scientific American well
thank you very much straight great
pleasure to be here thanks for coming
out taking the break during lunch I hope
to tell you something about this amazing
man Martin Gardner and some of the
puzzles he came up with a lot more can
be found online he published an enormous
amount of material I'm gonna go over
maybe six puzzles related to them that
are not so well known one or two of them
are well known and perhaps the rest are
not so well known some open problems too
he asked questions that we still don't
know the answer to which is quite
extraordinary
so as Rick said I'm based at Spelman
College in Atlanta Georgia and I go by
the name card column because I write a
column every two months for the MAA on
mathematical card magic and that's all
freely available online I'm going to do
the web browser oh yeah let's flip back
to that so if you google Conway's Game
of Life you it's hard to see it here but
actually what's percolating up in the
top right hand corner it's very washed
out there is a simulation or a real-time
reenactment of the game of life that's
an Easter Egg that some clever person
here so the game of life was a cellular
automata thing that he wrote about the
Martin Gardner wrote about in 1970 and
it became hugely popular so it's nice
that when you google the term you want
to get to learn a little bit about it
thank you so I call Martin Gardner the
best friend mathematics ever had he was
probably also the best friend that
rationality ever had and I just came
from the amazing meeting in Las Vegas
where Randi and various other people of
that ilk were talking about rationality
and debunking pseudoscience a mark and
turn out to be a major player in that
very early on he was born in 1914 21st
of October same day as dizzy gillespie
but a couple of years apart and last
year of course he would have turned 200
now I took this photograph of him the
first time I went to visit him he lived
in retirement in Oklahoma and he was a
very shy man and as soon as he saw me
taking my camera out he really just
froze up he just didn't like having his
picture taken very reluctant but I said
Martin please I want you to stand in
front of this bookcase I don't want to
take this picture and it just happened
to be one of the better pictures of me
doesn't look quite so grumpy as usual
when the cameras out he was not grumpy
in real life and it was used by the New
York Times and Time magazine it's the
one when he passed in their obituaries
and I call him Martin Gardner standing
by every word he ever wrote because he
actually wrote all these books and you
can see four shelves worth and there
were two more below the belt he actually
wrote an enormous is not very productive
life he wrote over a hundred and one
books in fact he was 101 non-fiction
books and about three fiction books as
well so you know when he died people
said he wrote 60 or 70 books that's kind
of true in the mathematical sense but
you know when my cat dies I don't want
the obituaries to say his cat had three
legs
my cat has four legs and it deserves
credit for the fourth leg Martin Gardner
over 104 books and he should get credit
for that I've got a list of them online
and mostly on math physics puzzles there
were two famous books and physics
philosophy and all sorts of other stuff
most well known of course for Scientific
American he wrote for Scientific
American from the mid 50s to the early
80s continuously and then sporadically
for a few more years and that gave rise
to about 300 columns many of which were
very very influential you can find those
in 15 books strick had one earlier the
the knotted oneth what I think is doing
the rounds but the nice thing is they're
all collected in one place as well on a
searchable cd-rom by the math
Association of America and that's cool
because if you want to look up magic
squares or you know Percy diaconis you
don't have to leave through the index of
15 different books you can just find it
very quickly and it's about 40 or 50
bucks highly recommended every library
should have one every teenager should
have one actually Knut escorter back
there was saying that this is the Canon
and I've discovered sometimes that some
people say well who's Knut
thank you he was asked this question
himself four years ago he's a professor
in Stanford retired professor at
Stanford
he was asked well younger computer
science students may not know who you
are do you think that's bad and I found
it answer was very interesting because
his answer was he was far more upset
that people might not know who Martin
Gardner was so he deflected the question
entirely and this was you know about a
year after Martin had died he said
Martin did a lot to illustrate
mathematics in an interesting way and he
says for me the important thing is don't
remember me but you know I didn't write
these books and I got things right and
don't reinvent the same things over and
over so we're reading the art of
programming or if you're not reading you
probably should be reading rather than
redesigning the same sorting algorithms
um sorry
so among the topics that Martin made
famous and depending on where you are
and the age spectrum some of these may
be familiar he start her off with
something called hexaflexagons that was
a folding activity with strips of paper
that were folded in hexagonal patterns
and funny stuff happened and that was
actually first explored in the late
thirties by a team of young students and
Princeton a feeling richard fineman and
martin resurrected this topic I wrote
about it for Scientific American in 1956
the very end of 56 it was so successful
just the buzz even in the office in
Scientific American office that before
it even went to press hit the streets
they said this has really taken off
would you like to do something like this
regularly do you think there'd be enough
material to do a regular column of
mathematical recreations Martin lie
through his teeth and said oh of course
and then rushed down to the nearest
bookshop he could find and get all the
books that then existed on recreation
and you know started writing about
started off with simple topics like
magic squares but as time went by the
stuff got more sophisticated because he
started getting friendly with people
like John Connelly and canoes and
diaconis some of whom were students at
the time and some of them were already
professionals he met persi diaconis the
famous magician and statistician in 1959
when Percy was only 13 and they were
friends for a very long time so another
thing he wrote about was the soma cube
which is basically a three by three by
three jigsaw puzzle three-dimensional
jigsaw puzzle with 27 cubes that have
been pre delude into seven shapes and
you have to assemble them together
conway as an undergraduate figured out
with Richard guy's son Mike guy that
there were about 2,000 different ways
you could do that and he did it using
group theory so right away
Martin would write about something and
mathematicians who were either already
famous or budding
magicians would take it run with it and
do something interesting no classify
generalized find the patterns the art of
Escher MC Escher's arch which you know
adorned many a bedroom wall in 60s and
70s and 80s that became well-known
because of Martin Gardner outside of
Holland not well-known at the time and
Martin wrote an article about him which
will have more to say about later that
helped popularize Edgar's work lots of
things in here I showed you the economy
game of life briefly the Easter egg when
you google - you find fun stuff
cryptography there's a story that Martin
broke in 1977 or so Horace a
choreography was broken by Martin Martin
knew the guys who invented it they got
in touch with him and he published dish
and then there was an issue of should
this have been published and there were
some people and suits who came to his
office and said cease and desist and
don't send the paper out but the cat was
out of the bag at that point so the
story became well-known fractals
fractals became known to the general
public because it was a cover story in
Scientific American that Martin Gardner
wrote he was a journalist and he was a
science journalist science writer he
just happened to be there at the right
time
Mandelbrot was one of his neighbors so
he got the scoop on fractal because the
guy lived a few blocks away paradoxes
when I was a teenager I remember reading
some of the Martin Gardner books I'm
been fascinated with the paradoxes the
old crows are black paradoxes the
paradoxes of infinity some infinities
are bigger than others big surprise when
you're 16 or 17 but it's very true and
Martin brought that kind of thing and
firmus last hyrum to the general public
before anybody else did and they're new
constructs which is still unresolved
surprising things like non-transitive
dice I can present you with three dice
and say which one do you like you pick
one I pick one my role would beat your
role in average another which one you
pick a is bigger than C is bigger than a
if it couldn't be a bigger than C is
bigger than a so very surprising this
was actually the picture that was used
on the cover of the first paperback of a
Martin Gardner book I hadn't I was a
teenager and the question was how many
pieces at most if you're clever can you
slice a bagel or a doughnut into with
three planar cuts and the answer is not
obvious and in fact you can't tell from
this picture you can kind of get an
lower band there may be an upper bound
but the actual answer I think is
thirteen four three cuts but no
ask that kind of question before i'm
topologists didn't have the ready answer
and now of course we know the answer for
any number of cuts but this was you know
cutting edge stuff back in the fifties
and sixties and you can try it at home
with a bagel or doughnut so you know
math research can be cheap that the
overhead is not high now he wrote all
these columns for scientific American's
so last year for his centenary we got
carried away with this top-10 theme and
I wrote a piece for Scientific American
called the top ten mark and Gardner
Scientific American artists there's also
the top ten Martin Gardner books the top
ten Martin Gardner magic tricks the top
ten Martin Gardner physics puzzles so if
you build a Martin Gardner top ten you
will find all of these there's about in
fact it got to the point where at the
end of the month at the end of the
centenary month
last October we had to come up with a
top ten Martin Gardner top ten list
those were about 13 contenders so here's
the list of the famous the really famous
top ten comes from Scientific American
the flexagon complex dominoes that's
polyominoes and pentominoes and so on
had the geometry one there is coxeter
geometry hyperbolic geometry and that's
where the extra art came in I skipped
over number three every spring he would
put out a column which just had nine
short puzzles and those are the things
that a lot of people remember him for
great brain teasers and then the
solution would come a month or two later
and the interesting thing was the
solution would come a month or two later
but sometimes in that month the solution
he intended to present change because
people would send them new solutions
that he hadn't thought of and that the
person who had given the problem had a
problem so and then sometimes people
would write it and say two months later
oh but you forgot about this case and we
can generalize this so it was just
constant feedback between him and his
audience with a kind of a month or two
delay and you know if you were
interested in doing these problems back
in the fifties and sixties and 70s and
80s you have to do them away the month
or two because there was no Google to
look up the answer so you had to do it
yourself refines them and you can help
you out so number five there's the game
of life that came out in October 1970
and Conway's biography just came out and
Herzog refer claims in there that
there's a fairly substantial claim that
one quarter of the world's mainframes
were playing
at the game of life in the year 1971
1972 not that many people had access to
computers back then of course the free
world paradox the Newcombe paradox is
number six number seven is great it was
an April Fool's gag April Fool forty
years ago 1975 April Fool so we had six
or seven things in there that he claimed
had been overlooked and again if you
read them you couldn't check easy
because you know there were libraries
and it's like the PDS but they were
printed several years earlier so new
results that somebody announced it
people tended to believe you you
couldn't check by looking up to see if
it was a hoax right so among the things
in there was that was a claim that
Leonardo da Vinci had invented the
valves flush toilets and he backed it up
with some very impressive artwork that a
friend of his did somebody who
Illustrated many of its books that he
claimed he'd found in the New York
Public Library so it's not kind of
genuine he also had a perpetual motion
machine but that was invented by a mrs.
birdbrain so if you're actually paying
attention you probably should have got
that you know it was a joke and he had
some math ones in there too and the
curious thing is that column generated a
huge amount response but interestingly a
lot of the response was I loved that
article five of those discoveries were
absolutely fascinating but I think you
made a mistake on the sixth floor and
which one the reader thought was a
mistake was kind of a uniformly
distributed you know and the same thing
happened actually with the skepticism
books when he first wrote about you know
Elrond Herbert and dowsing and UFOs and
astrology and people would write it and
say I love that book you know and - one
of the chapters were great but you
really messed up on this one so that was
kind of a recurring theme that when he
when he was not quite serious about
something of poking fun and something
people tend to only get insulted it was
about them they thought everything else
was fine
by the way for this April we did an
April Fool's joke with Scientific
American we got John Conway to regale us
with tales of martin gardner writing a
joint paper with ernest and with nicola
Bourbaki a fictitious mathematician but
it's all on video so it's on the
internet so it must be true right so
that's that's April this year and number
eight there is fractals number nine is
Penrose tiles on number 10 is RSA crypto
trophies these are tennis
donning stories any journalist would
give the right arm to you know to be
able to introduce the public to any two
or three of these a Marten luckily got
all 10 and a lot more besides
Lewton I think the most famous ones he
also was fortunate in that his work was
featured on the cover our artists work
related to the things to be writing
about were featured on the cover on the
recce ten or twelve actually played
twelve cover stories and they're not
correlated exactly with the ten top ten
ones I just showed you but you can see
here we have down the bottom right we
have fractals to the left that we've got
Penrose tiles the top left-hand corner
is a great word it's like make
decomposing a square into smaller
squares can it be done or not that if
you actually examine that with the
magnifying glass it's not quite a square
it was an open problem when he wrote
about it in the 50s but it was solved in
the 70s 70s I think on a much bigger
scale somebody found squares that fit
together in the non no not like the
floor looking over here but in a
surprising way the third image here from
the top is the Penrose sorry the the
work of Escher and what happened with
Asher was I sure liked Martin stuff and
Escher wrote him a fan letter from
Holland in 1960 and he said I'm great
admirer of your work blah blah blah by
the way would you like to see some of my
edging and he slipped in a couple of
things Martin looked a thousand went Wow
and got in touch with coxeter in Toronto
and hence this article which came out in
spring of sixty what and notice how
there's colors in there you know it's
geese flying in one direction white
gates versus colored geese flying in the
other direction Asher was outraged that
Scientific American artists had seen
that the color has worked because it was
originally black and white he got over
his outrage as the cheque started coming
in and you know sadly for Escher he only
died in 72 so you know his fame most of
his fame was after his death but Markham
was the first one to break that story
okay so those are some of the covers now
is the legacy of Martin here's some
interesting quotes from Knuth again and
it says more people have probably
learned more good mathematical ideas
from Gardner than from any other person
in the history of the world that's an
astonishing claim I mean what contenders
could there be Euclid's elements which
may or may not have been written by you
could certainly has been
revamped over the centuries millennia
since Jim prop has a great quote that
says that Martin Gardner's column was
the best watering hole of its day and
beside behind the scenes he was a
tireless matchmaker that's a very
important and relevant comment I think
as Simon Singh you may know him he's a
uk-based journalist he just done some
book tours over here says that he hopes
that future generations of budding nerds
will be introduced to Martin Gardner the
greatest popularizer of mathematics of
the 20th century if not all time and
that they'd also be introduced to his
writings on skepticism and science see
Martin was a shy guy I'm one of the bad
downsides of that is that he never had a
web page you never promoted himself he
just wrote books and moved on to write
the next book he never had the profile
of some other people in related arenas
he was no Steve Jobs he was no Carl
Sagan he was no Richard Fineman but yet
I think he belongs up there with those
three guys and we'd like your help to
make that happen and then Ron Graham
again who's a mathematician who's worked
with persi diaconis a lot and has known
Martin for 50 years said that there's no
question that he's responsible for
turning people of all ages automat
anybody else and nobody else has
succeeded people say who the next
American guard who writes as well as
Martin Gardner nobody it's that simple
one people have tried but Martin it was
a full-time job for him which was
interesting because the rest of us tend
to have like day jobs we teach and grade
papers and program of whatever we do
Martin didn't have to do any of that and
that really helped so I think he was a
great Community Builder he built a huge
community and we have harvested
testimonials from people over a huge age
range generation after generation of
people are the influences he wrote
reviews and books right up to his death
I mean day or two before he died he was
still writing stuff he processed
information at a ferocious rate he read
a lot he thought deeply heroes moved on
to the next project
there are several generations of people
influenced by him and of course
gatherings in his honor there is a
gathering every two years in Atlanta
called The Gathering for Gardner which
is a by invitation only conference of
mathematician puzzle makers I mean
physical puzzles to mature
skeptics and so on you're interested in
that let me know afterwards and then
every October would say more about it
later we invite the world to join in
celebrating the kind of things that
Martin liked a lot about him it's about
the ideas you know making people think
rationally and making people curious and
making people expand their brains but
interestingly people say well it's just
silly frivolous recreational mathematics
no it's not and I hope you convinced you
that in the time that remains because
new results of substance have been and
continue to be produced as a result of
questions martin asked on columns that
he wrote he was a firm believer that
recreational math was was a foot in the
door to real research and in fact formed
a natural springboard for curiosity and
innovation and I think strick mentioned
in the flyer that he circulated
yesterday that there was a time when
some of the jobs questions interview
questions you might be asked at a
company like Google or perhaps other
companies Microsoft some of those came
from the kind of puzzles that Martin
popularize I'll tell you something else
that came from it uncredited for most of
his life car talk car talk frequently
introduced their shows with a buzzer and
they nicked them from Martin frequently
and it's funny because they got a bee in
the bonnet about 10 years ago for
reasons we don't understand they thought
he had died apparently they didn't
Google check and they announced on their
the Martin Gardner had died and
confessed that they'd been stealing his
puzzles for all these years Martin
Gardner's son was listening and he had
talked to his father like you know maybe
the day before say got a little worried
he picked up the phone called that are
you okay I'm fine what's going on body
back then he called them to your and he
said you know I live in Oklahoma and I
know this man and he's alive and how
well do you know him well you know with
my dad so then they did an apology
broadcast the next week and when Martin
really died
they rebroadcast all of that and you can
it used to be free to listen to that
cross the dollar it's June 2010 one of
the doin podcasts of Car Talk you can
listen to it it's fun they also have a
CD out called the best of 25 years of
Car Talk I'm marking guard we get the
track on better ships so there you go
so I said that Martin was a firm
believer in in math forming a
springboard for curiosity and also can
lead to real research in fact there's
kind of two sides this corner these are
direct quotes from Martin he says the
best way to wake up somebody to math is
to introduce a game a puzzle a magic
trick a joke even our model or paradox
or i neva score of other things that
Doty's tend to avoid because they seem
frivolous and as a teacher myself I'm a
math teacher at college level you know
you often think well the test is coming
up I've gotta get through these theories
and I don't have time to introduce the
fun stuff but I've talked to a number of
teachers who say take the time take five
minutes ash maybe start a class every
Friday to do to introduce a Martin
Gardner puzzle because students look
forward to it they wake up and their
brains work better for the rest of the
class even though they're going back to
the normal work but more importantly
Martin says that you'd be surprised how
much math you can learn by exploring the
implications and ramifications of
something that just seems like it's very
brain teaser and John Conway is another
living example of both of these John
Conway invents games constantly and in
fact I was just reading his biography
and it said that he invented the game of
life in an attempt to outwit people who
were using computers to solve math
problems he's like I'll give him some
that computer won't be able to solve and
that led to a whole subculture of its
own that's been going on for 45 years
now in fact John Conway is one of his
famous quotes is in all caps I hate the
game of life it's the thing he's most
famous for and that bothers him because
he's obviously done a lot of other
things but Martin was the one who they
use the Midwife another yes the
testimonials so if you go to the Martin
- Gardiner oxide on the top left there's
a link called testimonials and we're
collecting stuff there and we've
actually got we're almost up to a
hundred we like we'd like to get to 100
because you know we're in the centennial
year and the age span varies well
Richard guy contributed yesterday
Richard guy is the subject with Conway
and Elm umbrella camp formerly from this
neck of the woods they are the subject
of a big conference coming up this
Monday in Tuesday in New York at the
Museum of map moves conference Richard
guy still doing stuff a lot of stuff and
in September he turns 99 it's a
punishing
I sent an email out yesterday asked him
for some new testimonials he got back to
you about three minutes he was faster
than all the 70 year-old an 80 year olds
but we also had Ethan Brown you don't
know who Ethan Brown is he's worth
looking up he's a teenager who is
astounding talented and I think we're
gonna be hearing more from him so you
know we have an 8 year age plan and we'd
like yours I look at the people we have
in here Hanna Frey from the UK James
Randi of course
Conway himself Richard guy Simon Singh
Stan Isaac's is based in this area he is
the man who curated the Martin Gardner
archives which were at Stanford so race
mullion the man who wrote the book what
is the name of this book like in 1978
that was funny now we're jaded but 1978
that was revolutionary to publish a book
called water the nameless book
raimus millions about 96 and he's still
rocking my crease what are the Simpsons
creators a lot of people have left with
some cool comments here Gary Anakin York
Times is with us today Rudy Rudy Rucker
Ethan Browns in there Alvy Ray Smith one
of the Pixar founder's people from all
sorts of different areas because Martin
didn't just appeal to you know one side
of the brain or to science people in
fact among his associates and friends
were Isaac Asimov and Salvador Dali but
that's not what we need to mention today
now because last year was centennial we
managed to get the people who run math
Awareness Month to make it in honor of
Martin and that was April of last year
so a new activity went up every day
throughout the month of April but the
good news is they stay up for all time
because this website will be maintained
if you go now you get this year's theme
you've got to go slash 2014 to get to
last year's and what we did was we took
things that Martin had already written
about and kind of updated them made them
video interactive multimedia friendly
had younger people presenting them and
also some things that weren't known to
Martin because they happened a little
after his time such as the connection
between the liner shovel I just did over
there if you were at the beginning and
fractals there's an interesting
connection with when he comes to light
recently it's in the book by diaconis
and graham so this book on the left here
is the picture on the left is actually a
famous book of Martin's first book
relating to map that he published the
same year he started the Scientific
American back in 1956
it's called mathematics magic chemistry
I'm Trent with the same cover and on the
right is the poster for math Awareness
Month same title basically and there
were 30 days in April which factors
nicely is 5 times 6 so it's kind of like
an advent calendar for people who
believe in mathematics and the top left
was Ethan Brown telling you how to do in
your head on the fly 4x4 customized
magic squares and he makes it sound easy
so everything's introduced with a video
of like 90 seconds 2 minutes tops and
then they explain some app but the level
goes since something a teenager couldn't
stand up to grad school level the second
month about braiding there's card tricks
in there there's turning the sphere
inside out there's an optical illusion
they think he dragon all sorts of fun
stuff juggling so we recommend you check
that out
he got very generous coverage in its
centennial year all the major math
magazines in the US and some so lucky
physics magazines for teachers physics
world and the APS physics teacher
skeptical inquirer of course turned out
he was one of the founders of that back
in the 70s the BBC magazine had an
article album which got half a million
hits in the first day which was great so
a lots lots of feedback and here again
are some of the covers
he made it under the cover of quite a
few magazines including all four of the
American magic magazines so let's get to
a puzzle I'm gonna actually show you six
puzzles and some are easy and some are
not this is not such an easy one so I'm
gonna ask you a puzzle when you can
think about it and at the end I'm going
to show you silently the solution and
give you the opportunity to take a power
nap if you don't want to see the
solution and if you haven't solved it
you probably don't want to see it
because it's very important you solve
this yourself this is it so five years
ago just a couple of months before
Martin died Gary Foshay who makes
physical puzzles and things stood up and
gave this talk and I listened very
carefully and he sat down he said 20
words and he sat down and the room went
nuts because of what these 20 words are
so here there I have two children one is
the boy born on a Tuesday what is the
probability I have to
most people respond by saying let's
choosing a to do with it how could you
sleep ASSA bleah be relevant here okay
so think about that
now there's a much simpler version that
Martin popularized back in the 60s very
simple it's standard now when you're
teaching probability and mr. Smith has
two children at least one of them as a
boy what's the probability both children
are boys
compare and contrast with mr. Jones has
two children the older is the girl
what's the problem isn't both children a
girl you have two right at your sample
space and do a little conditional
probability so if you can solve the ones
at the bottom of this page you probably
won't master the one at the top but it's
not the other way around just because
you can solve the one at the bottom
doesn't mean you nailed the one at the
top one of the tops a little harder so
we'll come back to it at the end but
it's an interesting question I have two
children one is a boy born on the
Tuesday by the way
Martin Gardner has two children and I
happen to know that one of them is a boy
and I was sitting beside Martin
Gardner's son about a year ago Princeton
and across the table with John Connelly
a John Conway is famous I'm one of the
things for being able to spit out the
day of the week for any date in history
and any calendar system you could
intention so I said to Jim Gardner
Martin's son when were you born and he
told me it was some date in some month
in 1950 and I turned to John Conway and
I said what day was that
and he blurted out Wednesday well he
said no I'm an idiot I'm an idiot he was
really embarrassed because it was in
fact you know so Martin Gardner in fact
has two children I'm one as the boy born
I achieved it so that's something else
about this is a very famous classic two
missile speed directly towards each
other one's moving
9,000 miles per hour and the other is
moving at 21,000 miles per hour now nine
and twenty would add a very convenient e
230 and that suggests if you know
anything about relative velocity then
you're told they start one thousand
three hundred and seventeen miles apart
that's an ugly number and there's a
question and the question is without
using pencil paper calculate how far
apart they are one minute before they
fly
the formula connecting the relevant
things here is a simple form you know
average average speed is distance
traveled over time taken so you might
have to multiply you might have to
divide and you're getting nervous right
because that one three one seven isn't
so fun
you might be able to multiply it by
something in your head but you certainly
don't want to divide something into it
or divide it into something so you're
worried right now he said with a pen and
paper this person was posed you know
fifty years ago
calculators were in common yet so there
was no question of using a calculator I
not supposed to use a slide rule either
true story Martin Gardner to his death
balanced his checkbook with an abacus
that's those use an abacus either okay
well of course you do realize that
relevant philosophy is what's important
here so it's as if one object is
stationary and the other is barreling
towards it at 30,000 miles per hour but
still not unpleasant number there well
having seconds actually much easier you
think because distance is speed times
time taken on if it's a minute but
that's it's a minute which is one
sixtieth of an hour so the answer pops
out at 500 miles and you're thinking
what happened to the one three one seven
it wasn't necessary to know where they
are far apart they were when this thing
started it's good that it's bigger than
500 because if I said they started 317
miles apart we'd have a problem in
Houston okay but now so so you know is
this a dirty trick question that's an
interesting question and as a teacher
when I first saw this I mean I probably
saw when I was John forgotten but when I
revisited it in more recent decades I
thought well yeah it is kind of you know
would I dare give that to my students I
would actually suggest that maybe we
should give problems like this to our
students a lot more than we do because
here we have a situation where there's
extraneous information information that
wasn't necessary to solve the problem if
you leave that out to make life easier
for your students what are you training
them to do your spoon-feeding you're
making so you always give me exactly
right of everyone information never give
them too much because they'll complain
never give them too little because
they'll complain even better almost
impossible when you look out the window
through the world we're bombarded with
data you guys know a lot about data
right this data everywhere yeah how
learn how to sift through it and decide
what's important was not important so
maybe we should give students problems
like that frequently like once a
semester or once a week with the class I
think I students might be very prepared
if we did so I think it's actually
immoral behind that okay here's an
interesting when I'm going to show you
some cans I think there's six of them
from we're gonna number them from left
to right and my question is for which of
them is the height greater than the
circumference so on the Left we have
chickpeas then we have Pringles that
looks like them we got coffee a coffee
I think it's nuts cat food something
sporty and pineapple juice so the little
cat food one surely it can't be tall
enough that the height exceeds the
circumference so will exclude number
five what about the chickpeas and the
pineapple juice on the two extreme do
they look taller at the height exceeds
the circumference depends you know some
people think yeah maybe the coffee can I
would throw out two and the nuts how
about if we focus on the two apparently
more extreme ones number two and number
six all those tall enough to my eye
right now and I've looked at this for a
few years it looks to me like those two
tall ones are maybe one and a half times
as tall as the circumference now it's
possible to figure this out without
measuring I mean if I had count here we
could actually measure it because if you
look at the can that says PE n Ana
that's actually got three tennis balls
which means that the height is three
times the width now the last time I
checked the circumference of a circle
was pi times the way how many decimals
of pi do you need to know none and
that's why this question was called
three-point question mark that's what
you need to know the fact that pi is
three points something you don't even
need to know it's three point one it's
bigger than three so in fact none of
these cans are tall enough that they're
high exceeds the circumference it's a
little surprising that I was inspired to
come up with that because the very first
day
Martin which was 2006 after a little
introductory chat he said I've got
something to show and he produced his
tall skinny glass which you can see here
ripped up my camera because I thought
this might be worth capturing and he
said do you think this glass is taller
than it is around and look at it it
looks like it's hugely tall compared to
else of course I fell for it hook line
and sinker and said oh yeah ah that's a
new word he took out a little rivet of
paper and showed me the error of my ways
we're very bad at gauging girth
we're just lousy at it
we're also bad at getting depth but
earth were particularly about it and you
know as you get older you look in the
mirror and you might be putting on a few
pounds and you're in denial you don't
see yourself putting our way around we
just don't see your at all but maybe
that's because of too much appreciation
of pie certainly in my case um Martin
was a scientific American he wrote for
Scientific American he was also a
magical American in fact he invented
clothes of magic and published it from
the age of 15 and a half in the spring
of 1930 until 95 and a half eight years
later one of his last published very
last published thing who's also a magic
trick he was a rationalist and debunker
in fact even as a kid he read stuff
early science fiction magazines that
included articles on astrology and UFOs
and so on back in the twenties I didn't
know the stuff went back that far so he
was he was skeptical from a very early
age he founded the scheduler move in
1952 inadvertently by publishing a book
called fads and fallacies in the name of
science that was the first book of that
type and now it's you know happily a
large movement but actually he's most
famous first nothing to do with anything
I've mentioned so far the annotated
Alice in Wonderland is his biggest hit
and that's why Asha wrote to usher was a
huge Alice fan he actually knew about
Scientific American but he loved the
attitude Alice and that's what prompted
Escher to write to Martin and include a
few of his edging the Chaplin yes color
polarized them a little more well-known
in the West
outside of Holland and this year is the
two hundred one hundred and fiftieth
anniversary of the publication of Alice
it was the fall of 1865 and there's
going to be a hundred and fiftieth
anniversary edition of Alice and a new
version could Martin left some notes
behind for updating the annotated Alice
or the definitive definitive annotated
Alice is coming out in a few months now
um Martin a lot of people assume that
Martin because he was such a rationalist
must have been an atheist or agnostic
and to be honest I would have been in
the same camp until I did my homework it
turns out he wasn't but you didn't talk
about it much he wrote about it and if
people didn't pay attention he didn't
really care he actually considered
himself to be a philosophical theist and
the mysterion so we're back to math
magic and mystery a lot of math a lot of
magic the magic way before he did math
and she was dying there he considered
and served to be a mysterion and you can
look up what that might mean if you
don't know so but there's also a mystery
about something else
and given what I've told you about him
every reasonable to assume this guy was
an academic right probably had a you
know bachelor's master's maybe a dr. ish
and he taught students and had fun
grading papers all weekend like I do and
published in refereed journals went
around the country giving talks no
that's not Martin at all he actually
never took a math fast pass to high
school
that's astonishing he graduated high
school in 1932 he would have learned a
little bit of algebra a little bit of
trig and a lot of geometry a lot more
geometry than we learned today but
that's it
there was no AP calc i we didn't get to
calculus they were no juniors in college
he actually intended to go to Caltech to
study physics that was his goal he
wanted to be a physicist but in those
days you couldn't just walk in as a
teenager you had to go somewhere else
improve yourself for two years like
totally not a community college but
another place so he went to University
of Chicago with the intention of
switching after year q but he fell in
love with philosophy and Russell and
Whitehead were among the guests guest
lecturers who came by that he saw speak
he also saw Houdini do escapes I mean he
saw incredible name some various parts
of history so we did have one university
degree from Chicago in 1936 but it was
in philosophy we didn't take any math in
college but he was interested in magic
he was interested in topological magic
like
you can braid something how you can take
a piece of paper nor what's written on
this for now now you can take a piece of
paper and cut two slots letters I'm
tiring out in the three things that
result
mind-boggling he knew about that in the
forties and that was early days of
topology he started writing about it
ultimately it led to the Scientific
American gig
it was a freelance journalist never had
to put on a suit and tie and didn't have
a day job for most of his life and he
was a terrific teacher but from a
typewriter
behind an old 70s electric typewriter
his word processing consisted of Elmer's
glue and a scissors I mean he would
rearrange stuff with you know old-school
very old-school and amazingly apparently
and as Berger confirms this he never
gave a public talk in his life anywhere
never performed in public it's
astonishing because he was such an
articulate person privately and in
writing but he didn't like crowds and in
fact so many comment recently there were
three people in the room he thought that
was a multitude he just couldn't handle
crowds actually of course had he bitten
the bullet I mean it's not easy to talk
to a public gathering the first time you
do it but like anybody else he would
have got over his stage shyness and he
would have been a brilliant expositor
had he given himself that opportunity
but he didn't anybody here on Twitter
good well Martin's on Twitter too and
what would Martin Gardner trees now um
being modest Martin he would he wouldn't
treat about I wrote a hundred and four
books he would tweet about oh here's a
cool thing check this out
here's a video here's a rope trick so
that's what he tweets and he also
treated his entire memoirs about a year
ago which took a while one tweeted day
but because he's such a modest guy and
there's the other side of the story
which is he did ride 104 books he wrote
40 books on puzzles he wrote two
important books on physics he wrote
these books on philosophy we have to
also tell that story so we've balance it
with the Martin Gardner Centennial
account so both of those I would
encourage you to follow and tell your
friends please we'd like to build up the
following of those they tweet once a day
and hopefully will for a long time to
come the new website if we talk about
year ago is Martin - gardener org and
there's a lot of stuff there about him
so here's the next math problem how many
cylinders or pencils can be arranged so
if they all touch each other
think of fingers could you get three
fingers that they all touch each other I
think I pulled it off right could I get
four fingers so they don't touch each
other well that might not be the
solution but wait it is if they join
there and they do so okay I've got a
solution so we can probably do four so
can you do can you do five okay can you
do six that was kind of what Martin was
fishing for when he asked this question
he showed a picture of four tennis balls
and with a pyramid or golf balls and
three coins that mutually touch and then
he said what about cylinders like long
cylinders of pencils and he was hoping
for six and it turns out six is doable
and here's the picture he had in mind
when he posed this question in
Scientific American but he didn't
publish the picture of later and in the
meantime people found a solution that he
had anticipated and actually can you do
seven and you get seven pencils at all
mutually touch well that was the
surprise because somebody wrote in and
said here six but here seven and here's
the picture you've got to think outside
the page it's coming out at you the one
in the middle there's a seven go in
there so that's a nice symmetry the
previous picture didn't know any
symmetry to speak oh well I had some but
this is an icer symmetric picture four
six and with the third dimension
you've got the seven all those pencils
might happen to be hexagonal but it's
okay so circular cross-section hexagonal
we don't really care so seventh possible
but we are using the fact that some of
the pencils have finite length because
the end they're touching so that then
you say hmm you know it's just a matter
of the pencils all have the same length
and I made a very bad mistake about a
year ago because I googles and what I
saw horrified me I shouldn't have Google
I should have used my brain because I
missed something important so I'm
telling you it is possible to do eight
some Googlers finding your stuff
if the Texans have differently you can
get age what about the pencils are
infinitely long infinite cylinders
how many infinite sitters could mutually
touch now you can certainly get three
you can probably get four here about the
five and the six not so obvious the
pictures are showing you certainly would
not work if the pencils were infinitely
low so you know you have to rethink re
redo things well that's an interesting
question little would actually ask this
question the book he published in 1966
he said can seven infinite cigarettes be
arranged so that each touches all the
others and this was an open problem now
gathering for gardener happens every two
years of the last gathering for gardener
three guys get up on stage and very
excitedly announced the solution we
didn't know the answer until quite
recently the paper was actually
previewed in 2013 so we know as of 2013
that yes you can get seven infinite
cylinders and they did it using a lot of
computer time well they set up twenty
polynomial equation the twenty variables
you know cylinder can be modeled by your
x squared plus y squared equals a
constant and then you have to be able to
put them at different angles in 3-space
and you know it's it's it's not so
linear algebra several equations and
server variables that are quadratic but
not linear so you have to use other math
techniques
maybe grub nor basis but it was
complicated and it took a lot of
computer time but I found two solutions
quite early in the search and the the
fact that they found too early in the
search means was probably a lot more I'm
going to show you a picture of one of
them it's weird because it's not
remotely symmetric now you see ends
there but that's irrelevant
I just couldn't print the I couldn't you
know the slide wasn't big enough to
contain the infinite ones but we're out
using the end the touching has nothing
to do with the end now here's the
fascinating thing and this just boggles
my mind this could have been discovered
many many times before by a kid
I'm fish with some straws mommy mommy
mommy no anybody could have come up with
that right just cluster them together in
their hand that the mighty just happened
that they charged and yet it took all
the king's horses and all the king's men
a lot of computing time to figure out
that was possible so even in 3-space you
know our
grasp of fish is not as firm as you
might think it's kind of surprising can
you do eight is there a mathematical
reason in terms of you know the algebra
why you can't do eight nine ten here's
the best result known the most you could
ever have would be 24 probably not I
mean it probably would be lower than
that but we can't prove that
well we're absolutely sure that you
can't get 24 or more but we don't know
if you get 19 or 9 it's crazy so we
thank you so we got we got we got the
five we got the seven and we're not
quite sure but a nice quote here from
Dana Richards the aha moment you know
you think of that and you spot on you so
you got it and then it raises new
questions this cycle of you know
enlightenment and new questions and
that's kind of what Martin engenders in
many generations of people
Dana Richards is the bibliography and
biographer now is there a three by three
magic square of squares Euler famous
mathematician a long time ago 1770 came
up with this example of a four by four
so a magic square means that add up all
the rows and columns and diagonals and
perhaps some other things you get the
same constant but each number in the
square has to be a square and that makes
it extra complicated so I came up with a
solution for a four by four Magic Square
of squares distinct squared if you make
me the same it's not very interesting
but he wasn't sure about three by threes
and people have been worrying about this
ever since and quite recently only a
decade ago a guy called Christian Boyer
came up with five by five and six by six
and seven by seven examples but we still
don't know about three by three nobody's
ever found one I know he's ever proved
it's impossible and trust me they've
tried with numbers up to you know five
gazillion so don't try it with your you
know it's been tested if there's a
solution it's way out there way out
there so Martin Gardner offered a prize
for this a nobody nobody's claimed it
yet and I will speak off the record on
behalf of the family that if somebody
nails this I'm fairly confident that the
family's estate will ponying up 100
bucks so go for it this would be the
most famous hundred bucks he ever made
there's a related question by the way
about magic squares for all the elements
or primes and there was a breakthrough
in that more recently that was hard for
a while too so here's the best three by
three example everybody's come up with
these saddles is a British engineer
lived in Holland and he came up with
this example of it's almost right but it
turns out that all the rows and columns
and sums are twenty one thousand
somebody not and except the top left to
bottom right diagonal one messes up you
can also get solutions where everything
adds up right but one of the numbers
isn't a perfect square so like little
compromise you can do it but if you want
to get it perfect we're not quite sure
those numbers are obviously too small we
know there's no solutions for you no
numbers up to very large numbers okay
here's the last problem I'm gonna ask
you Martin Gardner asked this question
in 1990 25 years ago what is the minimal
surface area inside a transparent cube
that'll render it opaque this room is
not a cube it's very long but it's
pretended to cube right we're gonna
squish you all into a star today we're
gonna stretch the roof a bit imagine
it's a cube
what a system of interior walls would we
have to erect sort of ceiling on the
floor on the four walls were all glass
no light beam could pass through want to
block all light beams well you could
just take the four walls on the floor
and just you know duplicate them with
interior walls leave the ceiling open so
five cubic units if everything one by
one by one would work you can do better
than that maybe you could put a diagonal
wall across here a diagonals in that
corner that corner and I did the roof or
the ceiling so you can cut down it turns
out that any question I did in three
dimensions you might say well let me
first go back to the 2d version and see
if I can solve that so let's back off to
two dimensions so we're talking about a
square we're gonna square and you want
to start light rays from from passing
across the square well the two diagonal
walls would work and they have a length
of two root two
actually that's the picture on the left
the picture on the right here is a
little better
those two mysterious points it almost
looks like a full bit of envelope are
called steiner points and this here has
the property that it's the most
efficient interior road network the
shortest interior road network
connecting the four corner cities or
towns so that seems like a better deal
and it comes out to be 1 plus root 3
which is 2 point 7 3 down from 2.83
we're making
or are we well it turns out you can do
better and the one I'm going to show you
now is 2.64 we've come down a bit but
it's really surprisingly not some
symmetry but it's also disconnected
wouldn't a very good road network
wouldn't recommend it for driving um
I'm Ken Brockie who developed the
surface vulvar about 25 years ago came
up with this and you know I come in look
like a flapping door so I say that's it
leaves the door open for the possibility
of future proven this is the best we've
known we know we just don't know if we
can do better this is a square we can't
even solve it for a square the matter of
fact we don't even know the answer for a
triangle think of a mercedes-benz symbol
right Steiner point in the middle that's
believed to be the best first for a
triangle but we don't know we're not
sure so we can't even do it for a
triangle a triangle astonishing how hard
can it be
well here's the best solution for the
three but for the three-dimensional and
Canberra he came up with this this is
like a tent or something and it's highly
non symmetric and this was 1991 or so
and we don't know no 24 years since
we've made no progress on this and
answers Martin's original question so
these questions he asked posed you know
got people going on research here's a
very simple one one of Martin's
favorites can you change the raf into a
different giraffe by moving just one
toothpick but I promised you I'd go back
to the problem about the Tuesday so
that's let's look at this so I'm going
to show you the solution and I'm going
to invite everybody in the room to close
their eyes if they haven't already
solved it and I'm hoping to see lots of
closed eyes and but if you want to see
it I'll just let you look at it silently
but you're better off solving yourself
later so by the way that problem Gary
fasciae spoke it but it's due to two
mathematicians with PhDs Mike Starr Mike
and Tom starboard brothers so here's the
solution okay so close your eyes we
don't see it and I'll point to something
here for those who who are looking this
is the key thing here when you just have
the sample space there's something you
have to pay attention and go oh uh huh
hmm well in that case hmm look at the
answer if you're looking not the number
you expect it
Hey
okay you can look up now please we got a
minute to go
Bob Chris who's a philosopher wrote a
great piece on Martin Centennial in
physics world last year and he said
googling is not the gardener way yes
look up Google to find out about the
game of life but don't Google to find
out the answer to questions and our
students do that of course they do that
and that's the problem because if you
actually try to discover something
yourself you learn a lot more Randi sent
a great comment last night that he was
once asked is Martin Gardner one person
or maybe Isaac Asimov I murray gell-mann
combined the man was so prolific of so
many fields there were people in a
pre-internet era who weren't quite sure
that the guy was real say maybe it's a
pseudonym for you know a pool of talent
he was one guy so every October November
with the celebration of Mines happen and
they happen because people make them
happen and I mean you your friends your
family even your enemies so please
consider running one it can be to do
with anything Martin was interested in
is the website where you can register
the website where you can get ideas we'd
love to see more Google affiliated ones
there's cards over here if you didn't
get them there's Scott Kim's design of
course the top it says Martin Gardner
said immersion mind the same thing in
four different fonts but you turn them
upside down and they say four completely
different things the existence of any
one of these is threatening miraculous
the existence of four that are kind of
similar one way in completely different
other way there's an extra miraculous
you can pick up copies there I'll leave
you with this gym props said that before
there were search engines there was
Martin Gardner when scientists and math
we wanted to find out stuff they often
wrote to Martin Gardner he was a hub he
would take stuff and send it back to
somebody else and that's kind of the way
things worked until you know we moved on
to the modern era so I thank Google for
providing this opportunity for me to
come speak to you today and thank you
very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
