years ago i came to united states with
the search of glory and who knows what
else I really wanted to learn film and
television I went to New York University
and I was accepted from 350 people that
try to get in in 1980 only 31 we are
accepted only later on our discover that
a tree the tree instructor that was
actually checking us out or evaluate our
ability there were Martin Scorsese's
Francis Coppola and with the island I
did not know any of them in eighteen
none of us know any of them right anyway
but that was a long story there's a long
time ago so put his perspective well I
want to drive a taxi let's look most
Israelis or foreigner and today we'll be
in the Indian and Pakistani in' will do
it I want to drive a taxi in New York
for six months till eventually I had
enough money and I started the company
and what I wanted to do really is
involve myself in the water and in
underwater photography to tell the story
about the ocean and what I knew about
the ocean during the time that was
driving a taxi i was driving the taxi at
night and during the daytime i was
working as a diving guide or dive master
at the dive shop in New York City how
many diver we have here beautiful how
many of you are photography also holding
the camera underwater doesn't make any
difference what camera that's okay I
started from there and that's okay
that's perfectly alright so if I speak
fast is only because I picked my English
in New York driving a taxi so please
forgive me if my xn is difficult I don't
believe you because there are thirty
percent of Silicon Valley's of Israelis
anyway so you already been in business
this is really one time or another so to
make the long story short what I'm here
really is to be able to share with you
the story in the privilege that America
gave me I was privileged or every
privilege perhaps and visited over a
hundred thirty one nation all around the
world and believe me there is no country
in the world like this country no matter
how difficulty no matter what the
obstacles the challenges we have there
is no country in the world
and there is no Constitution like we
have in America and no surprise we reach
this level I was able to master what
you're going to see now only because
other the country the substance of this
country the foundation and the people
that believe in my dream and participate
and join me as a photographer down two
ways to go about it either you go you
create a portfolio you send it to so
many different places to get work or you
go out and execute your own vision my
own dream i chose the last 1i chosen to
work after my own dream and make it
available however in the process what
become very clearly that institution
like magazine television stations and
network were concerned that they were
not able to get the money where's for my
vision and for my dream so I went and I
did it alone trusting that people like
yourself or other in America will join
me will participate in what my dream is
because I'm not any different than any
one of you we all have dreams but some
of you and me they have similar dreams
and we can join venture so i put my
expertise in the field you put your
expertise about the pixels and all those
done on technology i put it out in the
big animals so let's go and see what I
have in store for you what you're going
to see today is an ontology of years and
almost 30 years of having fun pushing
the envelope photographing on the edge
of wilderness comfort and common sense
and i'm not saying that lightly i
desired very much to come back again and
thank you vivian again for the
opportunity to work with people like
yourself and to share because you are on
the edge of technology yes you have all
the comfort in the world but you're
putting your pushing the envelope in
what you do and that is fascinating how
we connect some of the elements in your
life some elements of my life and some
of the elements of somebody else and get
make a better life and the idea in my
view in my presentation today is to be
able to show you how to bring to your
knowledge not a specific trip not a
specific picture but just the
conglomerate issue of what the big
animal but the position they have in our
culture
what we can do each one of our self
small world or big world to protect them
and to make them to make them available
to view for future generation and that
will be just a glory for the big animal
that's how most of the time when we
short like that is very unusual for me I
could not even put it in my pants
because I'm too fat by now I'm not in
the water for a long time ago not long
not long enough but only decks and this
weekend I'm living from Mexico diving
was a great white for about two weeks
and that is my backyard and all those
places that you see here are the places
where images and expedition that I'll
conduct or I'm conducting all around the
world so if you go sometimes sooner or
later and to my website you'll be able
to see all those places one by one as
they are relating and we'll start with
the polar bear and all of you won't
probably head and we may unknowns what
the polar bear plight and all the story
about the global warming it is indeed
taking effect and we don't know what
will be the next generation the next
step however what is important to know
that the polar bear our ancestors of the
grizzly and they are evolved into be
polar bear only three hundred thousand
years ago it is not something they take
like sharks that living in the ocean for
100 million years polar bear only evolve
in the past three hundred thousand years
ago so there are process the planet is
on constant continuous change continuous
evolution canoes and we are part of it
right now but to understand how the
polar bear leave and to get close to
that that's what I do and that's what we
bring in people a small group my team
usually about only four people when we
got to look at the polar bear and we'll
give you a few opportunity so you ask me
how close I was of the polymer almost as
close as I am to the front row right now
understanding that every animal mchugh
minh being we have a pattern of behavior
we have tools of how we protect how we
feed how we make babies also animal have
the same pattern similar pattern and the
polar bear in this case its pattern all
its protection is the sense of smell so
if the wind goes away from the polar
bear he will not smell when
get close to it the question is how
often I can do it it take a long time
you not you know challenge the
environment and against the environment
you just play together with the wind
till it happened so usually a trip like
that may take two or three weeks but
we're able to achieve result as you see
right now everything is timely
everything in the environment is about
time is about knowing exactly when the
polar bear on this case the animal is on
nurturing when they are mating where the
migrating and when they are feeding if
we know if I know all of these that's
what I take the people with me on the
trip for small window of opportunity
throughout the year that's why I don't
repeat the same trips the same trip each
year that only 13 / the car in every
other month but we be able to bring this
plan of opportunity this kind of images
you can we ask somebody turn some of the
light down so maybe the images will be
seen better and I want also to thank you
on the water not just stop side and I
want to share with you this anybody
knows what is that anybody yes that's
very good Leon thank you that's the blue
one and what do you know about the blue
one anybody any idea big how big the
biggest animal ever lived on a planet
biggest in any mm any dinosaurs how big
is it really how long how long 60 feet
any other number 100 feet long yes and
it only plankton there used to be about
other quarter of a million blue animal
planet today how many left anybody knows
hardly twelve thousand seven thousand of
them in the southern hemisphere about
5,000 on the northern hemisphere and
from the 5,000 in northern hemisphere
about Rita 2,500 3,000
the cost of Mexico Baja California
California and Washington State why
because we have the mammal the the
mammal protection law in the United
States that also extend into Mexico and
extend further up to Canada so
protection and when we apply the
protection it's very helpful to support
the existence of the animal and
especially the big one and that's what
you see really how big is this edible
that's aerial photography of course the
blow of the blue will reach almost over
30 feet 10 meter tall anybody knows what
is that it's beluga whales what they
call the country of the sea and what is
that what is that there's no killa well
there's no such things this is how we
use the language and how we are
mystified things and how we create bad
reputation too many of the animal
because of lack of knowledge via the
enemy of fear number one is lack of
knowledge workers are actually dolphins
they're not even wells there are truth
dolphins the name Killah well had been
adapted to the outcome only because the
Englishman that came to translate the
manifest of the Spanish galleons of the
14 15th century and could not give it
any other name because the Spaniard and
the Portuguese with the rock in the
manifest the looking at an animal that
actually killing other wells so they
call it killa well they did not give her
the name yet oka only later on when we
start to do research when we started the
role of University along the course of
Canada and Washington in Norway and
other parts of the world then we give
them name today we know there about five
different species of all kinda wild two
of them still unidentified in Antarctica
and the other tree that we know of a
resident transient enorme
in each one of them is different in the
world which how they behave which had
the search of the social formation and
how they feed those images are from
Norway when we see mostly actually a
transitive not transient we see resident
orcas resident of the feed mostly on
fish and their group of about 12 to 15
of them but they're all of all of them
all of the circulation the dolphin and
wells are actually led by females and
something with the orgasm and there is
not even one not even one accident ever
happened in the wild between oka and
mankind the only time there was an
accident anybody knows where so let's
close them because that's bad reputation
are necessarily and they play without
the need to have trainer and whistle and
all kind of toy they play freely in the
world this was a moment of really
unforgettable moment in the history in
my in my case being in a world for as
long as I've been and all of the sudden
we had sunset in one hand moonrise on
the other hand and the Orca just pressed
in under the mountain at the front of
the moon in Norway anybody Rose was no
ways of course we have google and a
little bit of the sunset together with
locals and everybody knows what is that
oh well
humble well humpback whales or only
sixteen thousand of them
metal Dane why not to pull an Armenian
Howie knowledge that means I don't know
for sure but I can tell you a quote from
research and from all the environmental
organization and the take place but
especially after the care of the Soviet
Union we were able to get into the
record of the Soviets of the Finland of
the Norwegian and the Iceland fishermen
from the early part of the previous
century and then we'll be able to put
all the number together how many they
have actually hunted not just the number
they gave at a time publicly but get
into the record and only then find out
really how many at least they've hunted
in addition to what we have today the
science and the researcher came to
approximate numbers and this is the
number as I mentioned today we have more
accurate information about working but
left in the world again not not
specifically but much more accurate in a
ten to twenty percent margin of error
but we have about 16 to 20 thousand
compared to half a million and this is a
result for hunting and today there is no
reason for that whatsoever although the
Norwegian and Icelandic in the Russian
and
japanese original reason if they call it
we can swim with them just like mr.
Humbert just like with the orcas just
like we close with a polar bear
understanding we can also actually
snorkel actually lost Cuba no busy no
wait Justin our own error be able to
snorkel with them because not killing is
perhaps the best activity to meet the
big animals just like for us men be
gentle is the easiest way to get to any
human if we want to nobody laughing
anymore simply because big animal are
most vulnerable when they are on the
surface then a surface because they need
to breathe and when the devil there is
the only time when we can really match
and get close to them and the moment
they get to the water that took the
breath and the word underwater after the
fight the first five feet there is no
way for us human ever to which to get
them because they're much faster
stronger than us but when they were the
surface and that's all a question of
timing and coordination that's why any
of the expedition I laid the
photographic expedition for the animals
are with small group with only four to
six people only to get the maximum
result and the ability not to affect the
animal and not to really impose on them
only two people at a time as we send to
the water so the enema would be too
active with us like in these images or
luck with this image this is a single
among the wells the humpback whale is
the only one the male actually seeing to
attract the female toward him and in the
water has mentioned it before the water
are three of eight hundred times denser
than air so let me ask you that where
will be the best acoustic place in the
world Carnegie Hall the opener house in
sydney or underwater underwater 360
degrees ate her time themselves any
vibration that this that this singer
humpback whale will do your heart will
pump together with the music it will be
actually echoing in the vacuum or in the
air space that you have in your lung is
absolutely stunning
and mother and calf again as I mentioned
is all question of timing to know and
all animal and you see that the pattern
repeat itself other among the occurs
among the polar bear and among the
humbug well is about feeding but
migrating and about nurturing knowing
the right timing be able to bring this
kind of it encounters between you and
the animals and the animals who come
very close in anybody we said the we
have several photographer here this is a
very very wide angle lens matter fact is
the fisheye lens that mean that I was
less than 1 feet away from this juvenile
humpback whale that came in was very
curious what am i doing in water and
that is averaged 40 ton of animal lift
itself out of the water and we don't
know why there is no reason that human
can develop and we said the
communication removing parasite we
really don't know why but they can do it
and they doing it and that's the classic
of the tale of the hammock well dripping
water in Alaska we're moving right along
for another creature of a lot of
excitement and colors and those are the
dolphins there are about three dozen
different species of dolphin in the wild
and those are these are one in
particular are those are the bottlenose
dolphin in Galapagos this is the common
dolphin the Atlantic common dolphin in
South Africa of course this debate ball
where the dolphin are feeding on and
what is that what is that go ahead no go
ahead is good what do you think is that
it is indeed a selfish there are about 7
m 7,000 species of what they call the
billfish family down so Trish down blue
marlin they are Marland a striped marlin
white marlin sailfish maybe one more
that I forgot at the moment however
there was live with any pictures of
selfish
until about four years ago anybody knows
what happened four years ago it is he
bluebonnet remember was the first time
they brought stories of the blue planet
and the images of the of the start of
this selfish and I was about it actually
took them out there into Mexico to dive
actually off just about 15 minutes of
Cancun into the water of Isla Mujeres if
anybody been there and we'll know it's a
beautiful little island and very rustic
it was at a time but today is becoming
almost like a hub after cancun because
it becomes very popular among the
fishermen and among the diver a
photographer now everybody plunking out
there yes the fish is about nine feet
long and the bill is about one-third the
whole fish it is the fastest fish in the
ocean it clocked and over 75 mile per
hour faster than a cheetah on the land
it is fantastic but the only time to
catch those images in the world that you
see next is when actually coming by and
they're coming into Mexico to this
particular part of the water and my in a
particular time of deer in
january-february to feed on the
bazillion sardine and her you see is the
bait ball of the Sedin nobody knew and
you know a lot of fishermen going for
many many many years humming gray and
the rest been catching those selfish in
those Marlin in Cuba and Mexico in Peru
everywhere else but hardly anybody until
four years ago actually not hardly is
clearly nobody was a camera went to the
water about four or five years ago at
five years ago when i went i called the
BBC and when they did blue planet the
color okay put us together with the
story and we set up the set up and that
is the evidence we talking about
baitball baitball happened many
different parts of the world all the
time especially in remote island in this
case of Galapagos anybody been in
Galapagos before beside Vivienne you
have you been all the way in Darwin in
wolf then no then most dog Northern
Ireland you don't know there is two
Island up north of the quake two other
one
darwin in wolf the middle of nowhere 600
mile from any land and a half mile north
of Galapagos itself that part of
Galapagos and our own
most million that's the people side
there's no land they need to feed they
need they need food and the food is in
the water so all of those seat belts and
when you watch well enough you'll be
able to see eventually the birds feeding
and then the tuna fitting under water on
the bait ball and those are actually
yellow tell futuna
you
but we think
a fish actually use its bill like the
baseball bat use in a bread bowl game
they actually heat the bear the fish
with the bill the book looked at all the
time into the school but only one
selfish at a time all the other selfish
will wait till one finish and then come
the second one but moving very very fast
and just like this one anybody heard
about the BBC wildlife competition of
the year the photographer do you so
about three years ago this picture took
the first place in the other water
photography this was the moment as again
very fast fish very fast action and to
catch it when he took the bait or to
take the bait in its boss it was very
others against very lucky to be able to
capture it and bring it alive and this
picture take it actually from the side
of my shoulder that's no no manipulation
and no photoshopping and nothing any
other other elements it just the way it
is captured in camera at one time and
everybody seen debate and you see the
blood that actually already the finish
already bleeding between the two part of
the bill what is that great white what
does it do breaching out of the water it
was very unwise in a situation that was
up until seven or eight years ago nobody
knew or even knew about it nobody
reported or did anything about it this
actually happened only in South Africa
they are great one bridge also other
places but not to such an extraordinary
behavior the reason why exactly we don't
know but the purpose of the great white
breaching is because they are looking
after them actually seals that moving
out from the island in early part of the
morning so in order to do that after
year or two or three observing that it
become clear that the great white just
like all other predators like all other
master of their ability a very
conservative animal despite the power
despite the uniqueness ability that
nature gave it to them
they are not many eater they're not see
anything they see they are very
methodical there is an island just off
side of cape town called seals island
about 45 to 60 thousand scenes on it
come January and they give birth de
Silva the population give birth the
progression rise to about almost 60,000
the adult will have to go to see to
bring more fish for them for food rajat
lie this is where the most migration of
a big bigger sales go out to see the
shark will arrive around Seal Island
around May June and wait for the
opportunity since Island it is
relatively deep go to the water with the
resume a steep cliff goes to about 40 60
feet before we reach the bottom and
that's how the rise out of the surface
the great white patrol around on it
especially held morning hours and
exactly like all cell phone when
Wednesday forgot to add to see early
morning and late afternoon when the
shark operate early morning late
afternoon why the Sun hardly her eyes
over the horizon the angle of the Sun
over the horizon is the angle of
penetration into the water the light so
the lesser the lesser the angle or the
more angle lesser lesser activity but a
shark can see there is a light of the
surface the show
the surface the seal cannot see the
shark underwater because he's not enough
light beside the shock on a Becket at
the back of it is Doug or what like the
water totally stellt the shark will go
straight up 40 feet to accelerate and to
catch the seal they still don't know
what he did come the light eight nine
o'clock in the morning the operation or
the nature went to sleep until later on
for five o'clock in the evening again in
order to be able to do that we had to
emulate the behavior of the seal and we
Toby heard about the dummy a plastic or
rubber dummy about 20 feet away from the
boat and wait for the moment for the
shock to jump out and here you go so
three years ago in the BBC competition
the whole deal this also had the first
place in animal behavior and rockefeller
close to the animal and to bring really
the behavior and be able to put almost
not almost I put actually the camera was
in the mouth of the shark and take it
away and be able to bring the images
back because understanding outer shell
cooperate and that's because of this
understanding I next week as Vivian nose
and hopefully she'll join me next year
when we go to Mexico and that was a
great white there is one thing that all
operator do continuously including the
discovery we do the very unethical
things it is challenging the shark
actually teasing them in irritating them
by putting blood and Chum in the water
attract them to the camera but if you
don't put a chum or blood and not take
it away from them the shock will kill
less and they will swim around me just
like I'm a piece of nothing in the water
and you don't believe me all right let's
see that's the animal that was captured
our imagination there's the animal that
the media wanted to use so badly that's
the image discovery views this exact
image in 93 they used as a poster the
turn at vertical they make it a positive
and all other the foremost buses and all
of the New York California and the text
Chicago to promote the chocolate but the
truth of the matter is that we don't use
blood because this is the prey what you
see here are the seals well that's what
the feed on if we don't use charm and
blood in order we can sit on the edge of
comfort and against common sense because
there is nothing to do with what we've
been fed we can swim properly freely
safely with a great white however it
will not be too bravado or to machos or
imposing our superiority perhaps
superiority over the wilderness on a
contrary living with all with the
wilderness like making love to nature
make love with nature nature will be
able to show some most amazing moment
just like this
and this is not again not touched and
not expanded and not been blown it is a
50 millimeter lens especially I use this
lens in order to bring the image of the
shock undistorted all photographer know
and if you don't know of any time you go
to movies and you see anything lenses
have the ability actually to distort the
images there is depth of field there is
shallow depth of field a lot of the
field and distort the images because of
what they call the false perspective but
when you take a 50 millimeter lens which
is almost like exactly what we see in
our own eyes you'll be able to get this
particular images and that's a picture
that one of my client took of me
swimming with a great white last year
face to face is I'm closest to people on
the front row and that's the image
regarding my camera and I allow the
shock to come even closer to admit is
another photographer let's even close
half the distance between us two and
that's the image I got then so if the
movie created such memories in our mind
I have to do to try to do the same thing
in but the opposite remove this negative
and be able to under to share with you
the knowledge how this happened and how
to avoid it or what to participate if
you want to participate as a positive
effect on your life on the life of the
animal and the life of nature but not
only to the great white we can come even
closer with this anybody know about is
that the world shark how big is the
world shock huge how you just huge is
not as you just Google but how you just
huge is about 40 45 feet long one of the
three or four different species of shark
they treat only on plankton and is the
largest of all the shark species
so it does not have to eat meat in order
to be lounge you can eat plankton and
you're the largest which is bring
another problem all together it is not
necessarily the place right now but the
overfishing of plankton in the Southern
Ocean in the run antarctica by the
country like the Soviet Union China and
other and they used it mostly for
fertilization and food for their animals
animal stacks that is becoming a problem
because they aren't competing
practically with the albatross which I
don't decline and of course with all the
large well the Blues decide the dephine
well the hum back and all of all of the
other world that actually go to the
Antarctica to feed during the summertime
in Antarctica summertime I wintertime
and here the example of the size of this
mouth of this animal together with the
diver just that beside that it could
swallow it very easily but it does not
really happen we can imagine whatever we
want to imagine and of course these
stories and this stigma of this very
place don't look like of them of the
Hammerhead chunks out of Galapagos when
you see them in great numbers sometimes
hundreds together but very unusual shape
of the head and the eyes all together by
it by the side but they come very very
close to the reef and they are waiting
for the actually for the butterfly fish
to come and to clean them and the open
maslak just like we see it in a barber
shop and a bubble shop waiting for the
opportunity to somebody come clean and
give us a good time and you are
but that's the drama that you're looking
for let's the event a phenomenal event
that you're looking for the schooling
unhead sometime hundred to a thousand it
could be 35 some time up to 78 minutes
parade of those school and they are
gonna distance between me and the third
the second or the third or from here all
this all these everybody knows what is
that ray what kind of rain there are
mobile a race now not mantis there are
mobilized there are smaller in size and
freed also implanted and they move in a
big crowd in this case about 40 or 50 of
them at one time of the course of
galapagos island again and this is the
monterey this is the oceanic montorio
the giant monterey almost 20 feet from
wingtip to wingtip and this is not a
selfish what is that stripe marlon
strived yes it's a marlin and then start
model about almost 12 feet by three feet
larger than a selfish and again the bill
is about one-third of the fish the fish
length now as fast as the selfish and
you can find them in exactly opposite
side of mexico if the selfish was not
found out in the caribbean the marlin
we'll find out in that land in the
Pacific of cabo san lucas and let's see
how the mall and feed the marlin free a
little bit different then then the
selfish and as you see is the modern
here coming to the school actually he
uses bill like we use the chopsticks
anybody knows how to eat chopsticks you
remove one sushi at a time right look at
the free picture is not very clear
unfortunately but in on a beige of the
bill you will see one of the sardine and
then it took it is the last day of
daylight of this sardine
it is fun being in the water is joy the
water actually will carry you as long as
you not not fight with it just let the
let the water do what the water does and
get along with it the water will just
carry you like being in a room of them
of the mother seventy percent more of
our planet is ocean seventy percent of
the planet is giving us over fifty
percent of the oxygen that we breathe on
and we polluted it girl know anybody
probably most of you heard about the
plastic island that we have somewhere in
the middle of the Pacific Ocean all the
way to Japan and all the pollution that
we throw into the water factories from
all over the country including the
United States and all the other
developing country we have to do
something about it because there is no
place is beautiful and look at these
images look at this coloration look at
the animal that suffering animal that we
can relate to they have our size or
turtle we can relate to one to one they
are happy to be where they are how can
we continue contaminate or really
continue avoid playful with them they
are part of a playground this is I
showed you the world of the map of the
world that's my playground I don't have
to go to your sanity only the ocean the
rest of the world is our playground and
there are beautiful things in order to
play with like those seals in the kelp
of South Africa or the narwhal out in
the High Arctic
or the pink dolphin from the Amazon
River even the Anaconda I know the movie
create such a drama and subject is a
piece of cake fortunately understanding
it anaconda doesn't feed underwater they
feed on the land but they don't fit
under one and then we'll do nothing with
swimmers them 24 feet long animal this
is how we find some of the animals in
the ocean we cannot see into the water
but we can use the same understanding
that the old generation hand we don't
need sophistication and we don't need a
Google ocean to find out where are the
selfish because Google Elijah doesn't
know unless I tell them and that's what
happened when you look from the surface
into the water half / half under the
birds on top The Selfish of the bottom
and between them are the baitball or are
the sardines going to Antarctica we're
not necessarily going to we are not
necessarily going to be like Titanic's
it happened once in history we learn the
lessons we dive under the ice which is
like driving in a palace
and we see this amazing vistas of the
continent it's totally frozen it goes
through changes like everything else it
goes all the changes but we have the
gear we have the equipment we are
knowledgeable and this exists if you
just reach out a little bit farther away
from the normal life and be able to do
those things they're very unusual things
and to see these unusual places look how
small we are under this planet that
corrosion and is the edge of the ice and
what we see under the ice those
jellyfish that's how the old generation
were looking at listening to Wells and
before they arrived into the crack in
the ice does the Inuit guide and with
those guys we working in the field on
the edge of wilderness to be able to
bring different kind of experiences
rather than drive in the freeways of
America or sitting in starbuck we
sitting on the edge of the ice in a tent
for three weeks looking for polar bear
or looking for the novel and those are
the guys be able to tell us exactly
because they don't have navigation
hardly having a satellite for the world
can go and the walruses and the lonely
and warrants that went to die and she
moved away just like the Indian and
American Indian you live that she lived
ahem and go by herself into father were
in the eyes and look at the size of
those tusks she's was probably about 11
or 12 years old which is the maximum
that one of us can leave and she went to
die by herself away from everybody else
and mother and calf
on the edge of comfort wilderness and on
the edge of noise 250,000 of king
penguin of the island of South Georgia
I'm sorry for my English believable just
my staggering from the smell from the
noise and from the vistas altogether and
the only one place on the planet you see
something like that and is one of the
most beautiful island you will ever see
and that is them you collect them
alcohol the grandiose as the stand up as
we lower ourselves down is about 30 inch
but 30 inch tall 32 inches tall lay
myself down and look at the mountain
behind which almost 2,000 feet and the
penguin in front of us they are the king
they I'll just give you a chest that's a
reason to leave there's a reason to
breathe to do something so possibly the
hoop designed anything like that with
those colors with those wings and able
to swim in the water and to work on the
land all at the same time
looking for predators waiting to be
eaten but there is a predator warming
around the eyes and the only one of its
kind and we are all ready to catch each
picture we all ready for the moment and
that's what know anybody knows what is
that leopard seals the only predator
that is in Antarctica and actually very
interestingly only during two months in
feed on penguins on meat on mill on meet
the rest of the time of the year the
freedom Plantin and look the size of the
teeth the canine teeth and the grinding
teeth at is animal god mother nature is
very very unique the animal look like a
place toric in the nine feet nine to 12
feet long and it is powerful and as fast
so agile is second that we never seen
anything like that and very curious by
us diver being together in the water
with them they are perfect hunter but is
also perfect places for people like all
of us clear freshwater and 300 foot
visibility or more the same notice in
Mexico and of course among the big
animal we cannot forget the gorillas out
in Rwanda or the lion and buffalos and
the Guru Guru crater in Tanzania anybody
knows what is that and what is this what
is this this is the cheetah and so what
is that leopard right while we're
getting somewhere and I'm getting away
from you guys this is on them anybody
knows Argentina peninsula valdes anybody
heard about potential evidence a world
heritage site is actually a peninsula
completely uncomplete lee close to or
stop to be developed by the world by the
by the by the World Heritage Foundation
and there are only
one for one particular reason there are
group of okras that still the only place
in the world which they will come in and
feed by stranding themselves on the
beaches and take the seeds out of the
beach and if you seen the latest movies
of Disney and there are some section
from this particular placement oh come
on the beach and take the animals away
once and every two or three years I run
a special trip out there and that's the
edge of the place in peninsula valdes
and then one of the Gauchos there had a
riding horse and since I mean Israeli is
the only one that let me write on a
horse and with this I guess I'm going
just to get another native images from
the island of Palawan Island of yup in
the Pacific and let you know that all
these images are taken actually the
natural setting and all the animals
depicted here are free and wild none of
them been fed none of them been trained
none of them in captivity all in the
wilderness and all out there somewhere
in the ocean that you can be able to see
if you'll join me if you are if you're
interested in any of the trips or the
photography or expeditions or want to
know more one of the best place to find
information is one of the best place
beside National Geographic or lower is
to find from on my website big animals
come alright any questions yes yes trip
that you can join this open that's open
to the public that's the reason I asked
you if any of you please before you
leave just fill me up the this car that
I left with you I'll be able to continue
to be in touch with you as today as you
know today by the nada media but the
network or the server are not allow us
to send mass mailing to people unless
people give us the permission to use and
to send you an email I cannot do that
anymore otherwise they will not let if
they if your email is not certified that
I've received it from you I cannot use
it so if you want to receive information
I'll be delighted to send you but only
through these clouds any more questions
yes only in my heart I was hurt once and
that is a result only of human error I
was hurt worse by actually by walrus
when you operate with the walrus you
need to have a need to have always a
backup which means somebody watching my
back because as you saw in the images
divorce is mostly on an iceberg but
there are other ones this was coming
back home and usually mother and calf
that's the season so we got off the boat
I got first with my camera and ready to
go and the safety diver and supposed to
come behind me he did and I did not pay
attention or continue moving because
when you are with a camera you go into
work your safety divers supposed to be
behind you he went to the water but
unfortunately he lost his tank the tank
was full of them of their carry of the
BC so he was delay getting to me I did
not know that I'm looking at the looking
at the toward the iceberg where there
was as well and all of the sudden I felt
something strange but you know you
sometime you have a six or seven cents
on nine cents the hair out in your bag
stand up and you know something is wrong
and I look to my side and this female
was very very close to hurt me and share
the cub we sell so she clearly going for
me because she was very close with the
task if I would stay where I am all this
area will be the most sensitive area of
humankind will be affected I turned my
butt and she she nub me on my butt she
made a hole in a dry suit and then I got
flooded with water mother Padma or Aaron
my bc and she came again but second time
she came again I turned around and then
we had a distance and I could raise my
head with my leg was my friend and it
was a diesel between us she understood
that I'm not after her she continued
went and I took a picture and she went
home
but that's the only time that really
will get close to be helped it is that's
what I do that's what people do when I
have over 30 years of immaculate record
but managing risk well as republic as i
mentioned to you before I'm from Israel
I was an officer in the military about
almost 12 years and special forces
managing risk it is what we do what we
learn to do it doesn't make any
difference is not necessarily be uniform
it's not necessarily to be guns as
noticeable it is knowing understanding
what the risky are facing and how to
manage it and to avoid it but how to
reach the goal that you want to despite
this element is knowledge is the enemy
of all fear and that's the key the more
knowledge the more experienced in the
field every time pushing the envelope
just one step before let the envelope
break because if you blow in a too hard
with brake push it one step at a time
and be able to see the result measure it
and move again and retreat if you need
to retreat it is a very proud things to
do retreat it is not a defeat and defeat
is when you're not be able to stand here
and share with you the experiences any
more question yes it is about being a
long time in the field yes just being in
the field I did not learn than any other
way i did not have sorry to say or good
to say i did not of education but the
education was in a lock of the real lock
of life i paid dearly for that but again
thankful America for the ability I
borrowed the money i was able to return
playback and that's what give me the
chance to learn being in the field and
if you read the bio vivian put together
in any of the trip i read as a
businessman I realized in order for me
to gain anything I had to have the
leader of the world in their businesses
other marine biology research
photography to be co-host with me on the
trip and learn from them while I went
along yes
you just said it you just as on yourself
very very close to the subject you
cannot have you cannot have powerful
enough strop to match the light from the
from the Sun when you work with wide
angle lens versus working with the macro
wide angle is when you capture a lot of
space you have to count on the ambient
light distribution is only like a
painter bring a brush over just to
highlight several elements you touch a
very interesting point and I'll take one
more minute I learn photography not in
photography classes not in photography
school not from any photographer I learn
from the people which they picked which
their prints or images sell for millions
anybody can give me two names of three
names of people that the picture or
prints sell for millions million are the
best teacher in the world and those
pictures are for free you go to any
Museum in the world you can sit for
hours watch not what they try to tell
you as a photographer but only how the
paints the light guys painter have the
difficult how the difficult job to do
they have only white canvas they had to
create everything to put on the
conference the color of the position the
composition everything else as an
underwater photographer I have exactly
opposite challenge I have the most
creative for the painter in the world
and create on so he put everything in
the water the only thing we did not put
in the water is the white light because
the water light absorbed through the
water very fast and first 30 feet you
don't see any more red no yellows and
only green and blue so as a photographer
might ask is how to bring the light out
and how to understand the light and the
second job is if I don't have a converse
so but what I have is a lens and to
select what part of the animal or the
scenery i see that i want to capture to
share with you
there's the power that's how I look at
it I was sitting hours honestly and
looking at the prints or painting of the
great painters to understand what
they've done and that's what they took
with me to the water but not cautious
and photographer because I don't think
you can learn photography unless you do
it and unless you put it out of the
market to sell and you see what people
react and how they buy and how they
react to the images as some of you
reacted today I cannot tell you about
images amiss because then i'll be very
sorry it is indeed the dilemma that all
photographer deal with because nobody at
home know what we went through or what I
gainful there are moment that we miss
but it's not the moment that we dwell on
is a moment when we learn the mistakes
or we learn what we did not know at the
time and how to make it better but I can
tell you the moment which I'm proud of
is like the bleaching great white or
like the one with the striped marlin
with the fish in its mouth is starting
Lee second to none and that is what
makes the difference in still
photography versus when you do video and
the Anaconda then the condom was
swimming in actually in barren bernal
river till eventually came over the
green grass and I was waiting for that
you take bet all the time with mother
nature so you miss a lot of different
things I missed several images of the
novel as they come into it as you saw
the novel with the task out there were
other images which I totally missed
there are images that of a polar bear
that actually was here I'll pray and put
his a pose over the plain roll it over
but I change lenses at the time you miss
but nobody know those images except we
have to live with it and we do next time
do better and better and better and
that's the challenge that's what kept me
doing it compared to being in the
military and wearing uniform and
commanding and running after but that's
the challenge the excitement and the
productivity and the beauty bring to the
world rather than sorrow and pain yes
oh the million-dollar question I really
don't know I know I don't take many
pictures while I'm shooting I don't take
many no I don't take many because it is
a mindset again remember the painter had
talked to you about then you what
they're going to paint davinci Angelo
Renoir Monet all of them were go sugar
they knew what they're going to paint
they elaborate about their painting
about the colors and what to do until
eventually they get what they want I
think the same because I start from
school of film not from the school of
digital digital can shoot 305 800,000
images in one cards I start with the
school of 36 frame so I to be very
methodical in the way which how what is
the subject of all to choose what I'm
looking for and the best photography in
my view and photo and icon images are
images that you saw before you
photographing or you thought you're
going to see and what happen is Mother
Nature in most time and actually out did
my own imagination and give me a present
bigger than any like the image of the
the image of the blue L on the back of
the cars you see the image of the blue
one with the clean open is an image that
I seen earlier in about 87 87 or 88 in
the National Geographic by flip nicklin
and as an image of a funeral across
across the two pages with the beautiful
sunset in in Baja I really wanted to
have this image oh really but as a good
person we don't copy we emulate we don't
copy so when I went eventually to behind
the mid-90 and try to get my own image
when the blue l was just an afford of us
I had to make a decision either i'm
going to take the picture of the whole
blue whale or half of it because he saw
big the lens could not take it or find
something else and all of the sudden
this blue one actually was resting on
the surface it allow me to think for a
moment and to be fast if I could because
that's the human element and move toward
the tail which is much
mom and powerful rather than the whole
body which will be very long and not
distinguish but over the tail and look
over the horizon and see the island and
that was a gift it is not something that
I could dream about I was him I was
impressed by the image that have seen an
87 but mother nature at the moment if I
was not open to receive the information
and given to me I will not see it i'll
just do the same thing as other people
did and move on but at the moment you
look and other opportunities always look
at other opportunities just like google
does honestly you guys or whether
managing and running and driving you
they are just brilliant never heard
about bait ball so that's mean that you
have to join me because that's what I'm
looking for the baseball is where the
action is most of diving trip most trip
period take people into places which is
very usual at very common and they put
you down to walk other to see the levada
to see the Eiffel or other to see jump
to the water if you go diving to see the
way if the call with the clownfish and
and they eels and solar so forth but
they are not focusing not willing to
take the risk to see something which is
not predictable baitball is not
predictable there is time and places
around the world it could happen that is
where I put my effort you'll have to
look for an operator that is really
looking for something like there to be
able to give you the opportunity oh why
is the ball because the small fish like
people when there is an explosion or run
together they hug each other for
protection so they all get together very
very tight the hope they will not be
taken by that by the Predators because
we'll be in the center of the group but
the group is turning around everybody
want to be in the center so is everybody
in and out in and out and that's the
baitball debate because the bigger fish
come feed on them then come the tuna and
then come the dolphin and then come the
Sharks and the birds from the top and
the photographer lakas can detect the
picture
any more question yes I love film I grew
up on film but there's no filmed yet
anymore all must be processed especially
slides to be processed and to get the
result and digital today really coming
to an age of excellent and delivering
delivering quality so is a toast it is
just because I raised on film and the
black and white and the color and we
liked some of the nuances that cut that
the film has but the dynamic range of
digital reaching to the level of the
quality of water indeed so in the next
year or two or three will have digital
perhaps even surprise film and we have
to deal with it if you heard about HDR
yes HDR putting some remarkable details
in images that we could not do in film
so there is a there is a positive
progression and increasing value and
increasing quality anymore guys sorry
I used to carry more than one camera yes
but in today because of the digital I
don't need you have 800,000 frames you
can shoot and don't study 2 gigabyte
cards you can do video at the same time
so is one one lens in my kind of work
specialty on the big animals so only one
camera when you go to roll to work on
the reef is different story because when
we work with big animal we are in the
open ocean is wild is wilderness the
encounter can be very short like maybe
30 seconds or can be even half an hour
but you have only one subject one big
subject to photograph so only one lens
will work well but when you work on the
reef is different story because there if
you have other elements that you can
photograph or being seal and will be
Seafarer will be a sponges will be the
clown fish will be M the fish giving
birth or get the fish laying eggs is
different at different cameras you want
to kill with you and also when you are
working on the reef you're going to show
the water 30 40 60 feet you can stay
much longer hour hour and a half two
hours if you have a matrix without
problem and then give you what you want
to have more cameras even digital yes
it's all is all in the line of work it's
like everything else you have a computer
and you have handheld and you have the
ipod that whatever the same thing in I
in the photography is only tools to do
the job and nobody's the job you want to
do or if you have fun and you have a
particular vision how to capture the
vision bring it alive thank you very
much or any more question who is coming
on a trip to LA this weekend we're going
to do a great white swimming in out of
the cage all right thank you very much
guys
