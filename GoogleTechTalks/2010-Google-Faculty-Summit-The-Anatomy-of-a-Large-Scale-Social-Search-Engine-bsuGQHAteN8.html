anatomy of a large scale social search
engine so Damon comes to us via Columbia
MIT and Stanford and after after a
master's in in AI from Media Lab I guess
wound up being kind of briefly seduced
by the dark side and doing a PhD in
actual philosophy but focusing on kind
of questions around natural language and
since then has gone on to do four
separate startups including most
recently a question and answering
company that you may have interacted
with called aardvark and that was
recently acquired by by Google so he's
going to tell us about experiences
building aardvark thank you Andrew so
Mike on everything sounds fine great so
so following up on the social theme I'm
gonna focus here on just one aspect of
social on social search and within
social search on one particular new
paradigm for social search which is the
aardvark paradigm um as we call it
having named it such this is a product
that built with my team it's been
running live now for over a year and the
material I'm gonna cover today is from a
white paper on aardvark social search
that I wrote with my good friend Seth
can bar who's with us here today for the
dub-dub-dub conference so let start with
a little motivation for what why one
would embark on a the project of coming
up with a new kind of search engine
think of this as our user the
contemporary user confused stressed
poorly dressed and and filled with
uncertainty questions constantly running
through the users mind these might be
things like when can I get out of here
and take a vacation where should I go
are there any good job of libraries for
xmpp
how can I politely tell the person next
to me if they have bad breath
just these are the things that are
constantly running through our mind and
if you think of us as stressed condition
of total uncertainty it's a marvel how
few queries we submit to search engines
of all the things that are passing
through your mind you know in the past
10 minutes which are those questions
have you then consulted a search engine
for there's a number but it's not nearly
as many as it could be
so why don't we use search engines more
so there are really three classes of
questions that I want to focus on here
as motivation for building a new kind of
search engine the first is subjective
questions so if you want to know an
objective fact like Einstein's birthday
or something like this that's pretty
easy to find right now in various kind
of online references but if you want a
personal opinion from somebody if you
want relationship advice or career
advice or recommendations about a
product you're thinking of buying
something along these lines your
background matters your particular
context matters you don't actually want
a generic answer you might not even
think of yourself as seeking the right
answer you're seeking an answer that's
right for you you're seeking a
subjective answer and we've noticed that
satisfaction ratings for search results
are lower for subjective questions than
for objective questions another class of
questions which might motivate
investigating a new kind of search
engine natural language question so it's
really nothing short of extraordinary
that kind of as a discipline we've now
trained a whole generation of users to
translate their thoughts into keywords
that's an unnatural act it's a
linguistic transformation of
extraordinary proportions and and it's
insufficient there are a lot of our
ideas which cannot easily be put into
key words there's a lot of our search
intent of our human intent that's not
captured in a few key words and when
people express their queries in full
natural language well that's very hard
for us to parse with automated systems
and then a third class of questions I'm
particularly interested in here are
questions that simply don't have answers
on the web the web is do use our
favorite prefixes join
Armus with billions of documents and so
forth but it's still only a tiny
fraction of all human knowledge if you
think in your own case of everything
that you know of everything that you've
ever experienced
about your hometown your feelings about
your mother your favorite food where you
had lunch yesterday all of that
information only a tiny fraction of it
have you actually offered and put online
even if you're the most prolific tweeter
most of it isn't online so we need to
say how can we get that information well
this is where you can find that
information it's inside people's heads
still it's locked inside your heads what
if a search engine could help get it out
so with these motivations I'm thinking
about us as overcome with questions that
were not all asking search engine
focusing on these three areas how could
you bring build a new kind of search
engine that would address these classes
of questions so to do that the approach
that we took was really to think about a
different conceptual model for what a
search engine is this is this is the
model of the web that traditional search
engines have the web looks the web is
basically a library it makes sense that
traditional search engines web search
engines have this view of the web
because information retrieval as a field
grew out of library sciences I'm so it's
inherited that conceptual model um in
the library paradigm for search you
search based on keywords or topics in
the Obey Dewey Decimal Classification
and what you're searching among is
content that has been authored in
advance this search is for an existing
answer and you try to find a keyword
that will direct you to tomes that have
something like that there's obviously
been enormously successful it
transforming the world as we know it but
it's still only one possible model for
how to think of the web here's another
way you could think of the web more
people oriented web behind every one of
those documents online there are people
there characters who are all interacting
in the real world and who have authored
that content so if you think about the
village paradigm for how when does
search as opposed to the library
paradigm well in the village
knowledge dissemination it's achieved
socially informations passed from person
to person so the retrieval task as it
were is going to find the right person
who has the information that you need
instead of finding the right document
answer your question the challenge of
course for the village paradigm is that
you don't always know who to ask and
maybe you don't have enough friends
accessible to you if you scan down you
know your list of neighbors or your IM
buddy list that might not be enough
people to answer your question about
XMPP libraries or about where to go in
Hawaii
um furthermore it's hard to keep up with
what everybody knows of all of these
people I don't I don't know who out
there is actually a ping-pong champion
and could advise me about ping pong
lessons and if I did know there's a
social cost in the asking them we're
gonna have to have a conversation I'd
have to catch up on everything that's
happened since we last talked they might
feel imposed upon and so forth so well
this village paradigm is a great way to
distribute information there are
challenges that it faces so we might
think of building a new kind of search
engine as a way to use technology to
address some of those challenges so why
not build a search engine that is itself
social that is to say the goal of this
search engine is not to find a document
but rather a person to answer your
question and for the more person that
you have some social connection to or
some sense of social connection as we'll
talk about later real time and this is
key a search engine that's generating
content dynamically where you're not
seeking content that's already been
authored but rather content that will be
authored in response to your question
that will be personalized and that's the
human um where the goal of this search
is a connection with another human being
it's not just a document um so the real
motivation there is a question
originally is an invitation to a human
engagement you're issuing a query to
another human being and you want to
respond and it's only recently we've
been trained that a question is an
invitation to an engagement with a
computer if we think about our
information needs is not just
information needs but also human needs
for things like surance
confidence in how we're going to proceed
we shouldn't neglect the human element
so a search engine based on the village
paradigm I believe would emphasize these
elements and in fact even before
aardvark people are trying to do this
type of search already on the web today
most typically here's how it happens on
things like Facebook and Twitter and
Buzz people post questions and their
status messages and now you hope they
might respond now in the true spirit of
technology innovation this is a real
Hank question answering is not what
status message systems are optimized to
serve status message posts are really a
kind of public performance they're an
entertainment for your audience if you
don't entertain your audience you'll
cease to have an audience it's not the
appropriate place to ask a quotidian
question if I won't find a drycleaner
near my house and then I want to find a
place to get my shoes fixed you know if
my Twitter stream for a given day
consists of nothing but that I'll find
that my followers shrinks rapidly um and
we actually only have a small set of
followers who will read our posts
compared to all the people who we might
be interested in due to social
connection all of our co-workers all of
our classmates friends of friends and so
forth you know if you think of the
number of social network friends that
you have that numbers around 200 and
they say well if 40 thousand friends of
friends it's an enormous number of
people that you want to reach and status
message isn't an easy way to reach them
but most importantly a problem with this
approach to search is that it wastes
everybody's attention attention is this
resource that's increasingly scarce and
everybody has to read this question when
in fact maybe you'll get three or four
responses um so that's that's a problem
that we thought we can use technology to
help solve so what we're going to do
here is go through a case study of
aardvark in particular which is a search
engine built from the ground up based on
those motivations aardvark is a live
products running now in Google Labs
which is very exciting the data I'll
give today is from when we
the only time we publicly really state
about aardvark which is a paper that SEP
and I wrote at the end of 2009 for the
dub-dub-dub conference so so before
talking with it let me just give a demo
about um so you can see actually how
aardvark work it's how it solves this
problem this this is the model that
aardvark takes you can ask anything to
aardvark you just send aardvark your
question in plain English as you would
to a friend and aardvark job is to
discover the perfect person in your
network to answer your question aardvark
will look through the tens of thousands
of people that you're connected to and
figure out who might be best to answer
and who might be available to answer at
the moment and then we'll send those few
people your question if they're not
available or if they say they don't want
to answer our dreck will move on to the
next feet person so aardvark essentially
is seeking through everybody you're
connected to to find an answer and then
sending you the answer usually you get a
personal response in about five or ten
minutes so let's let's try this out
since we have five or ten minutes to
play with okay so here's a here's a web
interface to aardvark so I'll put in a
question did anyone know the great sushi
restaurant in San Francisco I want to
add a little personal context someplace
that's not too loud on a Friday night
that's tonight a good place to meet an
old friend so I want somebody to respond
to the color of that query so let me
send us into aardvark here great and so
hard work is gonna look around and find
people in my network who are available
who know about sushi in San Francisco
and send them my question so that should
take a few minutes and any time we'll go
through some more slides
so the question is what's going to
happen after I've sent in that question
and and am I only gonna get one answer
back what if I want more opinions and
we'll see what we come up with but um as
it happened with aardvark their
parameters you can configure - how many
answers you're seeking maybe at the end
we'll have a whole question session here
where I or our drug takes questions from
the audience and we'll see if we got any
answers about sushi but in the meantime
let me let me advance here through this
there's a previous question I asked
let's skip over that actually cuz we
have a live question now and just I want
to point out a system like this since we
think of this as a search engine based
on the village paradigm you want to
interact with it in the way that you
interact with friends ordinarily so you
want to use any of the communication
platforms that you would ordinarily use
you can use I am or Twitter you can come
to the web there's an iPhone app for
aardvark
you can email are direct questions the
experience should be very much like
asking the person in your network who's
the hub who always knows who to ask for
you the person that you always come to
for advice and they redirect you here's
a good example some of the kinds of
things that people are asking aardvark
is a pretty random selection of just
recent queries here on the right should
I wear brown or black shoes with a light
brown suit so subjective questions like
that perennial concern above that he's
unqualified to ask that question yeah
it's some type of paradox there somebody
asking about above that a prank to plan
a supervisor again you may want to hear
back from people in your social network
who'd have the same sensibility about
pranks and then interestingly on the
bottom left here there's a question it
says I have a job interview over lunch
tomorrow
is there any interview Restaurant
etiquette that I should know it's kind
of an odd thing to post to a status
message
is something you might not want to
brought out right just after your
hundred thousand followers um I'll take
questions at the end so I can uh
great so that the question is about how
we can control or how you can be certain
that one or another person won't see
your question we can talk through their
different interfaces that we've
developed to show that but in the
current version of artwork there's no
control over that in particular um so
given that that general product
interaction let me talk about the
architecture and the algorithms behind
it and I think some of the research
challenges necessary to pulling off this
kind of search engine this is a
obviously just a schematic of the
architecture but show you the kind of
components
I think highlight here is on the far
left there are different gateways
different ways that messages can come
into the system and basically get
squizzle into a uniform format remember
the thing we call a conversation manager
so a social search engine has to Inchon
kind of responsibilities here the first
is do a little dialogue management so if
you're interacting with a social search
engine over I M there needs to be a
little bot mind that knows how to
interpret all the command you're passing
it if you can just type in a question
how does it know it's a question and not
an answer to somebody else's question if
you type in a command like show me my
history it has to recognize that so part
of conversation management is basically
being a natural language but the other
part is chaperoning your question to
make sure that it gets an answer so kind
of being Mission Control for finding all
the people who might be relevant
contacting them one by one seeing if
they're responding moving on to other
people but really organizing the whole
episode of from you submitting a
question to you're getting an answer so
that's one key piece of technology and
then another is a on the far right the
routing engine the the routing engines
job is to do the actual ranking of
candidate answers so it's very much akin
to in a web search engine how you have
to come up with a ranking of documents
in response to a query we have to come
up with the ranking of people in your
social network
in order of who we think is best to
answer the question I'm going to dive
into that a little bit more deeply here
and give you kind of a schematic for for
what that algorithm looks like basically
face it in a few slides to start with
the way we've modeled this problem of
finding the best candidate answers for
your question is like this on the far
right first we need to say what is the
probability that the question that we
received is about a given topic so we're
kind of using topic is in inter lingual
between between questions and candidate
answers servers techniques for
establishing that term that we can talk
about and secondly what's the
probability that a given user knows
about those topics so in the simplest
form then the probability that a given
user can answer a query about is based
upon the user's knowledge of the topics
that the queries about the second
important term here is that as we're
selecting answers we don't just want
people who know a lot about the subject
we want people who are good answers for
you as an Oscar people who are a good
match for you in some ways this kind of
social search engine is an information
matchmaking service where we're selling
information hookups if you will because
there's going to be a conversation
between you and somebody who replies we
want that to be a satisfying
conversation so in a simplest form that
term looks like this we compute this
based on many factors this is the
probability that they give an answer
we'll have a good conversation with or
we'll give a good answer to give an
esker the kind of factors we consider
obviously social connection since this
is social search common friends and
affiliations but also things like
demographic similarity or profile
similarity do you have common interest
if I'm asking about a movie to go see do
we have common movie favorites and so
forth and other things that you might
not think of straightaway such as a kind
of a vocabulary match do you talk the
same way you know do you speak the same
speak as it were do you know do you fill
up your answers with highfalutin
vocabulary do use off-color vocabulary
are you especially chatty do you want to
have these long
expositions of your subject or just
something brief are you polite these
kinds of things how fast are you in
going back and forth with somebody else
those are factors which matter for
satisfactory interaction which are
totally independent of whether or not
you haven't had knowledge that somebody
sees so then the final ranking score
that we use - some business logic it's
basically the combination of those two
terms finding the users that are most
likely to be able to answer a question
and finding the users who are the best
match for the asker it's a combination
of in that sense their expertise about
the knowledge areas that the questions
about and what we call the intimacy or
the the social connection that perceive
social connection or like-mindedness
between the two people so then enters
the operation of the system to recap
when the routing engine gets a request
it comes up a bunch of these candidate
answers passes them to a conversation
manager which will go one by one seeing
if those people can answer until I find
somebody so for those of you like
looking at formulas here's some formulas
which have some bearing on the previous
slides we'll talk about this later and
some data so one of the nice things
about our mug is it is it's a live
system it's been running now for over a
year so we want to share some of the
some statistics that we've found from
the metrics that we found in actually
running this and releasing it in the
wild so first and this is I think the
first most surprising thing that answers
our reasonably fast almost 90% of
questions can get an answer and over
half of those happen in less than 10
minutes now that's kind of extraordinary
because you might be thinking as you sit
there you know with whatever your
perseverating over right now your
problem that you're alone doing that but
actually somewhere in the tens of
thousands of people that you know
somebody could answer and would be happy
to answer right now so that's like a
stunning first discovery about releasing
something like this in the wild question
is that okay are they any good these
answers now we think they're good
because we built a system but there's
some instructions about how
how you actually measure that
intuitively they're different proxies
you can use at the answer lengths so
that the median answer length is about
two dozen words is interesting these
aren't typically one-word answers that
people give and then there's also
explicit feedback that users give users
had the option to say that was a good
answer that was okay where that was that
was bad and and when they give feedback
70% rate the questions is good it's
always hard to nomic what to make of
explicit feedback numbers but I'll say
something interesting about this number
is that it correlates with another
implicit signal which is how often an
asker responds to the app to the
answerer afterwards and says thanks are
asked to follow up question you know in
other words how often is the asker I
think it's worth their time to follow up
and and that number as we make change in
the system tends to vary tend to
correlate with explicit feedback another
instance that is that the questions we
get are in fact quite long they're
almost nineteen words compared to about
two and a half words which is average
for web search queries so that means
that there's a much clearer
specification of intent and personal
context what matters to you and indeed
as designed the questions are often
subjective so the here's a kind of a pie
chart of the kind of things people ask
about and nearly 65% of the questions
have some kind of subjective element in
them you know I'm looking for a good
restaurant or some subjective marker the
distribution you see here across
verticals isn't entirely dissimilar from
what you see in web search but then they
tend to be subjective questions within
those verticals and then I also want to
point out interesting said about user
activity there's a really broad range of
answerers in the aardvark system
seventy-five percent of users who
interacted with Arde work at all have
given an answer now that's remarkable
for a user-generated content site they
have such broad participation on
something like Yahoo Answers or a
bulletin board style site usually the
number is about 25% and part of those
good were actually reaching out actively
and finding the right person at the
right moment to respond I'll also say
that
within a month of when we released our
iPhone app we were at three-and-a-half
sessions per month on that which is
contrasted with at the time is about
five and a half sessions per month for
for web search
so immediately a lot of a lot of usage
on mobile now apart from that that data
I also want to share some more
qualitative learnings we do a lot of you
know our team there's a lot of user
research and every week has people
coming in and sharing their experiences
with the product um and that's been
going on for the past four as long as
the products been live so apart from
what you learn from the stats
you're gonna let of interesting things
in these he's interviewed and and those
really inform design of the next
generation of product here's here's some
the principles that we've learned with
any search site people want to know
whether they can trust their answer what
we found is that for the most part the
sense of trust comes simply from
assessing the textual interaction you
have with the other person there there
isn't an explicit reputation system in
aardvark or some type of score of how
good the answer is rather what we're
doing is we're taking a real-world
interaction just two people talking
one-on-one and we're saying in the same
way that you assess somebody that you're
talking to in the real world assess this
answer we find but therefore it's very
important to have a sense of intimacy
around that answer um when on
broadcasting a public answer for people
I have all sorts of different
motivations right I'm grandstanding in a
sense whereas if I'm just talking to you
one-on-one you can look me in the
virtual digital eyes as it were and say
you know what is my motivation to you
know to mislead it's a very inefficient
spam channel a one-on-one conversation
um so we find that intimacy is what most
facilitates trust not a reputation
system another interesting thing that we
found is that our drug users are most
satisfied when their conversation feels
social even if it's not actually a
conversation with a friend the feeling
of this being social search comes from
well our other friends of yours using
the system in general can we cite the
name of somebody who's a friend of a
friend of a friend it's really a pretty
distant connection if you're talking to
a friend of a friend of a friend but yet
be able to think of it that way you're
somehow connecting to them it makes you
open to open to receiving the answer
similarly affiliations work that way you
know fellow alumni from Stanford or
something you know number there's quite
a few of them but still I'm more curious
than about just a random anonymous post
I find somewhere this is particularly
interesting and relates to why why
people really participate in aardvark
the the most effective channel we have
for receiving answers from people is
actually through I am and what happens
is you're you're sitting there killing
time at work at your desk and suddenly a
little IM pops up and says hey are you
there a friend of Dana's has a question
about the future of technology that I
think you might be able to answer well
what's interesting about this is users
love getting these it's a little it's a
little compliment you know a little
flattery and also it's totally off so
you don't have to do anything you can
just ignore it you can take pass nobody
knows that you saw it it's an invitation
to interact with somebody if you want to
if you want to take 30 seconds and write
down your thoughts about something you
can help somebody right then if you
don't you don't have to so what's
interesting is it's a bot that contacts
you and yet 60% of the people 60% of the
time when people receive this bot this
invitation to engage they respond in
some way they give an answer or they
pass they say not this one but something
else or they refer to a friend they
don't just ignore it which is remarkable
just two hits two BOTS hopping up
another key feature here in terms of
this being social software is that as we
talked about with the village there is a
real social cost to just reaching out
directly and asking somebody for help
somebody that I met twice in a few
meetings here and then I want to ask
them some hard question
that's an imposition that's a burden I
don't want to spend social capital in
doing that so if I can send my question
to aardvark and then aardvark is gonna
reach out I'm not spending any social
capital and getting the answer and
similarly for the answerer it's a
beneficial to have a center mediation
because the answer isn't rejecting
anybody nobody knows if I decide
somebody asked me a question bout our
trek and I'm just not in the mood you
know that seems like an affront if that
happens in real life but with this
intermediary
there's plausible deniability and I just
pass on the question I don't respond
and then lastly I often get this inquiry
of why you know how are we getting these
answers just like we don't have a
reputation system we don't have any kind
of point system you're not racking up
virtual points and because of all the
answers that you've given rather your
people are giving answers simply because
about truism outright goodwill it is
very hard to find somebody who doesn't
enjoy helping other people in the right
context it's very hard to find somebody
who doesn't take pride in the fact that
they gave somebody you know good advice
about their career or help some
directions on the street
the catch is what are the opportunities
to do that is at the right time so a lot
of what we're trying to do is engineer
interactions where you're naturally your
latent helpfulness comes out now
something else I want to point out here
is if we're really leaning on altruism
is the motivator for people interacting
with aardvark um that acts I mean you
have to avoid other kinds of motivators
because those can interfere with
altruism being the main effect so for
instance if there are other perks that
we offer to people like Fame or
leadership on a bulletin board then
altruism ceases to be an active
motivator kind of drug interaction
effects in a way but incentive systems
so we're actually sticking with
optimizing goodwill as our as our fuel
source for tapping people now the last
major section I want to talk through
here is his research challenges involved
with this because this paradigm for
social search is a new paradigm and we
think there's huge opportunity for it
and huge challenges and so really
interested in getting this audience
interested in helping to address some of
these research challenges I'll go
through just a few of them we already
covered the ranking function and there's
been a lot of work on ranking functions
for web search I hope we could have some
approximation of that amount of work for
ranking functions for social search
engines next a big problem is is how we
derive this term the poorly formatted
term there on the side which is how we
know what a user knows about you know
what topics we how we find out some of
these expertise from a product level
there are a number of channels for doing
this people can explicitly declare what
they know about friends can say what
they trust other friends about we can
import structured profiles and so forth
but there's also a research challenge
which is really
from unstructured web content for
instance from Status Messages and blogs
how do you extract expertise the
approach that we've taken to that
aardvark is to index people based upon
their pre-existing web content
essentially so when people point us to
their blog or to their Twitter account
we want to model the user as a Content
generator you want to say what kind of
content have they generated in the past
and that gives you some prediction of
the kind of content they're likely to
generate in the future them with respect
to topics so so at the far end of the
spectrum the whole web of documents
becomes just just an index actually of
the people that authored that we're not
really interesting the documents in the
first place for this type of social
search you can go through some details
later about the techniques we use but
that's the general research area now
this is also really interesting research
areas what do we do with the question
that we get um note that the problem
here is not the problem that's not the
problem of natural language
understanding or really understanding
what the questions about or even
automated question answering we just
have to know enough about the question
in order to direct it to the right
people now there are some special
challenges that we face a question is a
very small text snippet as opposed to
classifying a whole document you need
different approaches to classification
for a small snippet and also if we're
classifying into an enormous space and a
growing space of users or topical
expertise that's difficult if you need
to have millions and millions of
classifiers that's there's some
challenges around that um one of the
nice things about this type of paradigm
however for developing algorithms is
that it's possible to get online
feedback immediately from users so if I
submit a question about you know finding
a sushi restaurant San Francisco and the
system comes back with something unlike
finding a sushi restaurant in San
Francisco so perhaps it says oh well
here's something about friendship
because I'm asking about bringing a
friends to a restaurant I can
immediately correct that as a user I can
say that's the wrong tag to put on this
question and then that's that's learning
data basically for the next generation
of the system they're different learning
models they can take advantage of that
then there so while those there's kind
of a traditional component to some of
those previous research challenges
they're entirely new things that arise
with this paradigm one we've dubbed the
answerer economy problem which is if you
think of social search as a market where
there information seekers and
information providers well we're going
to get a conservative providers and
making sure there are enough people
available to will answer your question
we model it by thinking about how to
maximize the amount of answerer resource
that's available that is number of
people available and how much answering
they're willing to do about what
subjects and then how to make optimal
usage of that answering resource that
involves changing parameters such as how
many answers were seeking for a user how
aggressive we are would contact a few
people at a time or only one person at a
time and also when you spend different
resources if I have a neuroscience
expert I'm thinking well maybe I'm not
gonna spend him on this sushi restaurant
question if I have a lot of sushi
restaurant expertise and so there all
sorts of challenges there and then
lastly I think there are real challenges
around interaction design that our
research challenges because of the
things we discover the importance of
social intermediating the importance of
creating trust through intimacy the
importance of etiquette matching between
users those are things where interaction
design can help quite a lot lastly a
there's of course research to be done
just in the effectiveness of this
paradigm so we're excited it's just been
out recently but now we're already
starting to see people who are who are
doing explicit evaluations of artwork
style social search versus web search or
versus status message question asking to
measure its effectiveness and the top
one is the first thesis that's been
written on aardvark which is a milestone
if I'm not the one who wrote the thesis
but somebody else did independent party
and we're delighted to find it actually
the results in early studies are very
consistent with what we'd expect which
is to say for subjective questions are
directed file social search is more
effective yield higher satisfaction
scores and is faster than objective
website that then web search where's for
objective question web search clearly
dominates so since
since that's all been sunshine and roses
I want to bring up some other the other
side of the coin the system does make
technical errors here's the case of
we're adding a question to a user who
doesn't think of themselves as an expert
maybe on the subject so and and then
they're also interaction design
challenges this is information
matchmaking things can go wrong so here
here's the interaction it's a little
hard to read there but somebody asks our
only blood relatives in the state of
Michigan allowed to claim children on
their taxes somebody replies I'm not
sure whether you text why don't you
check with the tactic expert not a web
service the asker says well that's a
little rude don't you think
just a simple question I'm wondering it
late at night I want to know somebody
new you don't have to be rude and on and
on so well so that's a failure of the
system just as you could have a failure
in ranking there's a failure of the
system in terms of how do you structure
an interaction to minimize the
occurrences of these um that said those
are rare occurrences and for the most
part what we see are a really
extraordinary positive example so just
just to read through a transcript what
somebody happened here's if you're
somebody asking what's a good place to
take a spunky off-the-cuff social pretty
girl for a non-traditional fun memorable
dinner date in San Francisco that's a
it's a lot of context in that question a
lot of flavor of color and look at the
different answers we get the first one I
didn't for a minute there's an answer
about two different suggestions with
brief summaries and then interestingly
six minutes later somebody says hey
we'll take her to this production of
Tommy in the mission that show i'veseen
now that's not what was asked but it's
relevant information a human was able to
interpret the question say you know what
this this could be useful at this moment
and indeed the asker was thrilled with
that said oh cool
and then 10 mins later another answer
with all sorts of detail about the
ambience at a restaurant whether it
would fit is the kind of things are just
very hard to get these sorts of
experiences in web search when what you
really want is just a simple human
conversation so that's all I want to
cover thanks everybody we'll take some
questions here
oh of course let's see what we got all
right let me go see
I hope I'm hungry see if I have any
answers have an answer sushi zone help
it that's appropriate
alright resubmit oh there's more
terrific
sorry PC you know there's one answer so
far to that question let's see what we
get by the end of the answer period
great yeah I've got sort of three short
questions if I may and the first one is
have you considered using the answers to
previous questions as answers or with
that to track from the social nature of
the search great is aardvark available
on android phones because i can't find
it in marketplace and the third one is
the leveraging the previous information
about users expertise I'm wondering I'm
thinking about this in the context of
enterprise search but it seems to me
like email archives may be a fantastic
source of that kind of knowledge and we
did some work on using email archives
for actually question answering in
companies at one point and it was indeed
an incredibly valuable resource so great
it's kind of a comment the last thing so
I think those from shorts the longest
there's not an Android app we'd like to
change that but I can't make any
specific product promises as for how we
use people's different kind of web
history yeah we're looking at all sorts
of different sources of data any content
that you've generated whether on
aardvark or an email or web search if
you want to share that with aardvark if
you want to say hey instead of me
telling you aardvark what I know about I
want you to just learn it from these
data sources you know we want to be able
to do that and then to the first point
that you asked which is about what do we
kind of reuse answers I think the short
answer is no we don't do that and the
reason why we didn't do that with our
first product release is that the beach
is really setting up live conversations
between people that's the model that we
want people to understand that's we want
them to see that there's this
opportunity it's not obvious that
there's this opportunity that you could
have that conversation with people and
it becomes less obvious if you're saying
I'm just gonna browse through existing
answers so there's waste so there's a
trade out there ways to make use of that
content but I think it trade up against
the interaction paradigm isn't worth it
yeah question thank you for the talk so
you both frame your your presentation
initially and then also showed some
research results that are now coming in
that make the distinction between search
engines and and aardvark I'm wondering
has there been any data have you looked
into the kind of closer comparison
between ardor question-answering and
other online question answering sites
that keep answers around there are more
vertical in in topic do you have a sense
of differences in performance and also
differences in the kind of questions
that are well served by one versus the
other great so I'll make this two quick
comments about class other classes of
what you might call social search which
is maybe the bulletin board style kind
of class of solutions and in the status
message class I guess we already covered
the status message kind of question
asking already and different application
that can be built on top of those or
Twitter or Facebook to optimize that and
again I think the real issue there is
one of entertaining your followers it's
the performative issue and there's no
system that's kind of looking out to get
you answers and so what's been found on
Morris previous slide
there's a reference Morris have done
some results and found that one of the
challenges with SAS message asking is a
you know kind of the inability to kind
of have an interaction or refinement of
your query when somebody gives you an
answer one-on-one with them to be able
to go back and forth and the speed
issues relative to bulletin board
systems
I guess one the most important thing I
think that we've observed is the
participation rate something that tends
to happen with a bulletin board systems
there's a small number of people who
basically troll a site and we'll kind of
rack it up a lot of answers it'll either
be intent to be either kind of teenagers
or or the people who built the system
for the early audiences and so that's a
challenge how do you get past that how
do you get broader participation I think
there might be some ways to have hybrids
between aardvark I'll search in those
systems but I think they're gonna be
more reports coming out in the coming
months I think about those comparisons
yeah great point great
I've been surf a couple questions first
of all have you bumped into something
called chat roulette by any chance one
when I haven't well I actually the
reason I bring it up is that I was
impressed by the intervention that
aardvark provides whereas chat roulette
is sort of literally in your face
so this is a more socially adept design
I think the idea that you have
accumulated answers to a bunch of
questions does suggest an opportunity I
think it was suggested earlier that you
accumulate that and make it usefully
searchable in addition to using this
conversational paradigm the last thing
I'm wondering about is if you were to do
that if you could capture not only the
text of the question and the answer but
the other indicia that said this person
is a likely respondent if you keep all
that information along with it you could
compute what some of the answers what's
the ranking of the previous answers that
might be relevant to a question that
just got asked so there I have an
opportunity to make the body of
accumulating information increasingly
useful and relevant they think that
thank you that's a great point something
that arises because it's not simply a
set of documents but we have interaction
data that goes with it
the interaction data is signals about
the nature of the content which then can
be used for informing for the routing or
all sorts of applications
good point hey great so the question is
what percentage of questions get
answered by your social network as
opposed to everybody now with with a set
of people using aardvark the way we're
did we start with your immediate friends
and if you didn't find somebody we
thought was a good answer then friends
are friends and friends of friends of
friends and then affiliations and so
forth so we kind of go outwards you can
get several hops down so so there's not
so in some sense there can be people who
recruit total random strangers but
that's that's a small number when we go
through through all the hops and I can
look up and try to find a number for you
but I don't have one yeah great so the
question yeah
great so two questions one is kind of
where does the social network data come
from and the second is what about
relationships that our future
relationship so you haven't formed yet
how does art bike relate to that so on
the first point this is a social search
engine it's it's not actually a social
network product and so just sits on top
of any social information that can be
found whether that's Facebook social
graph Google social graph your contacts
or buzz Twitter and so forth so it's the
aggregate of all of those things and as
we move towards more openness about
social graph information a social search
engine can sit on top of that so it's
somewhat different function now it is
true there are people who have formed
relationships through aardvark a friend
of a friend of a friend answers you say
thanks for that answer it turns out we
both have this common interest they
exchange contact information at you know
nuptials you know to come it's not the
main use case but it has happened good
good question some really fascinating
stuff happened there we there there's
just some terms of usage here's about
even it letting on people under 13 in
the different brackets and so forth
which we followed and the the greatest I
think most interesting demographic
information there came from releasing an
iPhone app um and and when we did that
we had a huge that was when we actually
add a huge influx of teenagers and we
found that a lot of the questions
teenagers were asking a lot of the
people in their twenties to sixties we
were less interested in answering maybe
I'd answered for themselves to realized
there were no answers to those questions
um now our strategy for dealing with it
is the same as our strategy for dealing
with any question that might not have a
universal appeal which is to match like
with like it turns out that if you kind
of have a head full of steam as a you
know seventeen year old boy and you're
asking you know questions that reflect
the surge of form
so forth there are other people in that
age group that are really interested in
answering those so so instead of a
paternalistic approach that says we
don't allow this kind of content on
aardvark it was much more find other
people who who ask those kind of
questions and again that's I think a
research challenge we call it etiquette
matching but so it has been under the
hood to date and that's actually been
fairly effective I do think that there
are ways into the marketing product or
educating users about it they can be
helpful that separate branding but it
enters the actual matching it's been
under the hood okay thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
