TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
KenKen's now in over 150
newspapers or magazines
all over the world,
and I am the inventor of KenKen.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you very much.
But my main job is that
I'm a math teacher.
I love mathematics
class since 1993.
I am a teacher, but I
don't like teaching.
In fact, I don't teach.
I had thought, how can
I make children smart?
Do you think that
children become smart
after careful explanation?
No, not at all.
If this is true, my
job is a piece of cake.
After careful explanation,
children have an illusion
that they can understand, that
they can not solve the problem
by themselves.
Then how can I make
children smart?
I found the answer.
The essence of mathematics
learning is to keep thinking.
So the most important job for me
is to present interesting math
problems to my
students that they
must figure out for themselves.
After that, all I have
to do is wait and watch.
I call this the art of
teaching without teaching.
First two years after
I founded my class,
I had only math lesson
for fourth grade
to sixth grade of
primary school students.
Do you know that there are
four kinds of math problems?
Easy and fun, easy and no
fun, difficult and fun,
difficult and no fun.
I make only
interesting problems.
Only interesting problems
can make students smart.
Almost all problems for fourth
grade to sixth grade students
were made by me in
first two years.
I wanted to start something new.
Some parents who have
third grade students
ask me to set up a
class for third graders.
I had considered
about it for one week.
I didn't want to give
them math problems.
Rather, I wanted to give
them materials which
they enjoy trial and error.
I had searched good
materials for thinking.
At last, I found it.
It's a puzzle.
I started puzzle class for
third grade February 1995.
Third grade students have
solved puzzles day by day.
They began to think
longer and deeper.
Puzzles in puzzle
magazines were difficult
for third grade
students, so I made
many kind of puzzles every day.
But they were not enough.
I needed puzzles that
used all four operations.
At last, I invented KenKen 2003.
First KenKen was 4
by 4 addition only.
Then I created KenKen with
addition only in 4 by 4 to 9
by 9 grid size.
Then I created KenKen with
a variety of combinations
of operations such as addition
and subtraction, multiplication
only, multiplication and
division, and those four
operations with symbols.
I continued to make
KenKen one after another.
Finally, I deleted
math operations
which added additional
challenge that made
students think even harder.
All trials were successful.
Once KenKen was
completed, I couldn't
stop screaming and
dancing-- I did it!
I did it-- like Archimedes.

I have made many, many puzzles.
KenKen is one of them, but
KenKen is a special one.
KenKen could make my
students strive dramatically.
They never give up.
They never compromise.
Recently, I have many chances
to drink with my former students
in Tokyo.
By the way, I have classes
in Tokyo and Manhattan.
I live in Manhattan eight
months, live in Tokyo
four months in a year.
It's exciting and
interesting life.
My teaching method, the art
of teaching without teaching,
where students have to
struggle to figure out answers
by themselves, has
made them successful in
many different areas in life.
They become successful bankers,
doctors, teachers, artists.
And one of them even
became a ballerina
in a famous ballet
theater in Europe.
The students are so
grateful for having learned
how to think this way that
they remain close to me
and keep in touch no matter
where they are in the world.
All of my former students I
reunited spend happy lives.
They're enjoying
challenging in life,
just as they enjoyed
trial and error in puzzles
in their childhood.

Why must we learn and study?
For what?
It's for happy life.
Happy life, what is it?
Entering high-level university?
Entering good company like
Google and getting good salary,
like you?
Is it always happy life?
I don't think so.
Happy life is a life that you
live as who you truly are.
I went to drink with
a former student who
is first KenKen generation.

He was 20 years old.
He goes to the best
medical school in Japan.
He looked focused and determined
towards the goal of his life.
To me, KenKen clearly supports
my students to have happy life.
So I am looking forward to drink
with more KenKen generations.
Not only to my
students, but KenKen
also gives me many benefits.
KenKen made me famous.
KenKen made me rich.
I spent happy life in Tokyo.
I didn't need to
do something new.
But two things changed
my soul in 2013.
First thing began
from one email.
I previously was interested
in only my classroom and only
my students.
I received an email
from a math teacher
in Paris American
School, Melissa.
She said, we are going to Japan
with 18 students next April.
Can we visit your
school with students?
I'd like you to give a
lesson to my students.
I know your school is
near Tokyo Station.
I was surprised that she knew
about me and my philosophy.
I had thought about one week
because I cannot speak English
very well.
That's my serious weak point.
But I decided to accept them.
I believed it must be
a beautiful experience
for me and for them.
Melissa and I
emailed quite often.
They came to Tokyo in May
7, 2013, three teachers
and 18 students.
Students were 14
to 16 years old.
I put 30 kinds of my
books on the table.
I told them, I give you a book.
Pick one.
But be careful because you
will try to solve it later.
Including three teachers,
everyone took a book
and went back to their seats.
Then I said, I give
you 15 minutes.
Do as you like.
Everybody began to solve.
Nobody gave up.
Melissa says to me,
it's really amazing.
They continue thinking
such a long time.
I answered, it's the
power of my book.
Interesting problems can
catch students' hearts easy
and never release.

The students of Paris wanted
to meet Japanese students,
so I sent an email to
my former students.
17 students joined the event.
Second stage was a puzzle
contest with my new puzzles
that no one had
ever seen before.
[INAUDIBLE] former students
had a fierce dead heat.
And one of them
became a champion.
It was really fitting.
Third stage was an exchange
meeting of one-to-one.
The students of Paris talked
slowly in the beginning.
But a few minutes
later, they began
to talk with normal speed.
I thought, my former
students can not understand.
But I left them as it is.
After that, most of my former
students who joined the event
went to study abroad.
Final stage was karaoke.
We moved to karaoke box, and
we sang only one song, &quot;You've
Got a Friend&quot; by Carole King.
Nobody knew this beautiful
song, so I sent everybody
to a URL of YouTube.
We will sing this song
at the end of the event.
Practice more than 100 times.
We could sing aloud together.
And I sent off Paris
team at the station.
It was one of the most
beautiful days in my life.
It was also the day
I had the first time
interested in students
other than my own.
Five days later, Melissa
gave me a heartwarming email.
She said, it was a most
memorable day, like a dream,
visiting Japan this time.
I appreciate you from
the bottom of my heart.
I thought, all students in
American school, come to Japan.
I will entertain you!

This was an eye-opening
experience to me.
Here is a group of
fashionable students
who seems completely
uninterested in math-- loved
and benefited from my puzzles.
And I wondered
whether or not same
would hold true
in another country
where students have
less opportunity.
I had the chance to
visit a primary school
in [? Chiang Rai, ?] Thailand,
a month after Melissa
and her students came to see me.
I had a plan to teach
them how to solve KenKen
and how to make KenKen.
I told them that if they
make more than 100 KenKen,
I will bring them to
the publishing company
to publish the book.
All the royalties of that book
will be donated to the school.
So I went to Thailand, and
I had 90-minute lessons
to fifth graders
and sixth graders.
Before the trip, I was warned
they cannot even calculate,
so I was very nervous.
But it was not true.
They enjoyed KenKen,
just like my students.
Some of them were much
smarter than I expected.
They could solve KenKen,
and they could make KenKen.
I thought that, schools all
over the world, call me.
I will go to entertain you.
These two things changed
my thoughts dramatically.
I was waiting and waiting,
but nothing happened.
I needed to grow myself,
and I needed to challenge.
Where should I go?
Next to the center of
Japan, near Tokyo Station,
where is the center
of the world?
One idea came to me.
It's a very, very
dangerous idea.
It's Manhattan, New York,
near Grand Central Station.
November 20, 2013, I decided
to move my classroom from Tokyo
to Manhattan.

The biggest benefit
from KenKen was that.
KenKen brought me
to New York City.

I moved to New York
City February 10, 2015,
with Green Card, category E11.

Before that, I had an interview
in the United States Embassy
in Tokyo.
The counselor says to me,
your visa-- wonderful!
Your visa is wonderful.
I couldn't understand at all.
I checked out category
E11 on internet.
Immigration
Department said, it's
for individuals with
extraordinary abilities
in the arts, science, education,
business, or athletics.
Unbelievable!
It's because of KenKen.
I am an ordinary man.
I don't have any talent.
Thank you, KenKen.

I feel KenKen has
unlimited possibilities.
It's a dream of mine to
create online head-to-head
competitions where students
from Thailand or Paris or United
States can create
their own KenKen,
solve each other's KenKen,
and compete in the way
where language isn't a barrier.
Then KenKen will be
a true entertainment.

Then KenKen will be a true
international learning tool.
By the way, KenKen was
originally handmade by me.
But for the mass markets,
a KenKen generating program
was required.
KenKen puzzle company
contracted with a pioneer
in computer chess
development and longtime
president of the Computer Games
Association, AI expert Dr.
David Levy.
Dr. Levy interviewed
me extensively
and applied this
knowledge engineering
to help design the algorithm
that is known as the Kenerator.
The Kenerator then finds
that there is only one
solution to each puzzle.
Sometimes solvers
contact us believing
that they have found a flaw
in the puzzle, but up to now,
no puzzle generated
by the Kenerator
has ever been found to have an
error or alternative solution.

Now, I'll show you
how to make KenKen.
Before that, let's go
over the rules of KenKen.

This is--
MALE SPEAKER: Switch
to [INAUDIBLE].
Let's switch to the camera,
if you want to switch.
[INAUDIBLE]
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sure.

TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: This is
KenKen, 4 by 4, addition only.
You can use 1, 2, 3, 4.
Every row, every
column-- 1, 2, 3, 4.
Do not put same
number on same line.
OK?
The small number means
sum of the number.
One cage, sum of number.
Let's try.
Two numbers makes 6.
You can use 1, 2, 3, 4.
Then what is two numbers?
AUDIENCE: 4 and 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: That's right!
Very smart.
AUDIENCE: Good job.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2
and 4, or 4 and 2.
Then, two numbers makes 7.
What's these two numbers?
AUDIENCE: 3 and 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
Oh, that's right.
How [? cute ?] you are.
3 and 4.
Here is 2, 4, or 4, 2.
[INAUDIBLE]?
What is this?

AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
That's right.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
Here is 7.
Here is 4.
Then what is this?
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
That's right.
What is this?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
Then 2, 4, 4, 2.
What is this here?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
That's right.
2, 3, 4.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.
Two numbers-- sum
of two numbers is 4.
Here is 1.
What is this?
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
And there-- what is this?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
3, 2, 4.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.

Sum of the number is 3.
Here's 1.
What is this?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
2, 3, 4.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.
4, 1, 3.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
Here is 7, here is 3.
What is this?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
And?

Here.
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3!
3.
3, 2, 4.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.
And?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Perfect!
Well done.
Very good.
[APPLAUSE]

Solving KenKen is
very interesting,
but making KenKen
much more interesting.

I always make KenKen
from the answer.
I will make block here.
Sum of three numbers.
1, 2, 3.
6.
Second block here.
4 plus 3 equals 7.
Third block here.
1, 2, 1, 2, 1.
4.
Next block here.
3 and 4 equals 7.
Next block here.
4 plus 2 equals 6.
1 plus 2 equals 3.
3 plus 4 equals 7.
This is KenKen problem
and its answer.
Now I'll delete answer number.

Then one KenKen
baby just be born!
[CLAPPING]
It's my baby.
How cute you are!
Let's try to solve, OK?
Which number do
you choose first?

AUDIENCE: 7.
Oh, do you mean--
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: OK.
AUDIENCE: 4?
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
4, that's right.
Three numbers makes 4.
Only one combination.
What's that number?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1, 2, 1.
Here is 3.
What is this?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.

Sum of four numbers is
always 10 because every row,
every column has
1, 2, 3, 4 once.
From here to here, 10.
From here to here, 6.
Then what is this?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
Then?
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
And they're 1, 2, then?

AUDIENCE: 3?
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
That's right.
And?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
And?
AUDIENCE: 1.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 1.
1, 2, 3, then?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
And?
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
3, 2, 1, then?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 4.
And?
AUDIENCE: 2.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 2.
And?
AUDIENCE: 3.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: 3.
And?
AUDIENCE: 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Perfect!
Well done.
I will introduce KenKen checker.

[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

This is KenKen checker.
Nobody can buy this software.
It's only for me.

[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

4 by 4, addition.

Two numbers make 7.

Two numbers make--
three numbers make 4.
Two numbers make 7.
Three numbers make 6.
Two numbers make 6.

Two numbers make 3.
And two numbers make 7.

And check.
Only one solution.
It's complete.
Is there anybody who wants
to try to make KenKen?

AUDIENCE: I'll make one.

TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: We can do
it like 4 by 4 or 5 by 5.
AUDIENCE: 4 by 4.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: [INAUDIBLE].
Really?
AUDIENCE: I'm new.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO:
[LAUGHS] One moment.

[INAUDIBLE]

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] make it.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Make it, yes.

AUDIENCE: OK.

Can you draw anywhere?
No.

TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Let me.
That's right.

Let's check he's correct.
[INAUDIBLE] answer.

Everybody attention?
Check!
Oh, congratulations!
[APPLAUSE]
Only one solution.
Completed.
AUDIENCE: My KenKen
baby was born.
TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Finished.
[LAUGHS]

[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

TETSUYA MIYAMOTO: Thank
you for your cooperation.
There are three ways to enjoy
KenKen-- to solve, to make,
and to serve to somebody.
The most important thing is to
enjoy challenging and thinking.
It doesn't matter whether
you can solve or not.
It doesn't matter whether
you can understand or not.
Continue to think long and deep.

The toughest rival is not
the person next to you.
It's yourself and yesterday.
Sometimes people ask my
autograph in my book.
I always write like this--
&quot;Renew your best record day
by day,&quot; next to my name.
I believe math is puzzle.
Puzzle is fun.
Then math is fun!
It's the best entertainment
to progress yourself.

I believe if the people
all over the world
can think with their own brain,
world peace can be result.
Good luck, Google people.
Thank you for listening!
