held the camera and then another and
then another and just make sure I'm not
going to disappear here okay we're in
business and got to the spot where I
thought he might want to take a picture
it says no I don't see anything there
and I went back took several more and I
just felt like a complete claw I felt I
was you know walking through going
through a garden but I was stepping on
all the flowers I just missed all the
good photographs his visual command was
just extraordinary
they okay that all seems to be working
when we look at images in today's world
we usually think the Photoshop we think
of Photoshop is a sort of a new thing
because you can take any pixel and make
it into any other value that you like
and you can characterize the the scene
by the histogram there yes I can see a
little bit clearer back there and you
can hear and the the tone scale curve is
probably the most valuable feature that
lets you transform the image you have
into the image you want and so here
we're talking about digits in and
grayscale value out but in fact it's a
very similar curve to the to the
original herder and drift field agent D
curve that photographers talked about
and certainly very familiar to the zone
system okay
there we go
if you compare film and digital
photography in fact they're quite
similar although the techniques are a
little bit different we have a lens a
camera a sensor sense of processing we
store it
one case in the negative another case in
the digital file we read it we
anticipate what we want to do with the
image and we display it now the tools in
the optics are pretty similar except the
size constraints are a little bit
different
it's the aperture the number of elements
the coding the resolution the volume of
the camera and the surface of the sensor
that determines a lot of different
things and John had invited me two years
ago to discuss some work we've been
doing in measuring how much information
you can capture in high dynamic range
imaging today's popular technique is you
take a series of exposures and out of
those many exposures merge it into the
image you'd like to have now in fact if
you look at the data very carefully you
find that all these nasty things like
number of elements and coatings and
apertures and surface reflection namely
glare glare provides a serious limit to
what you can capture on the film play
the multiple exposures you take do not
give you information about the scene
they give you information about the
scene plus the veiling glare the
unwanted stuff that happens in the
camera and so it turns out what you have
on that image plane is a function of not
only the scene but the features of the
camera so HDR imaging is not an accurate
rendition of the scene but it provides
more useful information although it just
doesn't happen to be the real accurate
information so you take
that's the same for both whether you're
in a digital camera or a film camera the
techniques and silver halide you put it
in you go into the darkroom you put it
in a developer you stop the development
with a scenic path you put it in hypo to
get rid of the undeveloped silver you
wash it you tone it change the IC you
change the surface properties of the
silver to get a better covering power
and then you wash it again and you dry
it you have a finished negative in
digital imaging you have an A to D
converter you have something that does
noise reduction you transfer that signal
to a digital part of the system where
you do the demos a-akane the sharpening
the image enhancement and and then you
compress it now on the printing side you
can use in different types of enlargers
which in fact in effect the essentially
of the response function in the grades
and the surface and the whatever so what
I hope to do in this talk is to compare
these probably for most people most
people your age unfamiliar things you
probably haven't spent much time in the
darkroom with the wonderful techniques
we use in digital imaging and just by
the way I answer was my coach in in
black and white chemical photography and
John Franco here was my coaching in
digital photography in 1972 you started
to set up a digital image processing lab
at Polaroid which was far ahead of most
most other labs starting to do image
processing for photography Ansel divided
making a print into three very important
steps first of all was the visualization
for
transyl you had to have an idea of what
the picture was supposed to do before
you took the picture it was indication
of let's grab something and then refine
it later it was the negative should be
very carefully composed exposed and
developed in fact the answer went to the
trouble of changing the characteristic
anticipating what the film should do and
exposing with the type of development he
was going to do in mind and I'll talk
about that more later but you wanted to
visualize what it was the second step
was to capture all the usable
information and he often described that
as the musical score he was at his young
man he was trained as a concert pianist
and he was both a photographer and a
pianist and he he found it difficult to
spend the time for doing both and he
decided to become a photographer it's
quite common to think of a pianist to
spend hours per day just practicing
Ansel took that framework and did it
with his photography he practiced taking
pictures more than anybody I ever met
most of us grab the camera go take the
picture
well absolutely never do that he would
take the camera he would try this
setting that setting he would
continually learn how to do these things
and he was a absolute master capturing
the musical score and in fact what he
was doing we would say today we would
say well he was controlling the tone
scale of his sensor then he would render
you'd call that the performance and
there's two parts of that first is you
want to scale you want to get the best
tone scale a response from the from the
media you're going to the print or the
display or whatever but also in many
cases be
because the dynamic range of the print
is very limited he manipulated using
kind of spatial processing this was
actually dodging and burning moving
hands around to make an image that fit
his visualization and that's really the
essence of the talk now in fact just
yesterday there was a symposium at the
electronic imaging meeting in San Jose
and the keynote speaker there was John
Sexton a longtime friend colleague
co-worker of Ansel's and I just wanted
to let you know to put on your calendar
John's going to be speaking in the Adobe
distinguished lecture series yeah I
think it's going to be June 15th but
just you'll find it on the Adobe website
and he he just gave an absolutely
marvelous keynote address where he
talked about Ansel's images how Ansel
made the images had old movies of Ansel
climbing to actually climbing to take
these pictures here and with music
accompaniment by Ansel playing the piano
so if you're an Ansel Adams fan look up
John Sexton on the Adobe distinguished
vision that he's coming to an auditorium
Youssou answer regarded this as picture
taken 1927 it's in the assembly valley
he and his wife and three friends find
halfway up he climbed up to this they
call the diving board
it's about halfway up to the top of they
brought a picnic they were all
photographers they took pictures
Virginia has his fiancee later his wife
the lifelong wife was went with men took
movies and you'll see him in John's talk
Ansel took these picture
with six by eight view camera he brought
up glass negatives the reason they were
glass was that essentially this was even
before you could get pen chromatic
emulsions on on nitrate base there
wasn't a safety film base that we used
today this was in the old very very
unstable nitrate base material that they
use at the time but you couldn't even
get that you had to be a glass plate if
you wanted pan chromatic emotions which
means sensitive to red light Ansel took
the picture on the left with a yellow
filter and then he visualized he said he
didn't there were no digital displays to
see the image that you just took he
started to think in his mind what's that
going to look like well I'm gonna have a
grey sky and it's going to be next to a
gray monolith and he had such
familiarity with it with his tools that
he said well I'm not going to like that
picture that the sky is going to
distract from the impact of Half Dome of
the monolith so he then and those days
he he reported to John there were no
accurate light meters so it was his
photographic experience that told him
how to expose the negative and he had
practiced enough so he knew that with a
dark red filter you needed two and a
half stops more exposure so we adjusted
the exposure took the picture with them
with the red filter which rendered a
black sky which let the the vision of
his vision of the the monolith become
apparent and he often told me that he he
was so excited
when he took that picture he ran down
the hill you'll see in the movies it's
it's a forty five-degree
and he immediately went to the back room
and made the print and it was he's often
described it changed his life because he
now knew that he could manipulate things
but to do the things we all know we can
do in Photoshop an HDR my favorite paper
is a paper by Jones and content from
Kodak it's a paper that measures a great
number of scenes 126 outdoor scenes and
measures the dynamic range and this is
mainly to illustrate that the world
could have a 3 log unit range most of
the scenes that they took that they
thought would be average people pictures
would be 2.2 log units but in the print
you have right around 100 to 1 you you
don't have you have a much smaller range
in the print than you do in the world so
how do you take this great big world
this wide dynamic range of stimuli and
put it in a low range media in fact this
is what color negative film if you think
in the last half of the previous century
there are probably a trillion prints
made from Kodak negatives or Fuji
negatives or and essentially that is a
technique where that compresses the
highlights and the shadows and it in
fact expands the mid-tones if you take
an Ansel Adams print and make sure
you're not measuring any glare from the
glass of the surface of the print you
get 0.15 candelas per meter squared from
the rich black sky
from the white bright clouds you get 17
that's a ratio of 114 to 1 is the range
that the print can did 11 now this these
blacks and these whites are amongst the
highest and blackest you will find in
photographs they are very skillfully
done there
selenium tones so that the densities
here are deeper than most most materials
and Anto was a great craftsman so that
there was always minimum density in the
in the heights so how do you fit this
into the world well what you do is you
you can't do what say a CCD does the CCD
counts photons and you have a nice
simple linear relationship between the
amount of light caught and the value
coming out the fellow who was the
director of research at Kodak for 50
years a guy by the name of me and in
fact me was one of the few I worked a
lot with urban land for at Polaroid and
there are some people you always knew he
had great respect for he would just
almost change his tone of voice and he
would always refer to Chester Mises
there as the great director of research
Kodak because essentially he started off
University College London he repeated
herder and drift fields experiments and
namely he measured the sense of
symmetric response of films he he
invented the tone scale in his book in
1920 he described here you have two
tones and here you have three tones when
you add a shadow and four tones if you
had that face shadow and so he was
describing the response of a film as a
tone scale now that fit very well with
the Kodak sort of had a policy around in
1900 they introduced the brownie camera
and the idea was you will you take
the picture will do the rest it was
quite an organized the big thing because
in fact it was a newspaper ad in just
about every paper in the United States
all at the same time in 1901 or 1902
something like that so that was a pretty
big organization you know google that
and where you could do it it won't eat
me hell yeah write all those letters to
get that many people to do well Kodak
had a policy that they really wanted to
get away from the complex jargon and all
the secret formulas of a previous
century of photography and so they
wouldn't let him talk about H and D
curves he had to invent a new synonym
for sensitivity response function and
that's tone scale and tom scale is how a
we use continue to use today here is
Ansel Adams zones which are very similar
and you can see that he tells you that
this white reflected roof is his own
nine and this is the middle gray zone
five and this is a black is omeone so
each one of these characterized their
one stop apart and as soon as he could
use spot photometers he measured these
areas so he could determine the range of
the scene and if he knew the range of
the scene he knew whether he should plan
to compress in the development or expand
in the development and to do that it's
relatively simple here's is a set of
zones with normal development for that-
if you decrease the amount of
development you essentially lower the
contrast you lower the slope of the
curve you get to a wider range response
you get a still wider range response if
you decrease it even more oppositely if
you extended the time
the developer you and if you have a
short dynamic range scene and you wanted
to make that punch here you would
increase the development time and the
jargon I learned before meeting answer
was always you would you know over
expose and under development and answer
what I said is right you're going to
increase or decrease you know what
you're doing so it's not over you've not
watch it do it today we just think of it
as well more development gives you a
tone scale curve that looks like this
less development gives you like this but
you could do this in a digital sensor
you could set the quantization of the
camera before you take the picture to
optimize it for the scene but that
doesn't fit the current add it to
extract artery nobody in fact would even
think of that
but but it's it's quite a quite a
remarkable thing to be so careful and
thoughtful about what you're doing this
is kind of interesting because if you
take a simple linear representation of
mono light between a hundred and zero
and put it into equal steps you get a
grayscale or a zone scale that tone
scale isn't very well spaced you
overemphasize the whites if you have a
linear display of the range of
information available and that's why
photographers always used log because
that gives you a better representation
it means middle gray is not 50%
reflectance is 18% reflectance and in
fact more recently people have started
to use lightness which is a cube root
function instead of a logarithmic
function it it better accommodates the
fact that you've got scatter in your eye
and so these are equal steps in
appearance if you use the cube root so
these are all now
algorithmic representation or rather
these are exponential in the deso each
effector to more light than the other
along the horizontal axis these are
optical density so that's log luminance
or log log light transmitted through the
negative so this is the effect of
development that means two times the
normal time in the development or or one
unit there wasn't necessarily two times
but more or less development these are
the similar kind of responses you get
from changing the grade of the paper now
these are all these graphs in fact were
made by John Sexton in the second
edition of a set of books that ants over
I'll show you the titles and references
at the end of the talk they're still
available today they're fantastic books
but these are all just taken from
Ansel's book the negative so let me just
go through that here's the paper grade
the manufacturers would send you
different contrast papers so that you
could make your negative look more
contrast or less contrasting and as you
can see as you increase the rate of
change you would decrease the range so
those two are always linked together
just a bit now everybody uses a spectral
film so you'd use a slightly different
color filter on the same piece of paper
and that would change the slope just
like changing the paper in the old days
you had a stock three or four different
kinds of paper to make the print this is
again an CIL's example if this is the
range of the negative and the positive
print on grade one would give you this
long low slope low contrast image but
andrei 3 you would take and make that
higher than the normal print if you
changed your brand of developer or your
concentration of dollar you would simply
get a curve like that
the
emergence time factor is also an
interesting things you're working with a
chemical that reacts and so that it is
consumed so if you making 20 prints xx
print will be lower in contrast than the
first print because your concentration
of active ingredients has decreased
substantially it's been used up the
previous 19 prints so ants I had a very
ingenious system when you're sitting in
the darkroom you have a safe flight of
the afire red light or a yellow light
and you can see the print can't see it
well but you can see the print so he
would time the length of time from when
he put it in the tray to when he saw a
particular object emerge and so that
might be 10 seconds in the first
processing and then he had a factor
figure if it was factor 10 that means I
will take it out at a hundred seconds
and so if now then the next printed
might take 11 seconds well he'd take it
out in 110 seconds so he multiplied the
time of the emergence by the factor and
so by doing that you can see here over
here
he has plotted diluted negative the
dilute developer solution using this
technique can overcome the effect of the
diluted development he can get a
constant result out from a chemical bath
that was changing uncontrollably we've
already talked about development time
and the enlarger depends upon whether
you've got collimated light or diffused
light and the selenium toning is a very
interesting thing if you process the
developed silver with these selenium
salts it actually changes the surface
property of the silver and gives you a
black or black and answer was absolutely
mastered that you
can also go wrong if you if you put the
right you can get the black/silver to
change color if you if you file that up
well what's beyond the tone scale this
this is important but what I think it
makes Ansel's work spectacular is the
things he did beyond the tone scale the
dodging and burning the best example of
that is an experiment that happened a
little bit before John joined our lab
experiment by Edwin land on the
black-and-white Mondrian because in this
experiment he had a bright light near a
dark grey object and the illumination
fell off with distance so it was a very
dim light up on a white object and my
job was to heat moving the light around
till the same amount of light came from
the white area at the top in the black
area at the bottom now if you take and
think of that as digits you take a
photograph of that well that's the same
to be the same digit in the camera here
as here if you manipulate that with a
tone scale what you'd like to do to make
this print better if you'd like to make
this whiter and this blacker but you see
I've got a problem if I've got the same
digit no matter what I do to the tone
scale I can't make the same digit go up
and down at the same time I can't I can
make this lighter but then this gets
lighter I make this darker but then this
gets darker you have to do something
different here than here to improve this
image and landed this is an experiment
about the visual system to show that
humans don't count what you see doesn't
depend upon the quanta that happens to
fall on the receptors it happens on the
relationship
between the other areas in the field
sorry if you scan I've rotated the
picture here so that is the dark area
and there's the light area you can see
I've scanned the digits along this path
you can see well we start off here and
then we have an edge and then we have
another edge in between we have a
gradient if you study this you find well
let's just look at this little patch of
one of these Bund RIANZ
if you look across this edge you see
it's 160 to 240 and you can see it a
little bit better here you have a highly
visible edge if you look here you can
see that well from here up to here and
also changes to 160 so we have the same
change in the amount of light however
one is very visible namely the edge and
the other of the gradient is highly
invisible so if you Manipur's
because you can't see it you can make
this go down it'll look virtually the
same as having it go up however if you
change the size of this edge you will
see it it'll be a big change in
appearance all of this comes from the
fact that you you like to think I always
used to like to think about well what's
important is the amount of light coming
from that's a hundred and that's 20 and
that's 50 that's why you see it as the
white gray and darker gray but in fact
it's not it's the relationship and so if
you keep track of the relationships you
can do anything you want with the
gradients and so vision allows you to do
things to an image that can improve it
can help you compress it from that great
big world into that tiny print but you
have to be careful the way you do it
another way of thinking about it is that
in ordinary films
you have a specific amount of light and
that turns into a specific response of
the film a specific density and that's
true of all the pixels in the field of
view but if you study human vision a
particular amount of light well it can
be a white it can be a gray it can be a
black it'd be anything you want
depending upon what you do to the other
pixels in the field of view and so
that's that's why if you manipulate
these gradients you can change the
appearances and in fact that this is a
project that John worked on in fact is
it John one of John's patents ordinary
photographs this I show this because it
was taken at Yosemite at one of Ansel's
workshops and here's a pole or set of
polaroid prints of overexposure normal
under exposure and the same amount of
light is coming from this white area in
the shade as this black area in the Sun
now this image was taken on a Kodak
negative which has about a full log unit
range they scanned it we brought it back
to the lab we process it by using
spanish facial manipulation and we're
able to render this picture so these are
no longer equal in the print we've
compressed the range of the print if we
just took and squashed it by linearly
compressing everything this would look
like a foggy day but if you spatially
manipulate the image we were trying to
do what Ansel had taught us you you can
maintain the edges and change the
gradient so you don't see it and in fact
these are some other images that are
processed using these techniques this is
a picture taken by Bob so bowl of HP and
in fact Bob was instrumental
HP used to have a camera that had this
processing in it unfortunately HP
doesn't make cameras it did not cause
didn't save it but this is all about
Hansel and some here's an Ansel making a
print the so called dodging and burning
here he's burning the top of an image
he's giving this more light so as to
bring out the details in a part of the
image here he's dodging I don't know if
you can see it but if you if you put
your hand here and cast a shadow from
the light you have a shot edge but I
have to get on a chair to demonstrate it
properly you will have an out-of-focus
image and if you move it onto the film
you can create a very soft change in
illumination that's so-called dodging
you take a essentially a lollipop and
you withhold film from a part of the
image Ansel also had a mechanical way of
doing this is a his his enlarger with
rows of lights so if he wanted to create
a non uniform control repeatable
illumination he would just turn on and
turn off these lights to have a light
mask to hit the negative to control at
the print looked like he preferred to do
the dodging and burning John described
it as Ansel dancing in front of the film
so to make a print
what Ansel would do is here's his one of
his famous these again are taken from
Ansel's book the the print you make a
series of exposures by just moving a
card across the in line so you would
start it here at the good start here and
expose this area and then take the card
away and expose this and then this and
then this and then this so that then
that would tell you the exposure and
tell you the grade of the paper that you
want it but when you look at this print
I think you can see that there's a
not much detail in the sky a little bit
more than on that screen but this the
sky is very weak and well it's the right
exposure for the lower areas to make to
see the details that are in the negative
in the sky you give it extra light
so there's Ansel holding the card
preventing light from coming from the
bottom of the picture here's an example
of dodging and here this is the straight
print and Ansel didn't like the tonal
relationship between these pines and the
other trees this is an example of
dodging it poorly
he's withheld too much light
intentionally and you can see that the
other trees have this white halo around
it because the gradients were changed to
severely but this is what he wanted he
wanted this relationship this lightness
versus this lightness for these
particular images these particular trees
in fact he had a formula a prescription
a recipe I think they called it for each
and ever a different print this would
tell you it's printed with a 24 inch
lens if this was the time as calculated
for the metronome he didn't have a time
I use the metronome counted it was f-22
select all and decked all it had was the
concentration and was on a paper called
seagull and it was toned in selenium and
the factor it was eight times after he
saw a particular feature involved and
then he would withhold the exposure for
two seconds I guess I don't know if for
some factor and then he would give extra
exposure here extra exposure here more
exposure there a lot more exposure there
more exposure there and do it with a
hole so we do all these steps
this would be the resulting image so the
print you see is not insult capturing
the real world as it is the print is
Ansel capturing all the information
possible and then rendering it to fit
his aesthetic content to fit his
visualization of the emotion that he
wanted to you to see from that image so
here we have we have the straight print
dodging and burning transit into this
print but Ansel is doing is changing the
gradients while preserving the edges and
this is one of John Sexton prints using
the same techniques there is a the
negative this is from listen to the
trees really a fabulous book this is the
straight print if you don't give the
straight exposure just do the dodging
and burning you are adding this to this
to get this the rendition intended to do
now the this is an example that I think
is probably one of simplest but in fact
a very profound thing if you Polaroid
film you were completely unable to
change anything the film manufacturers
the factory decided what it is your film
was going to respond to the light of the
scene but that that didn't stop Ansel he
developed this technique of pre exposure
I don't know if he developed himself he
knew of the process and he taught all of
us about it is that if you take a
picture and you find you've lost all the
information you'd like to capture you
would pre expose you
would take a uniform card hold it in
front of the lens cover the field of
view have uniform light on turn the
aperture weight and essentially give us
called a bump exposure exposure to take
from and expose all the grains at the
threshold of detection then when you
take the photograph so you take this
photograph then you take this photograph
in fact the pre exposure plus the scene
give you a better dynamic range you can
see more information in the print by
having raised essentially a fog level
everywhere so you have this great irony
you have you've decreased the actual
physical dynamic range no question
you've added like you have increased the
apparent dynamic range and what have you
done you've brought out some edges that
we're sub-threshold
you've changed the shape of the curve by
exposure as opposed to the way he'd like
to do it with with development so it's a
very simple lesson but it has a profound
implication it tells you a lot capped
just capturing all those bits and
processing meticulously right and
keeping them in dynamic range well
that's a good thing to do but it's not a
necessary thing to do it's not the
crucial thing in getting the rendition
that you would like to have so de Soto
summarize this the Ansel was an absolute
master at spatial rendering he would
capture the high dynamic range
information capture all the possible he
would then synthesize a new image he
would preserve the spatial ratios it
would distort the input luminances it's
not an accurate record it would decrease
the actual dynamic range
but it would increase the apparent
dynamic range now all of these things we
can do with automatic image processing
because we can preserve the edges and we
can preserve the dynamic range but we
can't do it automatic and image
processing is do is add the aesthetic
content is that the power associated
with you know the emotional reaction you
get when you look at these pictures at
least I don't know anybody who can do
that maybe that's something that we
should worry about these are the the
books that there's a lot of stuff about
DECT all that I probably can interest
you in and though answer though John
Saxon said in his talk yesterday was
kind of interesting if you can find
somebody who still has a darkroom and
still goes into the room and sloshes
things around just ask them to come see
it because they'd love to show you they
won't even charge you they love it to do
it so much they'd love to show you and
it is really worth seeing it is a UNIX
experience that is about to become
extinct Rapids which you haven't yet but
these books have profound information
about everything and everything to do
with photography and there's a lot about
technology you can just forget about
just skip over but it they are great
books that tell you a lot of stories
about imaging and then if you aren't
interested in the technical details the
last book they're the examples that how
Ansel made Fadi of his most famous
photographs it's a wonderful read it's a
wonderful bit of history it is really
worth following these books are still
available in bookstores but of course
you could google it and you'll find all
the editions from all the different
places and this is just a photograph of
we were going out with our 20 by 24
camera
to make some pictures and this is a my
friend fells gun it just gave me this
photograph is a remembrance of all times
so this is the married man that worked
on 20 by 20 foot photography at Boeing
so thank you very much
I'd be eager to ask answer any questions
you might like to ask and do remember to
look for John sections talk at the
question is am i familiar with Polaroids
twenty by twenty four camera and I did
John pay you to ask that question it was
kind of a long story but Polaroid had
made a an eight by ten system and there
was a tradition that land would always
go and give these very dramatic
shareholder meetings and three thousand
people would come to a shareholders mean
not to hear the financial results but
the seed lands demonstrations and land
had a policy you'd never stopped working
on a shareholders meeting more than four
weeks before the meeting because
everybody loved to jump in and help out
and it would just blow everybody's
budget so his economic future was lit at
the time people could do things and so
it was always some demonstration of
something that was not going to be a
product it was going to be a g-wiz so I
had the job of being in charge of the
research machine shop and so he called
me up and said I've just seen this
eight-by-ten but with three thousand
people it's not big enough
can you make a 20 by 24 camera get video
to make a 20 by 24 camera and will make
it just like the original camera that we
demonstrated the instant photography of
the optical society meeting in 1949 so
we went to work we didn't even know that
20 by 24 film wasn't 20 by 24 there's a
margin inside but we made it 20 by 24 so
we made it the wrong size
a week later I came back and told well
we've got this machine shop making that
we've got the rolls underway we've found
the lens we've got the bells it looks
like and well also it was he asked us
five weeks ahead of the meeting so I
knew that that was kind of dangerous it
at at four weeks he said well what I
really want is a camera that will
photograph or otherwise the ball abuja
ball I've looked it up it's 39 inches
wide can you make us a camera that's one
meter wide by two means high and I said
well we got our four weeks and so we
pulled it off and in fact at that
shareholders meeting yosef Kosh took a
picture of Ansel Adams a portrait of
Ansel Adams and we showed it doesn't
pictures from Boston Museum of Fine Arts
that were photographed on this
one-to-one imaging so yes I do know what
you
right well in fact the cameras still
going and the reason it's going is
because of that that adjustment is what
was in the original demonstration with
the optical society that adjustment is
moving the rollers back and forth to
control the thickness of the developer
and that's the key thing to getting a
good picture
in fact those roles are have a camber
they're not flat they're milled so
they're crowning them so that to get
uniform developer across the width of
the sheet you have to have the rolls
tighter in the middle and on the outside
ordinary film there passed their papers
things to set that gap but that is a
real bear if you're going to manufacture
film because in fact what we were doing
is we were ironing them on the first the
first version and that said no no don't
do that
just set the gap then you'd get a rid of
that whole manufacturing staff back so
all you put into the camera was raw
negative raw positive there was no film
assembly so and it is still going
somebody has bought all the available
negative you can get Elsa Dorfman to
take your picture and Cambridge
Massachusetts the it's still going even
though the Polaroid is I hang it I don't
think there's any other film made by
Polaroid that he still exists at the
moment and except the 25 24 so that that
rinky-dink think there are five or
eventually made and they have just done
a lot of incredible things with a lot of
beautiful people using but
I can tell you well the whole first half
oh thank you question is I've described
sort of two sides of an flames one the
very technical mechanical side into the
less the dodging and burning is more
very apparently more variable and was
there a more definitive technical
repeatable process that he developed and
just described how well I don't think I
did do a good job everything in the
exposure and development process was
very meticulously controlled just like
the times in the bath the dodging and
burning he he did quite precisely
again this pianist training he could
make 20 prints in a day and they you
couldn't tell the difference I couldn't
tell the difference maybe he could
he had techniques such as the the
switches on the back of the enlarger to
do that kind of thing so he certainly
tried them but he preferred preferred
doing it that way because he thought he
would have better control he was just
incredibly good at it and in fact an
ePrint you see that has Ansel Adams
signed he himself did all the printing
he printed it he might have had people
help him dry it or spot the negative
spot the positives or whatever it is but
he crafted all of his pictures there are
pictures that are a a sign and those
were pictures printed by Alan Ross is
close to associate all dynein Ansel's
home under ansel supervision so now you
will see different renditions but that
because Ansel changed how he liked to
print over the years and he'll explode
all these things but I don't think he
found a mechanical means now certainly
in digital technology he could have
found the solution if somebody asked me
in after my talk yesterday did antha
ever take any pictures in color in fact
there's a book published of his color
pictures and many am really quite lovely
Ansel was not quite comfortable with
color because he never felt he the
problem was that whole tone scale the
whole response of the film was made in
the factory so he couldn't get his hands
on controlling that to render the scene
the way he wanted so he was never happy
with the manufactured film scale he
wanted to make his own
well I question is as time goes on we
are increasing our ability to capture
more information and display more
information and I have to argue a bit in
the talk that I gave two years ago what
you'll find on your Google I described
experiments we measure the range that's
possible to capture on the film play and
in fact I was unable to find in the
cameras I tested and there's not a
comprehensive test but the tamra's I
happen to test the highest dynamic range
came from a color film negative and it
probably had to do with the camera
because it's a larger camera and it had
less scatter then it was a the digital
cameras I chose I and you probably could
reverse that you probably could find a
digital camera that responds better than
the negative film but for most images
they're in a comparable range and that's
because you got to separate the senses
there was a recent conference at
Stanford and one of the fellows there
gave and talked about how good the
sensors are getting and he reported that
he could get I think it was 10 to the
11th one part in 10 to the 11th in his
sensor as a readable difference I have
no quote no problem with that
the sensors digital sensors can
do a phenomenal job the problem is the
optics have undesired stray light and
you can't get that to the image plane
you can't get ten to the twelfth and
you're changing exposure just doesn't
help because all it does is move the
value up and down the tone scale but it
doesn't change the ratio of unwanted
light from the lens to right right right
right
you'd know new so you certainly you
certainly can improve in that direction
in terms of the digital displays it's
also interesting because for example so
the the bright side image has a high
resolution LCD and a low resolution LED
so in fact they are doing a very complex
transform of presenting the edges in the
LCD and they the gradients in the LEDs
and if you do that perfectly
you should truly be able to get a much
higher dynamic range display now but the
question is do you do they do it
perfectly it's a very complicated well
thank you very much
