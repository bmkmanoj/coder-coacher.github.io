sharing some data that actually was part
of a Google grant so basically it was
two years ago or maybe less than that
about a year ago they were awarded a
grant to look at Parkinson and around
tella medicine so thank you thank you
thank you very much Patrick for the
invitation to speak with you today a
good morning my name is ray Dorsey I'm a
neurologist at Johns Hopkins where I
direct a movement disorder or
Parkinson's disease division and
directed neurology telemedicine and a
year ago Google is very kind enough to
give a grant to dr. Kevin Bigland and to
me to evaluate how we can use
telemedicine or technologies that Google
is developing to transform care for
Parkinson's disease and we're here to
discuss how we think we can transform
care and then dr. big lens going to
discuss how we can transform a research
for parkinson disease so as many of you
know the burden of Parkinson's disease
like many chronic conditions is growing
but access to care in the United States
and globally is very limited Google is
currently enabling patients with
Parkinsons to receive a care from a
specialist in their home in addition
with Google support we think that people
from around the world with Parkinson's
disease that can receive care and right
now most of the world's population with
Parkinson's disease care with with
Parkins disease receive no care and at
finally those number of a different
Google technologies that can be
leveraged to improve care for patients
with parkinson's disease so first the
the burden and the burden of parking
disease both United States and around
the world is growing us substantially so
in 2005 we estimate that about four
million people with Parkinson's disease
in the world's most populous countries
and just do the aging populations by
2030 that are more than double and by
2030 more than half the people with a
Parkinson's disease and the world's most
populous nations will be Chinese so this
is a problem not just for developed for
developed or industrialized nations but
even a greater challenged for developing
nations
the challenge is that access to Perkins
these specialists is limited by
geography so this is a map of Maryland
County and there's about mm time
Maryland State there's 23 counties in
Maryland and if you happen to live in
Baltimore City or Baltimore County and
yellow there's many a Parkinson's II
specialists but if you live in any of
these 20 of these other counties there
are none an upstate New York or dr.
Bigland practices this is about a 150 to
200 mile a diameter oval and in there
there's not a single Parkinson's II
specialist but there's 30 nursing homes
many of whom have individuals with
Parkinson disease so the question is how
can you reach out to these individuals
to provide care in the United States of
this is data of courtesy of dr. Allison
Willis less less than sixty percent of
Medicare beneficiaries actually see a
neurologist so more than forty percent
of Medicare beneficiaries so people who
have health insurance in the United
States who have Parkinson's do not see a
neurologist and you can see that you
know the darker areas are areas were
more than three quarters of patients
with Parkinsons disease you not see a
neurologist and obviously it's a little
more prominent in the West and rural
areas but even on the East Coast you can
see many areas of the nation where
twenty-five percent of the population
does not see a neurologist for their
care if you look outside the United
States is in even even scarier story and
Bolivia when they've gone door-to-door
and identify people with Parkinson's
disease not a single one has had seen a
neurologist when I'm in robeson never
never been seen a physician for their
condition even though parking disease is
an eminently treatable condition and
China there are about two million people
with Parkinson's disease right now it's
only about 50 Parkins these specialists
so one specialist for every city of
everyone with Parkinson disease and
forty percent of all countries anti
parkinsonian drugs are generally not
available even though they've been
developed for over half a century and a
three percent of low income countries
are no available treatments for
parkinson disease so the greatest
challenge for Parkinson's disease and
probably for many chronic conditions is
that world
most individuals with Parkinson's
disease have never been diagnosed and
never been treated despite the fact that
in medicines are inexpensive readily
available safe improved quality of life
and decreased mortality those
individuals who see a neurologist fare
better than those who don't this is data
from the US and Medicare data and it
shows that individuals who are treated
by a neurologist or fourteen percent
less likely to have a hip fracture
twenty one percent less likely to be
placing a skilled nursing home facility
and twenty-two percent less likely to
die so a huge unmet need here in the
United States where resources are rich
if you look at individuals who see a
parkin disease specialist you know
highly specialized neurologists there
are three times more likely to be
satisfied with their care so access to
care makes a difference for parkinson
disease and it makes a difference for a
range of other chronic conditions where
improved access to specialist least a
higher quality of patient care and
improve outcomes and quality of life
this is true for Parkinson's is true for
heart disease this is true for diabetes
for just about any chronic condition so
now I'd like to turn to how what Google
is doing to actually help transform the
way we deliver health care for
Parkinson's disease so again through a
research grant that Google provided to
us twenty patients with Parkinsons ease
at the University of Rochester and at
Johns Hopkins were randomized to receive
care either with dr. big Lenore I in
clinic just like you would at a
traditional outpatient clinic or to
receive care with us in their home via
telemedicine were web-based video
conferencing and we were looking at the
sea is this feasible can you deliver
care to people in their homes medical
care how can you do can the motor
examination that we do for parkin seas
can you do that just as well in the home
as you can do in clinic can you
demonstrate that the clinical outcomes
that you get in the home or at least as
good as those that you can get in the
clinic can you improve quality of life
can you improve patient satisfaction and
can you demonstrate economic value of
telemedicine and the studies still
ongoing but we have some preliminary
data to address a couple of these that
we want to share with you
this google funded study is the first
randomized clinical trial to evaluate
the use of web-based video conferencing
to actually deliver medical care from a
physician directly into somebody's home
and we think this is a potential to
transform care not just for Parkinson's
disease but for Alzheimer's disease but
for cancer for diabetes for any wide
range of conditions for pediatric
patients so these are the individuals
who have participating the study again
20 individuals nine were randomized to
receive telemedicine 11 to receive in
person care and not surprisingly r about
age around 65 which is a very common for
parkinson's disease about a quarter were
women overwhelmingly white and educated
patients in this study and they had a
mild to moderate disease as measured by
different characteristics of Parkinson
disease these patients come from as far
away is 130 miles away and we're saving
them two hours of time so here's a
University of Rochester up here is a
University of Rochester and you can see
in the blue or all the telemedicine
patients in the red are the usual care
patients to their travel traveling tour
again as far as 130 miles away at
baseline and some of these patients are
now able to receive the care in their
home each individual who sees a receives
the care in their home by saving on
average a hundred miles of
transportation per visit and two hours
of time here in Baltimore again you
would think it's a known pro city on the
eastern eastern seaboard so you think
that access to care might not be as
limited as much but again we're still
seeing in blue telemedicine patients who
are 120 miles hundred miles away from us
and we're a relatively small state so
you can extrapolate that you know here
we are in California you know to take
care of patients in riverside county or
in the Central Valley you know they
don't have access to a neurologist and
that you can really change the way that
they're receiving the care so we've
completed at 20 in-person visits in 15
telemedicine visits 13 the telemedicine
visits were completed scheduled we
expect that we'll be able to complete
ninety percent of the total mess visits
as as scheduled and we've been able to
complete the motor assessments of
assessments of Parkinson's disease at
remotely as we have been in person and
what really strikes is that how
efficient this model is and we all know
that health care is inefficient and
we're actually taking inefficiencies out
of the system so right now if a typical
Parkins these patient when they come see
dr. big land or doctor or me they'll
spend you know 170 minutes two and a
half hours a per visit to spend 14
percent of that time with the physician
so a lot of ways when they see us in
telemedicine they're building 38 minutes
from computer onto computer off and
seventy-six percent that time is spent
with the physician only twenty-four
percent is wasted so we're trying to
turn the way we deliver healthcare on
its head and really you know change the
valuable part and make that the majority
of the time that people are spending in
our study patients were very comfortable
with a technology prefer telemedicine so
it's a question you know we're dealing
with older individuals eunos grandma
able to use a computer and so the
patients that we were taking care of
were very tech-savvy one hundred percent
were using the internet daily eighty
percent using YouTube forty percent
using skype all had owned a computer a
many owned an ipad they were thirsting
for this model of care I think I've
never had a study for which recruitment
was easier I think I recruited all my
patients in to clinic days ninety
percent would prefer to receive care via
tell mess and rather than their usual
than usual care and forty-five percent
expressed at the outside the study
without before even enrolling
willingness to pay more than their a
typical copay to receive this model of
care and so our sample you know how
representative is our sample of the
general population but among in adults
50 to 64 you know three chords use
internet daily fifty percent are using a
video sharing sites like YouTube the
fastest growing segment of social
networking are the are older adults so
you know this is only going to increase
over time in people's comfort level of
the technology will increase and so
we've now discussed how we're doing in
the United States and these technologies
they don't respect a borders they're not
worried about licensure rules and so
that at Hopkins we've been able to now
provide care to patients and nine
different countries on three different
continents and so the main these are
individuals who came to Baltimore for
their initial assessment and now we and
say rather than never see you again or
we wish you the best in the future or
come see us in a year or two we can
provide care to you in your home on an
ongoing basis so we've seen that
patients and a wide range of the
locations you know everywhere from South
Paulo Brazil to a Kuwait and the
patients have appreciated it this is a
low-tech version of what a telemedicine
visit looks like in February and have
you been doing good what's better ah
fine physical you know I'm up to 60
I'm up to 60 minutes a week on the
exercise so that's good 60 minutes a
week and Talia a bunch of exercise I'm
doing the best I can good and then at
the right hand can you open and close
your right heat just her thumb and index
finger on the right hand so he's in
Mexico so yeah many baltimora I'd like
to see it no why and he's an American
living in Mexico on and then open and
close
all the way open
so you can see some slowness in his and
twist in the left hand
we get with good can you stand up and
you put your arms like this and stand up
ideally you like a little more space
behind that you can walk in assesses
walking but you still get a sense your
saggy additional sense of his social
history excuse me feel better than I did
before why does it scare you that's not
supposed to happen you supposed to as I
understand and it's works isn't did you
get worse and orson orson well the
disease progresses over time but we try
to make you function at a highest level
as possible so we're able to know extend
the care that he was received for me and
baltimore knee came from an initial
evaluation and to be continued to
provide his care wherever he is this had
models with lots of it it were in
Silicon Valley so there's lots of it
companies are looking at telemedicine as
an application and we think there's a
couple ways that this model that
Google's helping support differentiates
itself from the services that are being
currently provided by startup companies
these are all different story up
companies in telemedicine and most of
them are focused on acute one-time
consultations we think this model that
we're developing with you as a fantastic
way to carry for individuals with
chronic diseases people with Parkinson's
ease have the disease on average for
about 14 years of life and over time the
disease does progress and their ability
to access care decreases so many senses
that the people who need to care the
most can get the lease and we think that
this is a nice way to look at looking at
chronic disease management and obviously
has a novel of focus in terms of disease
interest
news I'm Renee Montagne and I'm Steve
Inskeep good morning if you don't live
in a major city it can be hard to find
medical specialists and that is
especially true for people with chronic
disorders like Parkinson's disease who
need frequent care and today in your
health we look at patients who are
turning to specialists hundreds of miles
away to get the attention they need by
video doctors and patients like the
video appointments but insurance
companies are not yet convinced NPR's
Nancy shoot reports Deanna Ventura was
seeing a neurologist for her but she was
still having trouble walking bathing and
doing her housework I knew that I needed
more than what he was doing for me
managing Parkinson's symptoms is a
tricky business and the drugs used can
have serious side effects you need a
specialist but for Ventura the closest
was two hours away from her home in
upstate New York and she doesn't drive
so the specialist comes to her so I last
saw you in February and have you been
doing since februari if it sounds like
ray Dorsey is far away that's because he
is 343 miles away at Johns Hopkins
Medical Center in Baltimore he's a
movement disorder specialist and he's
been venturus doctor for the last four
years so this is sense that there's
different ways that getting some media
attention pharmaceutical companies are
interested in this way to improve access
to care for people with relatively rare
conditions where access is even more
limited I wanted to devote the last few
minutes before turning over to dr.
Bigland about the new model for
delivering a care to expand this model
for individuals around the world so our
thought is that with Google's help that
we can create a free town medicine
clinic so that individuals anywhere in
the world with Parkinson's disease can
get access to the care that they need a
one-time consultation with a specialist
who's trained in Parkinson's disease and
be able to provide care to many people
who currently are unable to access care
and at Lisa provide initial direction
and guidance to these individuals we
think that this technology can be done
obviously on computers and laptops but
you you know using the Android platform
and the video conferencing software that
we're using you could rarely do this
on a tablet computer or on Android
enabled cell phones and the way this
would look is that this clinic would
patients could sign up securely online
to indicate their interest in receiving
care select a select number of patients
to receive their care on a monthly basis
we can readily assist a patient's in
setting up the technology we do that
right now it takes about 15 minutes of a
research assistants time the patients to
receive their care I mean to get
familiar with the technology they could
receive their care from importantly
specialists and those recommendations
could be sent to the patients and to
their physicians and we think that we as
you can do this with University of
Rochester and Johns Hopkins we can
probably do this with institutions
throughout the country and around the
world and then a number of Google's
technologies can be leveraged to improve
care for patients with parkinson's
disease and so we alluded to you know
Android software platform for mobile
devices can obviously you know help with
the fall detection and decrease Falls
this is important not just for people
with Parkinson's disease but for
patients populations that are increasing
in their prevalence both the United
States and around the world you know
Google Plus would be a great forum for
creating a social network for patients
with Parkinsons ease or other chronic
conditions to share information with
other individuals and other caregivers
who are carrying the same burden YouTube
could be used for as an educational
platform both for patients for
caregivers for training providers
especially in developing nations or most
individuals receiving care won't be
receiving care from a neurologist but
from you know health care aides or
nurses or social workers or people that
are in the field we think that this
models could take a spin on google doc
so rather than just you know using the
thing about it documents you can now
think about as physicians so Google Docs
I could be providing care to people
around the world and the platform and
the technology itself can help
facilitate communications as could the
calendar and gmail
you know Google Trends has been that
recently described to show how it can
track outbreaks of infectious diseases
and this same technology could be used
to help us understand where the needs of
physicians and you know text messaging
could you know be used for example to
help improve adherence to medications so
with google we think this model can be
expanded by geography by conditioning of
Parkinson's perhaps Alzheimer's disease
next and Beyond neurology we can go into
into into patients homeless we've done
we've gone into nursing homes retirement
communities and then dr. big limb is
going to talk about clinical trials so
finally conclude you know Google can
really help shift the paradigm of
healthcare you know the changes that
need to occur in healthcare or an
unlikely to come from the healthcare
industry itself it's going to be likely
to come from those outside the industry
we have failed for a generation to do it
it's technology firms and it's a
entrepreneurship that needs to come in
to change the way that we deliver
healthcare we think that your technology
technological capabilities expertise
that the University of Rochester has in
telemedicine and Johns Hopkins
international reach can enable that
patients anywhere anywhere with Parkins
disease can get the care that they need
turn this over to dr. big line I'm dr.
Kevin Bigland I'm a neurologist and
movement just sort of specialist at the
university of rochester and i'm the
associate chair for clinical research in
the department of neurology and i want
to take this opportunity to talk to you
about how web-based video conferencing
and other technology can be utilized to
maximize clinical research specifically
experimental research through clinical
trials so utilizing the same type of
technology that dr. Dorsey just spoke
about with regards to providing care for
parkinson's disease patients we see this
is a powerful tool for evaluating
patients in clinical research studies
and hopefully this will lead to
increasing a pace of
of therapeutic research in a variety of
diseases are specific interest is in
neurologic and Nordic jam diseases and I
want to speak to you today largely about
one the burdens associated with clinical
trial participation and the barriers to
enrollment how remote technologies can
facilitate that and then what are our
next steps so this is the tallest
mountain in New York State I'm supposed
to stay at that podium I tend to wander
this is the and it's a about a mile high
so the the summit of this mountain is
the same height as Denver it's called
Mount Marcy and I was foolish enough at
one point to decide that I was gonna
climb there's actually ski up this
mountain in the middle of winter and
then I was going to ski down at which I
ultimately did and you're kind of
chugging along here for multiple hours
trying to figure out you know chug and
chug and chug in and you think you know
at some point what am I ever going to
see the summit of this mountain you know
it's been hours now and I'm a little bit
tired and so you you come around this
turn here and you kind of get this
glorious view of the summit of Mount
Marcy and you're like oh my gosh great
I'm so close now and then you realize
actually it's not really that close I
still have a really significant way to
go before I'm at the top and I think
actually that's kind of where we stand
with clinical trials therapeutic
research in in a variety of neurologic
diseases we've we've kind of set the
stage here where we can kind of see the
summit to improve therapies for a
variety of neurologic diseases but the
reality is that that last little bit is
still a challenge to get to and there
are a number of burdens and barriers
associated with that many of which
telemedicine and web-based technologies
can facilitate so drug development as we
all know is increasingly expensive you
know most of that the cost for drug
development is in the clinical trial
periods of the period with Russia
testing therapies in patients and that
is a those costs have increased
dramatically over the last 30 years the
mage
your driver of costs really is our
ability to recruit individuals into
studies more than eighty percent of
studies there's a delay and recruitment
nearly a quarter of the time spent in
the completion of the trials it's just
spending getting the people into the
study most many studies a third of them
don't even meet their target enrollment
and this has really profound
implications for the interpretation of
the studies it slow recruitment adds up
to about sixteen billion dollars in
direct costs that's not really even
accounting for the fact that we have a
number of trials that ultimately fail
and a third of trials need to seek
additional funding largely because
they're slow recruitment has impacted
them and I'll give you an example of
that eventually but ultimately this
leads to failed trials or underpowered
trials even more so where the we don't
enroll enough people into the study to
really get the answers that we need yeah
and unfortunately people don't like to
participate in trials even in diseases
you know fatal diseases like cancer only
about three to five percent people who
are eligible for clinical trials
participate in trials in Parkinson's
disease it's even worse only about 1% of
people who participate in trials who are
eligible to participate in trials
participate and we're never going to
find treatments for these diseases
unless people are willing to participate
Huntington's disease which is a disorder
a neurologic disorder inherited disease
that results in progressive declines in
motor function cognitive function
impairments in behavior and ultimately
leading to death is is a small disease
but a disease of great interest to the
neurologic community in terms of
identifying therapies that either can
slow the progression or prevent the
onset of disease even more importantly
and so the Huntington study group which
is an academic consortium looked at
individuals who were either related to
hunting his either had Huntington's
disease had the gene for Huntington's
disease had a spouse with Huntington's
disease etc and surveyed them about what
were the barriers barriers to practice
and one of the most important barriers
was missing work this becomes
increasingly prevalent we're talking
about diseases where we can identify
people who are at risk for disease but
are not yet 60 these are people
otherwise healthy living their lives
they know that they may or are going to
develop a disease in the near future
there are number of parkinsonian
disorders that that fall into this
category but Huntington's disease is
kind of prototypical one and these are
individuals who are young working full
time have families and the ability to
participate in trials due to time
barriers related to work travel barriers
are increasingly important so the major
barriers that people identified were
time travel lost work we recently
completed a study in the population of
people who carried the gene for
Huntington's disease but we're not yet
sick and this was the prequel study it
was a phase 2 study looking at a
nutritional supplement coenzyme q10 it's
the first multicenter study in
individuals at one hundred percent risk
for developing a disease for developing
Huntington's disease prior to them being
sick we only our goal was only to enroll
90 individuals and initially we had ten
sites in or you know to do that and we
looked at three doses of coenzyme q10
there was no placebo arm in this study
short study 20 20 weeks but seven visits
over the course of this study we were
mainly looking at the tolerability of
the treatment in a population whose
otherwise healthy as well as looking at
some biomarker data and the feasibility
of conducting a study in this population
and this is what our enrollment curve
looked like and you can see our
projected enrollment is the green dashed
line here and we had anticipated that
really we would be able to enroll
everyone within nine months of the study
all the data that we had going into the
study suggested that was going to be the
case people were very enthusiastic this
population was very enthusiastic about
enrolling even more importantly we
thought we had a captive population
there is a large observational study
called the predict study which is
looking at people who carry the gene for
Huntington's disease but are not yet ill
and just following them over time and
all the people all the sites that we
involved in this study were involved in
this trial involved in this trial there
was over 400 individuals who were
potentially eligible to enroll in this
at these different sites and we were
asking them to enroll about a quarter of
those people who were already involved
in research and you can see actually you
know just a few months in they did
pretty well but just a few months in we
really flattened out and our sites were
telling us you know what we've
approached everyone that we know of to
be involved in this study that we
currently are seeing and there's just
nobody else left to enroll and so this
was kind of problematic in this is even
more problematical this is a population
that's actually not in the health care
system in general this population people
who may be gene carriers are not
necessarily seeking care many of them
actually would be just as happy to not
think about the fact that they may be at
risk or maybe carrying the gene for the
disease and if you want to put that in
their face every day for you know by
being involved in a trial that's that's
a potential issue so we we kind of had
to go back to the drawing board and you
know say well what do we what did we do
about this and so well we said well in a
lot of visits over 20 weeks maybe we
eliminate some of the visits that I'll
make it more palatable for people we
added additional sites that was
ultimately probably very beneficial for
us more sites but it resulted in the
fact that we actually this whole delay
resulted in the fact that our drug
expired we had to order new drug we'd
have a manufacturer new drug and that
obviously has huge impacts on costs but
it ultimately was successful but it took
two years to enroll this population we
had anticipated nine months it took more
than twice as long to do this you can
kind of see this is where we flattened
out here and then we started to make
changes in the enrollment again did pick
up but you know this is kind of a real
life example of where you know
recruiting for trials is never what you
think it's going to be and there are
always challenges and so we actually
want to know specifically from this
population of individuals who were
eligible for participation why they
didn't participate and you can see these
these themes kind of our recurrent time
miss from work time intensive study just
not interested travel forty percent of
people thought that travel was a major
barrier to their participation in this
specific study okay so these things are
going to continue to
I want to touch you know basically a
little bit about when we're talking
about neurologic disease and
specifically neurodegenerative diseases
you know what is the ultimate goal in
these diseases with regards to
therapeutic research and probably the
primary thing if we had if we had to
pick one thing that we could do that
would be ideal we'd be able to identify
people before they were sick intervene
in some way and prevent them from
getting ill and this is kind of the
preventive trial trial paradigm that we
think about and we think about it most
specifically in Huntington's disease
because we can identify that population
with a hundred percent certainty through
genetic testing but if you have a group
of people you intervene at some point
here and you know this is a the treated
group at the time in the triangle to the
top and the squares are the placebo
group you can see that if you can
intervene then you can push back this
period where there is a diagnosis of
disease back relative to the the
untreated population and this is our
goal for a variety of neurologic
diseases certainly this is our goal in
alzheimer's disease we think we're
increasingly able to identify people
prior to a diagnosis or onset of
symptoms or even onset of brain changes
or biomarker changes in alzheimer's
disease we're getting close to this in
parkinson's disease we can identify
people at high risk for developing
Parkinson's disease prior to onset and
so this is a paradigm that becomes
increasingly important as we move
forward particularly as genetics allows
us to identify people at increasingly
high risk for disease prior to onset
unfortunately it has a couple of
problems one is as I alluded to this
idea of identifying people at risk
Huntington's disease is nice because we
can do that pretty easily in general
neurodegenerative diseases even common
ones are relatively uncommon in the
population and you don't want include
everybody in a study for people who are
at a low likelihood of getting sick and
these diseases are slowly progressive I
think dr. Dorsey's patient said you know
we're all supposed to get worse and that
is true these are degenerative diseases
people get worse over time but they tend
to get worse very slowly and in
Parkinson's disease where we have
effective interventions people actually
feel that they do better at least in the
short term as is that gentleman so
eloquently said so these long time
horizons slow progression of disease and
then ultimately how do we define disease
on
the bottom line for this really and in
the context of this discussion is that
all of these barriers suggest that we
need to have large amounts of patients
followed for long periods of time even
if we can identify possibility who's at
one hundred percent risk like
Huntington's disease for disease
Huntington's disease we still don't know
when they're going to develop the
disease we can make some estimates or
probability estimates about when that's
going to happen but the reality is we
don't necessarily know for sure when
that's going to happen and we it could
be 10 years from now and are we going to
be following these people for 10 years
well I think some people argue that we
might have to and when we put this again
in some real numbers for you just to
give you an idea there are about 30,000
people in the United States who have
Huntington's disease there are about
150,000 people who are at risk for
having Huntington's disease that means
most of them won't have Huntington's
these about 90,000 them will be
unaffected the the other 60,000 will be
gene carriers for the condition so out
of population of gene carriers in North
America is about 60,000 individuals if
you start looking at you know age the
people who are most likely to develop a
diagnosis of Huntington's disease during
that time period you really start to get
your numbers down to about 20,000 people
who are really eligible for
participation in a trial of this kind
and if you take your standard trial
where you're randomizing people to
placebo you're assuming a small rate of
about four percent per year which in
population we look at is probably pretty
accurate low dropout rates five percent
dropout rate per year that's that's a
probably optimistic and your standard
power and alpha standards this is the
these this types of sample sizes that
we're looking at so if you if you look
at the you know this top left corner
here if you have a small therapeutic
effect that means that there's a ten
percent reduction in the rate of
diagnosis and people who are treated
versus people in the placebo group and
you follow them for three years that's a
relatively small effect but probably
meaningful effect honestly you would
need about 20,000 people we know that
there are 20,000 people who would be
eligible for this study
that probably seems unrealistic we know
in from Parkinson's disease and cancer
studies that if we can get five percent
people to participate in trials were
doing a good job in yeah in Huntington's
disease they expect one hundred percent
involvement is obviously unrealistic so
the real goals there are we either you
know look for a very large treatment
effect where we follow people for a long
period of time I think it's unrealistic
to think anticipate a large treatment
effect we want to look for the smallest
effect that is going to be clinically
meaningful for individuals patients etc
and so we're really getting to a point
where if ten percent is meaningful we
need to file large groups of people for
long periods of time and ultimately you
know this is a problem because it may be
not be realistic we know that the longer
you follow people in a clinical trial
the less likely they are to continue to
participate in that trial and that the
the dropout rates become almost
logarithmic you know when you start to
file people for greater than five years
but technology may be a means for
allowing us to evaluate people
potentially in their homes ideally in
their homes for long beards time and
this certainly could be invaluable in
our development of therapies for
neurodegenerative diseases and we think
it is valuable we think it has impacts
on costs we think primarily through its
ability to facilitate recruitment we
reduce travel burden for Paige both
patients and caregivers we can increase
the geographic scope so this
international collaboration is a
valuable one for for us in both in terms
of providing care to individuals but
also opening up access to clinical trial
or clinical research opportunities for
individuals with neurodegenerative
disease and you know it's it's it's
interesting to note that you know we've
been doing this all along that in
diseases relatively rare diseases or
diseases where we know we can't get the
population at one location we start to
expand the population and certainly in
Huntington's disease the research
community and even the care community
has become an international community
and so this is already exists but if we
can facilitate that even better
and then ultimately there may be issues
with improved data collection improved
data and I think a lot of what we want
to talk about ultimately after this is
how can what kind of data can we capture
using technology can we somehow improve
the way that we do our assessments so
that people are interested in performing
the assessments making assessments fun
so that people are more willing to do it
and you have more data and better data
we often ask people to keep I hate to
say this at Google written logs of
infirmity of what the how they're doing
and you know in terms of you know how
they're functioning I will talk about an
instance of blood pressure monitoring
where we asked what keep written logs
but that is obviously wrought with error
because people everyone tend not to do
it and if they do do it they do it at
the last minute before they see the
doctor and then we know that data is
probably not very good and this is the
the model that we envision in terms of
utilizing remote home based assessments
and how they can be beneficial for in
clinical trials so you have remote
assessments in the home there we go
which ultimately result in decreased
burn up residence they don't have to
come to the site they don't have to
travel hundred fifty miles to be
evaluated by a specialist in the field
to be involved in a study they can be
evaluated in their home they'd also take
off work necessarily the investigator
potentially could do the evaluation in
their home as well so you could imagine
that you could be doing it at times that
is both convenient for the investigator
and for the patient we talked about this
issue of broad geographical reach
expanding geographical reach increases
the number of participants involved in
the study ultimately both of these
things facilitate recruitment short
duration of recruitment and less cost
ultimately again if we can reduce the
burden we can increase the increase the
likelihood that something will continue
in a study for a long period of time
which would ultimately result in you
know we have to often have to account
for about twenty percent drop out in
studies if we can recount for a smaller
dropout rate we have smaller sample size
less costs
and I think an important issue with the
not only the geographic scope but it's
increasing access to people who couldn't
otherwise participating trials and
Parkinson's disease is an excellent
example here where we have we do have
large unmet therapeutic needs in
Parkinson's disease particularly around
areas of psychosis and dementia in that
population however most of those
individuals who are suffering from
psychosis and dementia are not residing
in the community many of them are
residing in nursing homes people in
nursing homes in general do not
participate in clinical research at all
so we have a population who has unmet
therapeutic needs who does not
participate in research and so what are
we how do we how we address that while
we we take people with less severe
problems related to that who are living
in the community to enroll and that's
probably not the population were most
interested and we're actually interested
in the population that is in a nursing
home because they have psychosis and so
expanding the Donna like geographic
scope but increasing the access to care
for individuals even residing in our own
communities or otherwise don't
participate in research and we do you
know we do have evidence that people are
interested in this idea and so goodness
is the project aware and the yellow bar
there is this idea of home web based
assessments and overall people who
thought you know thought that home web
based assessments would be the best way
or the way that would most favourably
influence their ability or their
willingness to participate in a clinical
trial so you give them variety of
different options about what you know
what things would be beneficial for you
what things would facilitate your
involvement in a study and the thing
that comes back to is that if you come
to my home or in some way you know
virtually or otherwise we'd be much more
willing to participate and that's in
Huntington's disease but this holds true
in Alzheimer's disease which is
obviously is a for many people much more
pressing need in terms of experimental
therapies and in this survey they asked
individuals you know what was your will
be your willingness to participate in
clinical trials if we did the
assessments in the home if we if there
would likely of getting placebo was last
and again the thing that comes back is
that if you can do assessments in my
home that is the one driving force that
is most likely to allow me to do that
but you know we talked about doing these
these assessments but there also you
know and when we think about that we're
often thinking about assessments to show
that a
treatment is potentially efficacious but
when we're doing a study and we don't
know a lot about the potential harms of
a treatment it's just as important that
we can identify potential harm early and
as quickly as possible and so we
recently completed a phase a to study of
as rata pain this is a available
medications a calcium channel blocker
medication used to treat blood pressure
pretension high blood pressure and for
that matter it tends to drop blood
pressure which is what it's supposed to
do but in Parkinson's disease that's a
potential problem individuals with
Parkinson's disease in general have low
blood pressure to begin with they have
just in a dysfunction and their ability
to regulate their blood pressure so they
Tennessee to drop their blood pressure
as they stand up we know that low blood
pressure is a risk factor for falling in
Parkinson's disease so all of these
things kind of came to a head with we
want to look at this treatment but we
know that we it's going to have an
impact on blood pressure and we need to
we need to monitor that closely and so
as I talked about alluded to earlier we
you know we actually ask people to keep
a written diary of that now they
collected their blood pressure the blood
pressure was stored on their blood
pressure cuff that was data was
ultimately uploaded intermittently but
physicians had to make decisions about
medication dosages based on the blood
pressure logs and it wasn't as easy to
access the blood pressure cuff so we
asked them to keep a written log so this
is a huge burden not only we asking they
take their blood pressure twice a day
rest in to record it in a log and the
thing is what if their blood pressure
was 40 over 20 you nobody knew about
that until two weeks later when they
came into the doctor's office unless
they were really having a lot of
symptoms associated with that and so you
know we thought in discussions with
sapir consulting and and marvel that
there might be a better way of trying to
do this of capturing blood pressure data
in an ongoing trial in that we could get
information in real time and individuals
would not be have the burden of having
to capture that data on their own so we
use this kind of in retrospect
cumbersome device where we had a plug
computer plugs into the wall the blood
pressure cuff here plugs into the plug
the computer the computer plugs into the
router
and this gets uploaded at the time it
was a Google Health database and then we
were able to pull that data off and we
we did get data and so we were like well
this actually is a potentially valuable
means for capturing this type of blood
pressure data and allows us to see it in
real time and you can envision that you
could have parameters set on this so
that if there was an issue with the
blood pressure somebody a medical
monitor or some sort could get notified
of this in real time that there was a
abnormal blood pressure and then some
some intervention can be done at the
time and not two weeks later when the
person comes in so we were kind of
excited about that unfortunately
two-thirds the patient's actually
couldn't do this and largely it was
around issues logistical issues they
thought they had done it they thought
they'd uploaded the data but we had no
data on them whatsoever and so
ultimately remote technologies that do
this type of monitoring they need to be
easy and intuitive they need to be low
burden I would eventually to be
automatic somebody needs to take their
blood pressure and that data needs to be
available to the clinician or the
medical monitor immediately and maybe
they need to be fun I don't know but
this is a an important issue in terms of
remote monitoring in clinical research
settings so ultimately you know in terms
of future directions I think this is
this is just a smattering of what we can
talk about but they're really there's a
really this is a wide-open area that
hasn't been broached by the clinical
trials or clinical research community
too much so certainly there are
technological issues that we can do that
we need to move into increasing
broadband access or increasing access to
cellular networks would be one means of
facilitating remote technology and
trials we need we need technologies that
are both intuitive and automatic for
individuals mobile technologies both for
care but also for assessing variety of
outcomes and clinical trials and then we
talked about the gaming of technologies
to make the assessments fun so that we
are getting as much data as possible
missing data is the bane of our
existence and if we can
maximize a missing minimize missing data
that would be ideal scientifically you
know the the scientific community is
still out on this issue whether or not
this is feasible and we need to
demonstrate the feasibility of doing
this we've demonstrated the feasibility
of doing this in clinical care settings
I think quite nicely as dr. Dorsey
talked about but we still need to show
that this can be done in a clinical
trial setting and that the data that we
capture is as good as the data that
we're currently capturing in person and
then ultimately if we can show that
treatments in experimental therapies
have an impact on our remote data
collection that speaks to the value of
this as well as well as the validity of
collecting data remotely ultimately we
need to go to show that data collected
remotely can show a clinically
meaningful benefit with an intervention
and then one other thing that's
interesting is that remote technologies
not only can be a wiens of assessing how
people are doing a means of assessing
safety outcomes but also could be a
mechanism for intervening in patients
and we talked about exercise programs we
know exercise is important in
parkinson's disease other technologies
that we can utilize to to facilitate
exercise programs exercise interventions
in parkinson's disease can we can we
utilize that data to evaluate what
aspects of the intervention are most
effective and then ultimately we need
external buy-in from not with a
scientific community but funding sources
and regulatory sources the big issue in
terms of clinical trials is going to be
this issue around whether or not the
data that we collect remotely is going
to be considered good enough for
ultimately for FDA approval of new
therapies in neurologic diseases that's
all I have thank you
all four minutes of it until we get
kicked out we'll try to record them as
we go through a question about the tool
used for four of the telepresence yeah I
noticed you're talking about the
hangouts as a as like a collaborative
group therapy kind of thing I'm
wondering if this tool that you were
using and it in the video it how it
differs is it something like like
keeping track of time or billing or or
scheduled calls or is there a particular
thing the video kind of things that
we're so the video copy after we use
this from a company it will we use to
one from polycom and then more recently
from a company called bedale VI dy 0 and
tip of compliant and secure it's more
user-friendly I think then we've
experienced with the polycom it takes a
patient about 10 to 15 minutes working
with the college undergrad to install a
program on their computer same software
can be used on mobile devices can be
used on iPads so it's a very easy to rip
pretty easy to use for individuals and
relatively inexpensive but you know we
you dr. ski talk about this more but we
you know we have experience in this
group visit model for parkinson's
disease and you can see where these
types of applications might be utilizing
that affair that that's what you're one
of the things were getting at my
question was was really sort of is there
like a quantitative thing like like
keeping track of billing of time for
billing or schedule calls or anything
like that or is it just you know it's
really a few comments no shoes hells
bells or whistles so are you know the
billing is a big barrier to providing
care via telemedicine and we can talk
about that at nauseam but right now
you're largely not reimbursed for
telemedicine care and so we've been
utilizing grants contracts etc to to
fund the efforts so far so we don't
which is in many respects nice we have
to worry about all the billing issues so
much
you know I mean but you could see how
that could facilitate billing compliance
there is a means often used in
parkinson's disease time-based billing
which is probably relevant in
parkinson's disease and this be a means
of tracking that certainly any other
questions we are going to spend some
time with the doctors after so you're
more than welcome to join us we're going
to sort of talk about the futures but
thank you for attending and thank you
doctor thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
