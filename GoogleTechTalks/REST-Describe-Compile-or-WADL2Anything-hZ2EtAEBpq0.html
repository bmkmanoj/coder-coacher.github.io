will see shortly what this is about so I
want to start with a short introduction
of myself I hold two masters degrees of
a German and French University I did
this project that I'm going to talk
about as my final year project at the
French university and I'm with Google
since 2005 as an intern as a temporary
contractor and my story is quite
european i started in Germany then I
moved over to France so I was a
temporary contractor with Google friend
finally it's did an internship in the
United State and this picture is from my
home office in Barcelona so I'm really
traveling all around in Europe and yeah
always with Google tools so today we
will have a look yet wrist addressed
api's we will talk about some cool thing
called battle and we will have a look at
the project see about input
implementation details I will give the
live demos this will be probably the
most interesting part part and at the
end we have some time for discussion and
questions all right so your engineers so
you basically probably know what rest is
just short repetition the main idea of
rest is to apply birds to mound and
semantics of the methods is really
important so if you get something you
just want to get something if you delete
something you want to delete something
so even if you're addressing the same
resources the resources here and the
verb is really important so rest is
something about semantics today race is
also used as a loose term for something
that is not so that is some very easy
implementation of something that in soap
would be way more complicated and this
guy right here fielding wouldn't like
this definition so much but anyway it's
used you know
in a two-way definition part so we don't
really care about what is really from an
academic point of view but just keep in
mind we want to apply burbs to nouns so
let's have a look at rest api is I've
taken a very simple one from our friends
from yahoo it's the so-called inbound
API and with this API you can just check
who is linking to your site so if you
want to know who is linking to digg com
you would send a request to this API the
address is Sergio a piss com site
Explorer service version one in link
data then you have two parameters app ID
and query and in the query you just have
the URL so WD com so that's basically
what it is the method is again because
we want to get some information we wanna
know who is linking to take calm so this
is really a very very basic API the
problem is this API doesn't have a
whistle because it's a REST API so
Whistler is in the soap soap world but
we're in the rest world so if there is
no whistle we need some way to document
this API and in the world of rest this
documentation is in textual form so this
is a screenshot of the of the document
from the official yahoo side so this is
the address for someone who is
interested in it and you can see that
there is a list of parameter parameters
we've seen the application ID and the
query ID and the query and there's some
other parameters and we can see that
parameters have types like string
integer whatever and some are required
some are optional summer whatever some
have limited iniyum set so that you have
any enumerations of something and we
have at the end a textual description of
what this parameter is intended for and
very important at the end we have a
sample request if it would simply click
this
where is Mama's if you would click this
URL we would see the real results of
this of this API call in a browser it
will basically just be an XML document
the problem with this textual
documentation is to a PC this is
completely useless because pcs can breed
in a in a human sense so they cannot
understand what's going on so this
sample request will be quite important
for what we'll see now so when there is
no way stool there is no wasteful to
Java everyone anyone who has been
dealing with so before probably knows
about whistle to Java it takes a whistle
file analyzes it analyzes it understands
it and then can compile generate the the
Java code and you can then compile the
Java code and use it in your programs
we're in rest so we don't have whistle
but some clever guy called mark a delay
that's his face who is a senior staff
engineering as yet senior staff engineer
with sun microsystems came up with a new
description language that he called web
wal wal stands for bad application
description language and so in
consequence my goals for this project
bar to write an editor for battle files
and to write some code compiler and this
would be something like vista do java in
the rest world so I call it battle to
anything because I wanted it to be more
general than just Java so we've talked
about the abbreviation but why would we
want to do it and we've talked about
code generation we could also imagine to
have just one file to document the whole
family of AP is so this would be
application modeling and we visually
visualization and it can also help us
understand our architecture of some API
construct
but yeah this has all been very abstract
now let's have a concrete look and what
a battle file would look like for the
Yahoo inbound link API that we have been
talking before so once again the idea we
have text for this textual description
and we want to make it in some computer
readable form and in the following we
will see how this works so the structure
of a battle document is very very simple
it all starts with an application main
element that has some namespaces and
stuff and then we have grammars we have
resources space and if you have a look
at the resources space you can see that
it's just searched at Yahoo app is calm
so if you remember the URL was just like
this and we have a sub structure of
resources we have a resource path with
site Explorer service version 1 in link
data and this is completely an hour
analog to the structure of the URL so
until now it's nothing really exciting
so now to the next section of the of the
XML document now we have a method which
has a name yet so this is what we have
seen before we want to get information
so in this case we have a method called
gap and then we have a request with
certain parameters and parameters have
names they have a type so you can see
it's accessed e string so nothing really
exciting here we have required is true
this means we need to include this
parameter for every request and then
below you can see we have the option to
add the possibility to add options so
you can make enumerations so this is
basically just the same as this textual
description put together in one set of
parameters in a request element so the
next section the next text section deals
with the
respond and you can see the
representation is an XML document you
can say that the interesting element is
a result element and then we have fault
statuses that this API can give back so
in case of when something goes wrong we
can have HTTP code four hundred 403 400f
503 so it's basically just what is
written here in textual form and that's
it so the problem is we don't have just
one family of AP is we have various ones
so let's have a look at different
request URLs for common rest api so you
probably know the delicious api which is
for bookmarking so if you have a look at
this one its post so you're posting
something post issue is usually
something where you update something you
change something and let me have the
address ipi delicious version 1 tags
rename and we have the two parameters if
we want to rename attack we want to know
which old tag we want to rename with
which new tag so it's very easy um we
have the Amazon the Amazon item search
the Amazon item sword is part of the
Amazon family of web services and this
API is a bit more complicated so we have
more parameters we want to get
information so we want to search for
items so we want to get information the
address is web services amazon.com onc a
whatever this stands for xml and then
you can see parameters service amber
edwards no probably not edwards amazon
whatever web service ec i don't know so
some parameter that selects the service
of the amazon web services then we have
an access key we have an operation that
we want to
execute so in this case it's item surge
we have keywords in this case I'm
searching for enterprise immigration
patterns for a book in the family of
books of Amazon and then finally we have
our picasa API so in this case I want to
get all my photo albums and no no I want
to get a certain photo of my photo
albums so the rest is yet and I'm
picasaweb google com data entry api user
and then comes a dynamic parameter user
ID so in this case this would be a
standard or thomas so my gmail address
we have an album ID then dynamic
parameter album ID so i would put
whatever google visit to month of you
photo ID this will probably be some
large string or whatever some ID value
would whatever this might be then i'm
going to get just the comments of this
start index from one to maximum results
10 so you've seen this is three
completely different URLs so the problem
is we need some way to find out what
service what yeah what what operation
video we're going to deal with so if you
have a look at the first one the
delicious API if you would want to
choose and I'm apero me an operation
name what would we choose probably it
would be something like tags rename so
you can see it's part of the basic URL
if you go to the Amazon item search if
you go back to the to the same to the
same position of the URL text rename in
this case it would be on comcast / XML
it doesn't make sense at all so the
operation in the Amazon search is a
parameter so it's coded into the into
the parameters what operations we want
to do and then finally we have the
picasa api and the problem is here we
have all these dynamic parameters that
will be in some way need to deal with so
three different API is
random examples and a completely
different way of modeling or rest
webservice so this is one of the main
problems it there's no common rest way
there's different ways so now we're
going to do the live demo this is
screenshot I hope it will work so let me
just quickly switch to the main
application so there is if you have
laptops you can check it out it's on my
public server well what's going on for
each time I click the laser pointer in
reload so you can see the URL it's Tommy
akhtar de /r as described ladies rest
described or HTML and if you have a look
at the application we have three
sections we have the route someone got a
pen or something I mean just quickly we
have three sections like the first one
is the request sample section then we
have progressed details and then we have
a still blank box of a rattle file thank
you so let's load some data into this
into this project I want to start with a
very very simple API and you probably
know what the BBC is to british
broadcasting corporation and they have
an API that has various methods and one
of them is you can retrieve all the
channels of the BBC network and you can
test it online so this is the official
documentation of the BBC API we have the
method BBC channel list we have various
arguments so in this case it's just
format so we can we can select a certain
format and here we have an example
response and with the to various
parameters and because it's a rest api
we can simply check it out in the
browser so if i click the method you can
see this is an api call in this case
it's in a browser so it's not really
useful but you could imagine
I could harvest this data with a program
and display the BBC channels whatever
and make some kind of electronic program
guide you could imagine whatever you
want so I want to start with this very
basic example and all you need to do is
copy the sample request and then move
over to rest describe paste it in an OST
on the left side we have the parameters
method BBC journalist and format in this
case it's TV anytime and now I want to
show you how my application takes this
information and generates a battle file
automatically just based on this quick
copy and pasted URL so first let's test
it if it's really the one we we have
done before so the result is the same
the result is the same as we have seen
before so the URL is ok so now i can
click the analyze your right button and
you can see it has generated a battle
file it's pretty hard to see so I have
implemented full screen view so now we
can see the document in full screen you
can see the same sections as before so
all right this time it doesn't reload so
we have the application main element we
have some namespaces then we have the
resources space and you can see this is
w w0 rd whatever CGI pearl api query dot
PL so if you go back to the to this tab
you can see that it's basically just
what we can see up here and we have two
parameters method and form
they appear here so we have the method
which is get and we have the request we
have parameter and parameter and we have
a method and we have a format as names
and then you can see a red ball and a
yellow ball so with this what this does
is it guesses the type of the data so in
this case the data were let's quickly
switch over to the to the other view so
in this case the method was BBC channel
dot list and the format was TV anytime
so the application has guessed that the
type of TV anytime might be accessed E
string with a supposed probability and
because of the dot it wasn't really sure
about the format of of the method name
so i can quickly change that and say
well this is a string as well now you
see it has become manual you guys have
changed it manually if you have a look
at the details we can say that well
because the method is really something
we need to include in every call we can
say that this one is required in the
format in this case is required as well
so we can set it to true if you have a
look at this document we cannot see
something but that we should see because
it's always eaten up in Firefox so I'm
opening this in internet explorer just
because I want to show you the
namespaces and for some reason Firefox
doesn't display the namespace so now you
can see TV a main and then you bury see
the namespace you are n TV a metadata
2005 and pick 7 something so the API
give suspect some names faces then we
need to
take into account and it's just not
displayed here in firefox I'm not really
sure why but it's a firefox thing anyway
you can see here we can add external
namespaces to make the response xml more
stable against what context is it is to
be seen in so i can manually add it but
this is not really what i won i have
coded an AJAX call that searches the
response xml and you can see the fault
namespace is metadata 2005 and then we
have other namespaces mpeg-7 and again
this metadata 2007 a tooth out 2005 and
if i might be with it i can simply add
it and now you see it has been added to
the section of the document so this is
the whole battle document it's pretty
ugly at this point because to every
resource you can add manually sub
resources it's not really important the
value file is not really what we won
what we want is code we want something
like battle to anything so in the next
part we want to generate code and I show
you how this works so you can see this
part of the program is called rest
described question
yeah this is a good point good question
um I'm I have some of some manual
generated battle files from my own pc
I'm not really hosting them officially
because I think it would require the API
operators to like officially say about
this is our value file I'm not really
sure how about hosting for from my
server a yahoo viable file i'm not sure
if i made this I have some on my private
pc so if you're interested in in it I
can forward you some of the examples
I've been playing with but you're right
and they're absolutely should be some
officially monitored or whatever mental
rape is a possibility of metal file so
that people could download the battle
files paste them into the application
and then generate code from it so we're
not really there yet this is I guess one
of the very very first applications that
really deals with battle mark kelly from
sun the founder of this project has has
a project called jurors say something so
there he also has battled generation but
he's just limited to java and did it
respond to the question all right so let
me quickly show you how code generation
works basically you just hit a button so
once again this is rest describe because
we have described a web service so now
when i hit this button you can see rest
compile up there in the left corner and
then you have various buttons where you
can click and then you get the generated
code so whatever you want you can click
and you get the automatically generated
PHP code the Ruby code
so if you scroll down you can see that
it's really roomy code that's being
generated we have Python so it's really
a convenient way once you have a viable
file to generate code from it we have
Java as well so you can compile it and
then run it and it will work we have C
sharp greyed out for the moment so this
is an a project to come to add seen
short because I don't really have the
c-sharp development environment so here
on this screen you can again review the
battle file how it looks like so for
this case it's really really easy and
then you can see the generated classes
and here we have BBC channel list in
this case it makes sense and the
application is detected that the the
parameter method contains the actual
method name so i can switch and say well
source for the class names do not use
the parameter use an endpoint and then
can select the naming depth and you see
query dot PL if you quickly both go back
to here it's the name of the last
resource so in this case it doesn't
really make sense at all but if you
remember
where was it oops yeah if we go back to
this slide in the Amazon egg and the
delicious API tags renames of this part
would actually make sense so you can see
that it is it is automatically detected
I can quickly show you does it that it
actually moves I take this one and paste
it into the application clothes back to
race to scribe and then I want to reset
everything so now I'm pasting in the
delicious API I click analyze then I get
the rabble file automatically generated
you can see it here so in this case the
type gas or spender we have two times
access to string access to string so in
this case it's exactly what we want then
we can click generate code and get the
code and now you can see ya it has used
the end point but the rename doesn't
really make sense let's quickly see
where we are so the last resource
resource here is rename and the
delicious idea is really designed in a
rest way so what we want is is tags
rename so we would want a naming depth
level of two so we can quickly change it
and say use naming depth level two and i
can see tags rename would actually make
sense for a class name of this method
this is the generated code i want to
quickly go back to rest described and up
in the menu there you have the option to
upload a value file for delicious i have
the complete delicious API as a battle
file so you have asked the question
before so this is a good example that is
already built in into the application as
a demo so you can see here it's quite
large because the API use is relatively
comply
and so this is just a demo and i can
paste it in it will take some time to
analyze it you can see the spinning Mac
wheel so the parser is really yeah hard
at work and oops did some reload because
I hit the hit the wrong laser pointer
button so let's give it a try again
thank you suggest for background
information this application is built
with GWT the google web toolkit so i'm
not really taking care of all these
three views all this is done for me by
the web toolkit so now if you have a
look at this battle document you can see
the bar is pretty long so i can scroll
down and see all the various methods so
have tags rename and a new tag delete
some tags so everything you can do with
delicious you can do with the delicious
api we don't really care about the
battle file all we want is the generated
code so we go there hit the generate
code button then have whatever the ruby
code for that for the API generated and
then you can see they're generated
classes we've seen before we need to
take a naming depth level of two to
actually make sense for the class names
so now you can see the various options
tags get tags rename bundles all bundles
said buns delete so you can see a whole
bunch of different classes and I could
copy it and run some ruby program or PHP
program or whatever and all I did was
paste in some battle file and some yeah
some battle magic and then I got the
source code okay happy with it let's
quick let's do a quick reset what you
have seen here is the BBC API and this
was just one function I have one more
built-in example that I want to show you
so you can have a uri badge analyze it
so if I hit this button you get a window
with a field where you can paste your
rise in so I have a demo with various
yahoo web services and you can see here
it's quite a whole bunch of them what we
have is new surge site Explorer
whatever a sign explorer ping service
video surge so basically everything that
Yahoo offers and please note this is
just URLs this is nothing complicated
all I did was go to yahoo whoops Yahoo
rest web services whatever this site is
called I that we are developer Network
here and then I went to the various IP
is in this case search and then you can
see audio search content search image
search whatever and all I did was copy
the sample request URLs and put them
into the application so all I did was
copy link location go there paste it
into the box and yeah I've just coded in
a demo way into this application so it's
nothing really magic and then we can
click the button it warns me that really
might take some time and I did some
profiling the problem is the GWT code
for trees is really really complex so my
analyzes goes quite quick the problem is
the tree takes really some time to
render so there we are have a look at
the full screen view
ninja
oh so I guess the question is if this
works for post as well yes it works how
do you how do you figure out what yeah
it's kind of faked we can quickly have a
look at the where is it here at the
delicious API so you can see the
delicious API is posed and then I've
basically just added it to the URL so
what you need to do is analyze the
request and then copy the post part and
then simply add it as if it would be a
get parameter for the moment it's you
but it's nothing really complicated you
could just analyze this the post and
post data and add it here at the end to
the URL goodness respond to the question
all right
oops yeah so this is some firefox bag
you can see fun scrollbars try it again
yeah this time it works so now if you
really would take the time to figure out
all the other request parameter analyzes
we could say in this case here we should
definitely choose string and then you
can see result integer so this was just
request analyzes and given on the given
the data we have this application just
yeah did some did some guessing what
might be the type we can have a look at
how it works later but it's not really
important what the type is in the end
everything is a string because
everything goes on the get URL so there
just needs to be some way to represent
it and for if we go to the generate code
field for PHP it doesn't really matter
what the type is for Ruby doesn't really
matter what type is Python neither the
only language that is a bit picky about
types is Java and would be C sharp but
even if it would be ugly we could
basically go for in for a string with
everything so if we just default to
string this is a safe choice so now
let's see so this isn't the generated
code for all the oldest methods here and
you can see because the API has version
1 in the URL we need to change the
naming depth to one hit the recompile
button and there we go we have new surge
in linked data page data ping update
notification video search whatever so
all the other yahoo ipas api is in a
very comfortable way as a method that
you can call and all i had to do was
copy and paste the sample request URL
into my application hit the compile
button and there you go so this is the
long source code and if you try it at
home you can actually just copy it come
pilot if it's necessary in Java or if
not in PHP just use it in Python just
use it it's really really
straightforward so this was the life
presentation of the application I will
jump back to powerpoint and and see how
all this stuff works internally this is
just a scheme scheme out how how it
works in the middle we have the
application and we have input and output
what we can what you can do is put in
some request sample as we did just this
very moment if you already have a value
file you can upload it we've seen it
with the delicious paddle i have
uploaded it and then use it into india
application and then we can go from here
to here from here to here or straight
through and have output either available
file or the source code so you can
imagine various use cases of this
application as I imagine you are mr.
yahoo and you want to provide a value
file for all your web services you
basically start with the sample requests
then here edit the battle file and do
some what parameter is required which is
not stuff like that and then put out an
output the battle file and then it could
provide to the yahoo users the
officially provided yahoo value files or
imagine you're just you you want to use
the yahoo api you start here you go
through here and you take the source
code you don't really care about the
intermediate data file you just won a
source code so it's really really
flexible from what you can do there's
one more feature that i want to show you
if you go back to rest described you can
save the rattle file so here it's just
copy and paste it's not nothing really
comfortable yet but this is all to come
and then you could convert the battle
file to Jason it's an ax call and then
you get a JSON file of the of the battle
bag
so you could really imagine some web
service so this is a manual program
program but you could imagine a web
service or you have to enter some bit
request URL and then you get back the
JSON file of the other battle
representation and then get back all the
source code as well as a zip file this
would be a very cool Hughes case of this
program let's go back to PowerPoint so I
want to explain to you how it works in
more detail so if you remember the
schema we've just seen now we're at this
point so we have a request sample and we
want to get it into the application so
this is a full through hierarchy of
regular expressions where the type
analyzes happens so it starts here it's
pretty small I have it in a bigger
version but yeah obviously here it
doesn't fit so I want to just quickly
explain to you how it works so you we
start with the value and the name and we
don't just have the value we have the
name as well I will explain to you why
so in the first box we have the value is
true false 10 yes or no so this would be
clear and any fires for a bullying
because we have something 1 or 0 is
usually usually a bullying right if you
have yes or no it's just a string repent
string representation of yes or no of
yeah of 20 fault and if you have to a
fault it's obvious it's just the same
but the problem is one or zero could be
a string as well AB could be an integer
as well so how do we determine whether
some parameter equals 1 is a string or
it's an integer so in this case we go
and to the parameter name so this is the
second input and in English most
bullying parameter names either starts
start with is enabled is active is what
ever or end with ed so it's it's a it's
a heuristic approach is enabled you see
it it's dense with Ed so in the case of
ending with ed ed or starting with is we
assume that one is a boolean value if
not we assume that one is an integer so
this is one of the very basic tricks
that the application uses if none of
this case is is true you just have a
look at the second one and the value is
composed by digits so it's truly an
integer if you have the values composed
by digits plus a period plus digit then
we have a real value so floating point
value if the value starts with HTTP
whatever may have a URL so we can say
this is X st and uri and you can see all
this is just regular expressions if this
case isn't true we just look at the next
box and at some point we will arrive at
the end and at the end we can basically
say well if it's nothing of all of the
different types it is just a string and
if there is no value at all we can tell
anything so we have not available the
problem is this doesn't really work well
with the GWT implementation of the
regular expressions because regular
expressions is different differently
implemented in Opera differently and
implemented in camino in whatever so it
works really really well in firefox it
works well in Opera I guess it has some
trouble in Safari so it's not really my
fault it's a fault of the various
browsers implementations of regular
expressions but you get the main idea by
simple regular expression analyzes I can
usually determine what the type of some
parameter is
yeah it has I'm not really sure how it
works but it has some conversions of
like trade this in the upper way through
this in the Safari way but this is not
code that I have made and I just know
that it doesn't work in some cases so i
probably should file some box to the g
GWT team but um yeah it didn't really
have the time yet to really make sure
that's not my fault but I'm pretty sure
that is that it isn't so this is type
analyzes let's see the next point so now
we're at this point so we have some
internal representation of the battle
file and the question is how do we get a
rattle file into source code and what
this does is it takes a real hecky
approach and by by using java properties
files the GWT the google web toolkit
offers some internationalization methods
that you can say well if you're in
english use a string in English if
you're in a German environment use a
German environment and I said to me well
in the end PHP is a language Java based
language whatever is the language so I'm
just abusing the Java properties
internationalization feature for
compliation so I have a whole set of
static Java properties files so this is
really a real simple example that you
can get the main idea so we have the the
Java properties file in this case public
class then we have some placeholder then
we have the static text and then in the
end from the left side we have the rest
request parameter name of whatever
method name in this case and then the
two of them get combined and then you
have at the end the final code and the
idea is this is for Java but the dynamic
parameter always is the same so you just
change the surrounding text and make PHP
class handles and whatever
you make python class headers and there
you go the in the entertainment dynamic
part can simply be treated like a
language would in the
internationalisation feature so this is
really something yeah it's a cool abused
of international internationalization
it's a fun feature and yeah it it's
always fun telling it because people
don't really think of well well this can
be done sweet so this is code generation
so internally what's going on so now
we're in the in the middle part so how
does it work you have seen before the
xml namespace analyzes so this is
something we can do just on a response
analyze this way let's quickly go back
just let you know what i'm talking about
letting close this one close this one
visit everything so remember we have the
BBC ipi and as an input we have the URL
and if I copy it there
we get the battle file and what I've
done before is all the discovery of
namespaces and grammars but to do this I
actually need to execute an API call
because I need to analyze the response i
want to analyze what fault may occur I
want to analyze what name spaces are in
there so what the program does is it
provokes fault by mistreating the API so
I'm sending requests that are involved
bye-bye intention just to see what
happens if the IP i sees traffic or sees
queries that it wasn't expecting so if I
hit this button in the backspace I send
an AJAX request and I see what problems
may occur in this case it hasn't found
any arrows but if you go back and select
what you've seen it has detected the
namespaces in response but this is
nothing really exciting because you
could just if you have a look back at
Internet Explorer you could just copy it
from the from the response the real cool
thing is to see how the API will react
on reacts on fault so let's have a look
at another one this is the new search
demo so you can search for news on yahoo
i hit the analyze button I got the
battle full screen and then I do all the
discovery and you can see provoked fault
he has provoked for 400 so let's quickly
check what actually this fall 400 is so
it's serg new search
arrows so you can see the new search
service returns the standard errors so
let's loop with the standard arrows are
400 bad request for n 3 forbidden you
don't have permission 503 service
unavailable so at least from the three
available fault I could now with my
fault provocation treat exactly one of
them so it's not that bad at all and you
can see bad request so what the
application does internally is it sends
requests that are invalid it sends
requests that have obligatory parameters
left out so it sends things and you
shouldn't send just to see how the API
react react in order to have a more
stable code in the end so if you have a
look at the generated code in this case
okay let's see generate code PHP 5 for
example and now it should be somewhere
here
yeah so here in this case we have case
200 so if the if the code is correct and
we should have somewhere oh I know what
the problem is I didn't didn't
regenerate the vital file I guess
ah
so we just hit a buck so anyway believe
me it has worked before so we now could
have exception handling in case of arrow
400 so it would be more stable in case
of something going wrong so this was
this was the the dynamic part of the
application so what it does is it
generates code that it shouldn't be
generating and then sends it to the API
the FK react in a way that the AK is
documented to rig and then you get
arrows bag and you can integrate them in
the value file so as a conclusion battle
is a not too bad choice for describing
web services the approach is taking
sample requests and then generating
value files and then generating code
works surprisingly well you've seen it's
very very basic what I've done I've just
copied sample requests and then gut code
generated the code quality is not too
bad it works it compiles it lets you
deal with the basic cases and if you
face it most web services really are
very basic most web services in this
case are just information retrieval ones
so it's really really easy to use them
so it shouldn't be hard to generate the
code and s turn out that actually is not
future prospect is yeah more languages
improve the code and more stable
exception handling fixed this bug that
just hit me have some report repository
of battle files so there's huge
potential for future development this is
a kind of twenty percent project of mine
and if some one of you is interested in
joining I would be more than happy to
share the code with you
alright so we're at the end of the talk
thanks for listening you can put
questions to me you can get answers and
you can post discussion thanks i am any
open questions if not you can just email
me or whatever
it would be feasible but at the moment
it's embedded in the GWT file so the GWT
generates a web application so this is a
graphical application what you want is
some command line tool right so you
could just yeah you could just take out
the code of the GWT project and then
just take all the other classes that are
relevant it showed me too easy but I'm
not a command line guy so I've made some
GUI application but I agree if if it is
ready to be used you know in a more
efficient way it should be something
that you deal with on the command line
but for this to work type estimation
should be more stable the languages
should be like more flexible exceptions
need to be handled in a more efficient
way so for the moment it's it's a web
application it's a prototype it's a
demonstration of what can be done but it
definitely should move to the command
line and thanks to GWT thanks to being
able to program an AJAX application in
Java it's not not a big deal to extract
the code and move it to the command line
any more question okay thank you very
much
