very excited to be here and it's great
to see so many people um so I guess as
Ibrahim said our format is sort of the
first part is I guess I think of it as
sort of a storytime
so there's been a lot in the news
especially in the last six months or so
as we've gone through the Higgs boson
discovery process and and that's
something that we were both at CERN for
I've been there for a couple years a
long time too long yeah and so I guess
our purpose to come talk to you today is
to speak a little bit informally with
you just but tell you about what it was
like to be there because it was actually
a really really interesting process to
go through a discovery like this maybe
teach you a little bit of science if we
can sneak it in between the edges and
then answer whichever questions you have
for us so that having been said if you
have questions as we go please feel free
to interrupt because every once in a
while we we we can slip into jargon and
it's best if if if you catch us when
we're doing that
so with that I'll begin so the place
that I want to start is in 1963 actually
which was when the Higgs boson was first
theorized by Peter Higgs and a handful
of other theorists who were just a
little bit less lucky and getting their
name tacked on to the boson and that and
that's really what it is but there was
this they were looking at what we call
this inner model of particle physics
which is a collection of theories that
describe all the particles that we know
about and the way that they interact
their masses their couplings with one
another things like this and one of the
things about the standard model that was
a major flaw in the model at the time
and this is what the Higgs boson solves
is that there's no mechanism in the
standard model for particle stop mass we
all know that particles have mass
moreover if they didn't then nothing
would work properly and so what Higgs
and his and his contemporaries were able
to do was to do a manipulation of the
equations basically a change of
variables that introduced a mass term to
the to the equations of the standard
model and therefore sort of endowed all
the particles with mass
um and the the term that allows you to
do this introduces what we call the
Higgs field which is a field sort of
like an electromagnetic field is one
type of field or an electric field is
another less known type of field in the
Higgs field permeates sort of all of
space-time and this particles travel
through it they interact with it and
that's how they pick up mass and so when
we have fields like this one of the
things that we know about them is that
they have to be conveyed by particles
and so the particle that's corresponding
to the Higgs field is the Higgs boson so
the Higgs boson is now on the scene in
1963 and the question is can we discover
it so when I say discover the Higgs
boson what I mean is a very specific
thing um which is that what we do is we
don't discover let's start with can you
can you pull up the side of sorry just
thanks sorry so um let me step back a
moment
so we're experiments with particle
particle physicists so what we do is we
try to create the particles that we're
looking for in high-energy particle
collisions that one thanks um that's
what we do is we have a particle
accelerator
it's 27 kilometers its runs along the
French Swiss border outside of Geneva
and we run we run protons through the
accelerator in two different directions
it's a ring and four points around the
periphery of the ring the protons will
actually collide with each other and we
create all kinds of new things that
we're trying to study so underground at
the different locations we then let me
draw a picture for you here in the
accelerated sort of going in a ring like
this we have four interaction points
around the detector where the beams come
into collision and then what we do is
we're part of a collaboration where we
build a detector basically around the
collision point so that we can detect
the particles that come out of the
collision this is a cylindrical detector
sort of encompasses the collision point
like this and we call it atlas
now we have some compatriots across the
ring on the other side which are our
competitors but in a friendly way called
CMS and they will figure prominently in
the story so just very briefly when
we're searching for a new particle what
we're actually looking for is not the
particle itself but for the particles
that it decays into so for something
like the Higgs boson it only lives for a
fraction of a second and that breaks
apart into other particles
sometimes those particles then break
apart into still more particles and so
what you need to do is you actually get
sprays of particles that come out from
the collision point and then you detect
them as they traverse your detector and
from that you kind of reverse engineer
the Higgs boson and so what you're
looking for is for excesses of events in
the specific decay branches and once you
see enough of them then you say okay it
looks like there's there's indications
in this particular decay channel that
there's a particle here and then once
you reach a certain statistical
confidence in that statement you can say
we've discovered any particle could you
pull up the branch attractions do we add
up just a moment ago thank you so there
are three decay modes of the Higgs that
are really important for this talk today
so what this is showing is basically the
different ways that the Higgs boson can
decay and I'll just point out a couple a
couple of these to you that are the most
important it can decay in any one of
these different channels but for our
story today the most important ones are
w w this green line Z Z and gamma gamma
this purple one down here so let me
point out a couple things to you there
that are important about these and this
is the reason why it was it was these
are the reasons why these are so
important so Z Z start with Z Z as it
happens the Higgs is that 125 so is easy
you have a pretty good branching
fraction and maybe 30% Z Z is really
nice because it's a very clean channel
you can detect all of the decay products
that are coming out of the Higgs
collision and it's a very low background
Channel so this is a channel where you
can actually make a discovery with
dozens of events which is really nice
um gamma-gamma is also very clean we can
pick up both gamma rays in our detector
so that's really nice and we can
completely reconstruct the Higgs a
little bit higher background but still
relatively low background compared to
some of the other ones
the problem with gamma gamma is look how
low the branching fraction is only one
out of a thousand Higgs bosons decays to
gamma gamma and when you're only
producing something like a few Higgs
bosons every hour this might not be all
that many events you have to collect
lots and lots of data to be able to see
enough of them and then W W is a really
nice channel because it has this nice
high branching fraction even to 100%
depending on what the mass of the Higgs
is but the thing about WWE that when the
W's decay in our detector one of the
particles that they decay to is a
neutrino which is basically impossible
for us to detect I mean you need
specialized detectors to to see them and
so what this means is that you can't
completely reconstruct the W because
you're missing one of the particles that
you would need to reconstruct it and so
you get kind of fuzzy blobs where you
had w's and then when you take your W to
your w's add them together try to get
Higgs you get kind of a fuzzy blob but
these are the three channels that we
have to work with to make a discovery so
now I'm going to fast-forward to 2011 so
The Hague the yes yes so these are the
particles that the Higgs is decaying to
so gamma gamma to photons and w w and z
z are just different kinds of particles
they can decay to and so the right so
then let's fast forward to 2011 so at
this point the LHC has been on for a
couple of years and the LHC sort of the
there's a two-fold purpose to it I would
say it's a first-order the first is to
look for any kind of physics beyond the
standard model and second and maybe or
maybe even first depending on how you
want to order these things is to find
the Higgs boson so that the the real
focus of the the collaboration at this
point is to find the Higgs boson there
are hundreds of people who are working
on the different decay channels looking
for excesses in each of their channels
and in 2011 I had just been at CERN for
a couple weeks and it was a very
interesting we
it was Easter weekend actually and so it
was the Thursday before Easter weekend
and so everyone's kind of they're
starting to go home people are ready to
have a four-day weekend and there's an
email that goes out but there's a group
there's a small group of people three or
four people who've been analyzing some
data independently on their own not part
of one of the the major efforts but sort
of as a project that they're doing
independently and they see in excess in
one of the channels so this is big news
and so what's going on here is is a
little bit of skiing off-piste I think
they weren't doing anything that was
inappropriate but at the same time
they're not now all of a sudden the
collaboration is really focused on
what's going on in this channel and
might this be actually a discovery one
of the things that was really intriguing
about it also was that the mass point
that they happened to be seeing an
excess at was a place where they had
been a little bit of an interesting
excess on a previous experiment before
that experiment was closed down so maybe
this is corroborating proof of something
that we already had a hint at before and
then something something very dramatic
happened which was this internal
document telling about this this hint
that they had seen was posted to a blog
and we still don't know who did it but
this was actually a big problem because
it puts a lot of a put it puts a lot of
pressure on us to then very quickly
figure out what's going on and not
working or very our usual comfort zone
which is very slow and deliberate and so
as it turns out this was a false alarm
it took a couple weeks of truly working
around the clock to figure this out but
we learned something very important from
this experience which was that we had to
be very careful about what we said
because as soon as anyone said Higgs in
public a lot of eyes all of a sudden
came on to CERN and so we wanted to be
very sure that we knew what to say when
they started asking us questions so so
we continue to run the detector we
continue to collect more data and in
general the more data that you have the
more confidence you can have when in
detecting a particle and then I there
was there's a round of conferences they
come around in the winter before those
conferences we wanted to have sort of a
status update on the Higgs
and so this was too early for us to say
that that we thought that there was
anything there wasn't enough data that
we would be able to say anything
definitive anyway but just to give a
status update and there was a little
nudge in the most interesting channels
at 125 or so TV so that's right it at
this point here now just stop for a
second to point something out to you
your says that 125 is actually really
nice because if you take it you draw a
vertical line at 125 you hit all of
these lines right so you have all of the
the decay channels that can come into
play here whereas if you're down here or
here up here then there's a lot less
flexibility that you have for looking
for it in different decay channels but
since we're looking now at 125
gamma-gamma we have WWE of ZZ so all of
the major players are now in the game so
but there wasn't enough data that we
could say with great confidence that we
thought there was something there we
said it was something like a one in a
hundred chance that it would be that
what we were seeing was due to a
statistical fluctuation of the data
which is simply not enough for us to say
anything the thing that was really
interesting for me personally I remember
at the time was that CMS which were our
sort of our our doppelganger on the
other side of the of the collider they
saw peaks in the same channels at the
same mass so it's not just us if it were
just us I think people would have been
much less excited but the fact that CMS
was seeing something too was pointing
towards something that there might be
something physical that's actually going
on the detectors here so so now I'll
fast forward a little bit further about
six months to June of 2012 so we're
working our way up to the yes
the stop everything is basically as
independent as can be so let me continue
to tell my story and then ask you a
question again if I haven't answered it
because one of the things that's really
important is sort of the interplay
between the two experiments during
during the discovery process so in June
of 2012 there was a conference that was
coming up in mid-july and everyone knew
that there was going to be a Higgs
update that is given by one by Atlas and
one by CMS so at this point we should
have enough data to be able to say
something fairly conclusive and the
magic number that we need to be working
toward is five Sigma significance this
is five so if we can reach this number
then we can say that we have a discovery
and this number is the number that
corresponds to basically there's one and
a three and a half million chance that
what we're seeing is due to a
statistical fluctuation so it's a pretty
high degree of certainty and the reason
we want to do that is like I said
because you don't want to have a false
alarm and because there are three
Sigma's and four Sigma's that have come
and gone
so five Sigma seems to be safe and this
five Sigma corresponds to the
combination of all the decay channels
together so maybe you see three Sigma in
Z Z that's not enough but if you see
three sigma and gamma gamma also then
you can put those two together
statistically and you can say
potentially depending on how the
channels are correlated that you have
five Sigma overall so five Sigma is the
magic number and we were at something
like 2 to 2.5 I think in December and so
so I was this at a summer conference in
in France with a bunch of my friends and
some of them are on CMS some of us are
on Atlas and this is this is one place
where this is this is this is something
we shouldn't have done but we were
excited enough that we did it anyway um
which was that I as an Atlas member saw
some of the CMS data so what CMS had
been doing and this is what Atlas does
too is they blind their data so they
specifically look they specifically set
aside the data where they think the
signal might be hiding and they look in
sidebands or control regions to optimize
the entire analysis and only once that's
complete
they unblind in front of the wood for
the particle I'm the reason that we do
that is because we don't want to bias
ourselves and accidentally get excited
by something that we see in the data and
then amplify it and and sort of bias our
so that way and so CMS was unblinding
and so there was this big hall which had
300 people on the line and we were all
dialed in and we were huddled around an
iPhone looking to see what the CMS
results were and the CMS results looked
really really good it was really really
exciting and so so we knew that if CMS
was seeing something that was this good
then Atlas should be too and sure enough
the next week Atlas and blinded their
gamma gamma and it looked really good it
was something like three and a half
Sigma and then analogously in Z Z now Z
Z is starting to come online a couple
weeks later and Z Z now see something
like two and a half Sigma so at this
point and this is the last that I heard
of the CMS results until the fourth of
July so there is some bleeding in
between the two of them but we try very
hard especially at this point it's a
partition the two collaborations so that
the excitement of one doesn't sort of
amplify the efforts of the other so so
so now the race is on to try to get the
results for the conference in this
summer so we have a hard deadline that's
in the middle of July
and there's a lot of excitement within
CERN about what the two collaborations
were seeing and there were you know
rumors that were flying back and forth a
little bit and so the director general
of CERN then called a meeting in late
June between the spokesperson of Atlas
the spokesperson of CMS and the director
general of CERN in which the
spokesperson sort of tipped their hands
to one another and this was by agreement
and and to the Director General and said
this is what we see so far and and at
this point the director general of CERN
says this looks this looks like it will
probably be good enough that I think we
want to have an announcement that's
coming out of CERN rather than having
the announcement that's coming out of
this conference which last year happened
to be in Australia because we kind of
feel a little bit of possession I guess
of this discovery and we want it to be
ours to give to the world as sort of
from our own home
so this was taken as a very good sign
that all of a sudden there's now a
special seminar that's been planned at
CERN for the 4th of July and this
at this point is several weeks in the
future um and so the question is what
are you going to be able to get done
before the fourth of July so at this
point we have we have that's the
accelerator as it happens is running
really really well and we're getting
lots and lots of data every day and we
need every bit of data that we have to
be able to get enough confidence in
these channels that maybe we can combine
them and get the magic number we can get
the five Sigma and usually as the data
comes in we have to do a round of
processing on it basically in
calibrations and make sure that there
was nothing wrong with the detector
conditions when it was taken and there's
this whole rigmarole that the data gets
put through and it usually takes
something like a couple months and so at
this point there's this massive
mobilization at CERN to bring dozens and
dozens of people online from whatever
they're working on to start working on
the data processing so that we can get
the data out in a matter of days and
weeks instead of in weeks or months and
it was really magnificent to see this
big effort kind of come out of certain
because we had to we had to get all this
data just through as fast as we could
and they did it they added it in really
really it was it was magnificent to see
how fast they were adding in the data
they were taking it taking it one week
and it was in a plot the next week and
that's absolutely unheard of so so we're
getting more and more data every day the
numbers are being updated more and more
and more every day the reason I say this
is because I wish I could tell you exact
numbers and like bring you through the
the progression in numbers as we were
watching the significance of these
channels grow but it was it was hard to
keep track honestly at this point every
day there's a new number coming in
depending on which channel it is which
data set they're using everything is
looking really good and so there's
there's one channel that I haven't
mentioned in a little while and it's
doubleyou doubleyou doubleyou doubleyou
is also in play but WW had yet to
unblind
because they had been a little bit
behind the curve because they hadn't
gotten some datasets as soon as they
needed them and so it was only five or
six days before the July 4th
announcement that we know it's coming
and so the question is what to do with W
W so the decision was made that they
would they would talk about unblinding w
w try to decide whether they
we're ready to look at the data yet in
the similar region but before they did
the the unblinding deliberation they had
to decide whether they were going to
include WW in the combination so is this
channel regardless of what we do and and
we know personally amongst ourselves is
this something that we're going to be
ready to tell the world about on the 4th
of July and the decision was that it
should not be included in the in the
final calibration because they're simply
not enough time to do all the checks
that you would want to do in those four
or five days before the before the
seminar and you have to be extremely
careful here because this is this is
where some of those lessons that we
learned the first time around come into
play that if you if you you you get too
aggressive with WW and you include it
because it looks really you you unblind
it you say oh this looks really good
let's include it but you haven't done
all your checks maybe there's a problem
you've accidentally just discovered a
particle that isn't really there
likewise let's say you unblind it and
there's an there's a different kind of
problem and WW actually sees less than
they should well then let's say you're
at five sigma before and now you add in
w w you've taken yourself down to four
point five so you just undiscovered a
particle you really want to know what's
going on with W W and and and the
decision was we just were not confident
that we can do all those checks we need
to do
so W W this is now the Wednesday before
this is six days before the announcement
they make the decision to unblind w w
but it's going to stay within the
collaboration and it's not going to be
included on the fourth of July so this
is where the story diverges a little bit
in an interesting way because now there
are two different there are two
different things that are that we need
to keep track of one is what's going to
be included on the fourth of July what
we're going to be able to tell everyone
whether we can say you know the the
Higgs boson has been discovered and then
the other one is sort of what we
privately know as as collaborators and
as people who are privy to this
information whether we know that the
Higgs boson has been discovered so let's
say that we we only have four point two
sigma on the 4th of july but we know
that WWE waiting in the wings and W W
has three sigma and that's going to push
it over the threshold so at that point
we can't say we've discovered the Higgs
boson but like let's be honest we're
gonna know for ourselves discover the
Higgs boson so
this is this Wednesday afternoon was
really really exciting actually when
they they unblinded WWE and so that
afternoon you're just kind of sitting
that you're like pretty sure they're
discovering a new particle right now
that's that's really neat and so the
next day the the unblinding and finish
running there was a an official talk to
be given off Friday so this is four days
before the before the announcement but
the rumor started to go around and and
so they they said that they had they had
unblinded and it looked really good
expressing Oh like we're gonna put it in
should put it in and at the same time so
so regardless of what we can say on the
next week like we found it like this is
it so now the issue is what are we gonna
be able to say next week and so what
what what's happening now is that you
need to look at you need to look at the
updates to the gamma-gamma you need to
look at the ZZ you have a little bit of
information from last year's analyses
that you can mix in but like gamma gamma
and ZZ or the powerhouse channel so it's
just an issue of like putting those
together and seeing if you have the
magic number and um so I have a
particularly well-connected friend at
CERN or maybe she was just in the right
meeting I don't know so we were eating
lunch with her on Thursday and and we
were all gossiping about this because of
course that's I mean because of course
we're and so one of my friends kind of
leans in he's very we're speaking very
quietly because it's a cafeteria that's
50% Allison 50% CMS and and you know if
you want to learn secrets at CERN like
just go sit in the cafeteria and listen
for somebody who's too too noisy and and
so one of my friends she said they've
done the global combination like they
know what the number is for next week
they're gonna have it in a meeting
tomorrow about you know you know the
right people you can you can find out
today and so so one of my friends kind
of leans and he's like how many Sigma do
they have and she goes and kind of
catches herself but it's do the so at
this point this point this point you
know it's in the bag right we know it
for ourselves because we have the WW
like if the dough
W been mixed in at that point it's like
I don't even know 6.5 Sigma or something
we're fine but not only that but we get
to tell everyone so so this is this is
perfect at the same time the question is
what does CMS have because I'm pretty
sure that there's no Hague's boson at
this point the question is just and and
if there's a Higgs boson if we can see
it they can see it and so the now the
the competition comes into it back again
a little bit because okay so we have
five something month but but what do
they have did they have six a right I
hope they don't have six sigma because I
wanted to find it um so so even though
we sort of had all the physics cards on
the table there was still this even even
up until the morning of July the fourth
there's there's still reason to go to
the seminar because you only have half
the story you want to see what the other
guy has so so you go to the talk the
next day and WW looks pretty good but
they're not gonna be including it they
need to run some more checks and it's
going to be out in a couple of weeks
they do the the global fit and it's five
point five point one Sigma thinks
something like that and and we all go
home and we have like a quiet weekend
and but it's it's it's a really cool
time right because you know like you
know that it's going to be a big deal in
like three days and there's there's five
thousand people in the world who know
this and you're one of them so great so
so the word the word had sort of started
sneaking out at this point there were
people there you know Peter Higgs had
been had been called a few weeks before
and they said you probably shouldn't
plan any vacation for early July we
might need you to come we need you to
come as a sir
so so now fee but we're seeing Peter
CERN and that there are Peter Peter
Higgs in the CERN cafeteria and then
this is this is a very promising sign
and so there's this announcement it's
going to be made on on the 4th of July
and everybody wants to see in the
seminar room in the seminar room cause I
don't know it's reasonably but it's not
huge it's 500 people maybe 300 people
and half of those seats are going to go
to people who funded the experiment and
the higher-ups on the on the on the
collaborations as they should but
there's you know a fraction of this this
small space is gonna be reserved for the
remarks like us
um and we had we had learned our lesson
from the December talk because the
December talks the seats were hard to
come by and we showed out four hours
early for that
yeah when you start bringing up pictures
we have a bunch of pictures yes and I
were both at this table so there's
sitting there on the floor for hours I'm
sure um and we just slept there the
night before honestly they lost it they
locked the doors at seminar room because
they knew that people like us were gonna
do this and so we all lined up in the
hallways and we watched we watched The
Lion King and we tried to sleep and got
very excited and read internal notes
because we wanted to look at all the
plots against rescue that was at 5:00
a.m. where people came in thinking they
were early enough to get into the
auditory yeah I don't know what they
were thinking I don't know what they
were thinking I think the latest you
could get there if they get a see it was
4:30 maybe um
and so then the seminar starts and and
we're all trying to stay awake actually
because we've been up all night and and
the CMS talk goes first and it's the CMS
talk actually was really interesting
because CMS had done slightly better
than Atlas in the respect that they had
more data in more channels that was
ready so like their ww-with more updated
and arts for example and CMS they they
got up to if they did the the global
combination with all of all of their
channels - one I think they got to five
point one Sigma and then they had a
little bit of a downer fluctuation in
this last channel and it bumps in down
to four point nine and it was just like
oh but I mean for four point nine I mean
come on you discovered a particle um but
I thought that was I thought that was
interesting just because this is a case
of where you know you can get a little
bit unlucky and you know like I said
four point nine you're fine but but they
did happen to get a little bit unlucky
there and and then Atlas does the second
presentation which of course is less of
a surprise because we've we've seen all
the slides already and but where as it
happens able to say the magic words of
five stigma and of course if you were to
put Atlas at CM
together I mean you'd be it I don't even
know like eight Sigma or something like
there's no doubt at this point Atlas was
just a little bit lucky and that we got
like I said say the magic words um and
it was very exciting because I think the
especially being able like crossing that
five Sigma threshold was really
meaningful I think and there was there's
a big round of applause especially for
Atlas that I remember I think CMS
definitely got one too but I
particularly remember the Atlas one cuz
it went on forever like just for like
four minutes of just like this is
starting to get ridiculous guys um and
and so the end there were there was it
was it was all very nice with
congratulations from all over the world
and mr. Higgs was there and you know may
or may not have wiped a tear from his
eye at the moment that they flashed up
the slide and and and it was it was
really great so it so in the afternoon
we're all kind of exhausted and some of
us went home for naps the the ones who
had a little bit more stamina stick
around for the free champagne and and
then and and then there's there's a
series more of additional studies that
we we had to do at this point I mean the
big discoveries made this is sort of the
exciting part is now coming to an end a
little bit but one thing that I want to
spend just a moment talking about now
and sort of gesture towards the future
is like okay so we found a particle now
what in the first series of questions
that had to be answered was is that the
Higgs boson because it looks like a
Higgs boson and it seems about right but
you need to do something like you need
to do things like measure all of these
branching fractions you need to do
things like measure the spin of the
particle which is just one of its
quantum mechanical properties but if it
has their own spin it's not a Higgs
boson it's something else and it's maybe
even more interesting so there were a
series of studies that then had to be it
had to be done so we we certainly
partied on the 4th of July but we were
back at work on the 5th of July trying
to figure this stuff out and they
finally wrapped up those studies at
least the first round of them enough
that a couple weeks ago at the Memorial
and conferences which is another set of
conferences that they have in in March
they're able to say definitively this is
a Higgs boson so now so now we can say
things like we found the Higgs but
there's still a lot more that that
they're trying to find so I think
they'll take the last few minutes here
just to gesture towards what we're
looking at in the future as far as
things like the Higgs is concerned and
that is something like looking for
additional Higgs bosons and the reason
that I bring this up in particular is
because it's something that I work on
this is my thesis topic is looking for
under certain classes of theories that
go beyond the standard model so these
are the kinds of theories that were most
interested in investigating there's not
just one kegs boson but there's five and
so it's my job to find the second one
and so there's a number of different
efforts on these sorts of fronts but now
we have this great new toy that we can
play with and try to crack open the
standard model a little bit more and so
that's that's just one gesture towards
some of the additional things of what we
doing at CERN so technologically I just
very briefly I'll bring onions to say a
couple things about yeah just just a
couple minutes and then I think we're
ready for questions just a minute
so the CERN right now is it a little bit
of a it's at an interesting point we've
stopped taking data the whole goal was
to find the Higgs boson and run one and
we've done that and now what we're doing
is upgrading and repairing parts of the
accelerator and upgrading and repairing
parts of the detector so there actually
won't be a whole lot of new data being
taken at CERN for the next two years but
the visit the data analysis of the data
that we've already collected we continue
for the next two years and so hopefully
there will be a couple more surprises to
find in there this is something that
yen's is particularly involved in since
you want to say a couple words about
what they're doing really want to say
much I mostly came here to show pictures
so what
katie has not shown you is pictures and
I encourage everyone because you're in
Zurich in particular the people in the
room are in Zurich get over there and
get downstairs we have a shutdown out
for two years the caverns are open so if
your interest that you can just sign up
for a visit at CERN and go about 100
meters on the ground and see the
experiments there's you should look at
CERN dot CH and then you'll probably
find something like visits or how to get
to talk to yeah say yeah yeah well you
can come as a group for for typical
underground visits we're limited to 12
persons per visit which is about 45
minutes so if you're coming in with 500
people then better for a long week yes
of course how do you get underground
question here in the room was how to
visit and how to get on the ground okay
yeah but there's there's ways through
the certain visit service that they can
do these arrangements yeah do to give an
outline we have about 80 thousand
visitors per year and that's only the
number that we know of we like people
like Katy and I we typically get our
family there or friends there or
whatever and we guide them around and
that's not included in the official
numbers so we're talking about a little
more than a hundred thousand visitors
per year that does not include certain
open dates which will happen for example
in September I think this year which is
where we have two days on a weekend
which are open one for the families and
friends of certain people and one for
the general public which has another
80,000 visitors in two days so that's
roughly what we're talking about but you
get to see at CERN is things like this
and I cannot really point at it but
maybe here okay so what you get to see
on the ground is pretty large structures
the photos that I took here are
partially from 2007 2008 when the cavern
was still empty which you see here
because big structures are missing gap
here there's a large gap what we do is
we build really large detectors on the
ground and they fill the caverns
in case of Atlas we build it underground
that means we're bringing parts down and
building like a ship in a bottle
basically where as CMS builds everything
upstairs and then brings it down in nine
slot it down in nine slices the central
slice being about 3,000 tons and being
lowered 100 metres they rented a
shipyard crane for this the biggest
structures at Atlas head you're gonna
see in one of those pictures is 280 ton
magnets which are 11 meters in diameter
for the hall above the surface is
roughly 11 meters high and the cranes
inside the hall so if you want to attach
the crane to the structure you have to
lower the structure halfway into the
hole and then attach the crane that was
funny moments back in 2007 as you might
realize Katie does 8ax analysis while I
do hardware so I typically have good
photographs she has better plots we're
gonna get to some plots too because we
have some some that might explain how
this coveri works this is the structure
I was talking about that's an 11 meter
diameter magnet so the thing that looks
metallic in the center is supported by
this orange dark orange structure it can
slide into the detector so you can you
can actually move this it has automatic
feet where we put in pressure and then
it's supported like a hovercraft and can
slide in it's not as simple to move but
kind of the structure that you see a
side of it which looks like a large
piece of cake is a 22 meter neon chamber
in diameter which can also slide over it
suspended on Rails on at the top of the
cavern and it can slide over to seal off
the detector this is Katie and another
colleague from from Great Britain
standing on a platform inside the
detector to give you an impression we
have 11 stories on the sea side of our
detector there's a CN and a side the a
side has 12 stories inside the cavern
you get to climb up four floors to be
where we were standing at that time
through detector material so you you're
climbing between active detectors and in
this particular case you're standing
next to a 1000 ton calorimeter that's
filled with liquid argon gas we have
about 90,000 a 4 liters of liquid
nitrogen 40,000 liters of liquid argon
in this cavern and it's a very
particular feeling if you're I think
Katie enjoyed the day very much I did
it's like it's like a big like
radioactive detector treehouse it's
really great the first time I was there
was in summer 2006 I keep getting back
there whenever I can because it's the
greatest place on earth this is when we
transported the part that I worked on at
the time this was lowering a four
kilogram detector itself with lots of
support structure which had to be
inserted as a very lost component into
the center of the detector the
transportation effort alone was
complicated as such because we couldn't
we couldn't crash it anywhere we
couldn't just roll it over to the cavern
and then attach it to the crane because
it had to be suspended such as that it
wouldn't suffer from shocks during the
transport so we couldn't just roll it
over it was craned over from one hall
into the other also we had only a half
an hour window where the weather
forecast was good enough to get it over
without it being drowned in rain just
for a sense of scale let me just jump in
here for a second because I just learned
this recently and I think it's really
cool so you have a sense now that the
detector it's the size of a large
building but the alignment of the
components within the detector is known
to the width of a few human hairs so
that's it's very large but it's very
precisely aligned and so if you have
something like you roll over a pebble
wrong then it can mess up that alignment
that's why we have to be so careful in
the installation should probably take
questions in a fuse make sure we're
almost there okay so this is where it
arrived but I mean we're done okay okay
we spoke a little bit so we do to
actually have a few results because
typically focus on get
data analyzing and getting papers out
making this easy to understand for
general public is a tough job and takes
a lot of time that we need to like make
time for that like that that's our
weekends so I suppose that someone
messed up this weekend when generated
yeah I made it gifts like this right so
this is I'll bully can just let this
play in the background but let me just
introduce you to it before I think a
couple but so this is the Z Z and so on
the what you're looking for words you're
looking for an excessive events it's not
explained by basically these colored
structures so the colored structure is
the backgrounds Monte Carlos this is our
model of what a backgrounds will look
like in this channel on this axis here
is the reconstructed mass of the Higgs
so if you start to see a bump then
that's the mass of the particle that
you're looking for and so what this is
doing is this scrolling through time
it's adding more and more data to the
histogram and so you can start to see
that there's if you can reset it that
there will be a peak that'll start to
emerge right here that isn't apparent
from sort of the the red background and
so once you start to see a peak that
isn't explained by any of the
backgrounds and that's what has to be a
signal so this is actually watching
where the points here are the data
actually watching the the Higgs peak
grow in real time and then at some point
it'll zoom in on this exact excess and
then fill in the Higgs underneath it
with the sort of the signal Monte Carlo
say like this is that's what it would
look like okay I think with that we've
we've over spoken by probably 10 minutes
or so but 15 minutes for questions as
many questions as you as you can ask
yeah but thank you very much for your
attention it's been a lot of fun we hope
you've learned something
this topic or anything else really we're
young we answer questions the they were
understanding the oh sorry the question
was what did the Australian conference
think about the there there Thunder
being slightly stolen I think they
understood they they could see that it
was maybe gonna come I can't imagine
they were that happy because you know
it'd be great if you can be the first
thing makes the the announcement but but
we did have a direct line to Melbourne
for the seminar and so a lot of our
colleagues were in Australia at that
point for the for the conference which
was starting the next day and so they
called in and they congratulated us very
nicely so I mean and the people who were
organizing the conference were the
people who were a subset of people who
made the discovery so it was a very
collegial feeling how big is the next
accelerator I yeah so question was size
of the next machine that we're building
we are not we are not building the next
machine yet we're thinking about
building next machines and well
upgrading the machine that we currently
have which you see on this picture in
white
that's the LHC that's nine kilometers in
diameter 27 kilometers in circumference
we're thinking about upgrading that
sometime in 2020 to maybe up running up
to 2030 that's gonna deliver a lot of
data to exclude a lot of things where or
discover a lot of things well we're
mostly excluding we have many more ideas
than we have actual particles very
exclusive yeah but then the thing is we
need a precision machine so what the LHC
is is
thing that collides protons protons are
particle combinations of multiple quartz
and so we never know how much energy we
actually get in a collision
because what's colliding is not the
proton of the quarks so depending on how
much fraction of momentum of the total
proton one of the quarks has as they
collide you get more or less boost in
one direction what we used to have in
the past and what we should have again
in the far away future kind of on on my
lifetime span measured or hers is an
electron positron Collider because those
are fundamental particles they are not
made up of other structures as far as we
know so what we got in the large
electron positron Collider previously
was collisions where we could adjust the
energy of the incident particles and
thereby create a collision at a fixed
energy we would never get something else
but the energy that we put in because as
the two particles collide they disappear
completely so all of their momentum goes
into the collision and using those
machines you can much more precisely
measure the outcome the energy we need
to properly measure Higgs bosons you can
roughly grasp from the scales that are
shown in this picture is 500 GeV center
of mass is nice that is because we can
most probably create Higgs bosons only
in associations with Z bosons and that
means we need to get up to an energy of
240 GB instead of 125 - to create both
particles and make them detectable and
then the other thing we want to do is
produce some very heavy quarks in pairs
and measure them precisely so producing
top quarks in pairs requires some 340
350 GB of center of mass energy so
that's the rough scale we want to go to
and then you want to be able to go
slightly beyond just to like measure the
full spectrum and not just end exactly
where you want to measure there are also
plans for building something like a
compact linear collider and not just the
standard international linear collider
the standard concept is the one shown in
yellow that's like 30 kilometers long in
a straight line
the other concept is the compact linear
collider that's in light blue that's 42
kilometers it's only compact because it
has a lot more energy in the same length
right I should say very quickly too one
of the things that's tricky about
electrons and positrons they give you
very nice clean collisions and they're
very tunable the thing is is when you
try to run them in circles they radiate
away their energy and if you were to put
electrons into the LHC they would
radiate away as much energy in a turn as
you could put back in through the
accelerator so the way that we avoid
this problem is by not turning them so
that's why you want to build a linear
collider but that's technically more
difficult so that's what motivates the
the geometry their linear collider
geometry is is the problem as you see
from the size of the structures it's
kind of hard to find a place where you
can actually drill a tunnel that's this
long you want to typically build a
tunnel and such that it's easier to
control access such that you don't have
radiation at our ends that comes out and
like disturbs people which it does yeah
so that's that's why we generally put
structures on the ground
Japan is thinking about hooking into
that that's the time scale for this is
roughly 2030 and then there's other
ideas around we're not very fond of just
having one idea so this here I assumed
out is ideas for an 80 kilometer storage
ring that would actually be in the
Geneva region and either it would pass
as seen on the left underneath the lake
of Geneva and beyond the next mountain
range that we can see from the CERN
cafeteria or it would pass into the
Juara both of which will be complicated
because here you're going through
multiple layers of different types of
rock and soul of drilling tunnels and
there is this kind of complicated but
then you need the Prius elevation
structures to get proper energies into
these rings so that you only get here I
think I heard a question over here maybe
so the question is whether the tunnel
has to be straight or slightly can
follow the curvature of the earth over
the distance curvature of the earth is
not really a big deal
but it would most presumably be a
straight tunnel just to not deal with
bending magnets
we'd have to refocus at some points and
we'd probably get some something that we
call more like a kicker magnet that
adjusts the beam but it's really fixed
focusing and it's not about bending
bending the particle path there must be
a bending somewhere in there because at
the point where you want to collide the
beams you don't want to shoot the
positron beam into the electron
acceleration line so at that point you
have like a 1 degree angle or so ah the
question was about the third sector so
there are four points around this ring
and the two that I haven't spoken about
our LHCb and one called elise LHCb
and elise are both so CMS and Atlas we
call sort of general purpose detectors
cm LHCb and Elise are more focused on
particular types of physics the LHC be
is is there and doing wonderful physics
they focus on the physics of B hydrants
and the reason that B hadrons are
interesting is because we're trying to
understand to not to put too fine a
point on it but why the universe is made
of matter instead of antimatter because
there's no physical reason why we should
be made about our matter instead of
antimatter and B hydrants as it turns
out show some asymmetry between B's and
anti B's and so it's a very interesting
laboratory for studying the answer to
this question and then at least just
briefly while we're talking about other
detectors is designed to do heavy ions
so for a couple months every year they
take all the protons out of the LHC and
they put in lead nuclei they smash them
together to try to basically create the
environment that existed just a fraction
of a second after the Big Bang when
quarks and gluons were not joined
together into protons and neutrons but
were actually sort of floating free and
this was obviously a very interesting
laboratory for us to to try to
understand
the very beginning of the universe and
that's something that Elise specializes
in yes
like like Oh things like black holes
risks like black holes just just a quick
vote in the audience like who's paired
with black holes black holes yeah is it
clear that when we're talking about
black holes in the context of the LHC
that a we have to assume very special
theories and B we're talking about
microscopic black holes we're not
talking about the thing that eats up
Suns we're talking about something
that's very very tiny it does suck
for what and then it grows bigger no I
so the first order it's a first order
we're pretty sure that they wouldn't be
therefore there are smarter people than
me who crunch the numbers that says we
just don't have enough energy but let's
suppose we got that equation wrong and
we do create a microscopic black hole
there's Stephen Hawking one of the
things that made that he sort of made
his name theorizing was that black holes
can actually evaporate and as it
happened small ones evaporate quite
quickly so they would only live for a
fraction of a second now let's suppose
that Stephen Hawking is wrong and we
have a stable black hole stable
microscopic black hole that's floating
around the inside of the detector and
then they they they did a calculation of
it's like it's doing a little Pacman
through the detector and it's just
gobbling up like atoms as it gets close
to them and like how long would it have
to go before it would be like I don't
know the size of an atom or something
like that it was like millions of years
it was like wild and irresponsible
speculation and I'm glad you're here to
provide for everyone let's go further
into wild speculations we do know that
objects like neutron stars which are
roughly the mass of the Sun or two but
the size diameter of a kilometer so what
piece feel like is
matter in the core of an atom the the
nucleus of an atom just the size of one
kilometer diameter the moment a
microscopic black hole would exist it
would hit a neutron star and which is be
dissipated like the neutron star would
go away that very moment now we know
that cosmic radiation exists we have
some very fancy experiments for example
in Argentina that has 3,000 square
kilometers of Earth surface monitored
for energy deposit deposition from the
sky we look into the sky with telescopes
to find gamma-ray bursts in the upper
atmosphere we have a South Pole
telescope that monitors the Cosmic
Microwave Background we we have quite a
few things that know that there's cosmic
radiation and we see cosmic radiation in
an energy range range that we will never
reach with any accelerator that we can
build on this planet because the planets
diameter is not large so we have a
pretty good idea that if microscopic
black holes would exist and were stable
that they would be created a lot more
often and a lot bigger in cosmic
radiation hitting anything that's in
their way so if neutron stars exist then
we can safely assume that microscopic
black holes if they existed were not
stable because otherwise they'd be eaten
up the moment they existed by something
that hits it has anyone ever heard about
Rick Rick used to be a heavy ion is
still a heavy ion collider at Brookhaven
National Lab on Long Island in the 90s I
think when it ramped up the East our
experiment there were was a rumor that
they would create black holes and
destroy the universe I think the rumor
about the black holes came up ever since
someone fancy the theory that would
contain black holes because black holes
are cute but the problem is the moment
someone comes up with a cute idea that
sounds kind of vicious someone else
comes up and and goes to an American
Lawyer and says I want to get money for
this yeah this is mostly outwards people
are more easily scared
then a short of being state and that's
that's the big deal that's why we
actually have to take care of publishing
results of the way we communicate with
general public because general public
tends to receive the negative message
much better than the positive message
that haven't been said there are
analyses that are searching for black
holes I mean we're looking for them I
wish we had found them but we haven't
tried
the question was about beam safety so be
done let's be clear no you cannot slice
bread with it
you can melt yeah a cubic meter of
copper with the energy that's within the
beat no no you can you can cut the bread
with it but you'd have to get the beam
through the bread we did test studies
with copper and we can choose very nice
holes into copper when when we're
talking about beam safety we have two
so-called beam dumps one for each
direction
which are sitting in point six of the
LHC that's somewhat pointing towards
Zurich on that ring now but but the
pointing direction then is towards the
UK and towards Italy so they're sitting
on the side of zurakov ring but pointing
in different directions beam dumps are
basically a large structure that can be
cooled that heats up to 700 degrees
Celsius if you dump the beam into it
which are there for safety so if we have
the full LFC filled with protons we're
talking about two thousand eight hundred
eight packages per direction with about
a hundred billion to two hundred billion
protons inside the protons themselves
don't have much energy as such but
there's just so many of them
that it makes for a large impact when we
for any reason which we do very often
because every now and then we have
electric glitches or whatever dump the
beam we realize there's something wrong
with the machine so we are not sure
we can keep the beam in shape in that
moment it takes three turns of the
protons to dump them into the beam dump
three turns is less than a millisecond
and the time constant that all the
magnets have that we have there we we
have the largest magnets that you can
find in the world
magnets tend to be slow in whatever they
do we pump them up with what ATMs 10
kilo amps so yeah the moment the time it
takes for this current to go down and if
the current goes down the magnetic field
itself induces more current as it cola
collapses so the time constant of these
magnets is so large that within their
time constants if we would just cut the
wire between one end and the other and
the current could not flow a the current
would continue to flow wherever it can
and be the magnetic field would still be
there for a while and as well as long
enough that we can dump the pin we have
to defocus the beam wave to shoot the
packages in two different directions in
the beam dump so as to not shoot holes
into the beam gun but yes the beam
itself is not a very nice thing
no one is underground when this happens
we have interlocked doors everywhere so
if anyone for any reason
manages to open a door that will cause
the beam to be dumped and those doors
are either above surface or at least
like six meters of concrete away from
the actual beam line
yeah we do shoot holes into stuff I have
no idea the beam dump itself is the
structure that's like 10 meters long or
so so as to s to be safe its relegates
to shooting a bolt of lightning into
something that gives you an idea we're
talking about that thousand eight
hundred mega Joule if anyone wants to do
the calculations I'm not very good at
calculus right that's and light
neutrinos what was the what was the
problem
maybe sadly I don't have a picture of C
NGS yeah so the neutrinos just a brief
word on nutrient of the
faster-than-light nutrients so what is a
neutrino a neutrino is just a
fundamental particle it's very light
it's almost impossible to detect
we need dedicated detectors to do it
Atlas can't see them and so that's why
you remember at the very beginning WW is
so hard was because we can't see the
neutrinos coming out of there but we
have dedicated experiments where we make
neutrino beams at cern and and elsewhere
but the one in question came from cern
and then we shot it through the ground
at Grant's to Gran Sasso laboratory in
Italy and what you do is you basically
make measurements on the beam at CERN
and it grants off so we can look for
changes and the composition is being
between the two points and so it's sort
of a warm-up measurement that they did
on this experiment was they tried to
measure just the time of flight of the
neutrinos and and they came up with a
number that said the neutrinos are
traveling faster than the speed of light
which is which is something that
Einstein might disagree with and and it
it was actually it was an interesting
case because they were very as it turns
out the reason that they measured that
was because there was a problem there
was a Lutz cable in their data
acquisition system and so there was a
signal that was traveling through there
through basically their electronics
crates a little bit slower than they had
calibrated it to travel and this ended
up looking like a delay that the
implication was that the neutrinos
looked like they were traveling faster
than this beautiful
so so after a couple of months of a very
thorough and nervous investigation they
found they found this problem they reran
the analysis and neutrinos do not travel
faster the speed of light it was a
really interesting case so that in
particular because I really the the
collaboration that did this was the
Opera collaboration and and there was a
lot of criticism of opera at the time
they were irresponsible for giving this
result and and I personally at least
everyone has an opinion on this but I
personally at least really admired what
they did there because it was a tricky
it was a tricky results that you put
yourself in their position like you've
done this analysis you've checked
everything you can think of to check ok
maybe you didn't check your cables but
that wouldn't be the first thing that I
would think of either and and you still
have the result and like what what are
you suppose you can't not release it
because you know it and I don't know
maybe neutrinos do travel faster than
the speed of light and and you would
feel like a fool if you figured this out
in six months and you were sitting on it
and then someone else scoops the Nobel
Prize from you in the meantime um and so
if you look back at the result as they
presented it I thought they did it in a
quite a responsible way in the sense
that they they went forward they said
looked this is what we find doesn't make
a whole lot of sense to us these are all
the things we've checked and it's not
any of those so we said we would give
you a result this is our result and and
very pointedly not saying we think
travel neutrinos travel faster than the
speed of light and so it was kind of
interesting that to watch both the
experimental community trying to figure
out what's wrong with it and the
theoretical community is like ooh
neutrinos can travel faster than the
speed of light than like and you know
and like traveling with and following
this this through their favorite theory
and extra dimensions out of it or
something like that what what people
should understand here is what is seen
on the map now what we're doing is we're
taking protons from the pre accelerator
of the LHC shoot it into a target where
they convert into muons and then we
detect the muons in two places and as
the muons disappear from one place to
another we know that they must have left
a muon neutrino behind
that's the way our physics works that's
the way we can explain a lot of things
so there must be a muon neutrino
whenever a muon disappeared so at that
point we can say we've produced so many
muon neutrinos in this type of distance
and then we shoot them through three 738
kilometers of rock and we hit our target
the opÃ©ra detector close to rome in the
gran sasso underground laboratory with
about two centimeters of precision and
they've measured the timing of both the
incident beam at CERN and the arrival at
Gran Sasso to a little less than two
nanoseconds accuracy daddy's happy they
have GPS receivers which they have to
install above surface to get this timing
and then they have to extrapolate at
CERN 100 meters underground and at
console through the gran sasso tunnel
so they actually actually they have to
block half of the tunnel it has two
lanes and they blocked one of those
lanes for quite some time just to
extrapolate length meta measurements
from the outside to the inside can get
the timing right epidural so measuring
60 nano second time difference in time
of arrival it's complicated and I think
they've put a lot of effort into this so
I think I I'm talking about God
particles the question is about media
and how how we get around with them so I
guess my opinion it depends very much I
guess my opinion on how responsibly I
feel like the message has been conveyed
so one example that I'll give is that
outlets like the BBC or the New York
Times usually they have people who when
they come to us are very responsible
about trying to portray things
accurately and sometimes it's not
perfect but you know that's that's
alright with me
I'm less crazy about sometimes bloggers
feel a little bit more take a little bit
more Liberty than I would have chosen I
think that it certainly gets people
interested in talking and I think that
that is a good thing but for example
when there was this sort of spurious
semi discovery in 2011 the reason that
was a problem was because it got onto a
blog and it got public and so that's an
example of how it I think it kind of
hurt us to have something out there but
then have to say like no no no no no
don't pay attention to that and then and
then I guess on the very far extreme it
are kind of like crackpots and I guess
what can you do with people are gonna
stay what they're gonna say about
whatever handing the question back the
how does Google deal with it here's a
question about the LHC accident in 2008
whatever so the X I'm just kidding
I know I only had one so - again to talk
in numbers we have a thousand 232 dipole
magnets which are in most places
connected to one another we're filling
this pool 27-kilometer ring with magnets
or a seller rating structure or
experiments but that's that's all there
is and we only have so many when this
accident happened what happened was
there's an interconnection between
multiple magnets
those are superconducting magnets they
run at a typical temperature like 1.9
Kelvin we're cooling them with what we
call superfluid helium which tends to
crawl up the wall and cover all surfaces
and has as far as we can measure
infinite heat conductivity kind of which
is complicated to measure at almost
absolute zero so we're cooling this all
so far just because we need the coolant
flow because helium itself doesn't have
a large heat capacity so we need
superfluid helium to get their problem
as gases tend to
expand about liquid gases tend to expand
as they evaporate I vowed the factor of
thousand which is kind of old almost
always true so depending on which gas EF
is more or less but like a factor of a
thousand is a good number what happened
there was that we had an interconnection
between two superconductors which was
slightly above the resistance that it
should have been plus that the heat
conduction at this place was likely
below the value that it should have been
so unfortunate what happened was that
the it's not that simple there's someone
making an extending movement in the
background what happened was this thing
got hot it kind of burned through so the
superconductor didn't work anymore
because it was too warm so at that point
the typical superconductor that we use
is niobium titanium and niobium and
titanium are both not very good
conductors it's a wonderful
superconductor up to 10 Kelvin but as
soon as it goes beyond that gone so what
happened was the current those eight
kilo amps or so had to go somewhere else
and typically what we have for this is a
copper copper surrounding so like to you
profiles that slide on top of one
another so if the magnets extend or
shrink they can still have contact and
if the current goes through the copper
then at least can still continue and you
immediately dump the power of the magnet
problem was in this case even the copper
contact wasn't there so what then
happened like tiny gap so the current
goes somewhere else and what it did was
it jumped a little and hit the he
embezzled within the magnet so the
helium and the superconductor are not
within the same structure but they're
connected through metal what then
happened was the helium vessel opened
the helium ceased a sudden under
pressure and starts evaporating getting
hot and creating a cloud and this then
pushed partially the magnets by one and
a half meters each of those magnets is
about 20 meters long and about 22 tons
and weight and they're bolted into
concrete feet with with screws roughly
the size of my arm
and then while you're not alone in the
cavern when the beam is red that is why
we have interlocked doors yeah it moved
a total of 55 magnets at the time which
is a long distance like a total of 400
meters I think was damaged and it took a
year to fix it and get first counter
measures installed and right now we're
in the shutdown because we won't install
more counter measures to this because we
are kind of sure that we've we've
pinpointed the problematic locations and
we're trying to measure like you can you
can try and go online and figure out how
to measure a resistance of less than an
N om
that's that's complicated we've been
managing to measure that and the idea is
now to either exchange magnets where we
think that the resistances are too high
in these Junction points or also install
overpressure valves because the moment
this just happens again we need to be
prepared that there's helium again
extending and expanding and moving the
magnets and that would be sad so that's
what we're doing right now come to CERN
yes he is the question on how do we test
this this is all prototype like we're
not building a sec we're not building a
second LHC so the first time we switch
this on is the first time ever someone's
trying this and we're only switching on
the real machine we don't have a second
one somewhere in the backyard where we
can try out stuff so this is our one
playground that is why things like this
happen and they have to happen to figure
out why why stuff is not working we do
have above surface structures where we
also have superfluid helium to operate
the magnets but you can only operate so
many in the chain because you need the
space so getting all of this assembled
and a really large structure only
happens on the ground where we only have
one system and that's the production
system there there is there's a
pre-production sample but it never gives
you the full feeling it's like just
having the engine of a Ferrari and then
trying to figure out how it will drive
this is a question here good question in
particular for the LHC I can tell you
that for detectors the oh the question
was how many rounds of design reviews do
we do so I can tell you that from the
detector side of things the technically
signed report for the detector I worked
on was written in 1998 the last changes
to that were made I think in 2007
probably just before we installed
because what we did was we installed an
additional eat a blanket or a component
that couldn't be operated very cold that
was the last design change that was made
I don't think there's ever been a state
at which the detector was clearly
defined up until the point where we
installed it we do go through a lot of
rounds of design reviews because we're
never sure like did we see everything so
we have a lot of people from for example
other experiments we can just go around
and like pick up people from Alice or
from LHCb and tell them here look this
is what we're going to build is this
same go through the documentation go
through the pre-production samples that
we have like figure out whether we
overlooked something that depends on the
project I mean for me it's typically
electrical engineering so there's
electrical engineers there's physicists
who want to figure out whether besides
the technical aspect the things that
would work for a physicist because you
you will find that the there's a big
difference between the electrical
engineer and the physicist an approach
of trying to build a detector that's
mostly it I think it depends on the
problem like we have IT specialist there
we have kind of specialist for
everything there we have our own
Department for Blues
question is how reliable is the machine
now in last year last year's operation
was on time of I don't know we had a
so-called Huebner factor of more than 40
percent I think yeah I think when it's
running really well it's it's a little
bit stop-and-go at the beginning is they
sort of get a feel for the machine once
it's sort of on that plateau though it's
running maybe seventy percent of the
time and then the rest of the time
you're refilling or calibrating whatever
once the machine is on entry do operates
24/7 and nicely actually
yeah like the all the data we've
acquired last year it was more than we
initially were told we would get and it
was definitely very good question there
I sure hope that Katie's gonna answer I
want what's what's the gaps in the
standard model like what do we do now
that we have the expose on so we're
looking for there's a large class of
people who are looking for supersymmetry
which is another sort of you take the
standard model and you give it another
sort of dimension of freedom if you like
and this gives you a whole new set of
particles that we can be looking for
that might have discussed escaped our
attention so far because we didn't have
the energy to see them or because they
don't interact with the partners like
the protons and and the atoms that we
make our detector out of so maybe they
sneaked through because we just they
don't interact with atoms that well so
there's a large group that's looking for
that other open questions that are
related I think are things like
searching for a dark matter which is
something that we know cosmologically
has to exist because we look out there
and we see the 25% of the universe is
something that we can't see and so some
of the super some supersymmetric
theories in particular have particles
that are candidates to be the Dark
Matter particle so we look for those
there are some other exotic searches
that happen at the LHC for things like
magnetic monopoles extra dimensions
black holes and then yeah like the other
little things
and then there's some other smaller
experiments that you don't hear coming
out of CERN as much but I think are
maybe in the long run more impactful on
people's lives so things like learning
how to make anti hydrogen and to trap it
and to study its spectrum and things
like that that potentially like anti
hydrogen as it turns out and anti
protons are really have some really nice
properties if you want to fight cancer
as it happens they're extremely
difficult to make and they're extremely
difficult they're not well studied at
all we only the first time we ever made
anti hydrogen was in 1986 so this is
this is not a new this is not an old
thing this is something that like we're
really like pushing on the edge of there
but if if they figure out how to make it
in larger quantities and there's all
kinds of cool stuff you could do with
the general drive is to kind of get the
full picture of the universe so if we're
looking up into the sky and we see that
like 97% of whatever it is out there is
not what we understand in our current
models then we're upset right we as much
as possible interconnection to as much
as we can but then we also have
colleagues and things like a question is
how long does it take to fill about half
an hour so the filling procedure itself
depending on how stable it goes is
something like 10 to 15 minutes to get
lots of packets of protons into the ring
because you need to like stagger it so
you start at a very small ring
accelerator a survey protons to a medium
energy get them into the next
decelerator higher energy and then
eventually fill them into the LHC but
that these as these rings have different
radii you can fill only so many packages
into each ring and so the initial ring
gives you the maximum length that you
can fill into the next ring and as we do
this the procedure has to repeat a lot
of times before we completely fill the
LHC so that takes 10 to 15 minutes and
then the ramped up of energy that
happens in the LHC to
another let's say ten minutes so if it
drunk the cellar well let's say the
energy itself in the LHC doesn't
actually cause any energy consumption
because the magnets are superconducting
so you only fill them with current and
you can actually withdraw the current
eventually like you you could get it
back I don't think we do the energy
consumption initially I don't know CERN
has a proper power line so we we get
this these days like we have problems
when we switch from these wench French
to the Swiss Network which is which is
an 18 kilo volt line on one side and 18
kilo volt line on the other side and in
theory this should happen seamlessly
it never does like whenever we are being
told that there's a switching of power
then everyone shuts down all the
critical systems because it means less
work when you power them up again
we have a maximum of 200 megawatts that
we can consume in standard operation
with the LHC on we're consuming between
145 and 165 megawatts out of which 85 is
just a cooling system for the LHC RF
power to keep the protons that energy is
2.4 megawatts so that's where we're
talking order of the canton of geneva in
terms of power consumption that's
400,000 households this is why we're
supposed to switch off in winter because
if we're growing too much Karen Geneva
is probably heating thank you very much
