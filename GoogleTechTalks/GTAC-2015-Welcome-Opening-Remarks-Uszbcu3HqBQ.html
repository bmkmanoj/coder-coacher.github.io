&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good morning.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Come on!
Good morning, everyone.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Good morning!
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Thank you.
Good.
We fed you good coffee.
Welcome to Google, in particular, welcome
to Google Cambridge.
My name is Yvette Nameth, and I am actually
not from Google Cambridge.
I am from our Seattle office.
Just a quick hi from me, because I will be
with you for the next two days, helping figure
out what's going on here.
I've been with Google for about nine years
now, spanning both products and ads and maps.
I'm a test engineer and a manager in the Seattle
office for the Google Maps products right
now.
And I don't know if you can tell, but I'm
rapidly losing my voice, so I'm going to try
and keep this sweet and informational.
As some of you in the audience may know, that
might be a little hard for me, but I'll do
my best.
So, first of all, let's make sure you know
where things are.
One of the most important things to know where
it is is the agenda.
What are we doing over the next two days,
when are things happening.
All of the information, such as agenda, how
to submit questions, how to view the recordings
after GTAC is over, are available on developers.google.com/GTAC.
So just go there to find the link for all
questions, which, speaking of, it also contains
the link to the live stream.
Welcome to everyone viewing on the live stream,
which is going on right now.
If you're in the room with me here, remember,
you might actually be on camera.
We've got signs all over the place telling
you that, but this is my one last reminder.
The world might see you for all posterity.
They're going to see me for all posterity.
I'm sorry.
So it is what it is.
And that information is on the Web site.
But the other interesting piece of information
for those of you in the room and those of
you on the live stream, is that our links
to Q&amp;amp;A are also available from that same Web
site.
So, again, you go to developers.google.com/gtac
and you can find all the information on how
-- or the link for this, our way of asking
questions.
For every talk, what will happen, at the beginning
of the talk, it will show up on this site,
the same site for every talk.
There will be the date, time, and name of
talk.
And you enter your question.
At the end of the talk, assuming there's time
remaining, we will take as many questions
as we can.
And if somebody has already asked your question,
feel free to upvote it.
We'll be taking the top &quot;N&quot; questions for
every talk.
Another logistical piece of information, because
I got the exciting stuff, the really meaty
stuff.
Please wear your conference badge at all times.
This is our way of letting physical security
know that you are legit to be inside the building
with us, that you are a Google Guest.
And this same badge is what will get you back
into the building tomorrow.
So without it, I'm sorry, you'll be one of
the live stream participants from your hotel
room.
And that would be really sad.
So please wear it.
You will notice one particular thing about
your badges.
Most of you have, like, white string lanyards.
There will be a few people around who have
a black lanyard on.
The black lanyard is very, very special.
These are your buddies should anything not
be available to you on the Web site or obvious
from what I'm telling you today.
These are all the organization committee people,
and they will connect you with whatever answers
you need here.
There's another special-colored lanyard that
I'd like to call out, too.
That is the blue lanyard.
And that is all the speakers over the next
two days.
So just thank them for donating their time
to speak.
Of course, there's this thing called social
media.
Regardless of what platform you use, we'd
love it if we could coordinate a hashtag,
because we're like that, gtac2015, when you're
posting on Google+, Twitter, Facebook, what
have you, Instagram, any of the above.
We love to see your pictures.
We love to hear what things are really standing
out, what new questions you have for yourself,
what memorable quotes you heard the speakers
say, et cetera.
So please share those with us.
Well, you're at Google, and I think everyone
at this point knows that Google has a lot
of free food around.
And we're not going to leave you out of this.
Lunch is provided on site by Google for you
each day.
You really don't have to go far.
I think one of the stations will be just as
close as breakfast was to this room.
But lunch will actually be available out in
the common area just outside of this room,
as well as there's a common area upstairs
that requires no badge to get to other than
your conference badge, where there will be
tabled seating to sit down.
It will be different each day, there are vegetarian,
omnivore, carnivore options available to you
each day.
So welcome to Google, and enjoy the food!
But we're not done there.
You know, we've got tomorrow, and we've got
to recharge.
So tonight, Google recruiting has decided
to help us out by sponsoring a casino night.
No real money involved.
Funny money only.
Dinner, drinks, games, poker, roulette, Texas
Holdem.
Come, have fun.
And, again, it will be in our wonderful shared
space here in Google Cambridge.
Now, there are some changes that have happened
over the years with GTAC.
One of the biggest changes that has happened
over the years is that we've started to expand.
We've expanded the types of technologies that
we talk about here at GTAC.
We now not only talk about software testing
and explicitly Web testing.
We talk about app testing, phone testing,
testing machines, testing with robots, accessibility
testing.
You name it, we talk about it.
But with that, we've actually increased our
diversity, too.
And we wanted to actually explicitly recognize
that this year.
And one of the changes that we've made this
year is actually calling out explicitly our
diversity policy on the Web site as well as
our code of conduct, which you've seen on
the Web site, posted around this conference
space, and here on the slide.
I just want everyone to keep in mind this
notion of inclusiveness when having lively
discussions with your fellow tester comrades
here at GTAC and when asking questions.
And if you have any questions, feel free to,
you know, bring it up, talk about what does
this actually mean, what does this imply?
This is another interesting conversation we
can have here at GTAC.
With that being said, let's actually talk
about you guys.
This is a wonderfully diverse group of people
in front of me and those of you on the live
stream who didn't actually get to come join
us today.
So we had 1,362 applications to actually attend
GTAC.
That's an insane number.
Just look around, if you're sitting in the
room with me.
And how many people do you actually think
are here.
Just a few hundred.
We had approximately 200 applications for
speaker submissions, from which we picked
only 24 talks.
And we had over 250 Googlers apply to attend,
let alone the others that just showed up.
There are tons of you here.
And we thank you for wanting to come, for
making our job so hard when we were doing
speaker selection that we actually followed
our own advice.
We really wanted to take diversity into account
this year.
And rather than just looking at the diversity
of talks, we took into account the way Google
has been promoting the notion of unconscious
bias and recognizing when unconscious bias
comes into the workplace.
And in this vein, we actually removed all
PII, personally identifiable information,
during the speaker selection process so that
we could really focus on what you're talking
about and make sure that we get a good breadth
of technical talks covering all sorts of things.
Additionally, we actually added one more thing
that came out of the feedback from last year.
We're Googlers.
We live in this beautiful Google bubble with
massage tables and food and infrastructure
that some of you would drool over.
But that's not necessarily representative
either when we're doing selections.
So for the first time we experimented with
having somebody who is not a Googler on our
speaker selection committee.
And we would like to thank Vishal Arora who
is not actually here with us but who did dial
in and give feedback on the entire speaker
selection process and helped us make it a
better conference by pointing out where our
unconscious biases because of our, you know,
day-to-day infrastructure challenges, where
they were coming out it in our speaker selection
and even in our technical selection.
So that was kind of cool.
We ended up coming out of five academic speaker,
eight Google speakers, and the rest of are
everyone else showing us as broad of a range
as possible.
I gave you a little snippet of where people
are from up on the slide.
However, let's make sure you are really awake.
That welcome sounded pretty good, so I'm hopeful.
So I'm going to play a little game with you.
I would like anyone who traveled more than
20 hours to get to GTAC here in Cambridge
to please stand up.
Stand up.
Thank you.
I think these guys actually deserve a round
of applause.
[ Applause ]
No, stay standing because you are eligible
for the next two.
Now, come on, some of us traveled more than
ten years.
Stand up, please.
If you traveled more than 20 you traveled
more than ten.
Stay up there.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
Yes.
We're getting more.
Did you travel more than five hours?
This is where I get to stand up.
Did you travel more than an hour?
Let's get New York City standing.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
If you have any neighbors sitting down, say
hello to the locals.
They are your tour guys for the next few days.
Go make a friend.
Thank you, everyone.
You can sit down.
With that being said, I want to tell you a
little bit about what it is like to be local
to Google Cambridge.
This office has over 900 Googlers across 12
floors and 300 connected buildings.
It wasn't always this way.
When I first visited Google Cambridge there
were less than 50 Googlers here about five,
six years ago, maybe more.
I don't remember.
It is actually the second largest office east
of the Mississippi, the other one being New
York City.
It started out in 2003 as a small sales office,
as many of our engineering offices did.
And then, of course, engineers were like,
We want to work there, too.
That's a great location.
It was actually in Boston and relocated to
Cambridge in 2006, and this particular site
opened in 2008.
I listed a bunch of the projects that exist
in Google Cambridge.
But with a 900-person office, we have a really
good cross-section of the Google product space.
Everything from internal tools to ads latency
to Chrome, Google Play.
ITA is one of our particularly unique projects
here, et cetera.
And you may notice -- and you'll really notice
if you go on one of the tours which I will
tell you about in a second -- that this office
has a theme.
The entire office is themed like the T. So
each building has its own color.
I can't remember what color we're in right
now.
I think we're actually in the connector, so
we're in one of the connector colors.
But each building has a color and there are,
like, subway-like maps for getting around
the buildings because they don't actually
connect from floor three.
You may end up going from floor three to floor
four.
So it's kind of important to look your subway
map to get around Google Cambridge.
And if you actually want to see this yourself
and see the amazing office space along with
the green space that you may see outside the
windows just outside this common area, we
are offering tours both today and tomorrow
at 1:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.
You can sign up during breaks or lunch just
outside near where you picked up your swag.
And for people on the livestream, I'm sorry,
look at pictures online, they're great.
And we hope you can join us at whatever our
next location may be.
How am I doing on time, Matt?
I have one other thing.
I'm not supposed to talk a lot but I can't
help it.
Oh, the slides didn't reload.
I'm not supposed to talk a lot, but I really
can't help it.
I wasn't even sure I could talk about this
this morning.
But as of 9:00 a.m.
Eastern time today, a product I have been
testing in secret for the past two years finally
launched.
It's the first time I actually got to launch
a product that people didn't know about.
[ Applause ]
You don't even know what it is!
So as I'm standing here speaking with you,
my team is having mimosas because we actually
just launched offline Google Maps for Mobile,
meaning now you can do searching -- yes!
You are my hero, AV.
[ Laughter ]
You can now search for a restaurant in a location
where you've downloaded your map regardless
of whether you have Internet connection.
As long as you have G.P.S. which does not
require WiFi or data signal, you can navigate
to your route using turn-by-turn navigation
in locations.
So this will be rolling out to GMM on your
phone -- GMM, Google Maps for Mobile -- sometime
soon.
We are doing a slow rollout but it is now
out there in the wild.
So that's really awesome.
But guess what?
I spent the past two weeks debugging a test
that was really, really annoying.
I had this test where on every emulator I
ran it on, on every phone I ran it on, when
I stepped through it, it would not reproduce
the behavior.
It would not allow me to select an area to
download.
And I was like, What in the world is going
on here?
I can do this on my emulators, regardless
of my API level.
It doesn't matter what version of Maps for
Mobile I'm actually running.
This is like consistent back a few versions
of our dev build.
What's going on here?
It turns out I uncovered one of those bugs
that our users probably never will, that only
my automation could.
Once upon a time, a developer assumed that
your finger would be on the screen when you
hit that particular screen where you select
areas to input, and that's what triggers the
&quot;is this area valid to download&quot;?
And I was using automation to trigger this,
meaning that there was no interaction with
the devices.
And every time my test was failing.
I spent two weeks on this.
That's embarrassingly long.
[ Laughter ]
Like, let me tell you, although kind of funny,
let's be honest, the team would walk by and
be like: Did you get it yet?
And I'd be like, Seriously?
Are you asking me that?
Do you really want to ruin my day?
But, in the end, I just want to remind everyone
we're going to hear about a lot of people's
successes whether it's launching offline Google
Maps or whether it's spending two weeks on
a ridiculous edge case bug that's a huge challenge.
And these come hand in hand.
With every challenge, hopefully a few of those
put together will result in a success.
And with every success, ask the person what
challenges did you learn from along the way
that helped you get here?
So that we can learn from each other.
So I'm just going to actually put out a challenge
to you guys to say: What helped you get here?
And congratulations on all your big successes.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
