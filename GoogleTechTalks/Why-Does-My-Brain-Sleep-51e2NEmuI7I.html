start with a standard disclaimer which
is that when most speakers look to their
audience and they see people who are
falling asleep or nodding off it can be
profoundly disheartening however based
on the topic of today's presentation I'm
almost going to actively encourage that
kind of behavior from you okay in fact
knowing what I know particularly about
the relationship between sleep and
memory it's actually the greatest form
of flattery for me to see people like
you not being able to resist the urge to
strengthen what I'm telling you
by falling asleep so so feel free just a
sort of ebb and flow in and out of
consciousness throughout the entire talk
I'll take absolutely no offense and the
talk itself is really going to come in
four main acts so to speak firstly I
want to spend some time telling you
about what sleep actually is the
different types its characteristics its
structure and then after that I'll tell
you about the variety of different
functions plural that were starting to
understand that sleep serves so I'll
tell you about a role of sleep in
promoting learning and also memory but
I'll also then tell you how sleep can go
beyond simply manipulating individual
memories sleep seems to be intelligent
in that it can cross link new pieces of
information together so you can come up
with creative novel insights the next
day and then finally I'll describe a
role of sleep beyond information
processing into your mental health and
how sleep seems to be critical for
emotional regulation preparing specific
brain circuits for next day social and
emotional interactions so that's the the
basic overview coming on to what sleep
is and I do love this this picture you
can just kind of get a sense of the
quality and the depth of sleep that's
happening there if we're going on that
whole savanna grassland kind of side
street by the way I just want to come on
to this the giraffe first the what a
strange morphology in for a creature
okay have you ever wondered how
something that looks like that sleeps
would you like to know how a giraffe
sleeps that's how a giraffe sleeps isn't
that remarkable and it tells us at least
two things firstly despite such bizarre
Anatomy sleep will still find a way to
be obtained by the brain second and more
generally in every species that we've
studied to date sleep or something that
looks very much like it has been
observed what that means is that sleep
has fought its way through vehement ly
every step along the evolutionary
pathway if that's true sleep must be
essential at some of the most basic of
biological levels and that's exactly
what we're starting to discover and
sleep in terms of mammalian species at
least has been broadly separated into
two main types as some of you may know
on the one hand we have non-rapid eye
movement sleep or non REM sleep for
short and non REM sleep has been further
subdivided into four separate stages
unimaginative Lee called stages one
through four increasing in their depth
of sleep or a creative bunch of sleep
researchers so increasing in the depth
of sleep stages three and four are those
really deep stages of dreamless sleep
and they're often grouped together under
the term slow-wave sleep why because of
these slow lazy brainwaves that happen
during the stage of sleep that we
measure with electrodes on the head but
don't be fooled what that means that's
not that your brain is dormant by any
stretch of the imagination what it means
is that vast portions of your brain
hundreds of thousands of neurons have
all decided to synchronize together and
sing together in time it's a phenomena
like no other brain state that we know
of it doesn't happen whilst you're awake
it's a strange phenomena and we still
don't truly understand why on the other
hand we have rapid eye movement sleep or
REM sleep named not after the popular
Michael Stipe pop band but because of
these bizarre horizontal shuttling eye
movements that occur during the stage of
sleep and again we don't truly
understand
why your eyes move during that stage of
sleep and it turns out that these two
types of sleep REM and non-rem will play
out in a battle for brain domination
throughout the night and that sort of
cerebral war is going to be won and lost
every 90 minutes and replayed every 90
minutes and what that creates is a
standard architecture of sleep what we
call a sleep cycle so I'll just unpack
this for you here we've got the
different stages of sleep on the
vertical axis and then time of night
along the horizontal axis and I'll speed
this up for you but what you can see is
that upon falling asleep your brain goes
on this delightful roller-coaster ride
in and out of these different stages of
sleep so you'll quickly descend down
into the deep stages of non REM sleep
three and four and you'll stay there for
a while and then after about 70 or 80
minutes you'll start to rise back up and
then you'll pop up and have a short REM
sleep period here in red and then back
down you go again down into non REM
sleep and then up into REM as I said
this cycle is 90 minutes non-rem to REM
and that's stable across the night
however what changes is the ratio of
non-rem to REM within that 90-minute
window as you move across the night such
that in the first half of the night the
majority of those 90-minute cycles are
comprised of deep non REM sleep
slow-wave sleep whereas as you push
through to the second half of the night
now that ratio balance shifts across and
instead they're dominated much born by
rapid eye movement sleep as well as that
lighter form of non dreaming sleep stage
two non REM sleep and just to come back
to REM sleep REM sleep is the principal
stage during which your brain dreams and
REM sleep is a case of essentially how
your brain goes completely out of its
mind because everyone here as long as
you slept last night you became
flagrantly psychotic now before you
reject my diagnosis of a nightly
psychosis let me give you five good
reasons because last night when you were
in REM sleep and you were dreaming you
started to see things which were not
there so you were hallucinating secondly
you believed things that couldn't
possibly be true
so you were delusional third you became
confused about time place and person so
you're suffering from disorientation
fourth you had wildly fluctuating
emotions something that psychiatrists
call being effectively labile and then
how wonderful you woke up this morning
and you forgot most if not all of that
dream experience so you're suffering
from amnesia if you were to experience
any one of those five symptoms whilst
you're awake you would be seeking
psychiatric treatment yet for reasons
again that we don't fully understand it
seems to be both a normal biological and
psychological process one of the other
fascinating features of REM sleep is
this paralysis all of you when you went
into REM sleep last night were paralyzed
it turns out that there's a mechanism
deep down here in your brainstem so here
we have the brain which as Woody Allen
suggested was his second most favorite
organ of the body and so his front of
the brain back of the brain brain stem
down here now this war of REM and
non-rem sleep essentially plays out down
here and then is beamed up to the top of
the wrinkled mass top of the brain
called the cortex but there's also
another signal that goes south down into
the spinal cord and this signal during
REM sleep that goes south
essentially inhibits what we call the
alpha motor neurons in your spinal cord
they control all of your voluntary
skeletal muscles so during REM sleep
your brain paralyzes your body so your
mind can dream safely it's a bad
evolutionary design when you're not
perceiving your outside world to start
acting out all of those dream commands
and there are plenty of them just as in
a quick aside on this paralysis note by
the way sometimes this persists despite
you waking up some of you may have
experienced this this persistence of
sleep paralysis on awakening it's quite
unwell it's not unusual proportional
wise about 25% of the population will
experience this it's about as common as
hiccups and what seems to happen is that
your brain starts to wake up but the
paralysis isn't released from the body
so you start to become a word but you
can't lift your eyelids voluntary
muscles you can't move you can't say
anything it is often associated with a
sense of sort of anxiety a sense of
someone else being there in the room it
turns out that this sleep paralysis this
persistence accurately explains most if
not all of so-called alien abductions I
mean when was the last time you ever
heard of someone being abducted during
the day in the middle of a meeting you
know I mean it never whoosh what was
that oh I believe Jimmy just got
abducted by aliens you know no it never
happens like that it's usually at night
when you're in bed people describe a
sense of a presence in the room that you
were paralyzed by these other agents you
couldn't move you couldn't fight back
you couldn't talk it's a strange
interesting feature that's a little bit
about what sleep is together with some
other sides I don't quite know I threw
that in there but anyway let's now come
on to what sleep is doing and it is
serving a whole broad array of functions
firstly let me tell you why it's
essential to sleep before learning to
prepare your brain almost like a dry
sponge ready to soak up new information
the next day and to sort of test this a
question we're going to run an
experiment essentially is pulling the
all-nighter a good idea
here's how you do this you take two
groups of participants you assign them
to a sleep group or a sleep deprivation
group both are awake across the first
day but then across the following night
those in the deprivation group we keep
them awake in the laboratory and a full
supervision they can't fall asleep the
sleep group they get a full eight hours
both of them are awake across the second
day and then we have them try and cram a
whole bunch of facts into their brain
and then we're going to test them to see
how efficient that learning has been but
instead of testing them immediately
after learning we actually wait until to
full recovery nights of sleep before we
test them so that any measure of memory
that we get is not confounded by them
simply being too sleepy or inattentive
to recollect what they've learned and
that's what you're looking at here on
the vertical axis the efficiency of
learning so the higher up you are the
better you are and if you put those two
groups head-to-head what you find is
that under conditions of sleep
deprivation there is a quite profound
forty percent deficit in the capacity of
your brain to
make new memories to be able to create
new experiences and this should perhaps
be a little concerning considering what
we know is happening to sleep in our
educational populations if you want to
put this in context it's simply the
difference between acing the exam and
failing it miserably okay now of course
these are just performance data we don't
know what's going on inside the brain so
to answer the Sham we've repeated these
experiments but now during that
attempted learning subjects are actually
inside an MRI scanner as we're taking
snapshots of brain activity to see which
parts of the brain are switching on or
not switching on so you get these
attempted maps of learning in the sleep
group and in the sleep deprivation group
and then you simply subtract one from
the other to see what the difference is
and when you do that subtraction you
find a highly selective but highly
significant impairment in this part of
the brain here it's a structure called
the hippocampus that I'm circling for
you so just to orient you for those not
familiar with MRI images it's as if I've
sliced through the brain from ear to ear
and you're looking in from the front top
of the brain bottom of the brain left
and right side and I'm circling for you
the hippocampus here you have one on the
left and one on the right and these cool
blue blobs demonstrate that this part of
the brain was significantly impaired in
those people who are sleep deprived
compared to a nice strong signal coming
from that part of the brain in those
people who had had a good night of sleep
why is this important well it turns out
that this structure the hippocampus is
the quintessential reservoir for where
your brain creates new memories in fact
if you want to know what life is like
without a functioning hippocampus just
watch the movie memento I'm sure many of
you have seen this film if if you
haven't watched it's great film and I
won't spoil it for you but essentially
this gentleman has some brain damage and
from that point forward he can no longer
make any new memories he is densely a
music the part of his brain that was
damaged was this structure the
hippocampus it is the very same
structure that sleep deprivation seems
to selectively attack and block your
brain's capacity for efficient learning
let me just go back to these data
because there's an unresolved question
here that was the bad
happens when you don't get sleep what's
going on in those people who are getting
sleep in other words what is it about
the sleep that they're getting the
physiology of their sleep that seems to
be promoting the restoration of memory
and what we've been finding is that
there are specific electrical brainwave
patterns that are promoting this memory
restoration and they're coming from
non-rapid eye movement sleep and they're
these delightful little chaps they're
called sleep spindles these are short
synchronous bursts of electrical
activity in the EEG the electric
electroencephalogram they last for about
one second of time so you're going along
they that's the burst of X they don't
make your brain doesn't make that sound
of course that would just be strange but
they though these champagne cork
synchronous bursts of activity and we
believe that they form part of a broad
network that promotes the transformation
or the translocation of memories from
one location in the brain to another and
you can think of the USB since I'm at
Google in a crass analogy like a USB
hippocampus stick it's very good at
grabbing information somewhat quickly
but it has a limited storage capacity
and we believe that these spindles are
helping promote the transfer from that
hippocampus USB stick up into that
folded mass the cortex essentially in
terms of the analogy the hard drive the
mass storage capacity of the system and
by promoting that real estate
transaction that shifting of geography
of information within the brain not only
do you take previous memories and make
them safe put them onto the hard drive
you clear out the USB stick in terms of
its memory capacity so when you wake up
the next day you're freely able to start
loading up new information again because
what we find is that the more of these
sleep spindles that you have the greater
the degree of restoration of your
learning capacity the next day so each
of these dots represents an individual
participant the more of those spindles
that you have the greater the degree of
memory return in terms of capacity for
learning that you get the next day so
we're starting to understand not just
the bad when you don't get sleep but
exactly what it is in terms of the good
when you do get sleep that promotes
these cognitive
it turns out that it's not just
sufficient for you to sleep before
learning you also need to sleep after
learning to essentially cement that new
information into the neural architecture
of the brain and make it less vulnerable
to being forgotten
so it's essentially like hitting the
Save button it just takes a lot longer
organically within the brain to do that
and there's now good evidence that
following that type of a learning
scenario you do need sleep to hit that
Save button so that you get that
improved recollection the following day
and for fact-based memories what you
would think of as textbook like memory
that seems to require in terms of sleep
deep sleep stages 3 &amp;amp; 4 or that
slow-wave sleep that I described so
there's lots of good evidence over the
past sort of 15 or 20 years that this is
the case correlational evidence but of
course what you tend to want in science
is a causal demonstration so the
question is if you can increase the
amount or the quality of your deep
slow-wave sleep presumably you could
boost the amount of memory benefit that
that sleep is providing the question of
course becomes how do you boost the
quality of your slow-wave sleep well
there are a variety of different ways
but of course at your favorite and my
favorite would be this direct current
brain stimulation ok if you have you
seen those UM adverts or late night on
television where they say don't try this
at home this is this is one of those
this is not car battery and a couple of
electrodes ok although that would be an
interesting experience just imagine I'm
just picturing someone you know hooking
themselves into bed at night at the bed
partner you know goodnight honey and
you're playing these electrodes jeez
what are you doing don't worry about me
I'm just boosting my sleep so so you you
can inject essentially a small amount of
voltage and I'll just show you they're
clinically approved this is what it
looks like
you inject a small amount of voltage
into the brain now it's so small that
you don't even feel it that's how tiny
it is but it is physiologically
efficacious and the idea here is that
you're going to try and pulse in time
with the brain during those slow
brainwaves
okay and you go to try and boost the
amplitude the size of those slow waves
on the sea of your brains cortex and by
boosting that quality of that deep sleep
what happens to memory so you're going
to be applying it during that deep
slow-wave sleep you're sort of singing
in time with the brain and there are two
groups in this experiment both groups
get all of the equipment applied to
their head one of them doesn't get any
stimulation during sleep however the
other does get stimulation and here's
how the experiment works here's the the
mock stimulation group sort of the
placebo as it were they're going to
study a whole list of facts before going
to bed
then you can briefly test them to see
what their attention is like then after
a night of sleep the next morning you
test them again to see how well their
brain has retained that information
following sleep in the other group the
experimental group this is where we're
going to stimulate the brain activity
we're going to juice it up and see if
you can sort of enhance it this is great
study done by a German group a few years
ago the question is what happens in
terms of the memory benefit well if you
look at the group that slept but didn't
get stimulation we see in the nice
normal memory retention benefit across
sleep replicating what we've seen many
times before in the group that gets the
stimulation you almost double the amount
of memory benefit that you get by way of
sleep a causal demonstration that when
you manipulate sleep you manipulate
memory one of the depressing things
however unfortunately is some evidence
that we recently published just a few
months ago looking at the interaction
between sleep and memory as you're
getting older which for me seems to be
rather rapid and what we know certainly
of course everyone knows is that as you
get older your capacity for learning and
memory starts to deteriorate but one of
the quintessential physiological
hallmarks of aging is that your sleep
starts to deteriorate and it's not all
types of sleep homogeneous lee some
types of sleep get hit by the aging
process far more severely than others
the type that get gets hit most severely
is that deep slow-wave sleep and so the
question was whether or not these fact
are simply co-occurring or actually
causally related in fact we demonstrated
that they are significantly interrelated
and this pernicious drop in deep sleeps
by over about 70% accurately accounts
for about 50% of the forgetting that
happens with age these are huge numbers
so there's a suggestion here that
disrupted sleep is an underappreciated
factor that may contribute to what we
call cognitive decline in aging the
exciting silver lining part to that
cloud however is that it's a potentially
treatable target so we're now trying to
see if we can use these types of methods
to restore some quality of sleep in
ageing and see if as a consequence we
can give back some memory function as it
happens it's not just sleep after
learning to strengthen individual
memories because we've been recently
finding that sleep can go far beyond
individual memory sleep can actually
seemingly cross-linked pieces of vast
sets of information and from that
abstract understanding and even develop
creative insights and ideas from that
information processing on mass let me
show you an example of this here in this
study you're going to be as the subject
performing what's called the numeric
number reduction task it's the type of
test that psychologists love to
administer and participants hate to
perform okay what you're going to do is
see lots and lots of these number
strings okay and you're going to have to
work through them to come up with a
final end solution now one way that you
can work through these problems is by
using some rules that I'll give you okay
so firstly what you can see is that
there are only three numbers here that
make up this string 1 4 &amp;amp; 9 and this is
comment not that the numbers are the
same but this notion that there's only
ever three numbers in a string set
that's common and here's what you're
going to do you're going to take the
first number compare it to the next
number and the first rule is this if
this number is the same as the next
number write down the very same number
which it is in this case a 1 now you've
got the 1 compare it to the next number
in line is it the same number
if it is write down the same number well
it's not and here's the second rule if
it's a different number write down the
only other remaining number in the
string which would be a nine so let's
repeat that again can take the nine
compared to a four same or different
it's different write down the only other
remaining number or one one to a nine
different write down four four to a four
it's the same number so write down the
same number four to a nine one one tuner
oh my goodness is it boring and
laborious now it turns out and via this
is exactly how the experiment works if
you paid attention to what I said I told
you one way to solve these problems is
by using those rules because it turns
out there's another way there is a
hidden rule there is a shortcut there's
a cheat and if you figure it out you can
blow through many more of these problems
and here's the cheat the second number
that you produce in the string is always
the final answer and so whilst this is
different across all the different
problems in terms of the number the
overarching rule the commonality across
this informational set is the same so
here's what we're going to do we're
going to expose a whole collection of
participants to these problems then 12
hours later you're going to bring them
back and expose them to some more
problems and at that 12 hour delay point
you then go to see what proportion of
those participants have developed
insight into that hidden rule half of
those participants are going to remain
awake across the day expose them to the
problems in the morning re expose them
in the evening the other half they're
exposed in the evening they reexpose in
the morning to the problems and
therefore they've had a full eight-hour
night of sleep in between so the brain
has had equal amounts of opportunity
time to distill that informational set
and see if we can find out the solution
the only difference is that one group
has had sleep the other hasn't I'm going
to put sort of wake and sleep
head-to-head in this Coke Pepsi
challenge to see which one wins out and
so here's our outcome metric the
proportion of participants in each of
those two groups that gained that
knowledge that creative insight in the
group that remained awake across the day
less than 25% of the
participants developed that hidden
insight knowledge what about the sleep
group worse the same better well of
course they were better but what was
shocking was how much better this was
how much better after sleep over 60% of
participants having slept developed
insight into that hidden rule and what
we've been finding what I should say is
it it's almost as though sleep there is
an algorithm in sleep
that takes vast informational sets and
starts to try and understand the
statistical regularities and the rules
of those math datasets huge distillation
it's collision of information creative
information processing and we're finding
that some not all but some of these
types of associative memory processing
occurs during rapid eye movement sleep
dreaming sleep and I believe that it's
probably not a coincidence that this is
the stage from which we dream if
dreaming is a reflection of whatever
information processing is going on with
the brain then it may be this hyper
sensitive hyper creative hyper
associative processing that's going on
that leads to these creative insights as
an aside many people when I present this
evidence of them will say well aren't
that those sort of creative genius types
in history who were supposed not to
sleep very much at one of them that's
often quoted to me is this gentleman
does anybody know who this is
Edison exactly what he's holding is a
bit of a giveaway brilliant man of
course supposed to be a short sleeper
now of course we'll never truly know if
he was a short sleeper or not but even
if he was a short sleeper it turns out
that Thomas Edison was a habitual NAPA
during the day here he is after a pretty
good garden party it looks like here he
is on his inventors bench taking a nap
in fact Edison understood the creative
brilliance of sleep and he used it as a
tool he's what he would do he would take
a metal saucepan like this behind him he
would turn it upside down and rest it
underneath the armrest of his chair then
he would take two steel ball bearings in
his hand rest the back of his arm on the
chair take a pad of paper and a pencil
put it next to him on his desk and then
slowly relax back and fall asleep
and so we didn't sleep too long what
would happen is that his muscle tone
would relax he would release the steel
ball bearings they would crash on the
saucepan underneath him wake him up and
then he would write down all of the
ideas that he was having from his sleep
isn't that brilliant
what a guy so no wonder you're never
told you should really stay awake on a
problem nobody tells you that instead
they tell you to sleep on a problem and
we're starting to find scientific
evidence that rigorously backs that up
it turns out and a friend and a
colleague told me this that this phrase
of sleeping on a problem seems to be
common in most all languages that he's
explored to date what that means is that
this phenomenon seems to transcend
cultural boundaries and I should also
note that it probably says a lot about
the difference between me as a as a
British gentleman and our arch rivals
the French because the French
translation it turns out of this
essentially is not sleeping on a problem
it's that you sleep with a problem okay
British you sleep on a Bravo French you
sleep with a problem and it turns out
that the politics the people in politics
reflect this if you look at the past
president Mr Sarkozy and mrs. Sarkozy
okay these are the press release
pictures that they offer you know she's
draped on a bed he's looking forlorn at
her okay
whereas the people in British politics
who did we have what we had Margaret
that Joey had sort of Tony blur you
sleep with a problem you sleep on a
problem okay I'll say say no more um
before I'm probably never gonna be able
to go back to the UK after that beyond
information-processing of which now
there is good evidence for in terms of
sleep dependency we're now starting to
realize there's another brain function
of sleep and that is in preparing the
emotional circuits of the brain offering
you stable mental health now I think
many of us have a sense that these two
factors of sleep and emotion interact in
some meaningful kind of way an example
would be a parent holding a child the
child is crying and they look at you and
they say well he just didn't sleep well
last night as if the
some universal parental knowledge that
bad sleep the night before equals bad
mood and emotion reactivity the next day
we also know clinically that these
factors interact in that Nelly all
psychiatric mood disorders display
co-occurring abnormalities of sleep in
fact these sleep abnormalities are so
prominent they form part of the
diagnostic criteria for those
psychiatric disorders but despite that
suggested interplay we've known
remarkably little about the basic brain
dynamics of this relationship and that's
something that we've also been testing
when you think you've got two factors
that are interacting one way to test
that interaction is to manipulate one of
the factors and then observe what
happens to the other so here we're going
to manipulate sleep and dial it down
again and block it with deprivation and
see if as a consequence we can trigger
an amplified emotional brain reaction as
a consequence so a very similar design
to one I showed you before a sleep group
in a deprivation group deprivation group
we keep awake but then the next day we
put them inside the MRI scanner and we
perform an emotional challenge task with
them and here we're going to show them a
series of standardized psychological
picture slides that range in a gradient
from being emotionally neutral to
increasingly negative and unpleasant and
I'm just showing you some examples here
they get far worse than this by the way
they get pretty gruesome I don't show
them it's probably reactive vomiting of
lunch in the front row but you get the
idea what we can then do is ask a very
simple question from our experiment what
in the brain shows increasing reactivity
in response to increasing emotional
negativity and the structure that we
were focusing on here was this structure
in the brain here in red it's a
structure called the amygdala it's
buried deep within your brain you have
one on the left on the right and it's
one of the centerpiece anatomical
features for emotion processing and
reactivity and when we looked at this
part of the brain in those people who'd
had a good night of sleep
there was a modest degree of reaction in
response to those negative experiences
so again similar view to that I
described previously you're looking into
the brain from the front top and bottom
left and right I'm circling the amygdala
for you here and these hotspots
demonstrate a modest reaction that's
what
you at once you don't want no reaction
you don't want too much in the group who
is sleep-deprived rather than seeing
impaired brain activity which is what
we'd seen with learning and memory when
it comes to emotion you see exactly the
opposite in fact here the emotional
brain was 60% more reactive in response
to those negative experiences compared
to when you'd had a good night of sleep
and you can see that more clearly if you
just focus in here for us the much more
interesting question though was why why
was your emotional brain so reactive
without sleep and we performed some
additional analyses and what we found is
that in those people who had had a good
night of sleep this part of the brain
here in green it's a part that we call
the frontal cortex and the middle part
of your frontal cortex at the frontal
cortex you can think of in terms of the
brains like the CEO of the brain it's
very good at making high-level executive
decisions top-down control by the way
this view it's as if now you're looking
from the side so this is the front of
the brain the back of the brain top and
base and with a night of sleep this part
of the frontal cortex was strongly
connected to the amygdala believed to
send inhibitory regulatory control so
with a night of sleep you had this nice
balanced mix between the emotional gas
pedal in the brake okay without sleep
unfortunately what we found is that
connection had been severed and as a
consequence you've got this amplified
almost Neanderthal like emotional
reaction as a consequence so now without
sleep it's as though you're all gas
pedal and no brake you're all amygdala
and too little frontal lobe controls it
were now I could go on and show you some
more bar graphs and MRI images to
illustrate these effects but I'm
actually going to let a sleep-deprived
subject do that for me because it turns
out that we do video diaries with our
sleep deprived participants throughout
the period and I think at this point we
may want to just close down their video
feed just to not present particular
people it's fine for the audience here
the case so in summary then in terms of
the talk an answer to the question why
does my brain sleep well it sleeps for a
whole constellation of different
functions plural it seems to promote
emotional regulation learning memory
creativity and I should also say that I
didn't mention anything about the body
but sleep has huge impacts on body
systems it's essential for metabolic
control cardiovascular health for your
immunity in fact there is not one single
tissue that we have yet to find that
isn't beneficially affected by sleep so
I think my advice would be that the
single most effective thing that you can
do each and every day to reset your
brain and body health is sleep and I
should finish that I should thank all of
my lab members I actually don't do any
hard work I just drink tea
I write lots of emails they do all of
the hard work and then I come and give
talks like this and pretend that their
data is my own it's not at all and I'm
immensely grateful for all of their
dedicated hard work and brilliance and
finally I noticed some of you stayed
awake during this talk so tonight after
all of this information I hope you sleep
well thanks very much indeed all right
matt has agreed to take some questions I
think we don't have them on the
microphone up so you heated or actually
we actually I'd like to welcome back
Sina come on up
Sina from strong solutions for those of
you who are at the sleep posing a few
weeks a few months ago now scene was the
MC back then and we're gonna welcome
back to MC again today so thank you
Chris and thank you all for joining us
so I would like to open it up to
questions yet please go ahead
so I'll just repeat the question real
quick about bimodal sleep and maybe
polyphasic sleep in any kind of
information on that so dr. Walker yes so
it's an interesting question there is
sort of this first sleep and second
sleep the evidence for that
I don't think yet is robust the idea
however that we should be sleeping by
physically rather than mono physically
what I mean by that is right now most of
us sleep mono physically one law
about during the night if you look at
some cultures that are not touched by
electricity by some of the devices of
Edison what you see is that they some of
them will sleep by physically they'll
sleep about six and a half hours at
night and then have that siesta like
afternoon nap and it turns out that if
you look at people's physiology and
their alertness physiology in the
afternoons right around this time now
there is a physiologically measurable
dip in your arouser
it's that sort of afternoon meeting
around the table and everyone's sort of
doing those those head there's really
ugly things they're not listening to
good music it's that they're falling
asleep and it's because of this drop
suggesting that in fact we may be
biologically pre-programmed to have this
sort of dip into that so I think right
now it's unclear what I do or what I can
tell you is that we have also found a
whole collection of brain benefits by
way of naps as well sometimes naps can
give as much benefit as a whole night of
sleep and it's not entirely clear why
next question yes please
so caffeine and sleeping pills dr.
Walker
yes Oh caffeine can certainly mask some
of the effects of sleepiness the way
caffeine works is that during the day
whilst you're awake a chemical built
your brain that chemical is called
adenosine adenosine is there to tell
your brain how long you've been awake
and when it gets stopped your critical
mass you start to feel sleepy that's how
it works
caffeine comes in and blocks the
receptors of adenosine and fools your
brain into thinking there is not as much
adenosine around anymore so you start to
become alert however caffeine can get
you around some of the the very
rudimentary impact of insufficiency like
reaction times for example you can speed
back up with caffeine to a degree for
these much more complex processes of
brain plasticity and emotional
regulation the caffeine doesn't seem to
be a sufficient substitute you can't get
over it with caffeine in terms of sleep
medications it's a great question
the older sleep medications what we used
to call the sedative hypnotics they
would certainly you weren't awake when
you took those medications that's for
sure that you were asleep is actually
very difficult to argue based on the
physiology of the brain wave patterns
essentially they just sedated you so the
naturalistic sleep was I think highly
arguable the more recent new to market
medications are producing what some have
argued is more naturalistic sleep but
it's still not necessarily purely
naturalistic some of those sleep
medications the common ones and I won't
describe it to your target particular
brand names but the common ones that are
prescribed right now they can impact the
ratio and the quality of your non REM
sleep so for example that you may not
get the depth of that deep sleep and
you've seen the benefit of that depth of
deep sleep it can change the quality and
when your REM sleep seems to arrive so
again I think thinking about those
medications as yes I slept eight hours
and yes you know I don't remember waking
up so I must have had a good night of
sleep that may be a fool's gold
question from BC do you have any data on
the amount of asleep needed to have
these functions be good or optimal to
literally sleep too much asleep
what's the boundaries yes it's a good
question about what is the optimal sweet
spot for sleep the answer that question
is a little difficult because it will be
different for every individual it's just
like giving a calorie recommendation I
can tell you that 2,000 calories a day
is about the right prescription for most
individuals based on but four different
people's physiology and their metabolic
demand some people will need more or
less and it's the same with sleep but
what we've been finding is that once you
start to get less than seven hours of
sleep you can observe measurable
impairments that one of the other
dangers of that is that your subjective
opinion of how you're doing with
insufficient sleep is a miserable
predictor of objectively how you
actually are doing when you've had
insufficient sleep so people will say no
I can survive fine on six hours we say
no I know that you think you can survive
fine but you can measure those changes
you can see those impairments and they
happen quite quickly one of the other
interesting question is is too much
sleep and there has been some evidence
in the literature that once you start to
get past nine or ten things like
mortality and morbidity at she's not to
go back up again in a way so it's sort
of like this this u-shaped function that
there's a sweet spot in the middle
around 8:00 and I think either side of
that maybe that's bad it's difficult
because if you look at some of that data
firstly it's not clear that it's just
people staying in bed longer from those
surveys rather than sleeping longer
secondly one of the other theories is
that sleep is so essential for your body
health that if you look those people who
are sleeping longer may actually be
people who are sick and the reason that
they're sleeping longer is to try and
the body is desperately trying to do
what it does very well to get them
better which is to sleep so I think some
of that evidence about what's called
hypersomnia sleeping too much is still
unclear it's not to say that too much
sleep can be a bad thing I think it
possibly could be just like too much
wake is a bad thing it's about a natural
balance between the two and it's about
one third to two thirds in terms of the
20
for our period so about eight hours is a
good sweet spot all the way in the back
there please so the question was about
the sleep spindle experiment and then
also light exposure yes so for that
stimulation experiment where they were
injecting the voltage yes you saw both
an increase in the quality of the deep
sleep and you can measure that quality
electrically and there was also an
increase in the amount of spindles that
went along with it
there weren't correlations reported
between those two but both of those
things the deep sleep and the spindles
were ratcheted up by that stimulation
light pulse frequency I don't know if
anyone's tried it yet but there was a
recent report that used auditory
stimulation rather than electrical
stimulation and they were able even able
to use a sub-threshold awakening
auditory stimulation to kind of almost
in train the brain into greater rhythmic
activity and increase the slow way of
sleep and as a consequence increase the
memory performance - and there's other
ways that you can do that - you can
during learning when you're awake
you can per the specific material with
certain perceptual cues like sounds or
smells like a rose odor
if you puff back up the nose during deep
sleep that same rose odor whilst they're
sleeping you reactivate the memories and
you boost the amount of consolidation
that you get it's lots of ways you can
manipulate it so I mean you know if you
want to burn your incense whilst you're
learning and then at night you know
blaze a few more up maybe that wood fire
hazard actually that's probably a very
don't do that sorry that's a stupid idea
anyway fascinating stuff next question
right here please
cognitive function exercise and sleep so
there the interaction triad that you're
speaking about there I don't know of any
evidence that people have done that
particular experiment but certainly the
first two factors is well known that
exercise will improve the quality of
your sleep it can increase the depth of
that deep sleep so the argument would be
that it should produce causal memory
benefits and you have to be a little bit
careful there's some argument that going
exercising too close to bedtime stops
you efficiently going to sleep the
reason is because for you to initiate
sleep your brain and your body have to
drop by about one degree Celsius in
terms of core temperature to initiate
that sleep that's why it's always easier
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold
than that's too hot and because of that
core increase due to the metabolic
expenditure from exercise you can
maintain that heat and you don't fall
asleep as well it's the reason by the
way that baths a warm bath works and
it's for the exact opposite reasons that
you think it works you have a bath you
feel are sort of I'm nice and warm and
cozy I'll get into bed and you fall
asleep more easily what happens is that
when you come out of the bath because
you've had what's called mass
vasodilation all of your capillaries
have sort of expanded to try and get the
heat out of your body then when you get
out you'll lose a massive amount of heat
you get far more heat expenditure that
heat expenditure helps you with that
initiation drop in your core body
temperature that's why you fall asleep
easier questions yes please that's a
wonderful question yeah the question was
is yawning contagious yes yawning is
contagious and you can even see cross
contagion across species contagion I'm
not kidding you people have have I don't
know if they've empirically studied but
there's good evidence that you know you
can be staring at your dog and you can
yawn and then what happens is that your
dog starts to your honor in addition so
that does seem to be and that seems to
be perhaps not necessarily related to
sleep but there's something called a
mirror system within the brain that the
brain seems to have this capacity to
understand and even mirror what's
other people it's that same reason that
if you see someone closing a door and
their fingers are going to get trapped
in the door you instantly go why did you
do that your hands not going to get
trapped in the door it's because you
have this mirror system it's a very
clever system in the brain it allows you
almost this sort of insight into how
other people are and that same system
can create these types of contagions and
yawning is one of them next question yes
please
so question was about marijuana and
sleep yeah it's a good question I've got
no idea obviously why you'd be asking
that and I I don't I don't know of good
evidence right now to examine the the
systemic changes on sleep and how it
influences things like learning and
memory and cognition it certainly does
seem to disrupt some features of sleep
there are some reports of alterations in
rapid eye movement sleep what I can
speak to much more so though is alcohol
which is far more frequently used
alcohol you're absolutely right it is a
potent suppressor of REM sleep and it's
one of the reasons that people will
describe to you saying well you know I'd
had a bit too much to drink and then I
was having these really strange dreams
the next morning here's how it works is
that when you have to it's actually not
alcohol it's the metabolic byproduct of
alcohol the aldehydes and the ketones
and they will suppress REM sleep so
you're going throughout the night and
you've got all of this drink in your
system in your liver in your kidneys are
desperately trying to metabolize it get
it out of the system and what's
happening is that you're not getting any
REM sleep because of the impairment but
your brain is clever it keeps a clock
counter of how much ramps that you
should have had and then when the
alcohol is finally washed out of the
system not only do you then have the REM
sleep that you were going to have you
also have that plus it tries to get back
some of the REM sleep that you missed
it's called a REM sleep rebound effect
as a consequence you get this really
intense REM sleep late morning with REM
intense sleep you get intense dreaming
that seems to explain why next question
yes please
so a follow-up question on the electro
simulation question and different
effects that might have yes so I don't
know yet of the electrical brain
stimulation and benefits downstairs sort
of South in the body but I can tell you
the inverse of that question which is if
you selectively deprive people of deep
sleep what are the body quant body
consequences and they are significant
you can manipulate and the way that you
do this as well as people are sleeping
you play them just sort of tones
annoying tones now the tones aren't
enough to make them fully wake up
because you dial the volume around but
it keeps them out of deep sleep and
keeps them in shallow sleep so you can
remove the anxiety of waking them up you
don't have to shake them or anything
it's a very clever manipulation where
you can selectively excise deep sleep
and as a consequence you can disrupt
metabolic regulation profoundly in fact
after a couple of nights of this your
capacity to regulate your basic body
glucose glucose look so severe that
you'd be classified as pre-diabetic and
you can do that even just with basic
sleep disruption if I take you for five
days and I let you only sleep for five
hours or four hours a night for five
days the same metabolic profile of sort
of diabetic like impairment happens you
can see the same with immunity if I do
the same thing if i short sleep you for
five days your body's capacity to create
an immune reaction to something like the
influenza A virus the flu jab is dropped
by 50%
your body's immunity is at half its
capacity to mount a response after short
sleeping so there are profound impacts
not just on the brain but deep within
the body by way of insufficient sleep or
even selective sleep disruption other
questions yes please
so the correlation between timing of
sleep and learning yeah it's a very good
question what we found for the most part
is that as long as you sleep with that
evening sometimes even learning earlier
during the day will still be retained
and saved and in some ways that makes
sense because you wouldn't want to
create a system of memory were only that
which you learned just in the few hours
before sleep was going to be retained by
sleep the sleep system seems to have a
capacity to absorb about 16 hours of the
day's duration
however if you don't sleep that night
after learning I can still give you then
I and then I don't test you the next day
I give you a recovery night of sleep on
the next night and even another recovery
night of sleep and then test you there
is no evidence of a memory consolidation
benefit in other words if you don't
sleep in the first 24 hours after
learning you lose the chance to
consolidate those memories so it is a
time sensitive feature but within the
natural boundaries of how we normally
should be waking and sleeping that seems
to be fine right here yes please
timing of sleep answered yes oh that's a
fantastic question I only know of one
study out there we didn't do this but
they looked at how regular irregular
your sleep was in terms of onset and
offset which is just what you're
describing there and they found that
perhaps even more strongly or as
strongly as ammount of sleep was the
instability of that sleep predicted
worst memory retention I believe it was
actually in a very prominent university
and one of the hardest exams for that
University which was organic chemistry
and they found that less so than the
lecture or the great lecture notes your
sleep stability was a very statistically
strong predictor of how you were going
to do on that exam I wish I would have
known that when I was taking okay yes
please
what state of sleep you wake up in and
alarm clocks that help ya again I don't
know of any systematic studies that have
tried to look at forced awakening by way
of an alarm clock versus naturalistic
the alarm clock from sort of an
anthropological perspective is a
fascinating thing if you again if you go
to cultures that are not touched by sort
of electrical means the notion of
ratcheting your brain out of sleep you
know non naturally is it's a very
strange one and it came by way of the
factory whistle I mean that was the
first alarm clock in a sense and so you
got standardized mass people movement so
certainly I don't think it's necessarily
a good thing to be setting an alarm
clock if you can do it naturalistically
your body has a pretty good clock
counter of what it needs and it will
wake up when it's time but I don't know
of any good evidence that tries to look
at those sort of clever clocks that seem
to essentially molitor your brain figure
out when the optimal sweet spot is base
it on the light time and I I haven't
seen many ambulatory devices like those
that are actually accurate for sleep
staging next question let's go with you
please
the question was about naps and studies
about them um yeah we just shout at them
go to sleep and no we um it turns out
that we time them two to co-occur with
that what it's called the postprandial
dip that drop in your physiological
alertness right around now in the
afternoon so you give them a meal you
put them to bed around this time and for
most young healthy people even though
we've standardized their sleep schedule
for five days before we've made sure
that they've been getting eight hours of
sleep or between seven and a half and
eight hours of sleep a night they still
seem to be able to initiate a nap it
takes them about 10 to 15 minutes to go
into that nap but once they're there
these are young healthy people by the
way I should say 18 to about 35 it seems
to be harder with aged to do those
things but you can seem to initiate that
sleep during the afternoon it's
obviously a lot harder if you place the
nap earlier in the morning they haven't
built up enough sleep pressure yet to go
back into sleep in other words they
haven't accumulated enough adenosine in
their brain to force them to go into
sleep around 6:00 p.m. you start to rise
back up again in your alertness after
that afternoon dip so it's actually
quite hard despite it being later in the
day to get people to nap then too so you
if you understand the biology you can
place the nap window of opportunity time
right where it sits and you can get
about an 85 percent hit rate in terms of
people falling asleep other questions
so coffee in the morning yep so it's
actually just a habit based I mean your
body doesn't need caffeine people who
are drinking caffeine before about
midday you're simply self-medicating
your lack of sufficient sleep so after a
while it becomes a psychologically
habituating effect if you start to have
decaffeinated and people don't tell you
apart from the headaches based on the
physiology that's built up you know the
notion of a warm drink can do it for you
it tells you it's habit based rather
than a physiological need so there it's
a misnomer that you need that if you do
need that you should probably be getting
more sleep a question here please
so I guess light sleepers and perception
versus reality yes so what we what we
know is that some of those other
electrical features of the brain
including the sleep spindles are not
just important for memory processing
sometimes they seem to respond to
external stimuli in your environments
and some people have argued that some of
those spindles they are slower frequency
spindles the faster frequency ones are
the ones that relate to memory the
slower frequency ones seem to be
relating to external noise and the
argument is that there is physiological
mechanisms in place that try to keep you
asleep but it turns out that depending
on the spindle quality that you have you
may be more or less susceptible to being
woken up by external noises and it seems
to be that that physiology can determine
whether or not you're a quote unquote
light sleeper versus a deep sleeper so
we haven't fully understood and
characterized that yet but there are a
few reports out there demonstrating that
electrical features of the sleeping
brain can determine how vulnerable or
resilient you are to the sort of
alerting waking up cues of external
sounds and stimuli so we can understand
that better we had one question over
here yes please so the question was
about duration of sleep and no I would
always recommend getting as much sleep
as you can possibly get it's not clear
exactly how those ninety minutes I
interact with each other to accumulate
and accommodate all of the different
brain and body demands that are going on
since we don't understand that algorithm
right now but what we certainly do
understand is that getting less than
sufficient sleep can cause impairments
it would be far better just to sleep as
long as you possibly can
yep I mean you have to remember that
human beings are one of the few species
that have decided to deliberately
deprive themselves of sleep rest of the
organism ik kingdom seems to be far
smarter than we are in terms of our
understanding of sleep so I would
definitely recommend get as much as you
possibly can yep good question I usually
say I sleep about eight hours whenever I
can which is never know I would I will
routinely get between about seven and a
half to eight hours of sleep if I get
less than seven hours I know it when
you're this type of a researcher you
become sort of like the Woody Allen
neurotic of the sleep world you know
both by way of I know I can observe all
of the impairments because I'm acutely
aware of them and worse still when I'm
in bed let's say I've kind of crossed
time zones and I've got all of those
problems you know I'm lying in bed and I
know all about the biology of what
should happen to initiate sleep so I'm
thinking my gamma core body temperature
is probably half a degree off I'm not
shutting down my dorsal lateral
prefrontal cortex the histamine in my
brain and at that point you're dead in
the water in the next hour you're gonna
ruminate so I wouldn't recommend you
stay with whatever job you're in as long
as it's not sleep research well said how
much time do we have
keep going okay over here please yes so
the question was how to deal with
daytime fatigue yeah I think the most
obvious question is start to get
sufficient sleep if that's routinely
happening if it's one it's if it's that
one-off circumstance certainly you can
have countermeasures so things like
caffeine can be somewhat effective in
terms of driving sort of if you start to
feel drowsy but drowsy driving for the
most part the recommendation is just get
off the road because what you can have
have during fatigue is what we call
micro sleeps and they can happen for
just a few seconds even less
where you just kind of zone out and you
come back and it turns out that it's 65
miles an hour you only need one of these
microsleeps
to go two lanes in the opposite left or
right direction so that may be the last
microsleep that you ever have so
caffeine can work to an extent if it's a
one-off and certainly if you can take
sleep have a short sleep period you have
to be a little bit careful after a nap
though because what happens upon waking
up from a nap or a normal night of sleep
is that you have something called sleep
inertia which is that it's just like the
car engine it takes a little bit of time
to warm up now it's not oil that needs
to warm up in terms of your brain of
course some parts of your brain come
back on lines more slowly than others
the frontal lobe in particular seems to
take a longer duration of time so in
other words if you do have a counter
active nap to overcome that tiredness
don't necessarily jump right back in the
car wake up and start driving again go
grab a coffee and then sort of give
yourself 15 or 20 minutes to wake up
then start doing those types of
activities yeah question let's go with
on the back there please question was
what's a good length for a nap the
answer really depends on what you want
out of it if you want to just restore
your basic level of alertness 15 20
minutes that that can have potential
benefits for things like learning in
memory it seems as though you need to go
longer depending on what type of
learning and memory information that
you're trying to get a benefit from for
emotional brain regulation what we're
finding there is that rapid eye movement
sleep again comes into play dream sleep
and we've been finding that for those
emotional regulation benefits from a nap
you need to go along to get that REM
sleep which comes at the end of the
cycle so it's not a simple answer it
really depends on what you're trying to
self medicate in terms of a functional
benefit from that nap question right
here please
so melatonin and sleep so there is
evidence I think the evidence right out
there now suggests that melatonin
doesn't necessarily affect the duration
of your sleep nor the quality of your
sleep
what melatonin does is help with the
regulation of initiation of sleep so the
timing of sleep not the duration or the
quality of sleep melatonin is a
naturally released hormone within the
body it's called the hormone of darkness
not because it looks just you know great
in you know
badass sort of thing it's a it's because
it's released at nighttime it and it
tells your brain that it is nighttime it
tells the brain and the body that this
is the time to sleep so that's why it's
efficacious when you travel through time
zones because now there's a mismatch
between your biological clock and the
time zone and so whilst your biological
clock is still saying it's 4:00 in the
afternoon you know in the new time zone
it's midnight and so if you take
melatonin a little bit before sleep
onset then your brain is fooled into no
longer thinking it's sort of 4:00 p.m.
in the afternoon but it's oh my goodness
it's right now it must now be midnight
and that can help the initiation of
sleep but it is I think the evidence is
pretty robust now not the duration or
the quality let's go with somebody we
haven't had yet yes please so the
question was about elderly people and
sleep and kind of what can be done to
remedy or address it yes sir certainly
the electrical brain stimulation is one
of those that were were starting to try
and implement now obviously it's
probably not a population wise
therapeutic device sort of more
generally I think first thing we need to
demonstrate that by restoring that sleep
we can get the memory benefit if we can
then I think there's a lots of other
ways that you can do it exercise is one
of them one of the the types of sleep
that exercise will enhance when you do
get it as long as the exercise isn't to
close is deep slow-wave sleep you can
also there is pharmacology of course
although you have to be a bit careful
with pharmacology because it tends to be
systemic and it tends to have a variety
of other effects but there are drugs out
there on the market that seemed to
increase the what looks like the depth
of that deep sleep
I think there are a variety of
pharmacological electrical non
behavioral techniques that you can use
and some combination or all of those may
be useful long term depending on how the
technology could be distributed at a
population level yep
question over here please yes so the
question was sort of about the pattern
of maybe the sleep/wake cycle if I can
summarize yes oh it's a fascinating
still within the field philosophical
rather than sort of scientifically
addressed question right now which is
why would you lose consciousness it's
not the energy saving so it turns out
that if you were to just lie on your
couch couch potato like even with your
eyelids closed but remain awake the
caloric difference between sort of that
and falling asleep is only about the
calorie savings of a slice of brown
bread my point being is that it's that
seems to be a total totally inefficient
benefit for losing consciousness and
falling prey to all of the dangers that
happen like that why wouldn't you just
go out and Club another seal and have
more food you know and and save back
that sort of get back that energy and
not have to lose consciousness by way of
this thing that we that we call sleep in
terms of a process that evolved so
clearly what seems to be essential one
of the things that seems to be essential
is disengaging with the outside
informational perceptual world don't
forget though that the perceptual
information processing world does
reoccur during sleep during this thing
that we call REM sleep which is dreaming
but one of the potential benefits of
going offline is that the processing
cognitively of information that happens
either when you're awake with your eyes
shut
versus the non conscious state of the
deep non REM sleep that may be required
for this type of offline information
processing because otherwise you get
information interference you get cross
wiring of those combating information
streams and you can't effectively do
what the sleeping brain seems to do
that's one possibility I still think
it's a huge mystery though as to why
it's
seems so counterintuitive you know
you're not finding a mate you're not
socially interacting you're not getting
food all of these things would suggest
sleep is a bad idea
yet it's it's universal it seems reminds
me of a quote I heard you mention in
another talk if sleep wasn't the if
sleepy if it wasn't necessary was the
greatest mistake of evolution something
to that effect another question yes
please go ahead yeah so naps and
interfering with regularly yes so when
it comes back to naps we come back to
the adenosine story again so as I
described to you adenosine starts to
build up in this time-dependent fashion
in the day when you sleep what happens
it's like a pressure cooker building up
with steam when you sleep you dissipate
that pressure you remove the adenosine
so you come back down to your baseline
level again that's why if you've had
enough sleep you wake up feeling alert
or you should be what happens with the
naps and naps can be a double-edged
sword
if you sleep too long or you have them
too late in the day is that you're
building up that adenosine pressure that
will make you go to sleep in a healthy
manner at night you have a nap and the
nap removed opens the valve and you
dissipate some of that sleep pressure
some of it not all of it but some of it
and now you wake up and you feel more
alert again and it takes you longer to
get back to that point of feeling sleepy
again that evening then it would have if
you had not taken the nap and so in
other words you then start to think well
you know it's 11:00 midnight well I'm
not sleepy I normally am and the reason
is because you haven't taken the nap
during the day but because you have just
recently that has removed some of that
petit pressure so you're no longer as
sleepy anymore
at that time of day so you have to be a
bit careful with naps because they will
take away some of that urge to sleep and
that's presumably why exactly that
happens that you described
no I think the idea would be that if
your only question was which you sort of
habituate to the naps the idea would be
if you're taking those naps essentially
you can think of it like absorbing some
of the eight-hour quota that you're
having and so it may be that you would
then be going to bed later but you would
sleep a shorter amount and wake up the
next day so I think this and it depends
on the evidence that you look at but
there's some argument that as long as
you're getting that eight hours and to a
degree that's not too bad in that
biphasic manner i think highly
polyphasic sleep however that is
somewhat of a trend now instead of
sleeping ninety minutes being awake then
another two hours and all of this so
that doesn't seem to work be the way
that the biology is programmed within
adult humans it was the way in which you
were programmed when you were a small
infant though infants are highly
polyphasic in their sleep they will be
asleep for short periods than awake
sleep and parents know this
unfortunately to their detriment but
once you get into adulthood the pattern
stabilizes certainly into a biphasic
perhaps monophasic so yep other
questions yes please so the question was
about new parents and sleep deprivation
yeah I hear that a lot I did survive and
you know if that's your basal level of
success it saves so much we there is no
good knowledge right now that human
beings have any kind of learned ability
to overcome sleep deprivation you hear
this a lot in some of these sort of
heroic professions medicine is a good
one sort of that old boys network notion
that well you know it takes a special
person one who can learn to deal with C
deprivation you have to realize that
again human beings the few sort of set
of species that do go into sleep
deprivation there's no way that within a
short lifetime of an individual you can
learn to adopt to millions of years of
evolution that have put this thing in
place called sleep and it's never faced
the evolutionary challenge of having to
deal with a lack of sleep because it's
it's not common and so this idea this
this misplaced idea that you can sort of
learn to cope with it all that there is
a biological
safety net that you can invoke at
certain times it doesn't seem to be
necessarily true however there are some
exceptions there are some interesting
scenarios were some species for a
certain duration of the cycle will
undergo sleep deprivation one of which
is migrating birds and there is a
particular migrating bird that during
that period of migration seems to be
somewhat resistant to the effects of
insufficient sleep yet out of that phase
of the migration it is susceptible to
the sleep deprivation and that's
fascinating because it tells us that
maybe there are some biological
mechanisms that can offer some
resilience for a short period of time
turns out the military were fascinated
by it they're very interested in funding
that work to figure out obviously you
know 24 hour soldier so but for the most
part I don't that there is some good
evidence that people or others anything
like you know some breast feeding or
nursing or any circumstance that seems
to co-opt and invoke invoke resilience
to the impact of sleep deprivation
question in the back so the question was
about gadgets including the Zeo and then
also about sort of self treatment or
maybe Auto titration that type of thing
yes so since I'm I'm not a clinician an
MD I I can't really give too many
recommendations about the apnea stuff
but certainly in terms of the Zeo there
have been some empirical data put out
there that suggests that it may have a
somewhat good degree of correlation
between the gold standard of in lab
electrodes validated sleep staging
relative to its algorithm of sleep
staging it tends to be able to simply
quantify light sleep deep sleep and then
arguably dream sleep REM sleep however
if you look around for example if you
just gone to Amazon and you look at the
user reviews some people are saying well
right now I'm looking at my Zeo and I'm
awake and I'm looking at the clock and
it's saying I'm in REM sleep what's
going on and I I don't believe that
they're having a hallucination whilst
they're dreaming I
that's probably real so I think those
algorithms have got a way to go before
they reach that and I don't think
they're you know they're valid yet as a
strong at least experimental tool and I
think zero is actually unfortunate just
gone out of business other questions yes
sir over here please
that's a great question I have the same
question myself the question was about
kind of upcoming research and things
that might be on the horizon yeah well
not wanting to give away too many of our
recent research goals and secrets but I
think certainly one of the areas is in
this area of sleep in the lifespan so
firstly looking at the aging issue not
just in aging but now into dementia we
know that the pathology of things like
Alzheimer's disease hits very
perniciously
the centers in the brain that regulate
and generate that deep sleep so starting
to really understand translationally
what all of this basic science means for
things like clinical disorders such as
Alzheimer's disease I think is going to
be critical also that role of sleep in
emotional brain regulation I think is
going to just explode in terms of a
field and its core relevance will be in
this selection of psychiatric disorders
that suffer co-occurring impairments of
sleep I think sleep has a huge story to
tell in psychiatry and I think that
story right now has not been told in
part because people like me haven't been
doing the enough basic research I think
we're starting to get to the stage where
we've understood it enough where we can
make that translational leap
I think psychiatry is often thought that
sleep disruption was simply you know a
side product of the psychiatric disorder
you could flip that question around and
asked you know is the sleep disruption
contributing or causing the psychiatric
disorder that's a tenable hypothesis
ultimately I think it's going to be
neither one of those biology tends to
never be you need erection it tends to
be bi-directional is the flow of traffic
going more strongly in one way of the
street than another that's possible
so I think the whole translation of this
basic understanding of what sleep is
doing is going to be big in terms of
clinical medicine soon also reverse
the time clock back into development
some of the greatest changes in our
sleep happen within the first two years
of life and then after that right into
adolescence if sleep is regulating all
of these functions they're also
functions that showed demonstrable
changes in those developmental phases
learning memory plasticity baby starting
to understand what the rules of this
thing that we call the world that we
live in are it turns out that if you
give infants naps they can start to
abstract rules even before they can
speak you can see it in their behavior
sleep promoting creativity so I think
though that understanding because
developmental changes and developmental
disorders also co-occur with some sleep
abnormalities so I think there's a lot I
think other interactions are also going
to be with genetics I think we're
starting to understand that different
genetic compositions have a lot to tell
us about the impact of sleep and sleep
deprivation it being one genetic flavor
does that mean that you're resilient
versus another that means that you're
vulnerable what does that mean ethically
for professions if we've got a number of
professions that we know of where sleep
deprivation is rife should we be
interviewing them and then doing a
genetic test if we find that type of
evidence so I think there's fascinating
possibilities but I think the cool one
is that this is one of the last great
scientific mysteries of why we sleep you
spend a third of your life doing it and
people like me doctors and scientists I
can't give you a satisfying consensus
answer I mean that just blows my mind
despite all of the advances in molecular
biology we don't have an answer and
imagine that when you know as a parent
your first child is born and the doctor
walks in and says congratulations
everything looks great it's a healthy
boy or a girl you know all the tests
look good and they smile in that
reassuring way and they start to walk
away and before they get to the door
they say there is just one thing
routinely from this point forward and
for the rest of your child's life they
will lapse into a state that looks like
non consciousness in fact it looks not
dissimilar to death but don't worry it's
reversible and they will do that
fulfilling approximate
one third of their entire life they will
have hallucinogenic bizarre experiences
and I don't know why good luck I mean at
that point you'd say you know that can't
be true I'm sorry that's silly
that's what sleep is so beyond all of
the translational big-picture stuff I
think we still have to come back to
answering that question why do we sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
