session on flowing content into layout
I'm the chair for this session Steve sim
ski if you don't know me many of you do
the author that's here will also be
quite familiar to most of you unless
you've only been to the prior event in
Sao Paulo in which case his paper was
presented by yours truly and definitely
a step down but we get the step back up
again this year as Fabio is going to
present to a pageant dynamic and web
content which focuses on dynamic reef
lowing which will be a theme throughout
this session love you thank you thank
you so I'll download the paper first of
all why we want to paginate web content
for web content I mean documents there
are sent through the web where they are
in xml content and i'm going to go
through and see how this could be done
using an extension of the gala concert
are introduced what the galley is and
when the galley model is built now we
are the possibility to address areas of
documents in reflow ball documents the
usual are not rest able by the current
techniques and technologies and then a
little bit more about well now we have a
layout we can paginate we can flow about
how we can create the sequence of pages
based on the amount of content and I
will show how current technology like
xsl-fo can come to the rescue and LP and
solve them and the final part is now
that we have all this technology is it
possible to leverage it for a broader
set of documents and not only XML or
HTML document and how this could be
interacting with the devices and the
deliverable mechanism so first of all
why we bother about paginate in content
first of all the designer which design
content and web documents has only the
possibility of designing for certain
class device and this was you know
discussed in the keynote of yesterday
and pagination also is an aspect that is
related only to certain devices so
clearly printers require a genetic
content
other device may not need so but if we
extend the set of devices the user want
to use and this is a trend which is a
marriage we have so many other devices
now that we can use compare the past
like you know internet-enabled
televisions you know smartphones tablets
and you name it sometime there could be
an interesting IV imaginated content
even on these devices because it is
easier to browse it is easier to go
through it and is more convenient for
the user is all about user experience
and of course the designer is what
really is looking is at making the best
usage of the document structure and the
presentation aspect to make the user
have the best experience out of it so
one aspect is the device explosion so
designers are facing tons of device they
can not handle all of the different
nuances and and and platforms the second
aspect is that users also can start to
have a different interaction of with
with these devices and definitely a
designer cannot predict the way the user
will use these devices in in conjunction
so definitely printing from any of the
devices that we currently have at our
disposal we require pagination but as I
said before maybe sending document to a
larger state like a television screen
from our handle devices may require
pagination when we are using these
devices as a remote control it's easier
to go through or use a remote control
like you know previous page next page
then having to have a mouse or keyboard
or any of the other stuff so pagination
is becoming more relevant even if when
we are connecting devices and using
device in different in different earths
solutions so the other aspect is
designer wants to make sure that the
design is providing the best experience
possible for a user so a document like
this which is a relatively simple there
is a
a pizza some text and footnotes will be
presented like this one is rendered on a
page a designer will typically design
these as three areas header a body and a
footnote and if you take a designer
designed is seen in you know three
visually driven tools like indesign or
quarkxpress then we'll generate areas
for each of these element and i will
make sure that the content is correctly
positioned and everything like that but
what happened if i have tools that is
semi automated so it takes the content
and then it flows it across several page
they cannot predict when there are
footnotes i cannot predict any of this
so tools like text and accessory for any
engines will allow you to identify areas
that are growing as needed and those are
called usually golly so the size of it
is now prefixed is on demand will appear
whatever is necessary and it will
definitely there will be rules of you
know how much you can grow based on
where the references or anchor our
position in the content and the content
that goes and flow in those footnote are
usually called out of flow content
because they are generated within the
flow they have a flow anchor point but
they don't recede into the main flow
they are placed in a region that is
outside the flow itself and so if you go
to something more complicated like this
let's say have a typical spread of a
book or a magazine I have two sides I
have some footnotes in an area and I
have side notes it's another interesting
case a desire again will design in a
static layout environment every single
area as a separate one and then it will
make sure the content floats correctly
but again if I do automate this with the
galley model then I will have these
elements within those regions to be a
garland as you can see the one on the
left the body on the Left basically has
a galley which is reduced to zero
because no footnotes happen to a
in the particular part of the document
in xsl-fo text and other languages the
galleys are always usually implicit so
the i define concept of footnote side
notes floats and all this kind of stuff
but I don't specify them in the layout I
have no way of directing position in
them a reference in the layout so the
approach introduced here is to allow a
designer to actually specify the
existence of those galleys and named
them so in consider in the previous
example we're going to have in this case
two regions but then the user the
designer can design gully so you can say
I counted galley is a portion of the
body region which is let's say seventy
eighty five percent of it and you see
the there is a I use a stocky mechanics
top to bottom or left to right for
creating and combining the different
galleries so the font the footnotes re
can be expressed using a rapper I can
have an extent is variable so then I
have a gap which I used separate my main
content from my footnotes and then I
have a food to not golly and I in this
example I use ten percent for the gap
and ninety percent for whatever the
futon zones but also i can say that my
golly can expand and i can now think
what is the maximum expansion so i can
control not the only based on rule so
where the links or the or the anchor
appears but also i can use these to say
well i don't care how much fruit enough
content you will have in that page I
don't want to get more than fifty
percent of the available space and this
is really to control the statics
designer will do that in a static
environment static layout to make sure
that the document is going to look good
we're in a dynamic or dynamically
generate document usually they have no
control over it beside keeping
strategies breaking strategies and stuff
like that
now that this has been introduced we can
do fairly sophisticated layouts for
instance we can also use this to
generate quotes there could be pull pull
quotes or side notes we can have columns
and we can have columns Raptor and gaps
and so we can create documents they are
fairly sophisticated so you see I
created a document which has basically
four columns as gaps between the
different columns and then has subgroups
with the Riddler relative footnotes so
this is a very sophisticated design the
designers are used to deal with but when
it gets automated or or dynamic it
becomes fairly sophisticated and
especially controlling for instance
things like where the footnotes goes on
all these different columns is a fairly
sophisticated us to achieve so now that
we are able to point to our gallery so
we have a way of constructed document
where dollies are explicit we can start
to think about okay now i can reference
them and i can point some of the content
especially the out of the floor content
that i have in my documents to some
specific galleys so in a way i can
control where things are going and in
which way those are showing my document
so let's start with something simple
like the previous example we have a
footnote galley with the ball of the of
the document which is our content area
and we have a side note and two gaps a
footnote gaps and M stand for medina is
another name of cold side notes so first
of all I have some main content that I
want to flow so that will go probably
within my content area but then whenever
there are out of flow footnotes
happening within my content I want them
to be redirected to my footnote element
saying for the side note anytime there
is a sign on I want that to be referred
to the side note area so how to do that
the idea is to generate a separate
representation for the mapping strategy
so the
map will be a part of the document a
completely separate from our pagination
description which I show before and it
will allow me to specify what goes where
and the concept of role is that will be
based on what the out of flow or flow
role I want to assign to them it's very
simple so let's start with a simpler
concept the main flow and are gonna have
a role with sense content and it says I
take whatever you are I i want and i put
it to a destination which is my godly
associate evaluated and then i keep
going and produce other assignment now
that all can be footnote for instance
and the content godly will be my suits
and the destination would be my other
galley which is the footnote Valley and
I can do the same with the side notes
and so on and so forth so now I can
build a set of assignments which
determine what type of content what type
of role in or out of flow and where is
generated and where the content should
be redirected this is very similar for
people are familiar with xsl-fo this is
the actual folder is a flow map the
difference is that the flow map in
xsl-fo doesn't have any concept of role
so I've been working on Excel for for
many years now and part of this is
becoming a proposal for xsl-fo 2.0 but
what I realize is that using this kind
of technique with rods can broaden up
the the aspect from just being a father
even to more generic approach and again
another interesting thing is that now
using the same simple way of expressing
thing I can obtain fairly sophisticated
things for instance that's my main flow
what I want I want the floor to go from
the first column to the second column
and then third and fourth columns of
flow throughout the document that's
pretty straightforward I have whenever
my companies and I can / I can also have
many sources so I can I could have like
5 6 10 sources there will be around
in sequence okay and so in the same way
the destination is taken in sequence so
they will go from one to the other and
so on and so forth but then i have my
out of flow content like footnotes so in
the case of the footnotes if they happen
to be on the first part of the page in
the first two columns what i usually
want to do is that I want them to appear
in the footnote area that belongs to
that two columns but if they overflow I
want them to move into the V area
because I naturally they belong they
pertain to the same page so in order to
do that I create a new assignment where
now the sources of my out of flow
content are the two columns and then
they will move into footnote AF would
not be similarly following the rule of
the content right flowing between the
two but when I go to the column free and
fold oh I don't want them to go back to
footer on a of course I want them to be
fixed and just be a render that within
that would not be so if if the document
like this gets only a reference in the
column three you will see the footnote
area a it doesn't exist and a footnote a
derby will appear with the footnote
which again I said in the dynamic
document environment is now that trivial
and the other aspect is quotes quotes
now I have a single area for the code so
whatever the course happened i don't
care column one column two or four they
will all go to my quotes area so so far
so good that's pretty simple and the
other interesting aspect that now
because I have elevated galleys to a
first class citizen even gaps which are
usually spacer that the engine will put
two separate the generation of the
galleys are directly referable which
allows me to pull content into it which
is particularly interesting because I
can you know instead of having just a
built-in cruel or line to separate my
footnotes or to separate the columns I
can put in for instance SVG I can have
decorations I kept patterns I can have
anything I want it would Billy Billy be
like content and I can refer it to the
to my gaps and in that way they can be
assigned and as you see i use a
declaration roll so the other point is
this the wrong names are really user
dependent and user-defined everybody
could define their own defining them
using a standard way doe will provide me
advantage that i will introduce later if
i can find a common name or a namespace
they are common will allow me to do some
interesting modifications to the
document and reap alginate them a reflow
them accordingly but nothing stops me to
say to generate galleys and assign
content role that I invented examples
figures you name it so what about
pagination influence so now we go these
pages we got the gullies design in it
and everything applied but how the
content actually get generated and how
they determine how many pages to a half
and now I figure it out how many how the
page are the content that ends in page
one will be rendering a further page and
linked automatically to whatever my page
and valet model will be so xsl-fo comes
to the rescue in this respect ur so
xsl-fo is a pretty extensive way of
doing pagination and so let's say I have
designed two pages odd page and an even
page so for simplicity here I just
contracted the expression of these pages
where would be a little bit too long but
I have a page master I have a region and
then I have a certain galleys inside and
then you can imagine how I have designed
those godless so once I have these two
pages I can simply generate a role map
for it and just for now focusing on the
content aspect of it so how the country
will move from one another and then i
use the FO description of Pagemaster
sequencing and in this case I want to
have a master alternatives i want to
have even an odd pages okay
and so the condition is when the page is
either odd or even you use one or the
other and the other thing is that I have
a repeatable page secret master so this
will be repeated until the content is
exhausted when I finish the content I we
stop paginate so the way works is that
the main flow will be assigned to the
odd or the odd page in the safe page one
will be the first one to start so my
role map will actually say that the
content is to go from column 1 2 column
2 so I will do exactly that but when I
finish here then the fact that I have an
even page because my page counting would
be to it will say oh you need to go to
the event page now and render there so
the layout of the event page will be
considered out instead of the Caillat
out to the odd page but the flow map the
road map is exactly the same and so what
I'm going to do I will continue on
column one from column two and then
again column 1 2 column 2 and when I
ended up here the next page is again an
odd page and the role map still the same
so I go back and I continue on color one
and i will continue indefinitely because
i have my repeatable point indefinitely
until i have content to render so this
is the way xsl-fo pagination works and
it can be applied as you can see to any
document really i can define a
description of this type
so now that we explored all of this the
other interesting outcome is that a
designer could focus on designing a
document using the pagination and a
roadmap now if a designer wants to take
into account designing for a particular
format or device can describe the
document and both the pagination and the
role map if the designer does so she
will be able to design a document that
fits a particular class of devices I say
in class because as you see as you have
seen from the examples I can always
refer to my sizes on percentages or
relative sizes to the outer container so
if the design if the layout of the
document is preset and the device size
variation is not that great the document
will adjust itself relatively nicely so
the overall user experience will be
maintained I will be fairly good but
this we require the design to do quite a
lot of work and the problem is that as
soon as the user decides to move to a
different device or decides to do
something different print on even
printing on different page size or
different pages orientations like
portrait landscape that design may not
work well anymore and yes scaling is an
option and all of this but it's not that
is definitely not bringing the the best
possible user experience what if now the
designer instead instead of providing
the pagination model and the page layout
for the paginate 'add content just stops
at the role map and use the roadmap as
an intent so what the designer does says
okay I am gonna tell you what my content
and out of flow content should go and
then when you decide on what device you
want to print or web page format or what
rotation you want to do you're gonna
find a suitable design
it matches best as possible my role
mapping tent and so then the device the
printer the browser the rendering engine
they will in fear the pagination from
this roadmap and finally they will
override both produ providing a
pagination that is suitable and override
a role map overriding the roadmap means
making the role map compatible to
whatever the designer has expressed as
an intent and so to give an example for
instance let's say my designer has
created a document and then that is the
intent she created so she originally
wanted to have the four columns document
she wanted the footnotes on on the first
two columns on the left side and then
the two on the right side so when I try
to create a pagination out of it all of
these for instance are valid pagination
they can derive from being ten because
they both have four columns they both
have footnotes areas a and B and so on
but you see the column sizes can be
different the footnotes limits can be
different all of those are valid because
they are compatible or whatever they're
all mapper told tells me to but let's go
to a more realistic example so the
designer has generated this and deliver
this document these devices are let's
say is a landscape device what we do is
considering the sides it has it cannot
render in four columns because it will
be really inconvenient for the user to
read so he decided that the layout which
is appropriate for a multi-column and is
the two column one no more than two
columns and this could be done by
dynamically generating the layout or
picking up from a library of pre-built
the layout or designs they've been
available for the particular browser or
device or or printer and so now we have
these two columns to footnotes areas
document which per page and let's say
the pagination is simple just repeat
this until I ended up
my content so what the overridden
roadmap would be would be to simplify
the whole map removing the several
columns to the two columns and
maintaining the footnote areas it was
now because all of this is expressed in
the roadmap and not in the content I'm
not going to change any of the content
at all I'm completely adjusted to
whatever was the content that was
reference from those your eyes and the
wrangling energy will take their produce
the two columns bring in the content
whatever the footnotes will happen will
place the food plots in there there are
a limitation of course if you're in for
instance your gap was designed using an
SVG there was for a very large document
and you haven't made it scalable or you
haven't made it like the picture this
may not work but in general if the
document is designed with the idea that
can be delivered to several devices this
this model should work fairly well and
again the user experience will be I have
a multi-column document is tailored for
my landscape view and is pretty much
consistent to a four column document
that I could have seen if I had a larger
device so the designer wish or intent
has been preserved as much as possible
it's definitely better than an something
mangle into a single area with no food
to notes or the footnotes embedded into
the text or whatever and now let's go to
a river more extreme I have very tiny
device and I can only present it on
portrait so again the device can only
present one single column doesn't have
the way of presenting multiple call
because if he does so it will become
knowledgeable and the the pagination
that is prepared resented here is fairly
simple but again at least preserve the
wish of maintaining a food not
representation and the ovary the roadmap
is extremely trivial now we
because i only have you know account
that goes in at one column and then i
have a representation a column that goes
to i a lot so conclusions first
of all separating the pagination
concerns and a page sequences concern
from the role map give my flexibility
and the possibility of interchanging
those without having to touch and
consider the content at all the second
thing is that my role map now carries a
constant of intent that wasn't available
before and devices browsers can try to
interpret their intent in theory what
type of layout is the best suitable
creating it selecting from a library
applying any techniques and not
discussing what smart they can be in
achieve that and once they decided what
to do is very easy for this device to
override the role map because they can
just refer to same thing is this part is
where I was talking before that does
require to have a sort of
standardization on the nomenclature
otherwise I won't find whatever is you
call ABC into any of the templates I may
have and that's it thank you
be shy no questions Bobby I have a
couple for you actually answered the
want one that I was going to ask on the
left side but I'll ask it anyway to see
what the limits are I was looking at how
dynamic the layouts are two
contradictions so if you've got float
text that is not going to be possible
and fit into one of the columns and it
seems like in that case you would
divided up into a single column do you
have intelligence in there there would
that knows how to correspond images that
won't fit into the bride Elliot's right
so this is this would be is something
that will be handle at the composition
engine so what does it mean is that the
device has chosen a layout which cannot
feed the content and what is going to
happen is that there could be two things
the overflow will force it to bring a
simple layout in or modify the existing
one to accommodate the content so the
marginalia area for instance can be
reduced or removed and/or can be
changing with input float or something
that allows me the other content to be
float around instead of taking the
entire site but but again this is at the
rendering engine so I will discover this
when i'm trying to paginate and if i
cannot i can go back step back and say
ok this page model doesn't work for the
Conclave I need to switch and select
another one right ok so then the other
one for me would be what are the
limitations for your model to bring in
say in the statics engine at the front
end that derives content how because I
saw that you had some flexible building
the designs how are you matching those
or making those that most closely fit to
the aesthetics that we're defined by the
design so this is as you seen this is a
fairly loose coupling right the designer
the designer can define everything and
design a page and the role map and
everything and if it does so it will get
exactly you know similar to current
tools actually even more complicated
layout closer to the static layout
designs but if if the designer has no
idea of the device set is going to go
the the ability that she has now is to
create a role map they use the standard
potential Stan
they don't exist yet but potentially
standard notations or naming conventions
that will allow at least the content to
float in the right place one interesting
example there is all this proliferation
of you know print page on in HTML I go
to a separate link and again Paige does
have all the clutter of banners and
navigation which kind of stuff the
desire could with the role intent
basically express what content goes to a
paginate it printed material and the
role map will allow me already to
automatically remove all the clutter
because I won't have there into the
content that I floating to my page in
the first place and so if I select
subset of the page I gonna use I don't
need as a designer to create a yet
another HTML page or having another CSS
styling that goes and remove all the DS
and hide all the leaves and all the
stuff de la gonna be used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
