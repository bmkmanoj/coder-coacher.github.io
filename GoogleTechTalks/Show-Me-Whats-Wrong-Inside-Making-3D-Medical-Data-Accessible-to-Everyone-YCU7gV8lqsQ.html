banks who is a member of the Joint
Institute for computational Sciences
which is shared between Oak Ridge
National Labs and the University of
Tennessee he also spent a year as a
visiting professor of radiology at
Harvard Medical School
working on tools for visualization of 3d
MRI of the brain thank you so the title
of my talk is show me what's wrong
inside making 3d medical data accessible
to everyone and it's motivated by the
following question which is what will
happen when people routinely put their
3d medical scans on the web and the
outline of the talk goes like this I'll
show you briefly some of the work in our
lab I'll give you a 2d example of India
of my imagined scenario I'll make an
analogy with hurricane forecasting I'll
show you a 3d example so some of the
work in our lab includes simulating
motion of the skeleton this is a project
by a student joseph Colusa together with
andy payer from national library of
medicine to develop an interactive tool
to let let you manipulate joints in a
skeletal model here's an example of a
visualization of microscopy data so the
way this works is that my colleagues
prepared a tissue from the hippocampus
of a mouse and put it on the stage of a
confocal microscope I went a great
effort to keep that tissue alive while
it was being repeatedly scanned over the
course of about an hour so the scans are
roughly 6 minutes apart in time and
after registering the 3d scans and
producing surface representations of the
membranes of the neurons we can produce
images like this one you can see
individual dendrites one of them is
labeled these are the vertical
structures the long thin
twigs and on their sides you can see
spines so these are dendritic spines
which are forming synapses with other
dendrites not seen because not every
neuron was labeled fluorescently and
there's this little interesting feature
sticking out here which is called a
Phillip odium and it means it makes a
transient appearance during the
hour-long time series microscopy of this
of this mouse neuron we were interested
in showing the time varying nature of
this short-lived process you can see it
budding out from these small bumps on
the appearing on the side of the spine
of the dendrite evidently this Phillip
odium was attempting to find a neighbor
to synapse with and in the absence of
finding a neighbor who also wanted to
form a synapse the Phillip odium
withdrew so here's an animation from the
actual time series microscopy and you'll
see the Phillip odeon emerge somewhere
below this branch about there it was so
as a short-lived little process and is
thought to be at the heart of neural
plasticity how new synapses are forming
here's work by Israel Hough in our lab
to visualize molecular dynamic processes
this is simply water at equilibrium room
temperature and one interesting question
to us is whether we could combine the
two whether we could combine a molecular
dynamic simulation together with actual
geometry coming from confocal microscopy
and here is a frame from such a
simulation by Brad fudge our lab has
also been working with researchers at
Harvard Medical School to develop
improved tools for visualizing the white
matter fiber structure inside the brain
this is derived from diffusion MRI
brain data so we're interested in these
fibers the wiring inside the brain and
help to properly display them so that's
the background of some of the work in
our lab and you'll see as the talk
progresses how that sort of feeds into
our imagined view of what things might
be like when people routinely upload
very large 3d biomedical datasets onto
the web so first I'll start with a 2d
example which goes something like this
here is a 14 year old male before ski
trip and this is an image of the 14 year
old male after the ski trip of course
what I want you to note is the fracture
and the clavicle here the arm is being
held in an arm sling and you can see a
safety pin from there so here's that
here's an x-ray a 2d image of this
fracture and of course that 14 year old
is my 14 year old so this is a this is a
an actual anecdotal story fractured
clavicle he sees two different
orthopedist that one recommends one
procedure performed surgery install
plates two to repair the break and the
other offers different advice which is
simply to immobilize the arm in the
sling for a few weeks and let it heal on
its own so the patient is left with a
choice between two possible procedures
and of course wants to know what's the
best outcome so like many patients this
one searches the web for images matching
clavicle
and finds anatomical images with your
helpful for educational purposes but
also finds that many people have
uploaded x-rays of their own broken
clavicles and now there's this
interesting hunt that begins to try and
find an x-ray that looks like his who
has a similar bone break and what did
they do here is here's an x-ray someone
has kindly uploaded that shows the
result of following procedure number one
surgery with with with pin
- to set the fracture so if we imagine
the space of all clavicles I'll call it
C of T this is a time-dependent data set
so these would be clavicles T days after
a fracture so C of 0 is is the picture
that we've got this is immediately after
the fracture and we're interested in the
possible views of C 90 what will that
clavicle look like after 90 days of
healing so here's here's our space this
is C of 0 this is people who have
recently sustained a fracture lots of
images that you can find by searching on
the web and each of these images
conceptually is just a point in that
space so here's a space populated by a
bunch of dots each dot corresponds to a
picture and each picture corresponds to
a fracture so here's some sampling of
the set C of 0 now a fractured clavicle
follows a trajectory over time and
that's illustrated by this arrow mapping
one particular image in the set C of 0
over 2 a particular image that's in the
set C of 90 so we can imagine that this
this clavicle follows a trajectory over
the course of 90 days and we've taken a
snapshot twice before and after the
healing process of course there are many
trajectories here that have been sampled
by individuals fracturing their clavicle
some of these trajectories follow
procedure p1
these are illustrated with the red
arrows and some of these four clavicles
follow a trajectory along procedure p2
these are indicated by the blue arrows
that terminate at the blue dots so just
to remove some of the clutter there
perhaps or other fractured clavicles
that follow neither of these two
hypothetical procedures p1 and p2 but
now we restrict ourselves just as those
clavicles that follow a p1 or p2 and we
wonder what you know what turned out to
be the best outcome and not just in
general but for those sets of outcomes
which ones emanate from the subset of
original fractured clavicles like the
case we care about our 14-year old who
was on a ski trip so if we limit our
original set just as those injuries that
were similar to the one that we care
about and then look at the trajectories
that emanate from within this subset of
fractures that are like the ones of
interest to us then here they are so the
red lines are the trajectories of
fractures like the one we care about to
follow procedure number one and the blue
lines that follow procedure number two
so let's call that these resulting sets
after 90 days little p1 and little p2
and they're surrounded by a cloud of
capital p1 and capital p2 which would be
all of the fractures that had followed
these two trajectories so in order to
make a decision based on these samples
that one might find on the web there's
this basic algorithm that one might
apply which begins with finding images
like mine clustering trajectories into
ensembles and examining the ensemble
outcomes to see whether there tends to
be a superior outcome with procedure one
or with procedure two so one limitation
of this basic sort of web driven
Enterprise is that the imagery is not
densely sampled in time so you can't
really follow someone's clavicle over
the course of 90 days they did an image
it every night every day and even if
they did they probably didn't upload it
every day and there's the basic question
of what exactly my clavicle will do
given these these observations of data
points out there that it would be nice
to have some sort of predictive
value related to my particular case and
it could be that my case is an outlier
and that the outcome of following a
procedure will be different than those
that I've observed so that brings me to
my hurricane analogy which works
something like this the idea is that a
clavicle trajectory is as something like
a hurricanes trajectory for which
historical observational data is
available so here we're seeing the paths
of many many hurricanes over time this
is over something like a century of time
you can see that there are paths for
category fives and the Pacific and a
fairly dense grouping less so in the
Atlantic in the in the Gulf of Florida
so based on these aggregate
observational data points one might
choose a place to live that might have
more or less hazard and one would know
this in advance and one might limit the
observed trajectories to a region of
interest here for example are all the
Hurricanes or hurricane remnants that
have passed through or near the state of
Missouri over up the past hundred years
or so but one might also predict the
possible paths for a particular
hurricane so this would not just be a
query based on observed data this would
be simulations based on a computational
model for the physics of hurricanes and
which one might generate possible paths
according to some statistic a stick
conditions so here's a particular
hurricane and it might go any number of
different ways over the next few days
and these possible paths are indicated
by different colors so the analogy that
that I'm meaning to draw here is that
these trajectories can be considered
something like the future trajectory of
a particular mal
maybe it's a broken clavicle maybe it's
something else and that given initial
conditions based on one's medical scan
fed into a simulation one might predict
various possible outcomes and assign a
probability density to different
different points in this abstract space
for example clavicles over time so in
this analogy we have an observed
clavicle we have some sort of solver
maybe a bone remodeling solver and we
advance forward over time according to a
procedure p1 or p2 and we look at
perhaps ensemble averages based on
predictions not simply observed data so
there are two so there are two distinct
methods that might be applied to making
a decision based on one's medical data
one is to compare it against cohorts and
the other is to actually make
predictions based on computational
simulation but it's important to note
that we need a 3d volume of initial data
not just a 2d image and that brings me
to the 3d example part of the talk so on
this 3d example we consider a brain
tumor that shows up in an MRI scan and
if you don't see the tumor immediately
here it's been highlighted and pointed
to by this arrow and perhaps the patient
who who has this tumor has a choice
between different procedures to follow
and I was very important to make the
right decision between procedure 1 and
procedure 2 in the case of a broken
clavicle perhaps both procedures will
have comparable outcomes in the case of
the tumor perhaps they may not and one
would like to know that in advance
so we imagine this scenario where one
carries out a similar algorithm as with
the 2d example of the broken clavicle
but this case for the case of a brain
tumor and one searches the web for
images that match brain tumor now
there's a huge variety of imagery that
results from such a query the tumor is a
much more subtle feature than a fracture
so for a patient to take a look at
images that may show up from a web
search they may be much less discernable
to the patient than images say of x-rays
of fractured clavicles and there's
tremendous variable in these 2d images
not just because there's tremendous
variability and the possible shapes and
locations of the tumors but because
we're looking at 2d slices of a 3d
volume and which particular 2d slice you
happen to get can vary from from patient
to patient our diagnosis to diagnosis so
we might consider searching actual 3d
scans so how many 3d scans are there how
big is this possible data set
well it's estimated that in year 2007
there'll be something like 50 million
diagnostic MRI scans obtained worldwide
it's something like 20 million ended in
the United States alone unlike a typical
patient who may be searching for
comparable data to one's own the
radiologist has such a database already
embedded in their thinking a radiologist
knows what normal looks like and as a
result spends less than seven minutes on
average reading an MRI scan by
comparison a patient may want to spend
much more time not only browsing their
own scan but also seeing the imagery in
3d and comparing to other scans
so here's here's an example just to
bring this home this is a patient
diagnosed with a brain tumor this is
shown in green and you can see how this
tumor sits with respect to the
vasculature and the fiber tracts
surrounding it if we zoom in on a region
of interest here at the top of the tumor
we can see where some of these fibers
infiltrate the tumor itself now this has
this has implications for the patient as
well as for the intervention if the
tumor is removed or irradiated including
the periphery some of these fibers
necessarily will be sacrificed and these
fibers connect to regions of the cortex
that perform certain functions so the
patient perhaps would be interested in
seeing here are fibers that possibly
innervate the speech center of the brain
by removing the tumor we will damage
these fibers and there will be a
resulting loss in the ability to speak
being able to see this in 3d is as
perhaps important for a patient
who is evaluating possible treatment
options and being able to compare one's
own particular set of geometries to
those of other patients would be
potentially useful and empowering as
well so what we're imagining is this
basic algorithm that patients may wish
to be able to follow where they begin
with the space capital S of all MRI 3d
MRI images restricted to the space
little s of those that happen to be like
mine for example and then following a
trajectory over time according to
procedure P one of those scans like mine
that follow option number one versus
those scans over time that
option number two so thinking about how
this process might work there would be
individuals who first upload their MRI
data and then wish to view it then find
and view data from cohorts within
procedures p1 and p2 that is people who
had a pathology like mine who then
subscribed to procedure 1 or procedure 2
and what it looked like their what their
MRI looked like after those procedures
were performed based on these data
points together with the computational
simulation it might be interesting to a
patient to simulate one's own possible
trajectory or family of trajectories
possible outcomes over time a following
procedure one or procedure two which
where sin leads to consideration of how
how large a database are we talking
about to store the very very many
millions of scans that are performed
each year so roughly 10 to the 7 scans
per year that let's estimate 10 to the
9th bytes would be something like 10
petabytes of storage which would raise
issues of data movement for that that
quantity of data raises questions about
how to actually perform 3d queries on
MRI datasets this is an active area of
research for many people how to provide
visualization services so that having
uploaded an MRI dataset one could then
see a reasonable 3d representation of
the geometry it contains a couple
perhaps with simulation services that is
given a particular representation of the
geometry how might that geometry evolve
over time subject to physics and
biological processes and and of course
how to maintain confidentiality and
anonymity for these
these datasets there's one other lurking
issue here which is to validate the data
if if individuals are free to upload
upload their data and characterize it in
the way that say they see fit those
characterizations may or may not be apt
but the payoffs for this this
possibility of many people uploading
their 3d MRI data would include having a
large searchable repository of 3d MRI
datasets which would be valuable for
patients for their personal use would be
valuable for medical research and would
permit the population of patients to be
better informed and more empowered
so to summarize there are millions of
MRI scans out there there's an
opportunity to empower patients to not
only view their their MRI scans in ways
that a radiologist might not but also to
compare their MRIs to their cohorts and
possibly follow the outcomes of
different procedures that they're
entertaining also to simulate possible
trajectories via a computational
simulation and the basis for this this
kind of imagined world of uploading 3d
medical imagery to the web it was due to
collaborations with a number of
individuals including Kevin Beeson
Charles Wilmette Karen Dietz Carl
Frederick Weston and Gordon Kendall Minh
at Rhythm &amp;amp; Hues FSU and Harvard Medical
School
yeah
and I guess these another good one of
that is it
dr. scared so there multiple questions
about the sampling of this space of
imagery one is about patients making
long conclusions and one is about
possible bias so yeah I mean these are
all appropriate and interesting to think
about as sort of a thought experiment
for the first four sampling when I
imagine the scenario I imagine it being
staged where the first stage involves
seeding this collection of datasets so
why would individuals want to upload
their their personal medical data and
yet they do already with for example
x-rays that you can see if there is some
potential payoff for uploading your 3d
scan then that might be reason enough to
to seed this data set for example if by
uploading your 3d MRI you're able to see
some nice visualization of the result
then you might just want to subscribe to
that service then that would begin to
see the pool as far as as bias that this
will be an inherently biased system
because people without pathologies are
less likely to be scanned so we already
know upfront that there will be certain
biases as far as being able to correctly
categorize these scans that is here's
the scan that shows a certain pathology
the patient was a certain age and so
forth this is an issue that has to do
with the medical records that are
associated with that scan there are some
hospitals that are beginning to
experiment with having patients genetic
information associated with their
records which may or may not be an
adjunct to their 3d scan information
which would perhaps bolster the
validation part and as far as the
empowering of patients I think that's
probably here to stay
patients are going to be more and more
opinionated about their their
trajectories and and I think that's just
the nature of medicine and the
foreseeable future the question is
whether there is a repository now of
basins like this there are several and
of course they're sequestered because of
issues of confidentiality one of the one
of the important uses for these
databases is to establish what normal is
so there are atlases being constructed
based on scan data and there are cohorts
that are being imaged at set time
intervals over a span of up to ten years
so there are a number of different
groups that are doing this now and the
idea here is to take this notion and go
large yes
the comment is about the value of the
descriptive information as well as the
image information and that certainly is
the case for this picture where one
might forecast the future trajectory of
one's own data I guess it would be
important for that 3d imagery to be
available
so the simplest of all day is March and
man how long did it take to long today
this house I guess you know it's
comfortable uploading a video a video is
a bunch of slices of 2d images and and
this would be as well just be a nice
healthy high resolution video
simple plastic happy to grocers together
I suspect that queries about the visual
comical Maya particular broken clavicle
will only be answered with confidence if
you can actually simulate how that bone
modeling will take place you know a 3d
computational simulation because the
observational data is just too sparse as
far as issues about things like range of
motion resulting from or amount of pain
or appearance cosmetic issues again I
think that the simulation is really I
mean the idea that one might upload a 3d
scan and then with various computational
tools predict what will happen in the
future based on this particular
observation of one's 3d state I think is
incredibly exciting yes
my opinion
to produce a decent visualization of
one's MRI data so that's actually how
this whole thing got kicked off I had
posters up on the wall of various
visualizations of biomedical data and a
colleague of mine said you know I hurt
my shoulder and I got it scanned can you
make one of those pictures for me of my
data I said why don't see why not
he brings it in on a CD and so we start
to work on on making images and this is
complicated by a number of things there
are dropped images and the sequences are
out of order there are gaps and it takes
a fair amount of manual processing so
just to automate that task is is
non-trivial how long would it take well
this was a one-off example so it took us
a day automating you know will speed it
up by however much it does I guess a
potentially deeper question is to
automate a process whereby one uploads
MRI data and then looks at results would
require that the visualization system
make very good predictions about what a
user would want to see and that depends
in part on the sophistication of the
user so that the naive user might want
to see just plain vanila anatomical data
in order in part to see what you know
what do the organs look like in this
vicinity and the more expert user would
already come equipped with that advanced
knowledge and would be interested in
something more refined so for a
visualization system to know in advance
what level of sophistication the user
has maybe requires a dragger yes
some scanning devices come with
applications designed for viewing the
resulting data so that so that's vendor
specific and and it depends on you know
the clinical setting as to whether you
will get a CD that has both an
application and your and your data as
far as some canonical visualization tool
that accepts a broad variety of data and
will automatically generate a view that
you like now that still is is not there
yet just buckets been available for four
or five years now you know
UCSF radiological imaging labs and use
in South San Francisco was taken over
was sold out to another group I can't
remember the name of the right now but
they're off on a waster point
look it up over it and see if I can find
them but I know that there's a company
that actually reads DICOM GE Toshiba
Hitachi most the major MRI brands and I
club so it's like it's pretty Universal
I've used it at home on my own PC
just give me a second I'll see if I can
find it
yes he was fine and he demonstrated this
range of motion before I left with his
talk harshly based in part I think on
cosmetic interests no scar yes
the question I think is about the
utility of these visualization tools for
if the doctor is making the diagnosis
that is that's unclear and unclear for a
number of reasons whether a 3d display
is an improvement over 2d display this
is an ongoing area of research at the
surgical planning laboratory at Brigham
and Women's Hospital how to best display
in 3d data for making diagnosis and
surgical plans thank you very much for
