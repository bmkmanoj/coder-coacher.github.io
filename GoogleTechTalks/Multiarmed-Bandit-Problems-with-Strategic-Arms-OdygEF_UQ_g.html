from Princeton today John is a PhD
student a comprehensive Arthur is
Princeton working with mark government
he has worked on information of leg city
and online learning which there's a
second you get admitted and today is
going to talk about that after topic
hi yes so saying and talk about some
work we did on Motel dance with
strategic arms and this is joint work
with my advisor mark waving and cheering
now and back to why
so the general sort of subject was
talking about learning into kiki context
so very generally learning algorithms
assume Sargon stochastically or
adversarially but increasingly inputs
are controlled by strategic agents and a
bunch of context and later but
algorithms are good adversarial
guarantees don't necessarily perform
well Kiva case and you might think how
is this possible adversarial cuz
everything and probably the focus is on
so specific learning problem whole look
at is the multi-armed bandit problem so
classically you have Kate raises her
arms and each round over the course of T
rounds you choose one arm to pull this
will give you generally either of the
cache to clear adversary generate reward
and their goal is to maximize your total
reward all right and sort of model is a
trade-off between exploration
exploitation because you spend some time
figuring out what the best part is but
once you have to grow with the best term
is you want to put as much as possible
to maximize your total and the way these
algorithms are usually phrases in terms
of regrets
so limitation so arm i gives you the
word vit if you float around the teeth
and will say that it algorithm enfolds
arm i Chi and crunchy rice and so many
variable and the regret event is just
difference between its total value for
some of vit counties and the maximum
overall arms value you would have let me
just pull all right yes exactly how much
mercy do them the best our bigger goals
all right and it's well known that all
right so we'll say an algorithm is Delta
Laurentiis with high probability the
regressively algorithm the most Delta su
not taking expectations so we're not a
little strong version we'll just do with
high probability
yeah but uh so many things you only need
expectation to be all right
ropes XL later but yet for simple to be
wants to forget algorithms which are low
regrets in the adversarial base was high
probably the strongest and it all didn't
sort of by setting so yeah so there's
many an algorithm in this case that
achieve proximately square roots Katy
regret and for example the gastic
setting you see being achieved
absolutely we take to you with it and
the adversarial setting DX b3 achieves
fruity keywords and you can make it
achieve make will be achieve it with
high poly would put the other all right
so what do particular miss lang so the
strategic multi-armed bandit community
anything's
front we're looking at the case where
each arm is an individual rational
agents and before when you pulled an arm
you just will receive some value
now will you pull an army the armors
give some value will say stochastically
generate and it chooses what amount of
the value to pass on to the to the arm
puller that will called the principal
all right so after this round the
principal receive utility X the arm
receives utility fee minus X and notably
the principal doesn't learn exactly how
much value the the arm guns we already
see some value test on X controllers X
but in the word exactly how much our
critical value fee and there's sort of
this inherent stay down here in between
the arm keeping most of the value which
case will get more value but it will get
poor blessed and passing on those
familiar in which case it will get the
played more often but it doesn't give
much valley all right so the sort of
thing is something like a generalization
of multi-armed bandit let's go to
exciting it captures a lot of aspects of
peaceful agent problem with many agents
so for example you can resume on old
where is can model hiring one of those K
investors to mend some amount of money
or hiring one of the K contractors from
some work and choosing between one of P
sellers that can offer varying discounts
or prices all right all right
so one natural question after seeing
this model is why can't we just run exp
3 or UCB or some of them now this seems
like that will still incentivize the
arms to compete maybe because you know
one arm doesn't give so much it'll get
overtaken by the other arms seems
naturally to do well um so it or you
might say ok this Takeda pending is a
some case of the adversarial setting so
it doesn't own the adversarial setting
that you do well just keep saying so
that's true and like in the case that we
still have low regret the limit just
means we do as well as the desktop and
it's possible that you know after all
these arms are sir
can agree on some equilibrium or
convergence on equilibrium even the best
star might give us variable you want
something like exp 3 and there's sort of
the issue here between the red pen
policy right oh my god these are these
algorithms from no regrets
Commissioner registers with respect to
you bring the algorithm now you fix
history and your goats are it if we paid
exactly the same that I've done better
by being on our so what if I went back
an excellent picture that what's changed
all right um so well after in second
whether he XP treat as well but uh this
one last part of the model is important
which establish which is what to be on
genome so there's sort of two realms
Rachel settings that the guards can
belong in twenty the RMT's each on Teebs
all the other values reported by all the
other arms they can see exactly what's
going on in the game
and the other case the arms only see
which arm is chosen of around the use of
arm only fee but I'm gay was chosen you
don't see how much arm Jay gave to the
principal and amount of my deter these
cases do the arms learn the other
individual values these are private all
right so uh so you can come back to the
promotion but taken from model use y
okay so that's a good question so um I
will bring it this like so negating the
I don't worry yeah so like to be
equilibria you'll be using is so we
assume that the arms house values drawn
from some stochastic distribution so
accordingly sets equal Commission
reducing dues I can epsilon across the
Nash equilibria for there so it's the
excited month in a bowl of a little time
ago but I think the important the
interesting model will try to be the
tacit model and these what information
sensitivity tested mother yes you can
find a game promotes
yes we just put in some game loads of
game like what's the work in the brain
yeah so just like a recipe the game so
just cute it like a street neck muscles
not perfect so you know the rad
sink without Dennis stuff yeah it's a
lot of Busboys and threat to stop so
you're looking at a repeated game and it
couldn't belong to the again for if not
that's what if you go to the computing
actual work attire here I'm judging on
don't open any quality yeah Tony like
redeposit the shoes say fire I'm going
to that they can allow pets allowed so
threats are allowed and prints are very
powerful mix for the model which is why
it's less interesting what's happening
model right can't communicate between
themselves out of correctly so it's a
lot more subtle with Aveda and there's a
friloux live effects the tracks you're
using a little bit over them if I want
so many questions folks the model right
now for the time regret my cardigan in
this so the only notion probably uses
we're talking those algorithms which
have low regret things like the classic
add versatile negative x so we actually
won't talk about regret special for one
one to find a special notion of all
services inside so but it's still um
they find us with more what is them I'll
go to stay up in this cases yeah so know
what is passed on I think perhaps
lipless explain maintained until explain
sort of what why you no need to find
right introduced so the main sort of
results we have is that these key goals
of things like I'm being an ordinary
load algorithm in the adversarial its
and having anything good algorithm speed
case in sense of the principle getting
non-trivial revenue even
fundamentally most any lower get
algorithm there's some equilibrium for
the arms where the principle receives
with a little theorem you might if you
could I'm sorry
so so this could be unrealistic because
you're not doing sub game perfect yes I
think I think for the tax case that
you're reviewing if you think something
perfect we'll see yeah yeah when you get
to later the per student you know I mean
actually that they have to month it's
not natural
yeah that's one thing because like you'd
expect to get some constant amount of
around from the arms so you should get
the data tip against the loyalty means
get something like T to those requests
32 routine so this one's for both that
not done setback and modest oh no mommy
put them all of game either so so it's
pretty explicit model you can actually
do way better you're already into the
how much like that order T match versus
mesh Metis a set of halves one actual
just slash please
um far it is identified nations it might
be yeah it might be important but it's
very hard to work with the exact match
so the point is those these like the low
teaser is this the little to you so if
we don't know exactly whether you can do
three well it's crashing okay so we get
back to theorem what about a st specific
terms of strategy yeah another good
question so what about like looking
suppose the best people like if they're
a lot of an algorithm where you know the
best equilibrium a people mix so not
funny
the answer is yes are there's good
equilibrium but the kind of weird so
basically these are the results of the
clues results will show that the artist
can effectively blue even though they
can't communicate amongst each other
they can still learn to give the
principal love it it turns out that's
where there is an equilibrium words they
can also collude and give the crystal
once or not not a lot of those playing
it non-trivial so don't right now Goku
that's giving them dangerous polar caps
bump around they also give VD principal
like play to 1 plus epsilon crowns
because Queen here at level 2 so somehow
with the existence of a good equal
greater is as great as I 20 probably
want something like you want something
we're being truthful is a dominant
strategy are excellent all right anymore
buddy
okay so basically the main theorem
somebody again is that property being
low-rent of the adversarial case the
property of doing well with ski today so
sort of thumb of yours there's like some
natural equilibrium for the arms where
the arm is can pass long very little or
zero revenue to the and so it's making a
sense that there's some instance of the
static problem but actually was true for
like a very wide family of natural
instances I think it's probably true for
every instance one day like if you think
deeply finicky orthography somebody
karadian sitting area with something
like a funky Immodium leg any brainy any
revenues possible for the Pacific from 0
to P yes we can sort of think of this as
sort of like a so there may be first to
look like strategic balance but uh yeah
it's not we're not exactly sure what
happens in may clearly show like because
they supposedly seems like everything is
possible I think equally exciting in
generally what happens anything it
probably like us I feel like you can
probably construct yeah some clearly
that will get Luke to control an
interview well there's there's also some
tactics like we can't prove it for every
single in suggests all right sure
later but for foremost lytic settings
and distributions and most possible
running music one principle have there
is some sort of like equilibrium in this
game where the principal objects that
effort right over here so I find in this
aquarium you actually have a non-trivial
one of Evan you or me or the um yeah so
the arms also all gets yes occurs if I
just believe it's a little T and the
arms also get zero so that's that's yeah
yeah so I'm putting this get the arms
will get all suppose the honorable brunt
we get played once every this K arms
will get say once every K turns and
basically and if they get to keep their
entire revenue vector so then on average
if they're mean is you I will make Y
over K around together up there all
right
I'm ste any idea over hey taxi
where's new instance so you like to be
basically it so so they're giving
instance but as long as the gap between
the largest
tomb you I was not too big milk's you
read you'll need all the noise piece
followers yeah I was wondering to work
there later the related video okay I'll
go get a cop and the WACS text if
they're all equal but until the circles
so I'm being played one of the connexxus
basically have the killers and all of
them are thieves disappear therefore you
don't care about which will go to bed
sovereignty placate me this straight
yeah some some of you know you need to
make sure that whatever strategy doesn't
you know yeah I know it is so one of the
question is like because information
sharing between the arms so they know
each other's muse to begin with um think
I can imagine you're supposed all of the
ump knew that the new is equal to half
Blitzer then the arms decided okay we're
going to pass zero revenue for the
suppose no matter what on picks and we
just want to share whatever I mean you
will make at the end of the day if I
think then why wouldn't like what why
would I really want to be be it from the
strategy or so so what subscribe is all
the arms have M equals one half sari and
so you fear strategy is all the armies
have need 1/2 let's say yeah and then so
people are going to say all clay 0y and
then we'll get wait like you go up and
reach got like hefty alright cuz I need
to make sure it's not in any arms
incentives to pay a little bit more
because if what I'm saying you know like
wanting thirds are like what up entity
per what tends params okay well suddenly
Bible or guy that played like all the
time but then going to as a threat to
because that but the point is that
they're going to show is they put a
model yeah you can either that's doing
that so we put the models okay that's
why is the type of model you can't see
this captain more all you see is that
present one disarm getting played border
that's sort of what's going to happen
and you're not assuming that the low
regret algorithm is metric yeah the
little bit algorithm could also know try
to break this or strategy by being like
all right I'm going to pick arm one for
a while now because pretending like here
we can suspect on one to the fence
that's very good for a good we're good
over but also that our algorithms
actually lower risk it can't do there's
some
well Anna - are you playing on it Christ
yes I guess I mentioned some other stuff
but so clerk atvs was the case assist
this like sort of trend model and spray
similar to things T and the kids second
price auctions basically if he you know
all the army to watch each other and
whenever the arms up or something bigger
than zero they all simultaneously start
giving all of their value and or earlier
they can raise the victim eventually
there's a several threatening side use
where you can disincentive life any arm
from ever getting real answers
it's got to know if it included tourists
questioning said some game is completely
generally a federal event so games
perfect completely as early as that yeah
so some game are going to fix for the
finger look I think that's happening was
towards in the sub-game perfect yes okay
because the thing also might violate the
thing that was also mentioned about you
know maybe in this explicit
incorporating 100 pics or than the
others so what I'm actually gets loyalty
revenue total but like is no guarantee
here that the market will get shared
evenly between the two arms yeah so so
explicit example it's not great but it's
to show that you can give very eighty
bad things whilst example to incur
cocaine sub-game perfect or they witness
but the DEF example sort of sort of
students always so the tax example it's
harder because if you can't directly
measure when the other arms are
defecting some stead what they'll do is
that is that each arm tries to maintain
an equal fraction on the marketer and
the way it does this is sort of see then
what it's getting played it's getting
played went to the trip it will give
like a tiny epsilon to the principal to
encourage it to place and you can use
this along with the fact of the
principles playing Laura ghost tragedy
to show that they can actually maintain
this equal market share while passing
along
Wilson's parts yeah nice thing so it is
there a threat to if an arm gets
excessive market share on the shed that
part of this set in part of it yeah okay
um so I'm guessing if you guys finally
simply perfect split yeah it's not good
cause you can still make some amount of
money but if you're like the arms of a
higher value and well yeah maybe it's
either some deeper okay so I just one
question is maybe like we need to lower
bread provision they're unnecessary
maybe you know any algorithm for the
principle that there's some way for the
arms to collude they can't do better
then that's critical the case the only
what's up you interprets but so the
tacit case um you can you learn the
laureate and you can give the principle
in constant amount per turn and the
algorithm is very simple basically going
to burning a second price auction one
more later but basically if you sort of
the means then just what we make the
second largest mean per territorial and
this album is very much novel regret
than could be better than well regret in
the test case that's a simple adaptation
of the second price auction in more
detail of how exactly we're going to be
describing us are using every sin it oh
oh this is just another addition to the
I'm not not describing the second price
auction I'll go right now but uh so it's
also possible to modify the second price
auction algorithm to work with the
combination of strategic and
non-strategic routes
was there all right so I think like a
chunk of time I'll kind of walk to the
interesting parts of Brooklyn fear one
basically the impossible result for the
traffic is so that's a possible running
lowered algorithm to do well in the
strategic setting so for simplicity will
look like walk rate for the case where
there's only two hours there's very
similar proof from the case of care
super complicated but so the captures
already interesting parks so it was
listen even your very duplicate so you
have two hours of the biggest values so
arm one always get q1 / M that aren't
you always get asked you to program and
let's also assume that the gap between
q1 and q2 been most a larger one over
two and so the sort of the restriction
on instances we have and let's also
assume that because of everything is
dealt out lower ribs the adversarial
worst case we want to show that these
two facts together apply that in the
strategic setting there's some square
root T Delta equilibrium where the
school gets the most square root T Delta
running all right so I guess
applications like sort of answered is
how can the arms glued without
communicating and the idea is if you're
being played less than half the time in
this case give a hyena
otherwise give sir so suffice imitation
of what c1 TV the number of times arm
one is pulled up to time T also find C 2
T similarly and we'll define these
customs B and data so B is 6 through T
Delta number much bigger than 1 and
theta is root Delta 30 system
a smaller one it's our epsilon basically
so this is the equilibrium strategy for
the others so first of all if ever
you're played less than B times less
than the other arm
you should affect basically just give
out your full value from now otherwise
so this is interesting because this is
where e so difficult reset is actually
connected independent so depends on the
mechanism providers arm certainly I
think otherwise what you want TV the
probability that people will pick you
pick on one and the frowned conditioned
on plays pretty so far all right so now
there's two cases if see one like if the
other times r1 is played is less than
amount of times r2 is played and the
probably got one is going to get played
the next round in the most 1/2 arm 1 is
epsilon or fail moment an otherwise if
it's in is true need to set our arm or
pay zero so more interesting thing is
that you might expect that ok we just
pay a little bit more if you're behind
but you also need to take into account
because probability eita figure out the
probability you're going to play the
next round if you know the history and
then react to that otherwise these
people can do funny things with picks r1
for a while so they identify these other
arms to think that our morning's events
ok so sort of the poor level of the news
of this low-rent property of the
algorithm this thing we said that
there's no way for the learner of an
algorithm to force the sort of algorithm
to affect while maintaining lower pairs
so particularly those arms are using the
strategy then with - illegal number
design
okay so what's the idea behind this
proof the idea is that if you want to
show that different the only defect when
the difference in the number of times R
1 and R 2 played grow slowly so make
sure that this thing stays bounded by V
for all times so the idea is it releases
correctly to the regrets so whenever
this difference increases the regret
also increases the regret sustained by
the algorithm so let's let R 1 TP the
polar rents due to non plane on one so
our money value of time T minus the arms
you've chosen to time T and let's define
R T similarly and so by definition since
reason strong word anomalies are with TR
to TR less than Delta for all times by
probability all right so when do you
accumulate regrets and we are one C and
R 2 T change
so there's a to date so we only regret
when the two arms would have paid your
different amounts and that only happens
for one of the arms is going to pay you
felt a good arm is going to pay you sir
so one of the times when members that be
insulted when we as a commission happens
so long it's more likely that arm won't
get to play the and r1 is already
getting played more often than arm to so
in this case the arms offers the arm to
offers theta I'm Roma for 0 and there's
two things that could happen depending
on what the algorithm does and
probability P 1 T either he takes arm 1
and redtube
like a regret two increases my theta or
probably one minus that he picks arm to
and arm one to read decrease clay hit
the correct I might have swapped
my restroom
all right yes and if you look at the
expected some of his regrets we expected
some of the red at time t plus 1 given
those some of the red times T is this
expression which is at least some of the
rest of time see ticular the problem
it's also a second case so second cases
like elegance just a meeting swamped and
this inequality still holds so in both
cases the expected is some prevent
conditions on the past two risk
increases so this thing forms a sub
market and regular white papers in
quality you know that the probably that
that some of these to read scoffs too
low is bounded you'll never have some
case for basically will have very low
negative read for both are one and very
low negative read for r2 and it's an
important because now what's this
balance r1t and RTT overall time stone
all right so what about the quantum you
see I we need to eventually show that
it's unlikely that c1 p minus p GT grows
weary limbs so we also look at what
happens to see one team at c-to-t any
situation so if let's found the probably
the c1 to my GG ever grows larger than
so let's look at the last time equals
zero that's what's how we hold that time
and what's LED Delta s Eva plus my for
difference between these two quantities
at times SN deadlines so it needs to be
by some telescoping that c 1 t minus VTP
is at most some hotel desk from town
1 2 T and we can break this into two
cases crowns we're more likely to pick
on one that I'm two and rounds words
more likely to pick are to the north
okay so focus on the first term so the
quantity Delta s this one in one of our
arm one is chosen at time X and it's
negative one whatever arm ones are just
different types and also we know that
because we chose it out to be the last
time that C 1 that equals C 2's and
we're trying to mount the probability
that Q and X is at most P plus e to us
oh my god
P 12 minus P we know that this thing
gives greater than 0 so in particular if
we have all these constraints if you
chose the arm 1 and I'm going to take
more than arm two and probably picking
on one is bigger than probably picking
up two then you're right increases by
theta and also it's basically as see
what has to be repeat was then it
follows that C to F of 1 the least
I think you see the size I think it from
from this bag and this can see that this
sum is the most difference in regrets
twily by theta which is and most since
the regrets are bounded in this interval
negative 2t wonky delta positive delta
and it gets and get some bound on this
crystal all right then you can also
similarly down the second something
easier because when probably picking
common ones is pledged to the
probability of picking Merrick to he
expected valleys of Delta is just P 1 s
minus BT legends to most syrup so
basically this film can't grow too large
and basically by hunting the high
probability of the most roots team
auditing and sort of different parts and
supply probability P 1p might have PGG
to most 641 games so we chose to promote
all right so question 0 P so the
definitions eight conditioning so the
peas are in strategy the arm strategies
right so presumably their venerable
perspective see a sort of observations
of which arms done so the important
thing to notice that we're doing with
mountains heats of both arms are
following strategy Esther so if the
following tests are then okay so it's
taxes which is could you because you
don't know what the other person
reported but if you a similarly tolling
F star you can figure out what your
report is based on the history up to
that point and whether you can play for
another is either going to afford 0 or
theta and you can figure that up okay
so assuming they both play a star than
the evening make sense anything so the
peas they're conditioned on the sequence
of reports and scores of that but at at
the mountain road and the things same as
the one that like we're going to serve
everything yeah
yes it's a subtle point because this is
like the top of model sometimes catching
those you might suspect that maybe they
can't defeat these two guys luckily
because we're enforcement QC strategy I
start again all right so we kept we've
done so far so this is the equilibrium
strategy basically if you are in full
month and they're less likely head pulls
and the other guy you should give us 1
otherwise it is 0
and you show that if the guy's foot both
arms use the strategy high probability
they want to trigger this defect station
all right so next question is why is
this an approximation one more question
so presumably actual strategy like that
has to be some kind of a flat and that I
can do it it considers never acting
casters tired out it but even though you
get the whole time gives you zero
ability so definitely so I think is
going back to whether this was something
perfect
that's very much so definitely if the
guys that they're both playing this is
still a like epsilon approximate match
equilibrium just because this won't
happen that probably and that is a 1/5
of a second but if someone personally
causes a defect they can't get much more
applying it much less than if they just
follow that star basically
argue with this approximation quickly
these argue that if arm to is following
estar the arm one can't deviate to
subscribe and get more than little lower
teeth and in fact successor will do so
so assume come up generally that q1 is
bigger than Q 2 and we have it as
constraint before that q1 minus q2 the
most qn illusion this will be port is
ensuring that this is actually equal
here so both arms all that start you
have this sort of even market fair and
both arms get play is half the time and
so arm one gets you whatever keep around
get to loot on the other side to 1 over
2 m c- caloric right but the farm 1
deviates and plays some other strategy
on to the best start with arm to stilts
is star there's sort of two conditions
this should be made more formal but
actual math and interesting so Andrew a
little bit so these items has even
triggered our motivated most few more
times the number two so it gains the
most queuing time to P or Ruby was about
ruse t delta delta T so is this a little
of me and I'm gonna render the defect
has been triggered then basically in
order for arm 1 to get paid at all I
must play at least q2 an average to pay
more than arm to and arm tooth pain to
keep around and this case arm to get a
notice in our model gamer with q1 minus
q2 production and as one is this staff
between two means the most Mexican in
the market share strategy is that the
being an equal race or next on
approximately spoken and yet arm one
can't get more than a little over T by
DV
okay so for two arms I won't go through
the proof or camera spell just show you
the equilibrium strategy because it's a
little bit different it turns out like
most straightforward generalization that
doesn't work but it is similar in the
proof is kind of similar so we have K
arms you set your B and theta similarly
and you again compute the probability
that a principal table here conditioned
on what's happened so far and now you
give X I'm just giving zero theta will
give some fraction laps okay the time is
one minus the probability and so this is
very nice this will give exactly a even
Marcus but of your arm get forward one
right here at the time and the proof is
similar to the 12 years so if you have
to sort of a few snacks for says this
time you ignore the safe um yes
something actually completely more
disease just works okay so the
counterpart to this or simpler is that
if you don't restrict ourselves to lower
good algorithm then the tactic patience
for kinetics non-trivial state of teeth
and suspending is this K arms arm is
collecting some distribution which we
need you I and the main idea is just
runs them sort of second price auction
ask the arms to record external means
like giving you that amounts per turn
for a while and then compensate some
views on scoring move and once you've
done that you play the arm of the
highest mean as long as it gives you
something big as the second largest game
because II lower stop playing that arm
forever
do something else for the rest of the
time or you can play out there
so more formally alright as you can see
exactly looks like so the contents you
slow down on the move on login clinic
guys so you start by playing double arm
once simple grammars can teach it and
let xib the value that are my reports
then you compute the second largest I
star is the arm with the largest
exponent largest reported value and oh
actually give you the money so I just
thought they gave you the next kind is
the second highest screen or second
highest reported value and then after
you communicate to I star somehow the
value of second highest it should be an
X print the highest second highest
community and then you play the best arm
for some number of turns of the vast
majority of the protocol and you always
ask I start to give you at least X prime
its arm never person thinks smaller
lenders or different from its stop
playing it and then so you have to we
compensate the arms or telling you the
truth
in part one because the lower value arms
and the incentives to pay you money is
not going to get chosen career ound
three so he was just going to play each
arm some number of times for free the
number of times you play it will be
roughly log of their value and it's
simply being a scoring rules so it's
just they're attentive sax your board
excited what they favor and I won't go
through the analysis because it's not
too interesting and I think intuitively
as sort of clear what's going on but
basically all the non men terms will
report the trimming in the beginning
because the reward at the end idea the
scoring world if we run the second price
auction the best arm also depend divides
to be fruitful and if you prime is the
second largest between the principal end
up making the prime times t plus the low
of T River
alright so there's a couple of questions
you can ask so there's something for the
issue that this algorithms that we wre
learning you just asked the arms for
things they already knew and they told
us then we just chose the s one and s or
not the plaintiff motorman it's so
natural questions but if the arms don't
know that means no one knows exactly
what sins are it turns out to be
something similar which also doesn't
really buy that like doesn't solve this
problem with you're not actually
learning but so you can do is you can
clay each of the arms for free for some
amount of time at the beginning go to
time then the arms themselves can learn
they're me so some sub costing precision
and then the people will still make
roughly the second highest mean times
key revenue but now in mecca's only
approximately crystal kind of some kind
of at least two years and you're
basically still offloading the learning
to the arms the other extensions you
mentioned earlier is once there's some
lots of teaching artists so that's
another question might ask lots of these
arms aren't good at for spinning in this
auction but it turns out anything takes
the previous protocol that even Mazda GT
cars participates basically those asking
every arm to report their mean first
rounds you actually divide it divide all
the rounds of the blocks of size keeps
the two thirds and now let's use the
average value of loop boxes but they
report so even though there might be
really high variance for non to keep
your arm over like one specific round
you average it over a block will be very
close to 70 I'm very bit of close enough
still get something in the form
maximum of the largest
mean of the monster took arms and the
second largest mean those a strategic
rights
all right so let's mention some future
direction for working on and guess one
thing later what is mentioned is a
question we're trying to solve is there
some actual like natural and that ISM
that actually learns over time since
it's asking for all the information from
getting and fella basically selling the
business to the best work and yet
another way to pay this is the algorithm
that has mentioned clearly fail in
settings where the distribution involves
over time and you might want something
that can learn the description as it
changes our auction mechanism doesn't
actually do anything uploads all the
learning to the artists which what
interesting exciting is where maybe
think about whether it's possible to to
do something interesting so I'm setting
you are coding bandits where there's
some hidden state some exclusive events
on that states for example one thing
could be your main grips over time so
start somewhere in every round either
increase a little bit or decrease a
little bit and consoled is an option and
we'll get to some mantras in revenue
again what is can you do anything better
isn't just auctioning off the entire
business wait it's the game I don't
think that's bugging up is so we're
afraid a theorem in terms of you know
there's some instance where gluten can
occur but actually we think losing
probably occur for every choice of
distributions for the arms
values you know we shouldn't need this
uh constraint on the gap of the largest
charms me and guess what currently works
as long as the gap between the top two
means is small enough but somehow our
parent groups still failed for the K
square or totally fail for a very
reasonable reason which is that if you
try to run the same proof and give like
a uniform market share to everyone then
if our one is way better than aren't you
is acting are most interested is more
all the other arms of this to play the
second highest r-value so one way to fix
this is instead of giving the uniform
market shares every arm you can sort of
try to in two different record share or
maybe you want one hour to receive it
played sixty percent of the time some of
the army has a 40 percent design and
prohibits possible in general can be for
any england purchase for the markets is
there some sort of collusive schedule
attacker case that's what person
arbitrarily premiums and are proof
somehow only works to Perdition
uniformly it's hard to get something to
computer form from the general campus
but so the sort of you know that is
possible to get arbitrary partition the
tour in case any types of distributions
for the armies there is some sort of
cruces like cruises strategy okay and
other question is is there anything
meaningful we can say about these
advantages adversarial doors so it's not
super clear what this means because it's
not really clear how to define an
equilibrium in this case because arm is
going to be something which will
maximize their overall expected utility
when they think we respect each other
the opinion but the words or adversary
children doesn't make sense so you can
all the reflections like what if the
army cells are playing the right
strategies it could chew ask you screw
as a chosen 0 i gave an address everyone
to the table I mean the history of
rewards from type 1 to T and then they
can bet respond to that knowledge
yeah so that's another thing you can do
we can could basically but didn't order
an order diversity make a quite a better
sailor like this non adaptive adversary
in time zero nature address early gives
something to every single person like a
history or watch from time 1 to t be
like this list and you want the theorem
statement to say for any has list you
give any such list you give in any high
caliber in this budget
uh-huh and that is a question that they
know each others face about them and
that is literally were thing with long
beep lines were yeah everyone knows
everyone's lists whatever are sort of
but your strategy can always depend on
like that time key can only depend on
the part of the listing team so far and
that because there's any sort of like
truthful or dominance prejudice case I
think three covers there can't be
anything I'm like to enter in security
and then more in general can apply any
personal methods to other situations so
this term until I got it make the
results that you can't do good like
learning why you think a lot of it other
than maybe the clues resultant uh Kusum
statutes like a positive result and use
it to exploit hours and joining lowered
read strategies so we do there's other
dynamic then interaction problems where
these methods can apply and also maybe
in some settings we can avoid this
release crawling the behavior of cruiser
alright so that's it thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
