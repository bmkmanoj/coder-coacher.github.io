for coming I'm really really very
pleased to welcome everyone to this
event for our gold alumni a gold alumni
the gold the acronym gold stands for
graduates of the last decade so it's
really the gold that we use blue and
gold so these are the true blues are
from beyond the past decade and so don't
worry you know if you're not in the past
decade like me it's not so I'm
especially pleased to mark the
collaboration between berkeley
engineering and our generous host at
google and you know without too much of
a preamble I think you're really here to
have a have a release a wonderful
interactive panel discussion with a
wonderful panel here in these director
chairs and the question we have posed is
y'all hear about oh I T is part of the
problem in terms of energy consumption
but really today we want to ask can I t
innovations solve the energy challenge
and I think it's especially arcane to
the folks here because you know you as I
think you you'll see during this
discussion you know there's a huge
amount that the methods of information
technology the methods of computer
science methods of electrical
engineering computer science and really
can be melded with more traditional
approaches you know the show's biofuels
and the wonderful materials and PV and
those are all part of the solution but
it's really the methodology that we have
there's a lot to offer so anyhow without
further ado I'm going to address i'm
going to introduce them in the order
that i have written here which doesn't
correspond to but i think i know where
everybody is a peter norvig peter is
Google's director of research he's a
brettly PhD peter is known for his work
in AI and of course the book with Stuart
Russell and natural language processing
amongst his many accomplishments
including our distinguished alumnus
award last year
luis barroso distinguished engineer at
Google where his interests range from
the design of Google's computing
platform to energy efficiency and power
provisioning from Berkeley engineering
we got we have Randy cats whose or out
there one of several key faculty members
associated with the rad lab which brings
together partners google microsoft and
sun to develop technologies for large
scale computing efforts reliable
adaptive distributed computing that's
what rad stands for and finally we have
a professor Costa spanos who during the
time he's a currently associate chair
for ecs but he was till recently the
associate dean for research and he
really helped develop a lot of the
strategy for the kinds of energy related
research that we do in Berkeley
engineering and just to give you a sense
you know we thought we'd have cost us
just do a few slides to to sort of set
the stage for the panel discussion so
just a few slides no you won't snow you
with PowerPoint and then all the other
panelists have graciously accepted to
sort of it will have a little bit of an
interactive discussion i'll start off
asking a few questions and then really
throw it open to you to have a
discussion so really this is the format
is to be in the format of a town hall
meeting so listen either we can get you
and cost us so let me introduce cost has
to get us started all right well thank
you thank you very much just a couple of
slides most of them not mine but the
theme for tonight the question for
tonight is can I t innovations of the
energy challenge and the answer of
course I personally believe it's a
strong yes and I hope you can see that
reflected in the discussion we would
like to bring three examples and where
this can make a difference in buildings
in distribution and in computing I just
an example from my colleague David color
from UC Berkeley where what you see here
is a when we try to solve the problem of
green buildings the greenest building in
campus at least in up
appearances so the whole the computer
science building as you can see over
there but if you monitor if you monitor
its power consumption which is
relatively easy to do without even
disaggregating the power consumption at
all you can see that the load is is
built out of servers building support
systems plug loads HVAC and lighting
what is really I think problematic and
what presents a huge and hopefully
low-hanging fruit is the fact that the
duty cycle on a 24-hour basis doesn't
really go very deep in other words the
building consumes as much power during
the day when it is fully occupied as it
consumes at three o'clock in the morning
on a saturday what almost nobody is
there and that presents some
opportunities I think extending these
opportunities on on the scale of the
whole Berkeley campus you can see here
they are the consumption in terms in
terms of kilowatt-hours per square foot
per square foot or the total consumption
it's dot corresponds to building in the
campus it's a large diversity going from
buildings that are just built or
buildings at 300 years or more and you
can see that there is a huge spread
smaller buildings are actually more
efficient and bigger buildings and it
might be almost embarrassing to do to
admit at some of the newer buildings
Alex you're not efficient at all again
we view this as an opportunity and we
are signing up to use the campus as a
testbed where we use information
technology to reduce its foot bring
dramatically and the idea of course is
to monitor model and medicate monitor
will say a few things about model of
course is to track you try to understand
where the energy is going and most
importantly what controls its
consumption what improves its efficiency
and of course the mitigation is all the
clever things that we have to do in
order to reduce its consumption reduce
the carbon footprint and this is a
little snapshot hear of a fairly
detailed the measurement of a corner of
soda hall when you disaggregate all the
plug-in loads and everything else we're
using a sensor network and then you try
to do you
this information to build a model to
generate the appropriate community
feedback the appropriate supervisor
control and maybe even the appropriate
automatic control for the building
systems to get the job done and another
low-hanging fruit this is not from
commercial buildings that but this is
from a residential places where what you
see here is 10 identical residences
occupied by people with the same
demographics and you can see the power
consumption in its area that tells us
that the power consumption depends quite
a bit on occupant behavior and that
perhaps represents another big
opportunity to get things done so how do
you how do you exploit this this is an
idea from my friends at MIT and I
wouldn't bring it here if I thought it
was a great idea but it's an interesting
idea nevertheless what you see here has
a diameter of about this big it is
called the ThighMaster and maybe guest
on the guessing that it is you can see
this and if your power consumption
exceed us at the limit it makes you it
makes you feel really bad about it they
actually spend research money to do this
I actually did not think that this
solution is going to work for most of us
but there are other solutions
information technology can really make
it as people say and I'm sure in this
company it's pretty well understood you
cannot impact something unless you
monitor it unless you don't unless you
unless you don't know what what it is
you cannot do anything about it so this
is an idea about using pervasive energy
monitoring in a home and and
distributing it is working and
distributing they are distributing the
information I decided getting the
information the different phone to the
different home components and having the
information available to you of course
that dovetails very nicely to the Google
energy meter and if you are still
signing up beta users I'll be glad to
sign up if that's available again you
cannot improve something at the land as
you can measure it and I think that
information technology can play a big
role in mitigating occupying behavior
just making
by making the energy consumption visible
moving on to the next challenge to do
the distribution of energy and this is
one of the slides that I stole from my
colleague Randy cuts and some other
friends at UC Berkeley what this slide
says is that when you start now
expanding the scale down to the national
scale perhaps and you try to take
advantage of of energy sources that are
not polluting like Sun and wind and so
on well it's what happened that these
resources are not at the same places
where the populations are this is for
example where the solar power exists
this is where wind power exists and of
course this is where the population is
so you have to figure to figure a way to
take this energy and distribute it to
the appropriate places and that gives us
an opportunity in its Island to rethink
the way to distribute energy it may be a
create a grid that takes advantage of
information technology and take
advantage of 21st century chancery ideas
this is a slide that is directly stolen
from randy cuts and i think as much more
to say about that but i just wanted to
mention that when you start dealing with
a energy the same way that we very
successfully dealt with in with
information and the distribution of
information where the distribution can
be locally and reliable and reliable but
in the aggregate very reliable because
quite a bit of redundancy and also
optimized because now you're going to be
distributing energy based on information
that is going back and forth and this is
an architecture that believe it is
dramatically different than what it is
today it is very scalable you can have
this architecture where you have this
intelligent power switch that that
monitors supply and demand and decides
when to buy or to sell energy in packets
this can be done within appliances
within homes within communities within
Connecticut with in towns and so on
finally challenge number three
information technology of course is
going to be part of the solution because
it's going to give us the information
that we need to do something about it
but information technology itself can be
can improve its own footprint quite
dramatically the idea here
letting ID lead the way by example I
used to look at the low-hanging fruits
here this slide tells you about the fact
that computing today is not proportional
what does it what it means and maybe you
can look you can look at this one first
this one gives you the states in terms
of density how much time a cpu spends be
utilized one hundred percent how much
time is spent being utilized about
thirty five percent and how much time
spent being idle as you can see CPU
spend quite a bit of time being there in
this typical operating region and that
would not be a problem expect except the
power consumption and wearing when you
see in this green line here really does
not scale all the way down to zero it
scales all the way to fifty percent so
when you spend your your time here
you're being very inefficient because
you're utilizing quite a bit of energy
for doing a little bit of work so the
the mantra that that we keep repeating
to ourselves is about doing nothing well
the emphasis on is on the well we want
to make sure that when I do nothing
would not waste energy and that's the a
that's one of the ideas of course its
energy proportional computing energy
flows in the data centers Randy card
kind of opened my eyes to the fact that
computing is really a big industry in
the sense in the sense of sheer physical
size and when you see square miles and
square miles of servers and of course
this has many implications service do
not only computer compute the power to
do the computing by switching
transistors but there's quite a bit of
ancillary power in order to keep them
cool in order to keep them organized and
control and so on and you can see the
breakdown on how this power breaks down
so there's quite a bit of opportunity
there if energy proportional computing
takes fall that is applied in a massive
scale is going to make a huge difference
okay so just to close three
opportunities where I t can make a
difference buildings and energy
collecting enough information making it
available to the people in the
appropriate format and giving them
giving them the tools to do something
about it not only giving the tools to
the people be something about it but
also automating some of that many of the
consumers in your homes are not
people their appliances and and so on
intelligent grids a distributing
managing the distribution of energy
using ideas that we learn in the last 20
years on how manager distribution of
information do it in a very scalable way
and flexible way and finally
proportional computing a data centers
and I'm not going to say much more about
it because we really have the three
experts City sitting over there on the
other side of the podium I do have to
say however that when it goes when you
go in the whole hierarchy there is quite
a bit to be done at the bottom when you
actually make the transistors and make
the computational elements that do the
sweet things and the ones and zeros
there is there are dramatic
opportunities there to reduce the energy
required for that fundamentally by maybe
a couple of orders of magnitude by using
transistors that depend on tunneling and
so on and there is quite a bit of
exciting work there as well in addition
to the high levels in closing and I see
Sankar wants to get me off the stage
this is a nice view that they can up
from beckley hills and that reminds me
that reminds us that's a problem worth
solving so I hope that it and get a good
discussion about it today thank
Thank You costa's and while you folks
that are getting warmed up to engage our
panel I'll just get them started a
little bit and if you'll allow me I'll
like to get them a chance to say a few
words and so if I could start with Peter
Peter how can we give people better
information to allow them to improve
residential energy usage okay I think
that's a good question you know we in
the slides here we saw the more
large-scale or commercial usage and I
think there is a lot to be done there
but of course that's harder you got our
retrofit buildings and so on another
place to attack is for the consumer and
we saw a little bit about that and we've
taken a similar approach of we have a
project called the smart meter of being
able to put a meter into the home to get
a better handle on where your energy
usage is going and we find that
consumers are able to reduce their usage
by about ten or fifteen percent just by
being aware of it and we didn't even
have to put any sharp spikes into the
thighs to think it to get people to do
that and and this is starting out really
just at the beginning right because this
is just you get a little readout and you
say uh-huh you know all my usage is
going to my refrigerator or my lights or
something you know what change can i do
to to fix that but it's but so far
that's just an individual looking at it
and we think there's a lot there's a lot
of opportunity for sharing as well to be
able to say you know what other people
are like me with similar loads we saw a
chart there where there was a two-fold
difference between similar households if
we can you can not just look at your own
data but say aggregate over lots of
people and then say now how do i get
myself from above the blue line to below
the blue line I think there's a lot of
value in sharing that kind of
information Louise Google's operations
have naturally pretty energy intensive
what Google doing to make its data
centers more energy efficient thank you
that's a very timely question since we
happen to actually have released quite a
bit of additional information about that
and over the past week or so if you
search at google for efficient data
center you're going to find a page that
actually has a bunch of data for a
summit we ran last week on wednesday
unfortunately on april first but that
wasn't the plan it was i don't think it
was the official the plan but you know
somehow we still had enough credibility
that people believe that it was either
gonna be true or entertaining so they
showed up and there was a summit that
had people from a lot of different
representations and in the industry or
the companies like amazon and ebay
industry groups like Green Grid were
present as well so anyway it was a
summit that to talk about energy
efficiency in the context of best
practice is not necessarily focusing on
what is the next crazy technology that's
going to solve that problem but instead
what can we do with technologies that
are available and inexpensive sort of
today to make data center so it's much
more efficient than they are so also
summarize or very quickly the state of
the art in that area and some of the key
things we talked about it's just to
tease you to ask you ask me a few
questions and I'll tell you more later
if that's the case but basically there's
the general impression of across the
industry and some studies to back it up
that data center is actually waste about
you know twice as much energy as it's
actually fad to computers right that's a
measure called pua that's fairly
standard in industry right now in which
you take all the energy that enters the
building and divides by the energy
that's actually given to computers and
networking switches and things like that
right and if that number is one you're
perfectly efficient if that number is
greater than one you're wasting
something right so the typical data
center out there it's probably above two
but the ones that actually there to
measure are probably averaging sort of
around two and that's when you hear
things people saying that what is wasted
on cooling and power distribution etc
for every what that's actually used for
computing that's what that there's that
you'ii of two and we've disclosed a
while back that our data centers
actually work on an average that's
actually you know waste one-fifth of
that amount of energy so our pua number
instead of being too is actually closer
to 1.2 in fact i think that the latest
numbers 1.19 which you know if you are
sort of in this industry you you
probably recognize that that's really
really ambitious sort of number and the
fact that this is not a demonstration
prototype but it's actually the average
of all or Google design data centers
it's actually you know in my view sort
of really impressive and not only the
demonstrates what can be HD that you can
cut waste by a factor of five but also
we were able to talk about how we
actually did that so we there's a lot of
things we did in the power distribution
and and in the way we cool data centers
some tricks that had to do with how we
actually design our servers as well and
none of these things are sort of you
know crazy technology that maybe is
going to be affordable in five years
right clearly we're a business that
turns a profit and you know we do that
because it's sort of good for our
business as well so the fact that we
were able to demonstrate those numbers
and actually tell people some insights
about how to achieve them I think was
sort of an interesting you know
existence proof that no you it can
actually be done today and it can
actually be done in a way that still
sort of very you know good for business
if you will and I'm happy to talk a
little bit more about this wonderful I'm
sure there'll be people who want to know
more let me ask Randy Randy if
information technology equipment really
consumes that much and does it really
consume so much energy in the net sense
given that there are actually savings
caused by not having to commute as much
not having to get into cars and planes
and what's the what do you know about
what the truth here is well as sort of a
will sound like a little bit of a
strange way of getting back to that
question I want to react a little bit to
what we said in some sense these
internet they
centers are example of the industrial
infrastructure of the 21st century right
I mean it's no surprise that Google's
Oregon data center is down the road from
a shutdown aluminum smelter because
people don't do that sort of thing today
they do internet data centers so in some
sense we've now companies like Google
have moved us into an industrial scale
of computation that is comparable to the
largest old-fashioned industries of
making a Luminum making steel and so on
except now we're moving electrons and
moving bits but the thing that's really
cool about it is that we can be a lot
more efficient and aware of how to do
that to achieve these kinds of levels of
puc pua efficiencies that are 1.2 just
point to watts for every watt that goes
into running a computer is pretty
amazing thing in terms of energy
efficiency so we could be a lot smarter
about how our industry evolves as we go
forward now coming back to Shankar's
question this is a very controversial
thing if you look at the data that the
consultants have put together the it's
sort of a little bit all over the map
but in general the amount of energy that
is consumed by information technology
equipment our home pcs or handheld
phones are the infrastructure and so on
is about today two percent of the energy
footprint of the world that doesn't seem
like a very big number but the
extrapolations forward into let's say
twenty twenty that number doubles so
it's one of the areas that's growing the
fastest especially fast in parts of the
world which are not necessarily using
the nice hydropower that Google for
example is using up in the northwest
part of the United States they're using
nice dirty old fashioned coal-fired
energy plants so to even say the you
know to factor in the footprint of the
information technology equipment you
can't exclude the nature of the
electricity and how it is generated when
you're thinking about what the real
environmental impact of that is so we
have to consider that as well but two
percent to an extrapolation forward of
about four percent as you go to 2020 and
then the things we've been talking about
is energy efficiency and Bill
and so on and in information technology
equipment but there's a much larger sort
of set of issues to think about which is
the efficiencies with which we live our
lives and do business how much what is
the energy efficiency gains of being
able to participate in a google project
without having to get on an airplane by
doing video conferencing instead of
actually I'm afraid all the Berkeley
supports staff from the College of here
we all jumped in our cars individually
probably drove down here so what was our
carbon footprint for this meaning to be
in front of you you really have to start
thinking about those things and
understanding that and understand the
way in which information technology can
help through remote telepresence through
being able to shift in time the kind of
work you do to make it more efficient to
I don't know how many of you are old
enough to remember the old yellow pages
ad of you know let your fingers do the
walking through the yellow pages that's
exactly what Google lets us do I have a
story of I looked inside my refrigerator
one day and one of the shelves had
broken I'm looking at this thing I'm
thinking to myself god this refrigerator
is like 10 or 15 years old there's no
way I could possibly find that part I
don't even know what number of
refrigerator this thing is i guess i
have to buy an entirely new refrigerator
typical engineering mindset right this
you know sort of five dollar part broke
i'm going to buy a new it i'm going to
buy a new refrigerator so fortunately
google existed and so I went well maybe
I should just check it says Westinghouse
on the side of the refrigerator I'll
said I like go to the Westinghouse
website indeed you're able to search the
westing at Westinghouse website and
they're smart enough to know you don't
know what the model number is they have
the pictures of all the refrigerator's i
can call it's that one and then from
there they have the exploded cad/cam
diagram of all the things inside it with
the part numbers so i could actually
order and be shipped the next day for
like five bucks the plastic part which
is the bracket that i needed to replace
and never left my house now that is now
it yet may have come by Federal Express
and you know a guy in a truck rolling
around and all that but I didn't have to
I don't even know where I would have
started to look you know what appliance
store do you go to
to try and figure out what this part is
so just to kind of sum up this is just
the beginning of how information
technology can dramatically make our
society more energy efficient way beyond
our individual use of computers or the
energy in our houses just by the way we
live into business so I think there's an
exciting aspect of that good
Shankar can I jump in there a little
jumping because you know maybe emphasis
for the question was there was a article
a while back saying how doing a Google
search is like boiling a cup of kettle
or something would seem to be way off
base and the way I look at it is if you
do a google search and you look at the
result for 10 or 15 seconds then your
body's doing consuming more energy than
Google is your computer is consuming
more energy than all the Google servers
did and if you have a light bulb on in
the room then that's also consuming more
so the Google servers are in fourth
place for that query good cuz it says I
like to you to pick up on what Peter
talked about so in zero energy homes the
earlier comments 0 energy ohms is this
you keep hearing about this is we have
air RV on this what do we do about
residential in addition to commercial
that's a very interesting question
because the concept of a zero energy
home has been discussed for a long time
and people actually can build zero
energy comes and they have been building
zero energy homes for a long time zero
energy home that will change the world
has to be a zero energy zero cost home
that the misery shouldn't cost more than
than the home it replaces or at least we
live and I'll allow you to use the
savings in the energy in that equation
even with that is soon all costs more
and today's technology cannot do it and
the reason today's technology cannot do
it is because not because you don't have
the materials to do it it's not because
you don't have the know-how the constant
thing is associated with the lack of
information once you have the
information on how a homo periods and
once you have built the appropriate
models and used information technology
for that then you you make a giant step
in that direction in the studies that
you have done
so that in order to go to zero energy
the first step is you have to do is to
conserve the energy that you consume and
that takes you eighty percent there so
you have to reduce your consumption by
five times before you spend your first
dollar to generate energy at home
because it's expensive and as I try to
saw in these few slides and some sir
many people realize you cannot consume
your energy that you cannot reduce your
energy consumption by that factor
without changing the way you do things
an information technology information
availability i think is going to be
critical there so you know I've got tons
of things to ask them but I'd like to
have you give a chance if you don't mind
it's a completely unprovoked so I
apologize but I was having a
conversation Mike Orton CEO of crossbow
who's a sensor network company what
sensor networks and energy consumption
homes and all this could do together
Mike you heard to Peter and you heard
kosis you have can use the mic because I
think they're gonna record the the mic
out here and yeah I think it helps the
recording function too I guess I've been
we're doing sensor network work since
since your networks were around and
building them and trying to understand
for a while just as a personal hobby and
get asked question how can sensor
networks help you save energy and I
think one of the key basic fundamental
things is occupancy detection so much of
what what is on in a building is on just
because someone left it on so we've done
a lot of work with passive infrared
sensors which are micro power
consumption can live on batteries for
you know very very long periods of time
and using passive infrared sensors
across a low-power wireless sensor
network to detect when people are in a
facility or not in a facility and simply
turning things off when folks aren't
there is a very basic and simple way to
save a lot of energy I think another big
thing that that at least for the
homeowner and I'm very interested I want
to actually ask professor spanos a
question about how do you cut your
energy usage by eighty percent so I went
through in our house and tried to figure
out how to cut our energy consumption
down and found that the most effective
thing was the thermostat so
you know we we cut that back by about 4
degrees and that took about ten percent
off our energy bill right off the bat by
just reducing the heat by four degrees
what do you do to get to a 5 to 1 ratio
well five to one is going to take more
than reducing your thermostat five and
five to one is probably required
probably quite a little bit of
remodeling too and it's all it's also
going to require a little bit of
changing your expectations about what to
demand from your home there I was
surprised that shouldn't happy but it
was surprised to find out that
architects have been doing studies for a
long time now to define what is the
ideal environment in a building in a
home and it turns out that the ideal
environment is very subjective and
because occupants leave in what our
cadets call the memory space meaning
that once you used an environment you
become comfortable with it I come from
southern Europe and i came to the united
states at the time where condition it
was not very widespread in southern
Europe summers were still 100 degrees
and we're fine we used to it our
expectations were set that way if I go
back to Chris now of course everybody
has air conditioning at the wouldn't
imagine living in that so going five
times reducing the energy x factor five
we require both the information
technology i really like the idea of
detecting presence because obviously you
don't want to help addition a room that
nobody occupied so to light a room but
you will also require changing your
expectations about what comfort means
and people have proven again and again
that people can adopt two environments
and be very productive and happy that
while saving quite a bit of energy I
have one more question just to fall back
up on the folks that have done and I
don't know if some of the folks here
have signed up for the google smart
mueller trot trial I we tried to sign up
but we weren't weren't allowed on to the
trial guess it's a fairly narrow set of
folks but what people are averaging ten
fifteen percent what are they finding
were they doing to to get that energy
savings what are the lessons learned
from the beta users of that program
where do you want to take that
so Omar calm one of the engineers on the
project hi mom are i'm at i'm actually a
Berkeley student too so this is a quite
apt so what people often do I think two
things to look at in your home that
people often think about when they're
trying to reduce energy consumption and
one that a lot of people Rob Lee this
room don't think so much about but is is
sort of your base load so what your home
is always using that certain amount of
energy and and there's a lot of
questions of why that is and and so
anecdotally some people talk to us and
come and said well you know I learned
that the computer i always had on was
actually using 300 watts all the time so
just things like that so a lot of people
have shut those kinds of things down and
then there's of course the large
appliances so you think of old
refrigerators washers dryers so sort of
changing the timing of when you do those
things isn't gonna change consumption
but then if you if you reduce frequency
some people said they've reduced
frequency or they've sort of I mean
there's some there's one story of
someone who was making toast in their
oven so which which you know we didn't
have a toaster but if you get a toaster
you're going to you're going to see a
dramatic reduction when you're using
your oven say to heat your home or to
make toast so there's all kinds of
there's all kinds of things that and one
thing I want to point out here is is is
the importance this feedback is very
very good at motivating people who want
to make a difference and one of the
challenges I think we're facing that
we're all going to face is that everyone
in this room might be very interested
reducing power consumption but a lot of
people don't care and and so how you
motivate people is a big challenge that
we're trying to tackle as well so it's
not just feedback is not going to
motivate the person who doesn't care and
so how you generate motivation how you
get social groups involved how to get
larger groups involved is that is it a
challenge that we're also trying to
tackle so first of all we're only
instrumenting the whole home so the
smart meter the power meters is it is
the sort of the name of the project and
the technology and it will only show you
sort of the bigger things and so your
base loads you can't get very detailed
um measurements but if I show you this
graph I showed everyone graph on here if
someone's home you'd all be like oh that
looks kind of boring it's not that
interesting but first when it's your
home you know everything about it you
you can like see that little spike oh
that's when you know we were watching
the TV or when we turn on the dryer for
10 minutes people know what the the
graph says and they will tell you
stories until the end of time unless you
extract yourself from them because it's
a very very personal thing so uh so i
would say that people have been very
just willing to interpret this data and
very good at it okay could you use my
cake please tempeh tempeh yeah one
problem I I see that home energy price
is actually quite low right so um it
seems like the only way you can't
convince me go to use your solution is
to actually a lower the price of your
solution right you know in order to
motivate them to use it otherwise oh how
do you think I stat so this good price
as a signal it's also okay can you
actually broaden the question is is
price the only good signal so so so I
wasn't sure you mean the cost of the
solution or the cost of energy he said
oh okay yes oh yes yes you're right the
concept energy is low cost of energy is
probably going up and depends where you
live to write the cost of energy in New
York City is ridiculous cost of energy
in California is somewhat high the cost
of energy in a place like Toronto Canada
is very very low so so yeah energy
prices are not necessarily motivator but
one person we talked to here i'll give
another example we have this notion of
your sort of score relative to other
people in in like who are using the
system and i was talking this one woman
last night and she was saying how she
saw that her she was like only better
than say like forty percent of the other
users in the trial and this drove her
insane and so she had to reduce she had
to reduce her consumption to do better
and there was nothing about price so
we're what the motivators are and what
are the incentives that you can align
with people it's gonna be a challenge to
identify what works with what people
anyway you know the ones you talked
about is sometimes referred to as a
Prius effect
there are pious effect if you will like
it better conference do you find me the
discussion about price kind of assumes
that people have to give up something to
save energy and for the first twenty
percent or so usually they have to give
up nothing it means that you do not have
to illuminate the room when you're not
there means that you have to turn off
their conditioning you're not at when
you're not at home okay so i think
metering and visibility helps you do
that without really any cost to your
well-being it is beyond that point that
price let's build playing playing at all
Peter sensor networks can you baby so we
just do paraphrase the question so you
can tell a lot about what's going on if
you know what's in this building and
certainly I know of studies of dorm
rooms in dorm floors and Cornell being
instrumental at the subfloor level and
so on so what all should we be measuring
everything all the world's information
then we should be keeping track of all
of it uh I figured you'd say that no I
think that's a lot we need to know you
know I was just at Santa Cruz last week
talking to some of the statisticians
there that work on climate modeling and
they say you know we can make good
predictions you know we know you can
draw these graphs and as co2 goes up
temperature is going to go up but we
can't tell you there's gonna be this
amount of drought in this particular
area because they just don't have the
data and so we need better models we
need both better data for the models we
need to be able to collect what's the
temperature like what's the humidity and
all these other things in lots of
different places and then we need the
computing power to be able to deal with
those models and some of this is going
to be driven by big science and
governments and so on but I think a lot
of it can be driven by citizen
scientists right so if we make a
thermometer be a standard peripheral on
cell phone then everybody can be out
gathering that data and as people are
motivated to do so they can add
extra peripherals and gather more data
and start sharing it and start
participating hi Fred from UC Berkeley
so I actually have a question about not
only what measure but also where to
measure so one thing that we're seeing
about measuring electricity is that from
the very sort of endpoints of the load
tree is Hilda the AC outlets so you can
measure exactly what one appliance use
and the other approach is to measure
what the entire house or the entire
building is some sort of you know con
transformers on some sort of clamp on
sensor but they all have their problems
right you do not have the money to
measure every single thing that's in
your building at the outlet level nor do
you have the visibility using just one
sensor at the house so do you have been
some idea of what's the sweet sweet spot
in a measurement do you want to
basically go with the individual
measurement at the plans or sort of play
some tricks with load a grenade the very
top what's your view as the best
approach to this visibility cop vs. cost
I guess I was gonna jump in and just go
to some eccentric feet what was said
earlier it's always tempting and you
know very often the right thing to do to
measure everything right at some point
it's economically sort of not
advantageous I think that what was said
earlier I really believe that is true in
that if you have good enough time
granularity for your measurements for
the whole house it's fairly remarkable
how much you can tell and really if you
consider the fact that most of the gains
are going to come from big-ticket items
those are guaranteed to show up so it's
a first order approximation you know the
whole house sort of approach seems
personally to me very promising and
being kind of very much at that sweet
spot and that in that case the main
thing you need to do is actually to make
sure that you're not measuring that as a
daily average and in that case you
really don't have enough right or maybe
an hourly might even not be sort of good
enough right but if you begin to have
things that are sort of at the minute
granularity I think it's remarkable how
much you watch
you know about what's happening in
particular the big ticket ticket items
are not tough sort of relatively quickly
in that sense so so for the google
powermeter are you guys doing sort of
automatic disaggregation or is this
relying on the user to spot which part
of it is what well just for brevity a
reply for my colleagues here though the
users eyes are disaggregating things at
this point but let me ask you the
opposite question Louise so you know
there's a lot of activity on sort of
power low power technologies for
processors laptops mobile devices but
now from the micro to the macro what are
your views about sort of going from what
we're doing for small devices and so
doing doing nothing better for small
devices to bigger things like data
centers and so on yeah that's an
interesting sort of segue if you want to
move in so from sort of home appliances
all the way to sort of things like data
centers and sort of very briefly people
have been thinking about energy
efficiency of computing for a very long
time it was not just data centers that
got them to sort of begin worrying about
this right but the kinds of solutions
we've come up with are you know
reflective of the kinds of problems
we're trying to solve at the time so the
way I look at things big jumps in terms
of the way we solved energy efficiency
issues occurred maybe in 90s or so with
sort of mobile devices and the needs of
mobile devices and portable devices
right and things like sensor networks
for example and the characteristics of
Isis or so that you know they have to be
untethered so you have to worry about
battery life you may be you have to
worry about sort of your cell phone
being too warm in your hand or something
right but that's what dry drove sort of
innovations maybe sort of them for most
of the 90s right and then you know
around 2000 2002 or so then there was
another big research factor which is
temperature right for micro processors
in particular not just for all
electronics but really just for
microprocessor is important to remember
that and that drove a bunch of new
technologies for low-power sort of
electronics that really addressed peak
shaving of power for the objective of
controlling temperature on in micro
processors
what you see is that the solutions that
appear first of all I have only appeared
from microprocessor the rest of the
boxes sort of hasn't really benefited
from it because they didn't have the
severe temperature problems and
microprocessor have but also they didn't
really worry about energy they just
worry about temperature which is a
function of sort of power density and
things like that now if you begin to
think about data centers and that
connects to the energy if proportional
computing sort of things we've been
talking about this been mentioned
earlier it's it's a great start to be
able to have device that when they're
truly doing nothing like your cell phone
right now hopefully or your laptop
hopefully as well because the wisest
panel wouldn't be that interesting they
know then they're consuming kind of
almost zero power and we already know
how to do that relatively well and
that's going to work well for maybe a
lot of sensor networks of applications
as well but for a lot of other computing
and especially as you go through the
cloud computing infrastructure which has
Randy mentioned is sort of growing in
importance in terms of footprint they
are not like that they are not devices
are just on and off right they are often
just sort of ten percent utilized twenty
percent of your lives thirty percent
utilized right now until now we haven't
had the motivation to build devices that
are very energy efficient in that range
because we've sort of been sort of
riding these other research factors from
sort of managing temperature
microprocessors and making sure that
energy is well used on devices that are
mostly idle right so there's a new
interest right now instead of trying to
make sure that we we capture that range
of the or anization specter about things
that are kind of working a little bit
they're not working very hard or not
sort of not working at all but they're
doing some work for you and that's what
this energy proportional computing ideas
that comes about and what we're trying
to do is sort of to make sure that
people pay attention to this because
when you actually look at it there's a
ridiculous amount of low-hanging fruit
there I mean it's typically one of these
situations where we just maintain no
attention whatsoever to that so and
that's why servers are so incredibly
inefficient these days when you're
running them as sort of 30-40 you know
percent or so and the nice thing though
is that once you actually do that the
technology you
you develop for that are not just useful
for services for everything all right
they'll be actually beneficial to your
mobile devices as well right even if you
didn't begin thinking about that as
being sort of the bane the main sort of
issue so there are lots of different
ways to sort of think about energy
efficiency research the usage mode can
drive the kinds of solutions you have
right and that's sort of one of the
things we're learning right now when
we're beginning to see how to operate
really big data centers and try to make
sure that that's been done in the most
efficient way did I make just a
follow-on comment I know we want people
ask questions to one one of the things
that I find to be really interesting is
this whole notion of energy
proportionality when you start studying
all the elements of the energy system
you look at the HVAC systems the power
distribution systems and whether it's at
the board level or for an entire
building you look at transformers and
generators that are out in the
distribution and transmission
infrastructure none of them are energy
proportional they are all designed to be
most efficient when they are high highly
utilized so now when you think about the
advances we're doing at the computer
node level of having if we can reach
that dream of being able to have a nice
scale from when they're highly used to
when they're not very used of harnessing
reductions in energy demand what about
all the stuff that's feeding them they
don't work like that they work like you
know the original charts that we that I
actually Costa stole it for me and I
stole it from him by the way those
charts that were showing but those were
for computers and it's the exact same
issue for all of the physical systems
around us they're all optimized to work
at high levels of utilization so if you
want to be able to slide everything down
and harness energy advantages is from
doing it it doesn't stop at the computer
it goes all the way through the energy
system and each 0 cal alumni um first of
all just like to thank you guys for
coming out I actually live in a
neighborhood where all of the homes have
PV systems so I can speak to a lot of
the the positive feedback that goes
around on just you know I'm kind of
excited about the fact of competing with
some of the other homes but a lot of it
does come along you know there's a
monetary factor I'm actually generate
more than I'm consuming and I'm you know
a lot of that is because of the reports
that I'm watching along with that how do
you because there's actually a bill
that's going through the California
Congress about requiring builders to
provide PV systems as an option I know
that's going through and they're trying
to see if that can pass how do you guys
feel about legislation as a way of
pushing this kind of energy movement
forward are you taking it cost us yeah
specifically in the PV systems the way
the technology exists today
unfortunately they are so expensive that
you have to use out of the
characteristic to make it happen carrot
of course is to give enough incentives
stake is to mandate it you probably have
a PV system and you probably know that
even though you feel very good about it
you're not going to get your money back
haha types of energy right return the
ROI is obviously lastly the ROI is lost
and people are working very hard on the
technology of that try they try to use
they try to use materials radically
different than silicon because silicon
is extremely expensive semiconductor
grade silicon and but unless we find a
way to reduce its costs by may be a
factor of five don't think TVs are going
to compete with today's energy prices
maybe 20 years from now there would be
closer let me jump in about the
regulation story so there was a bill
those were in in the legislature last
year which said zero energy homes by
2030 18 or 20 25 or something that but
there's a writer in this bill which says
unless PV technologies mature in which
case you know so there's a little bit of
an out on it but what's driving the
legislation in California is really this
ab32 which is a cap on the greenhouse
gas emissions which garnish wats nagar
announced and really the rope so I so
the bigger question and I'm now is
really the role of regulation so I think
the the reason that they so I was party
to some of the Senate California Senate
and Assembly discussion you know I think
that the good thing is in calif
the sense that you cannot sort of have
punitive legislation that makes you
spend what do you spend in your
neighborhood to put in pv to get to
those zero energy I think what I've
heard Steve jus say is actually a little
more pessimistic than what caused that
says the factor of ten is really what's
needed to get closer to the zero cost
and you know but they're pretty upstream
technologies you know if you really want
them there's go go go to stay out no
it's okay don't say this is very useful
but I wanted to say you know because I I
was asked me for about a zero energy
home and I did not come out enthusiastic
about it there is nothing wrong about
the 0 at Z home but the generator home
is not fundamentally better than a Zener
and zero energy community and a zero
energy community is much more feasible
because all these renewables can be
produced at low cost at scale so zero
energy home sounds good but zero energy
community is probably the way to go and
then when you look at communities of
course I mean the reason you be able to
actually do some of investments in for
higher volume that sort of amortized
costs right for example you just
thinking about solar for example
boo-boos been involved in some projects
to sort of cheapen the costs of some
energy generation techniques and right
now we're sort of you know putting a
sort of relatively big bats on things
like solar thermal not photovoltaics for
example which as far as a parting
harnessing sort of Sun sort of energy
directly seems to be much more promising
but it is less likely and you know
better processes that that is something
that you have in your home but more
likely that you have sort of a DeCourcy
grandeur if one were to slice it I think
energy efficiency has to happen at home
and it's renewable production probably
needs to happen at the bigger scale to
make sense Adam yeah so I was wondering
I identified oh yeah sorry I'm Adam
cataldo i work at agilent technologies
and the research labs over there and
just interested in this energy problem
we're a measurement company so I'm
interested in you know what kind of
opportunities there might be for us in
this space but but but but specifically
with the the data center question one
thing I'm wondering is how does the
energy consumption
of running your server or using your
cell phone for that matter compared to
the energy used in manufacturing it I'm
just thinking that like I get a new cell
phone every year you know I get a new
computer maybe every two years and that
manufacturing energy might be you know
sort of worse because maybe it's made in
a part of the world where they burn a
lot of coal and you know it may be less
clean then then the energy consumption
that's right next to the hydroelectric
power plant or whatever who's going to
take life cycle costs life site well
when it comes to semi semiconductor
production studies have been done to to
to see how much of the energy goes into
production how much the the system burns
when it's running of course it depends
on the product some products are meant
to consume very little energy and use
very infrequently but if you use a high
power microprocessor that is used you
know well then only a trivial portion of
the energy goes to producing it most of
it is going to go to operate it does
that include like the cost of you know
the casing and everything else though
yeah but of course you can find counter
examples because some of my custom
electronics are meant to be used very
very little or with very little power
but semiconductor manufacturing has
improved in terms of energy and eternal
footprint ever metal food would bring
quite a bit another issue that sort of
from an environmental standpoint that we
haven't talked about that's really
relevant in it and you know it's it's
gonna be sort of in our typical tongs
sort of everywhere very soon is water
right and and that's sort of interesting
because a lot of the solutions we have
for example to run data centers very
efficiently is to use things like
evaporative cooling which use water so
in principle you think well maybe sort
of you're solving on problem sort of
creating another one right and that's a
ties to tie again to something that was
said earlier if you don't trace the
electrum from its source you actually
may sort of miss the big picture the it
turns out that if you actually don't use
evaporative cooling and you use
mechanical chillers right that don't
really sort of use any significant
amount of water in the entire food chain
of the electron you actually end up
being worse off because you so much more
energy and the production that energy
actually uses a tremendous amount of
water
right that the relatively small amount
of water that's dissipated on the
evaporative cooling ends up sort of
buying large sort of being a win right
so this is one of those situations where
you know if you sort of look at the
small part of the problem you may
actually act exactly in the wrong way
even if if you had sort of best of
intentions Adam by the way thanks for
asking your question because after Omar
got up there and talked I was thinking
maybe I should have gotten a new
refrigerator you reminded me of you know
maybe the total life cycle cost it's
good that I'm still running a 20-year
old refrigerator good thank you uh tony
chen i'm a cal alumni and so one
question i have is that energy
efficiency is not just about like you
know how you can save on energy right it
can also be the other way around like
you know how can you recycle the energy
right for example the google data center
generates a lot of heat right like you
know do you guys do anything or like me
there any research being done that you
can that forever like no pipe a heat
into the office next door right yeah so
this may be one of the few a criteria
upon which a data center is worse than
aluminum smelter in that yeah you know
machines and in particular the the heat
that's generated in the data center is
really low quality heat right it's very
low temperature and you know if you're
you know thermodynamics tells us that
the amount of sort of actual useful work
you can get from low-quality heat really
little so we're very limited in that
sense there's a couple of things we
could try to do one of them is convinced
a whole industry to allow their
electronics to run that's sort of 300
degrees Celsius or something like that
right in which case are wasted heat to
be sort of super good and the higher the
better you know unlikely that this would
be an end-to-end win but you know is
what shot the other thing you could do I
mean if you're very close to large
communities maybe some of this even low
quality heat can be used right to be
piped into homes and
like this ultra probably wouldn't be
enough to you know if the place sort of
very cold but you know that's something
that could be explored one thing that
some folks have done and in some areas
where they generate a relatively low
quality heat has been used for
industries that sort of have
fermentation needs right so you know if
you want to make beer or yogurt for
example low quality 85 you you should
say bio feelings are you good biofuels
so you know there but unbeaten so it's
it's not an impossibility but certainly
your options are much fewer than other
industries that actually generate much
better quality eat so let me support
Louise ears a Carnot efficiency is one
minus t1 t1 over t2 the problem is this
t1 over t2 is so close to 1 because of
the temperature but but you know the
bigger question I think thirty five
percent of the energy that we produce in
this country is wasted as heat fifty
five percent and the bulk of that of
course is in the power plants where you
do generation and then this question of
what you do with thermoelectrics new
materials I mean thermoelectrics of the
solution that we've touted for 20 years
but hasn't sort of fully arrived and
here is fifty five percent of our energy
input energy so that I think is a big
ticket item I just want to say one thing
we did do was was make a survey of
failures of disk drives and I think was
the largest survey that had been done
and we determined that you can actually
run them a little bit hotter than the
manufacturers recommendation so we can
turn up the temperature a little bit and
not worry that much about the cooling
costs we've actually done that didn't
saved us and tremendous modern cooling
yeah all right thank you kursus did you
want to say something no I just want to
say that when it comes to waste heat
places like Denmark for example they use
coal fire plants that they don't have
very good efficiency but they use the
waste heat from this file from these
plans to DC with hot water to two
communities and the overall efficiency
is about a hundred percent rate is very
close to that so there are opportunities
but not with low temperature heat
unfortunately
hi I'm Josh I'm hesitant to say which
company i'm from SL say it Intel because
my question deals with semiconductor
manufacturing and I know professor of
Spanish you've done a lot of work on
that side here's a question back in
berkeley you know in the micro lab for
instance we would waste tons and tons of
water di pure di water right just to
clean a few four inch wafers and now
that I'm in industry I realize that the
problem is ten times worse I used to
feel guilty about it back in the day but
now it's just it's tremendously wasteful
it seems so I'm wondering are there any
technologies out there that you know
that can make us feel less guilty about
this and it's important right because
it's like day in day out i go to work
and it's like wow I'm like the worst
person you know on the planet because I
enable this technology the other
question is I just as a follow-up and
then I'll sit down you mentioned power
distribution 50 or five percent wastage
that is so true and I think there's a
lot of effort now or should be in
localizing power generation so how what
can we do to really have literally
thousands of power distribution systems
maybe even you know in area the south
south area the size of bay area right so
can we get localized energy distribution
distributed locally I'm sorry thousands
of wet system like power generation
centers in the village in an area the
size of bay area for instance okay would
that help okay let me take your first
questions which is a electronics
manufacturing back in the early 90s when
there was quite a bit of present about
the ozone hole you remember that there
was quite a bit of pressure on
semiconductor manufacturing technologies
to clean up their act in terms of the
solvents that they put in the air and
the industry has responded and in fact
now now they're extremely clean on that
I suspect that when appropriate the
pressure at the legislative price
pressure applies to di water usage you
will see the industry becoming
recovering much better just to give you
an example which is not Sumiko document
about Peavy manufacturing people did
most people do not know that TVs that
will build 10 years ago the energy
consumption and the carbon footprint in
building them was so bad that it took
about 10 years of operation before they
redeemed themselves now this amount is
now this time has been reduced about six
months so the industry has also has been
driving in that direction so there are
opportunities of course not to address
your question about distributed energy
generation and this is something that I
think was reflected quite a bit many of
these things are built to operate at
scale and they are built to operate at a
hundred percent randy has complained
about transformers and distribution that
they are built to work at a hundred
percent only well turbines and
generators I really build to operate at
a hundred percent and it's a big waste
if they do not so in that regard I do
not really believe that distributed
generation is going to be the solution
because even though you waste a little
bit of power over the grid you make it
up with the efficiency of a big system
the only natural distributed generator
is a PV or maybe a thermal electric or
affair of the solar thermal at the scale
of the home and you have to wait until
the price goes down before that makes
sense Randy did you want to chime in
well I just you know I think it there
there does require some technological
breakthroughs on having efficient
smaller generation technology because
there is an economy of scale and things
are designed to operate efficiently at
large scale so but you talk to people
who know about things like gas turbine
generators and there are examples of
much smaller deployments that may not be
at the level of the home but might be
appropriate for a facility like the
Googleplex for example so there at least
four large you know university campuses
or industrial campuses or things like
that it can make sense to have which
would be the equivalent of a
neighborhood you know hundreds of homes
rather than the entire Bay Area on 11
distribution system you know there's a
whole other dimension to this which is
our current regulatory environment does
not allow us to do CIMMYT the ability to
truly share and
amongst the community you can operate
your own in fact you're sometimes
required to universities are required to
run cogeneration facilities and things
of that nature but if you really wanted
to enable I think the kind of
distributed generation that you're
talking about to drive the technological
developments to drive the manufacturers
to come up with a more scalable set of
technologies there has to be a way in
which energy is shared or there's a way
to build a more localized marketplace
and that requires some regulatory
involvement in order to open that up
because today it's so everything is
geared towards the large-scale utilities
as being the providers of energy and
delivering it to you and the entire
industry supports that particular model
so that has to be addressed as well as
the technology great Jeff Walz with
Google first off I'd like to
congratulate Berkeley for taking on this
this problem we have with energy and I
had a question on education when I was
studying Electrical Engineering a long
time ago I took a course called power
systems and I was the last class to take
that course because they decided that
the problem had been solved that we no
longer had to worry about that stuff and
the professor was about 90 and I think
he was retiring something so you know
the funny thing and I was at MIT a few
months ago and they said yeah we have
that problem too no one knows this stuff
anymore so I'm wondering what what is
Berkeley doing it seems like we've lost
a generation there who's teaching the
students and what kind of education what
kind of courses is it sounds like we're
getting onto the research goals here but
who's learning the new tools and new
techniques and that kinda all right
great crested all right panel you've got
it I think the professor's on the panel
should try and take a stab at that
particular question so taking the
observation of fellow colleagues who are
or were department chairs up here really
being being unresponsible forces I have
to say that you being in the San
Francisco Bay Area both Stanford and
Berkeley you know we were very early in
the days of semiconductors and if you
were to go visit berkeley or imagine
Stanford in 1950s the buildings were
filled up our system engineers and the
hot thing to do was to bring in young
new faculty members who knew about
semiconductors and within a generation
the balance when the entirely the other
way that we have lots and lots of people
like Coast us over here who are experts
in semiconductor technologies some even
down to the level of our last remaining
power systems faculty member really
knows about things that are you know
integrated power supplies and things
that at that sort of medium scale level
so it's true that it places like
Berkeley Stanford and MIT surprisingly
because we've all been on the forefront
of the semiconductor revolution the
knowledge of power systems on the macro
scale has been lost it's interesting
that a lot of being I'm sure there are
many people in the room who have gone to
Big Ten schools Midwestern schools those
kind of places still have power system
engineers by the way but maybe this
isn't such a disadvantage because now
there's an opportunity to really take a
new 21st century view an information
centered view of what power systems at
from a scalable view of power systems
from the small to the large aware of the
kinds of applications like data centers
and so on this is not your mother or
father's power system that we're looking
at for the 21st century it's a very
different kind of beast I think it's a
huge challenge for the universities to
really think through what is the
educational basis of that at Berkeley
our colleague actually Seth Sanders who
is in here today pioneered and push
forward this idea of an
interdisciplinary energy course that
we're teaching this semester where we've
got people who know about buildings and
know about or trying to know something
about distribution systems all the way
through to the turbines to the
mathematics of energy markets we're
trying to figure out how to integrate
all of that new knowledge into a
coherent set of curriculum for what
graduate students should know about
energy systems and I think that's just
the beginning of a very important set of
activities that have to go on to
understand what the educational
component of that is is not much to add
I'm not gonna make any apologies for not
having a power system at Berkeley the
decision was made long before my time
but I think it was the right decision at
the time because information technology
was the way to go and now puts us in a
position that to use really 21st century
tools to this problem and to look at
this problem differently so let me take
one more question of the audience and
then I got a question for each of you so
please okay it's kind of a maybe a crazy
a question than what some of the other
people are Scott please I decided oh
yeah my name is sarah she chopra um as a
scratch uh is there any
interdisciplinary work that's being done
between engineering departments because
i know that this problem of managing
heat and heat loss is not uncommon
across disciplines like you're saying
you know fifty percent of the energy is
just wasted to eat I was thinking of one
example where uh dry fuel storage for
nuclear power plants if you have they
spent nuclear fuel rod that's very hot
as to sit it has to be safe but it needs
to be cool to what all those things are
called passively with concrete so is
there any type of research that's being
done or are you aware of any topic also
a kind of sorry look I think part of
what we've taught you here is that we
are gearing up at Berkeley to do
something substantive in the area of
sort of addressing two pieces you know
certainly energy efficiencies but also
new generation technologies where the
focus certainly on buildings
transportation I think this biofuels
story is often running it Berkeley and
that's in pretty good shape the other
part is about industry and that includes
cement glass even these aluminum
smelters you know three percent of the
carbon dioxide is produces and cemented
so green cement and all of that are also
big agenda item the work is wonderful
because you know even though what one
thing I'd like to add to what randy said
is even though
we sort of down scaled our energy
efforts luckily for us we had lbl next
door the Department of Energy Lab which
really kept through this period when we
downscaled our own efforts fantastic
material science division which have
been thinking about novel materials
buildings energy efficiency is
technologies division a lot of the
people including current science advisor
to the president John Holdren came out
of a lot of these programs so now I
think the strategy is to gear up and
citrus I think with sort of an example
for us of a multidisciplinary initiative
which pulled in social legal to the
so-called LC economic legal social
implications of the technology I think
we're going to try to do the same thing
for energy exactly how you will do it
will reveal before April 1 2010 has that
its losses it will it you know a lot of
it is resurgence you know I have to
share with Randy and co-stars you know
it's not so bad that we really sort of
skipped you know we brought to a
termination one set of technologies for
energy and now I think it's going to be
a new set of things you know the Randy &amp;amp;
Co starts talking about an Internet like
model so we ran these phrases from a
Industrial Age infrastructure for power
to a internet like infrastructure for
for Power and Energy Materials you know
we've invested 10 years in nano
technology nano science nanotechnologies
and so exactly how we're going to use
this you know let's talk not of using
the silicon but ferrite sand sulfides
and so on to make you know rust making
pv out of rust so those are kinds of
things that you can do if you're
starting with a clean slate and that's
so I think that so you'll see as gearing
up to do something it'll be pretty it's
lb Albert Lea so you know Steve Chu
taught me one thing since I started he
said Bradley means university california
berkeley plus LVL and he really lived
this and certainly made me a believer
and that sort of how we're going to be
sort of presenting
energy strategy so I'd like to ask each
one of you in turn if there's one thing
you would like to give as advice to
President Obama about what he should do
it is only one night you can see it so I
think should we start with You Louise
and just sort of work our way down I was
hoping you gotta start at the other end
oh if you prefer easy you're the first
one everybody else will have to say
something different house haha what
would you rather okay but you're right
well you know I guess I'll volunteer one
thing I suppose the I mean you have to
look at the big ticket items right so
energy production and transportation
right sort of you know a general focus
on these areas seems to be a big deal
right and and my understanding of what I
hear from the current administration
seems to be that they sort of understand
that information technology is the in a
blurring sort of I don't know the the
Keen abling but certainly one of the top
key enabling technologies for further
efficiencies on both of these industrial
sort of areas so if it's indeed the case
that you know they are sort of going to
be focusing a lot on that and sort of
understanding that you know information
technology is the key component sort of
in sort of unlocking the potential
efficiencies in those solutions that
would be a sort of keep going that
direction super Randy well I think my
favorite thing would be to push for a
carbon tax I think really we need the
economic incentives to get people to
understand the true cost of energy and
to facilitate the investment in the
technologies the driving forward with
new more efficient technologies because
right now let's pin several view of said
during you know the last hour energy is
really cheap well is it really cheap do
we re really cost accounting for all the
implications of its generation
distribution and usage can we have a way
of recapturing that and use that as an
economic incentive for building more
efficient systems and for
really triggering the development of new
technologies I think I think that it's
going to take a tremendous amount of
political will to do that because all
the standard answers are we can't afford
it we're not going to be competitive
it's going to cost us too much it'll put
people out of work etc etc but unless we
do that we can't move forward in really
getting the investment in these new
technologies Europe is doing it why
can't we yeah that was gonna be my
question if you had started so you know
giving me another five minutes I was
going to answer exactly Peter and I come
after Randy rather before so I get that
advantage so that's certainly good one
and I guess the way I look at it is you
can use that kind of advice to
simultaneously solve energy climate and
the financial situation right because
you can form a new industry and we can
be at the forefront of that industry and
I think important way to look at it is
to say it's not that capitalism is
broken it's that we were just doing it
wrong and you have to internalize the
externalities or else everybody cheats
and if we get that out of the system and
build a system where we're trying to
optimize the right thing rather than the
wrong thing then we get back on track
very good your green Custance I was
gonna say you had the last word but we
gotta give it back to Louise but you
have to say something new right all
right i mean i think around eight
capture did in the sense that you need
the characteristic but i'm going to say
that again having come to this country a
long time ago but i still can concede
you know with some clinical distance we
have been spoiled for generations with
abandoned cheap energy and you have a
creative build our lives around that
model we commute long distances we live
in big houses we do not mind if their
conditioning is running or if the heat
is on e what nobody's there you can
mitigate some of that by of course a
carbon tax bye-bye pricing everything
but the shock that the economy will be
huge if we really try to price that out
and and i think that the area education
breaking us out of this mold I don't
know how to do it but I think that would
be a very high priority to get us into a
mindset that we
care and I don't think we're there yet
okay Louise you have the last but this
is gonna be real advice I'm gonna
personally relay it so yeah I think you
you should just think Randy with you and
not every sir all right thank you all
very much before I said I think the
highlight of these evenings of a chance
to to sort of have a lush moving I'd
like to thank the panel I'd like to plug
the poster folks who like to just sort
of tell you who they are and what the
posters are so that while you do the
networking and partake of the food and
drinks and the wonderful hospitality of
our hosts the I'd like to say there's a
out here is coupling renewable energies
with flexible electricity demand
periodic oh skin rang and Thomas take
half here climate navigator with Nina
Nina and K actually can you folks
identify yourselves the first three okay
good and then the climate navigator this
is an attempted really trying to measure
carbon footprint for and this is Nina
Gary Gary Baldwin here and Mark Cuba tea
and then a silicon carbide harsh senses

Evan Evan ritzel there you are and I
think Fred Fred what's your post a cold
yeah so as wireless sensor networks for
building efficiency with David color
that's the poster out here and finally
before I'd like to thank the panel but
I'd like to thank our hosts and
especially Sunita for and her staff or
pulling this event together and I invite
you all to sort of enjoy the rest of the
evening and each other's company and
