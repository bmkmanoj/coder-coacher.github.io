computer science and probably in your
first programming course there was this
little exercise on the stable marriage
algorithm trying to figure out how to
match up men and women and hospitals and
residents no lad well today we have as
our speaker owl Roth is the world's
expert on this subject I would say it's
written a very well-known book called
the two-sided matching problems and he's
here to tell us a bit about some of his
practical experience with mechanism
design how thanks al thank you I'm glad
to be here so I thought I'd start with a
question why can't the Google cafeteria
serve horse meat and it turns out
there's one reason is that it's against
the law in California to serve horse
meat for human consumption but the
longer answer is that the reason it's
against the law is a lot of Californians
don't think not only don't they want to
eat horsemeat themselves they don't
think you ought to eat horse meat and
this isn't a relic of some wild west law
this was passed by referendum in 1998
about as many people voted for it is
voted for gray davis as governor that
year so so this is your your fellow
citizens who have opinions about what
you ought to eat in the Google cafeteria
and notice there are no laws in
California against eating cockroaches
right so the problem isn't that people
don't want eat cockroaches I mean but
people don't want to eat cockroaches so
there's no need to have a law against it
people do want to eat horsemeat but
there's a law against it so I want to
talk one of the things I want to talk to
you about today is repugnance and i'm
going to use repugnance to describe
transactions that some people don't want
other people to engage in that that's
what i'll call a repugnant transaction
and eating cockroaches isn't repugnant
in that sense it's just disgusting so
the law of supply and demand takes care
of cockroaches but but as a market
designer I occasionally have
conversations in which people say to me
you know you can't do that about
something that I propose to do and
sometimes they sometimes it's repugnant
I'll tell you about some things that
you know that get that kind of reaction
sometimes just words like unfair or
inappropriate or unprofessional you know
so so I want to think one of the things
I want to think about that I've been
forced to think about as I design
markets is is the fact that people have
ideas about transactions that that mean
that you maybe you shouldn't do all of
them and sometimes this can be
consequential later in the talk i will
talk to you about kidney exchange and
things about about kidney transplants
and notice it's a felony in the united
states to knowingly acquire receive or
otherwise transfer any human organ for
valuable consideration for use in human
transplantation so if you wanted to sell
me your kidney that's a little bit like
wanting to sell me horse meat in
California it's against the law yes I
can't so you have another question every
transaction opponent if there's multiple
sources for a product so with verizon
label a transaction with singular is
repugnant I'm not trying to give an
axiomatic definition here i'm talking
about kinds of transactions mostly
speaking that have laws against them
okay so but you're right i'm not going
to give you an axiomatic development of
repugnance i think it'll be clear later
in the talk i'll give you a list of
things that people find repugnant among
them kidney sales and loosely speaking
the way I run into this in my experience
is is when I propose a market design of
some sort that that I sometimes run into
problems with with that stop us from
designing markets the way we'd like to
because some kinds of transactions are
repugnant but as an economist as a
market designer I sort of expected to
learn the other lessons i'm going to
tell you about today what kind of market
failures create needs for new market
designs but i was a little surprised to
learn about repugnance but the other
lessons were more the kind i expected to
learn i'm going to tell you about
markets that fail because they're not
thick enough they can't the marketplace
doesn't provide thickness it doesn't
bring enough people buyers and sellers
together sometimes when markets get
thick they also get congested you have a
lot of buyers and sellers and there are
a lot of transactions that you have to
think about you don't have time
to think about them to process them and
it also has to be safe in various ways
you have to be able to enter this market
safely as opposed to transacting outside
the market so I'm going to tell you a
bit about those kinds of market failures
including reasons why some more kids
don't exist at all and what it is that
market designers can do a little bit too
to help out so as Hal mentioned I've
been involved a lot with medical labor
markets of various sorts and I'll tell
you briefly about some contemporary work
that you're 'legally is sitting here and
I are doing it for certain kinds of
medical subspecialist these days and
then I'll also tell you about kidney
exchange I'm not going to talk today
about other kinds of markets
particularly as I just learned that this
is an hour talk and not an hour and a
half talk so let me tell you how some
markets lose thickness will get to
repugnance again later okay so so what
you'd like when you go on the labour
market is to be able to consider a lot
of possible jobs when you're being
offered a job and when you're hiring
when your google hiring people you'd
like to be able to look at a lot of
computer scientists and and people like
that but in some markets and doctors
were certainly one of them employers
start to compete with each other by
trying to hire people earlier and
earlier in advance of employment so so
doctors start their employment only
after they graduate from medical school
but around the 19 well in the early
1900's doctors were hired after four
years of medical school by 1930 they
were being hired around the middle of
their senior year by 1940 they were
being hired two years before they were
going to graduate so something funny had
happened in that market and it's
something that we see in contemporary
markets as well law graduates who want
to clerk for appellate court judges in
recent years have been hired for in
advance of graduation and and and of
course when what's going on is some kind
of competition here when some people
start to hire early their competitors
have to hire early too and there can be
big information losses when you hire a
medical student two years before he
graduates from medical school you you
are missing a lot of information that
you would like to have about your
employees right they haven't met
patients yet and there and the
of course also missing information that
they would like to have they haven't met
patients yet they don't know whether
they want to be surgeons or whether they
faint at the sight of blood and one of
the things you see as as these markets
become early is that the offers also
become very short so that that people
who are getting jobs often are faced
with a single offer that they have to
say yes or no before they can find out
if there are any other offers so
presumably when you guys all had offers
from google you could also wait long
enough to see whether other employers
want to hire you and you could weigh
different offers but in many of these
markets that ability goes away so turns
out this is quite a common phenomenon
sometimes words have entered the
language so so for instance fraternities
and sororities are social organizations
on american colleges their recruitment
drives are called rush well that turns
out to that word comes from unraveling
it turns out in the late 1800s those
organizations used to compete for
seniors and then some of them started to
rush to try to recruit members earlier
and today they compete for freshmen I'll
tell you about medical specialists today
undergraduate admissions you know
depending when you went to college there
have been times in the last decade when
elite colleges admitted more than fifty
percent of their entry classes in
various forms of what were called early
admission that again made the market
thin typically if you wanted to be
admitted to Princeton say early
admission you could only apply to
Princeton at the time you applied and
that stopped you from considering
multiple offers for financial aid and
things like that so a lot of these
markets that have unraveled when you
look at lots of these markets a lot of
them that unravel they try to fix it by
bypassing rules about uniform dates and
that seldom works so they're going
earlier and earlier you look at the
trade journals and they're saying to
each other we shouldn't hire so early
this is really destructive let's not
hire till a certain time but that tends
not to to solve the problem that that
caused the unraveling so it's seldom
serves as a solution to suggest dates
some of the markets I'm going to tell
you about have gone to centralized
clearing houses and I'll tell you a bit
about that and in particular the market
i'm going to mostly concentrate on today
has made a round trip all of these
arrows are our transitions i've seen in
some market
I've been involved in so those
clearinghouses let's let's think a bit
about what are the characteristics of a
clearinghouse that can can help solve
that unraveling problem and typically
the property of a clearinghouse it's the
one that that Hal referred to in the
computer science problems is a good
clearinghouse one that turns out to be
successful in the world is one that
produces stable matching so so the way a
medical Clearinghouse works the way
doctors get jobs is in their senior year
of medical school now they they submit
rank order list of places they'd like to
work and the residency program submit
rank a quarter lists of people who have
applied to them and then a matching is
produced and for a clearinghouse to be
successful it has to produce a matching
that that never has the property that
you and I aren't matched to each other
but we both rather be matched to each
other that would give us the incentive
to go outside away from the
Clearinghouse and transact turns out you
know in canoes one of canoes spokes
maybe several of canoes books they
discussed the the deferred acceptance
algorithm there are simple ways vast
algorithms even for large problems that
get you stable matchings here's a
straightforward kind of description of
one you say the students list choices
and the schools or students and schools
here you could say firms and workers
each student applies to the top school
on their list the schools collect the
applications they only keep as many as
they have room for and they reject the
rest but the ones they keep they haven't
accepted yet they're just holding them
that's why it's called a deferred
acceptance algorithm everyone who's been
rejected applies to their second choice
the schools now look at the applications
they've got the ones they held from
before and the new ones that they've got
they keep the set they like the best
reject the rest and the algorithm only
stops when no new rejections are issued
which could happen either because all
the offers are being held or because
some students have run out of places
they want to apply to and the theorem
duda galen Shapley is that the resulting
outcome is stable there can't be a
student in a school who would both like
to be matched to each other who warrant
the proof is very simple if I'm a
student and I would rather be matched to
you than to
the school on match to it means you're
higher on my list if you're higher on my
list it means I applied to you before I
applied to the school I'm now matched to
and you rejected me so if I would rather
be matched to you you wouldn't rather be
matched to me turns out an additional
property of this theorem is that it's a
dominant strategy for the students to
state their true preferences you can't
do better than to rank the places you're
applying in the order in which you'd
like to to work at them so that's a
that's a property that makes it safe for
students to participate in this they
don't have to engage in complicated
strategic games and loosely speaking
places that are stable you know you look
around the world at matching algorithms
the ones that are stable listed in the
first column and whether they succeeded
in holding unraveling in the second
mostly not completely you yes is in the
first column or associated with the s's
in the second column and nose in the
first column are often associated with
nose in the second column it turns out
because it's not a because there are
different things going on with with each
of these actual markets it's also nice
to look at this in the laboratory where
you have much more control and where you
can definitely gain support for the
hypothesis that it's a good idea to
produce a stable matching now in the
nrmp match the the the actual medical
match and in in other complicated
markets the the matching that has to be
done is more complicated one of the
interesting problems for medical
matching is there are now a lot of
couples who need pairs of positions
there are some other complications as
well so actual stable matches that get
used in medical clearing houses are a
little more complicated the one that I
helped design the Roth parents and
algorithm is now used in lots of markets
so we've gotten lots of experience with
them the the blue ones are or Roth
parents and the one I want to tell you
about is one that failed ok I want to
tell you a bit about the market for
gastroenterologists most of you are too
young to know what a gastroenterologist
does but you know just wait till you're
50 but but but I'm not just going to
talk to you about their labor market uh
Hal knows I'm just going to talk to you
about their labor market they were in a
match for a while and unusually they're
in a stable match a new
surely it failed they departed from the
stable match i want to tell you their
story and how Muriel and I help them
rejoin clearinghouse and why they wanted
to what it is about being outside of the
match that that caused this failure okay
so who r gastroenterologist not what do
they do I won't tell you that they they
are a sub-specialty of internal medicine
so the way you get to be a
gastroenterologist is you graduate from
medical school you go through the
medical match and you become an internal
medicine resident which you do for three
years now after those three years you
can become a gastroenterology fellow
eventually become a sub specialists or a
board-certified subspecialist but of
course you could be hired to be a
gastroenterology failure fellow at any
time during your residency ideally you'd
like to have most of your internal
medicine residency done so you can
decide whether you want to be a
gastroenterologist or maybe a
cardiologist or a pulmonary disease
specialist or one of the other internal
medicine specialties and similarly as a
gastroenterology program director I
would like you to be able to go through
as much of your residency as possible so
I can figure out who are the good
doctors and who aren't because not
everyone gets to be a subspecialist okay
so these guys had a match for ten years
they lost it and and and so consequently
mirror and I are able to investigate
what happens in the absence of a match
compared to a match and I want to tell
you a bit about the timing and the
timing of the market I already told you
what's going to happen there they're
going to unravel and what that does to
mobility who matches to whom and to
wages and will tell you too much red
wages it doesn't do anything to wages
but but there was a class action lawsuit
that suggested that it did something to
wages and and this is the kind of
problem that as market designers we
approach in lots of different ways you
know we we approach it theoretically we
can prove theorems about this market we
can look at lots of field data we can
bring it into the laboratory we can
survey the market participants so just
incidentally here's a bunch of papers
but muriel needle e nick mckinney debbie
Proctor on my co-authors but what i
wanted it the reason i show you this is
just to give you the idea of the kind of
calm
sation that's involved in changing a
market so the the papers in black are
published in economics journals the
papers in red are published in medical
journals papers in blue or experiments
the you know the thing about market
design is not only is there the science
of what you have to do but there's also
lots and lots of explanation and
persuasion and coordination so so
getting markets adopted is an
interesting fun thing to do so let me
tell you what happened to timing of
interviews and what I'm showing you here
is a cumulative distribution of when in
the year internal medicine fellowship
programs that that continue to
participate in the match when they
interview and what you see is they
basically don't start interviewing until
January there's hardly any interviewing
going on then they interview they're
mostly done by April and the matches in
June okay these are guys who are
preparing for a match in June unlike
gastroenterology which started to go
earlier and earlier so if you look at
the time when say forty percent of
interviews had already commenced what
you see is if you're in a match sub
specialty that doesn't happen till
februari more or less but even ten years
after the match every year the
gastroenterology market was moving
earlier and earlier loosely speaking
what was happening is because people are
going earlier and earlier because
they're making exploding offers more or
less here's a picture of that here's the
people who have open offers the
employers who have open offers at any
moment during the year and what you see
is it's pretty dispersed you know here's
a here's a moment at which a quarter of
the programs have already finished
making offers a quarter haven't started
to make offers yet and a quarter are in
the midst of making offers so if you
want to be a gastroenterologist not only
do you have to decide a whole lot
earlier then when you decide whether you
want to be a cardiologist but you can't
even interview a lot of the
gastroenterology programs at the same
time right so you interview in a
gastroenterology program they make you
an offer you have to say yes or no
before waiting for a program that you
might prefer but but that isn't going to
start interviewing for a while so so it
was a thin market here's another graph
of that at any moment less than forty
percent of the
for the employers have offers open so
there's no time at which you can go on
the broad gastroenterology market okay
you you more or less get offers when
they come and from whom do your offers
come in such a market they come from
people nearby you in in your hospital in
a hospital near your city because what
this is a graph of his mobility and from
you know from 1977 through you know 2004
and what you see is over time mobility
grew that here's the start of the match
and here's basically the end but that
after the match it collapsed it it
started to go way down and and and
what's happening here what you're seeing
here is you're less likely to change
hospitals you're less likely to change
cities you're less likely to change
states then you're used to because you
don't get many offers and instead of
having a big national market the market
for gastroenterologist collapsed into
lots of local markets so presented with
this evidence the gastroenterologist got
ready to start a match again and the
question was and I mentioned the you
know coordination there's a lot of
different organizations of
gastroenterologist so to agree on
anything lots of people have to be
persuaded okay but they agreed to start
a match again and then the question was
but how should they do it but what they
wanted to do is they want her to move
the hiring date back later a year so
we're all in this together we're all
gastroenterology directors and we say to
ourselves you know this is crazy the way
we've been hiring let's wait a year and
we all agree to do it then we go back to
our shops and everyone says how do I
know you're gonna wait right we've all
been hiring a year too early we've all
agreed to wait a year how are we gonna
do this I'm afraid that you're gonna
hire people early and lock them up and
I'll wait for the match and and the the
good guys will be gone and we started to
get emails our gastroenterology
colleague who did the real work and took
the lead an organization is Debbie
Proctor and she sent us an email where
she said I'm getting three or four
emails per day basically on that subject
saying
I want to make sure my competition is in
the match and that they don't cheat the
question is how to do this how to give
how to design the market so that
everyone has confidence that they can
all participate and not suffer from not
cheating so what the gastroenterology
professional organizations did is they
adopted a policy they didn't feel they
had the authority they didn't have the
ability to enforce any action on
gastroenterology fellowship programs so
sitting here we are we're all
gastroenterology fellowship directors
and sitting together in our professional
organization we all say you know there's
no way to stop you from making early
offers and so what what we propose to
them is that they empower the applicants
the residents and say you know if
someone makes you an early offer they
shouldn't have done that they are a bad
guy and you can accept the early offer
and later turn it down and it turns out
some of you may be familiar with that
policy because that's a policy that
American graduate schools adopt for
their graduate programs if you get a
letter from the department of economics
at Harvard admitting you to the ph.d
program it comes with a policy signed
formulated by what's called the Council
on graduate schools Council of graduate
schools which is also signed by hundreds
of American Universities all the
universities you've heard of and what it
says is it says you don't have to answer
us before April fifteenth and if someone
else and everyone has agreed that they
won't ask you to answer offers of
admission before April 15 but if someone
else asks you to answer you may say yes
and later you may change your mind as
long as you do it by April fifteenth and
so with this assured students is that
they wouldn't they wouldn't be cut out
of the market they could keep going on
interviews and what it and it of course
made it very unprofitable to make those
early exploding offers because you could
no longer lock up the candidates if they
got a better offer later they could take
it yeah
absolutely so so it's going to make it
unprofitable to make early offers and
rather you should wait to go through the
match okay so here's the the match you
know what so the met the policy says
said the policy that they adopted says
offers you accept in the match or
binding offers you accept early or not
okay so here's the resolution and again
you notice for professional
organizations have to agree to it so
once again there's lots of coordination
and persuasion that goes on says the
resolution concerns the conditions
surrounding fellowship offers the
general spirit is that each applicant
should have an opportunity to consider
all programs for making a decision and
be able to participate in the match and
therefore seeks to create rules that
give both programs applicants the
confidence that applicants and positions
will remain available to be filled
through the match and not withdrawn in
advance of it and then what it says is
if some applicants may be persuaded or
coerced to make commitments prior to the
match they can nevertheless participate
in the match by resigning the accepted
position okay so would it so they can't
enforce rules on on their colleagues on
the other gastroenterology fellowship
directors but what they're saying here
is we can sure take the fun out of
making early offers because you won't be
able to capture the good candidates sort
of a jurisdictional question which is um
if they can't
enforce that the participating
institutions cannot make early offers
how could they override in the
contractual commitment of a student that
agree to know right so there is this
question of interfering with contracts
and the AJ's lawyers got involved and
and we got involved little too and our
advice was of the of the following
practical sort we said you're not going
to have a lot of broken contracts if
these are your policies you're not going
to see many early offers and this
problem will go away and that's by and
large what happened in other words
because remember most of the fellowship
directors want to wait for the match my
problem is not that i want to make early
offers my problem is I'm worried that
you're gonna make early offers and tie
up the good guys so that I better make
them offers before you do but now that
I'm assured that I have a reasonable
chance of being able to talk to them you
know there's always the question of if
you decided to sue some medical resident
and require him to perform none of these
went to court and indeed when the match
operated it operated very well other
words this made the early offers go away
it gave the employers the confidence
that that the match would work once you
get enough people using the match now
now it's easy for applicants to turn
down early offers because there's a big
thick market coming the problem was in
that transition when when you sort of
say gee everyone's always hired two
years in advance you've just made me an
offer two years in advance it looks
pretty good I'd love to wait but if no
one waits there I'm not waiting for
anything but what we did is we helped
make the market thick we helped make the
match thick and it's now run through its
second year as well we haven't analyzed
those data yet but maybe this weekend
all right now just incidentally we're
talking to orthopedic surgeons these
days and they have very similar problems
almost identical but some of the
orthopedic surgeons don't think they can
use the same solution they think that
for other reasons like not the
legalistic ones but the repeated game
ones they think that orthopedic surgeons
can't turn down fellowship offers that
they've already accepted
okay that that the world is too small if
I say to you I'm coming I just have to
come on the other hand they believe that
they can take punitive action they think
they are professional organizations are
more powerful they think that they can
stop you from presenting papers at
academic meetings if you're a bad actor
in the market so they're there now
exploring those things federal judges
who hire law clerks they have the worst
of both worlds law students can't break
promises they make two federal judges to
appellate judges and the judicial
conferences can enforce anything on the
judges so right now they're having the
full set of market problems without an
apparent solution in sight that is the
same nice clearing house about which we
can prove the same theorems isn't going
to work for the judges until they solve
some of their other problems let me just
before I move on to other things let me
tell you what it's like to be on the
market to be a clerk for an appellate
judge okay they have exploding offers so
well we have a paper where we we survey
people we get some quotes I just want to
show you one which is almost like a
haiku about the job market someone said
the following he said I received the
offer via voice mail while is in flight
to my second interview the judge
actually left three messages first to
make the offer second to tell me that I
should respond soon third to rescind the
offer was a 35 minute flat okay so so
judges are tough you know and there's no
judicial body that can police them so
until until judges can't rescind the
offers they make it's going to be very
hard and especially since law students
can't Greg promises to judges that the
you know in economics where we're fond
of talking about how you can't get
efficient contract efficient outcomes if
you can't make binding contract but the
market for law clerks is one where they
can promiscuous lee make binding
contracts because all the verbal
contracts are binding and so they have a
lot of problems having to do with that
we have some similar things alright let
me switch gears now tell you about a
different set of very different markets
not labor markets where thickness was
also the issue and i want to talk to you
about kidney transplants and that's sort
of how i began because you
remember the national organ transplant
act says you can't buy a kidney okay so
there are 70,000 people waiting for a
cadaver kidney in the United States but
we only get to do about 11,000
operations each year so there's a real
shortage and supply and it's costly to
wait so about four thousand people die
each year and dialysis gets less and
less easy to go through so it's a really
costly wait this is you know end-stage
renal disease is a terrible disease but
it's also possible to to do live donor
transplants and that's because each of
you has two kidneys and if you're as
healthy as you look then you can stay
healthy with just one kidney so if
someone you love needs a kidney you
could give them a kidney can't sell them
a kidney that's a that's a felony okay
but sometimes you can't give them a
kidney you're healthy enough but you
can't give the person you want to a
kidney it could be because blood types
are incompatible or it could be because
of immunological incompatibilities so
the chance if I didn't know my own blood
type the unconditional chance that you
can take my kidney is about fifty
percent but the chance that my wife can
take my kidneys only about thirty
percent and that's because we're parents
and in the course of childbirth she
becomes her immune system may have
become exposed to some of the proteins
that our children get from me and not
from her and if she already has
antibodies against those proteins then
they'd be waiting to attack my kidney if
it showed up so sometimes I can't give
to who I want to give to and you can't
give to who you want to give to and it
opens up the possibility of exchange
maybe I can give a kidney to your
patient and you could give a kidney to
my patient so that's what I want to talk
to you about as I as a market design
problem and once again it's a long
conversation in both medical journals
and economics journals and my economics
collaborators are typhoon Sun medicine
at goin burr and my medical
collaborators are Susan statement and
Frank Delmonico and Michael Reese and
and we've had some success and I'm going
to tell you about the details but there
are now regional programs for kidney
exchange and the Congress has slowly but
just started to pass legislation which
says that kidney paired donation that's
the polite word for kidney exchange
shall not be considered to involve the
transfer
of a human organ for valuable
consideration so in case you were
worried about about whether this
violates the national organ transplant
act by you know here's new legislation
which says that it does not so by the
end I'm going to get back to a bug nuts
the question is why not and what's going
on but first let me just tell you about
the sort of technical problems of
designing a kidney exchange ok so just
incidentally for the economists in the
audience you know Jevons talked about
the double coincidence of wants right
the trouble with kidney exchange is you
know we've got a kidney on that we can
use for exchange you know I want to give
a kidney to someone but I can't but but
I'd give a kidney to to your patient if
you give a kidney to my patient it's
only going to work if my patient can use
the kidney you've got and your patient
can use the kidney I've got ok and jevon
sort of says you know the only way you
can solve problems like that that's
going to be a rare event that's what you
need money for that's why we don't have
just barter right if you could buy a
kidney you'd be all set then you take
the money and and you'd sell a kidney
and then you take the money and go buy
an appropriate kidney of course it's
illegal to do that and what I'm going to
propose to you is that computer
technology allows us to build clearing
houses that perform some of the
functions that that traditional monetary
markets perform so let me give you the
background on on how this works notice
there are now more living donors than
there are deceased donors in the US
remember there are where am I there are
still a lot fewer living transplants
than there are deceased donor
transplants but that's because deceased
donors donate both kidneys
okay so there are more living donors
there are lots more unrelated donors
than they used to be so so it used to be
before immunosuppressive drugs got good
you could only get the first transplants
were from identical twins okay back in
the 1950s but it turns out that while an
identical sib transplant has has both
the best survival rate after 10 years
and deceased kidneys the worst you just
can't see the difference between
non-identical Sims not identical on a
vector of six proteins and unrelated
people right so so my kidney is just as
good for you as your brother's kidney so
this is really going to open up the
possibility of exchange now there's a
whole elaborate national system for
allocating deceased donor kidneys but
live donor kidneys are completely
decentralized we're trying to create
some clearing houses the way live donor
works is someone you love has kidney
disease you you suggest that maybe you
could give them a kidney you go with
them to their nephrologist they take a
blood sample maybe they really out right
then they say sorry you know
incompatible blood types or maybe you
get further down the line but if you're
incompatible mostly what used to happen
is you just vanished from your not a
patient so you don't have a chart you
went home and no one ever knew about you
and your patient went on the deceased
donor list but in just a very few cases
and this is how we could tell it wasn't
repugnant some exchanges happen so we've
got 14 transplant centers in New England
and there were only five exchanges
before 2004 and at least one of those
was arranged by the people themselves
that is it was spouses who met in the
waiting room of a dialysis center and
they had a conversation in which they
said you know what's your story and one
of them says you know my spouse is in
there but and I would have given a
kidney but I'm blood type B in his blood
type a and the other one said you know
that's funny we're we're just the
opposite so so exchanges can happen but
because the market wasn't thick because
it was hard to look for a counterparty
to that trade very very few of them were
happening Johns Hopkins in Baltimore was
a leader in
early days so what we want to do for
starters we just want to assemble a
database of incompatible patient don't
repairs that is if you're interested in
a trade who else could you trade with
and then we want to find efficient ways
to match them and we want to deal with
it in a way that gives good incentives
okay this is a you know the kind of
thing how where is about in auctions all
the time we want people to participate
safely so because I have less time than
i thought let me not tell you too much
about incentives except to say one of
the things one of the incentive things
we do is all the surgeries are performed
simultaneously so that after you've
gotten a kidney you should your your
donor shouldn't become unavailable to
give a kidney so I'm actually the guy in
the yellow robe they are trying to make
sure no one hands me anything and here's
a kidney here's a kidney and behind me
off-screen you can't see it he's an
operating room just steps away where
that kidney has just been taken out in a
nephrectomy and here is the transplant
here's the patient right there and this
and in another pair of operating rooms
is the is the donor for that patient
giving to the recipient for this donor
ok so for simultaneous surgeries are
going on that's cumbersome ok here's
another incentive problem that that we
have that as we've started to get kidney
exchange going sometimes when we talk to
transplant centers they don't want to
tell us about all their incompatible
patient donor pairs they don't want to
announce to us all the people who can
engage in trade let's see what's going
on there supposing transplant center a
has two incompatible pairs but they
could exchange them in-house they could
do it themselves well we'd hate to have
them do that because supposing this is
what the whole graph looks like in our
little bit of exchange if they exchanged
a one with a two they get two
transplants ok donor from a one gives to
the patient of a to donor from a 2 gives
to the patient from a 1 but if they were
to tell us about those and it turns out
we can also exchange pair a one with B
and pair a 2 with C then we'll get for
transplants but of course the reason
they might not tell us about it
is maybe the graph looks like this there
is no see and if they tell us about a1
and a2 we're going to say to them
patient be as high priority patient be
as a child the exchange we want to do is
a one with B and then they're going to
say gee you know we could have done a
one with a two if we just hadn't told
you about it okay so so in order to get
full participation this is now a real
issue we have to basically promise I
think we haven't done this yet we have
to basically promised transplant center
a that if you show us patients a1 and a2
will make sure they get transplanted
they might get transplanted like this
which would be great but if the
situation is like this will that will
make sure a one and A two both get
transplanted even if patient be even if
the child does not and this turns out to
be a very difficult discussion to have
with doctors for reasons of sort of
repugnance you know they sort of say gee
you know these a1 and a2 they just
accidentally happened to be at the same
transplant center they're not especially
deserving there's this child and of
course what the economists say is you
know the child isn't going to be
transplanted unless transplant center a
tells us about a one and A two and then
there's a chance but if they don't tell
us about them then they have higher
priority than that child even if we've
never formally said that they should and
so so again this is the kind of question
of how to design the Clearinghouse to
not only get the transplants you want
but it all the patients that you want so
that you can do the the best transplants
okay so let me tell you a bit about what
makes kidney matching efficient there
personally tell you about blood for a
moment so there are four blood proteins
a the a B and oh so you are blood type a
if you have protein a your blood type B
if you have protein B you're a B if you
have both of them and your oh if you
have neither of them in some languages
instead of oh that's called zero that
makes it clearer it means you don't have
any of the blood proteins and the rule
is you can't receive a kidney from
someone who has a blood protein that you
don't have because you've got antibodies
to all the proteins you don't have so
type o kidneys can go into any patient
but typo patients can only take typo
kidneys okay so they're gonna be the
most vulnerable patients the ones
hardest to match okay and type o donors
are going to be in short supply not
because there's a shortage of typos
donors in the population there's plenty
of typos donors in the population but
because typo donors are seldom
incompatible with the person they want
to give a kidney to if someone loves you
who is typo and they want to give you a
kidney they're going to be able to
unless you have an immunological
incompatibility ok now the immunological
incompatibilities are these preformed
antibodies to a vector of six proteins
that could matter for kidney
transplantation so it turns out when we
think about exchanges that when we
initially talked to doctors we said
let's do exchanges of any size let's
find what's efficient and they said to
us you know no no you know that may
sound good in in you know at Harvard but
in the in the hospital remember when we
do a two-way exchange it takes for
operating rooms when we do three way it
takes six if you wanted us to do a
four-way exchange we take 8 operating
rooms you know a 10-way exchange would
take 20 simultaneous operating rooms and
surgical teams you know it's impossible
so we went back and we we figured out
how to do everything that you could do
under the constraint that you could only
do two-way exchange but since then we've
been explaining and helping build the
infrastructure to do bigger exchanges
because it turns out if you want to be
efficient you need to do both two and
three way exchanges you don't need to do
more than that and what's the story well
let's look at a little some little
examples and here are patient donor
pairs here's the patient blood type
which is called the ABO blood type
because of the two proteins so here's an
a patient with Abby donor the reason
they can't the reason I'm incompatible
is the the a patient can't take the B
kidney the old patient can't take the a
kidney here's a rare Oh donor right Abby
patient can take the O blood type these
guys are incompatible because of some
immunological issue similarly here's
here I've noticed this a patient has a
positive cross-match can't take this a
kidney so if we can only do two way
exchanges then we just get these two
transplants we put this Oh kidney into
this open
patient in return for this be kidney but
if we could do three way exchanges we
could take that rare o donor and create
a chain where this Oh goes to this old
patient this a goes to this a and this B
goes to this big and similarly we could
put this a a pair in between these two
who have the positive cross match so
when you can do three way you can get a
lot more transplants but for way doesn't
get you much more and one of the reasons
for way doesn't get you much more is a B
blood type is very rare in in the United
States so so you can prove some theorems
about this which which say that because
they're only for blood types you can get
all the exchanges done with no more than
four way cycles but the fourth the
conditions in which you need that fourth
the 4-way are very rare so in fact you
get almost all the you know if you just
go two-way exchange in a pool of 25 you
get about 36 transplants you get forty
five percent if you can go three way and
only forty-seven percent if you can go
for way and only forty-eight percent if
you can go higher where where the larger
ones are just due to immunological
idiosyncratic things and the bigger the
pool you know hear the numbers would be
49-percent fifty-nine percent you this
jump between 2a + 2 + 3 way won't go
away but hardly anything comes extra if
you do larger exchanges so it's really
worthwhile to invest in the
infrastructure to be able to do three
way exchanges and we're starting to do
that both in New England and in the
Alliance prepared donation that's the
stake ago called frequency oh baby
yes absolutely this is on American
patient population so I think there are
places in the world where a B is more
common but these are American patients
the only about four percent a little
under four percent PBS now there are
some other cool things you can do that
make exchange more efficient for
instance every now you know I say cool
things you know when I talk to doctors
they are always sort of upbeat but but
it's often very odd to have these
conversations with transplant surgeons
know you talk about some patient who is
very ill and you know maybe a child
patient who needs a heart something like
that and then and then they say and then
you know things were looking really bad
and then by a stroke of good luck a
heart became available you know you go
you know but so so let me tell you some
good things that can be that can be done
with with exchange sometimes sometimes
you've got this patient and donor who
are an incompatible patient don't repair
sometimes they're need becomes urgent
and one of the things that they can do
that so they can no longer wait for
exchange but what they can do is at
least in New England that this isn't
allowed everywhere in the US but in the
New England program for kidney exchange
we allow this the the donor can give to
a patient who's been waiting for a long
time for a deceased donor kidney so
someone who has high priority on the
deceased donor Q and in return receive
priority on the deceased donor Q so
basically what the patient gets is very
close to the next available kidney
that's good for him from a deceased
donor okay and in return they donate a
live kidney now the reason those are
little complex issues is of course
there's not one deceased donor Q there
are different queues for instance for
different blood type kidneys and
typically this patient isn't waiting for
the same kind of kidney that this
patient is waiting for that's why this
patient can take this kidney in this
patient can so so so it's a little bit
that the patient steps in front of the
queue but it's a different queue then
then the patient 3 was was waiting on
well we can do better than that now
we've got this pool of people waiting
for exchange so instead of donor one
giving to immediately to someone on the
deceased donor q they can give to
another
patient don't repair and have them give
to the deceased owner Q and in return
get priority on the deceased don't
accuse that that's a way of getting
another transplant okay we also start to
have non directed donors okay a saintly
thing you can do is decide to give a
kidney to someone you don't know and
what had been typical practice in the
United States was to have a non directed
donor give to someone on the deceased
donor Q someone who'd been waiting for a
long time and now instead in New England
we can multiply that gift by by having
someone give to someone in the exchange
pool who gives to someone else in the
exchange cool who gives to someone on
the deceased donor q okay and you know
there's a pretty abstract way of looking
at it this is what it looks like you
know in the flesh you know this is a non
directed donor q that involved six
people now the reason it only involves
six people is all the surgeries were
done simultaneously but with a non
directed donor we can start asking maybe
we can relax simultaneity okay so let's
think about that so so when we started
talking about this just in a theoretical
way we said you know if something goes
wrong in a non directed donor chain
maybe it's not as bad as if something
goes wrong in an exchange so let's think
about that here's a standard exchange
which we do simultaneously what's the
issue well here's Pere one donor one in
recipient one getting ready to trade
with donor to and recipient to supposing
we didn't do the surgery simultaneously
and donor to donates a kidney to
recipient one the surgeries are done and
now for whatever reason donor one
becomes unavailable or unwilling donors
become unavailable it's not just a
question of unwilling one of the things
is donors sometimes become pregnant for
example and they can't give a kidney so
so if you were going to wait a week you
might flunk the test they allowed you to
give a kidney that you had passed a week
earlier well if this were to happen if
we did this non simultaneously recipient
to is really harmed here recipient to
didn't get the planned kidney but also
recipient tues donor has already given a
kidney okay so so it's bad for the donor
and it's
bad for recipient to who can no longer
take part in exchange but now suppose we
start a chain with a live non-living non
directed donor okay as in that picture I
just showed you well what we'd like is
you know the non directed donor gives to
recipient one recipient one's donor
gives to recipient to and maybe and so
forth if it breaks down well that's
really bad for recipient too but not
nearly as bad as it was here because
recipient to is just where he was before
the non directed donor came forward can
still take part in exchange next month
when we run the next match run so we
started to say to ourselves you know if
they don't need to be simultaneous maybe
we can make them longer maybe we can do
non simultaneous transfers where social
workers do some of the work of
identifying bridge donors who who with
high likelihood be prepared to give a
kidney in the next week for one that
their partner got this week and we've
actually started doing this there's
there's a you know like Greece likes to
call them never-ending altruistic donor
Jane's my grease is the surgeon in
charge of the Alliance for paired
donation a Midwestern kidney exchange
consortium and there's one that's going
on you know in the it started in July
and it was at when I prepared this slide
it was at transplant number four with
with transplant number five on the way
so the exchanges are no longer list a
limit no longer limited to just three
which was six operating rooms okay other
ways we could make things more efficient
well we need a national exchange right
especially for patients with lots of
antibodies right so the way we talk
about your your antibody load is we
talked about how highly sensitized you
are if you have a ninety percent
antibody load what that supposed to mean
is ninety percent of the kidneys that
our blood type compatible you wouldn't
be able to take so of course if there's
only a couple of dozen people you can
exchange with you we might not get a
kidney but if there were thousands you'd
get a kidney okay so so we're working on
a national exchange the the legislative
barriers are falling but but it's
amazing how many barriers remain it
turns out
you know coordinating transplant centers
is very difficult they all are
accustomed operating with great autonomy
another thing that would increase the
thickness of the market is to offer
exchange not just two incompatible
patient donor pairs but also compatible
ones who might benefit from exchange so
supposing I need a kidney and someone
wants to give it to me well the likely
people who would give me kidneys are as
it happens many of them around my age so
they are middle-aged kidneys which would
be great for me and I would be
essentially cured but it would be better
a better younger kidney is better
supposing you you know a young person in
the audience need a kidney and you have
a young you know twenty-five-year-old
donor but you're incompatible so your
donor is great but you can't take your
donor's kidney well maybe we could
exchange right so I'd get the younger
kidney and you'd get a kidney that works
for you so it turns out one of the
reasons that would be very powerful to
allow is that would remove the shortage
of o donors there's no shortage of o
donors in the world there's just a
shortage of o donors who are
incompatible with their intended
recipient so this is something that is
not yet really possible in the United
States but but is on the agenda you know
how to make the market work better again
that's something we we started to talk
about in 2004-2005 we're still talking
about it and the enabling legislation so
so just summing up here on kidneys we
need to be able to do three way as well
as two way exchanges we're doing that
these are all things to to make the
market thicker and we would like to open
up kidney exchange two more pairs and
all of this is done in the shadow
remember how i began is the fact that
monetary exchanges repugnant so so as a
market designer I've started to want to
understand repugnance better so let me
tell you I mean let me end my talk by
telling you a little bit about
repugnance I wrote a paper called
repugnance as a constraint on markets
right there were markets we don't see
and the thing about repugnance is it
changes it changes in time and in place
you know I started off and I said it's
illegal to sell horse meat for human
consumption in California well the horse
meat that it's not illegal in California
too
kill a horse to make pet food and feed
it to your dog but actually that happens
very little because the price of horse
meat is set by the fact that it's highly
desirable in Europe for human
consumption so American slaughterhouses
in Texas that slaughter horses export
the horse meat it's very little sold in
the United States and you can easily
check this out if you search for you
know sort of horse meat on the internet
you find two kinds of sites one site is
full of how it's awful to eat horse meat
and the other is full of recipes and you
know and those are mostly an Italian so
so let me tell you a little bit about
repugnance repugnance can change over
time I've already suggested that you
know organs are a problem but cadavers
were an enormous problem for a long time
for medical schools I don't know how
many of you are familiar with the
Harvard campus but the the medical
school at Harvard isn't in Cambridge at
the main campus it's in Boston the
reason it's in Boston is that the city
of Boston promised to make all unclaimed
cadavers available to the Harvard
Medical School for anatomy classes if if
they would locate in Boston it turns out
in the mid-1800s in England the only way
to get for medical schools to get
cadavers was to deal with grave robbers
who were called resurrection men and the
nice thing about you know one of the
nice things about the Internet is you
can go read the early issues of the
medical journal the lancet and in in
some of the very earliest issues the
editorials one of the editorial struck
me it says it says a reliable
resurrection man has just been arrested
and sentenced to transportation to
Australia what are we going to do now
you know so so there were real problems
in the market for cadavers whereas not
too long ago I took my children to a
body worlds exhibit that was full of
pretty repugnant you know cadavers posed
in artful poses so that you could learn
about their Anatomy it may not be
unrepentant but it's certainly not
illegal anymore so so those are that's
something that was repugnant that became
less repugnant but it also goes the
other way think about indentured
servitude and slavery right so there
used to be markets for slaves in the
United States there used to be it used
to be that one of the common ways to buy
passage across the Atlantic Ocean for
Europe was to sell yourself into
indentured servitude okay well you know
the the Constitution now says that
involuntary servitude is illegal in the
United States and that includes that
means i can't sell myself i can't sign a
labor contract that that promises i
won't quit my job right you you can't
sign a contract with google that says 45
years no matter what Google does you
will work for Google that's not a legal
labor contract in the United States
because we find involuntary servitude
repugnant you know these repugnance is
change you know where we you know the
role of mercenary soldiers and armies
seems to be changing as we speak
interest on loans you know used to be
repugnant in much of Christendom right
in in Western Europe mostly no longer
repugnant right Max Weber wrote a set of
essays called the Protestant ethic and
the spirit of capitalism in which he
talked about how you know what makes the
capitalist economy possible is the
changing repugnance on earning money you
know the headings here are meant to be
big things so human remains labor
markets finance reproduction and sex you
know you can pay a lot of money if you
want to adopt a child but you can't buy
the baby from the birth mother okay
that's against the law almost everywhere
so not to say it doesn't happen but you
know you can't do that but everything
else can be purchased you know all the
other reproductive services so certainly
eggs in Massachusetts we have a funny
law you could have cooked you know there
are ads all the time in the Harvard
Crimson asking for eggs from women of
certain you know demographic and
scholarly characteristics and you can
sell eggs in Massachusetts at a high
price for fertility but not for research
eggs eggs useful research may not be
purchased in Massachusetts okay you know
other examples I could talk about let me
just suggest that some things that
aren't repugnant by themselves are
repugnant when money is added okay so
interest on loans no one ever objected
to people loaning money to other people
they objected to charging interest
payments to birth mothers you know
adoption is a wonderful thing but
purchasing a child
not be prostitution you know sex and
love are wonderful things but we object
to markets for markets for them and of
course purchasing organs for
transplantation everyone thinks it's a
great thing if you give you a friend or
loved one a kidney but it's a felony if
you sell one and we can all identify
with the idea that money is you know
inappropriate in some songs and it's
house laughing because he can tell that
the man in the tie is an economist but
but we all understand why the joke is
funny if i come to your house for dinner
i can bring a bottle of wine i can offer
i can invite you to dinner at my house
in return i can offer to take you out to
dinner and buy you a dinner at a
restaurant but i certainly can't at the
end of the dinner say that was great you
know that would have cost me $75 easy at
a fine restaurant let me let me pay you
right because because when you invite me
to dinner you're offering friendship and
when I offer to pay for it i'm
suggesting that i didn't understand
about your offer for friendship so I'm
somehow transgressing one kind of
transaction with another so psychologist
Phil tetlock calls these taboo
trade-offs and one of the reasons I
thought I'd talk about repugnance here
is you know when I think about Google I
wonder whether repugnance could be an
issue for instance in questions of data
privacy right so you know it's okay you
know if Amazon recommends books to me
based on my past book purchases but you
know I wonder if it's equally okay or
certainly this was an issue when gmail
started you know whether it's equally
okay if you recommend me books based on
my the content of my emails so let me
get a sense of the audience just before
I sort of close up about transactions
and I want to know whether you are
willing to contemplate first start a
market for living donor living vendor
kidneys how many people would be
prepared to have a suitably regulated
market for kidneys keep your hands up
please okay so a lot of you not everyone
put a lot keep your hands up how about
eyes
I okay seems pretty much same people
eyes how about hearts oh yeah some
hesitation there okay a lot of you guys
stay up with hearts but so I think
you're tougher than many of the groups
I've talked to a lot of people a lot of
hands come down at hearts that a
question or you just want to want to see
what the next item is and you'll vote
for that too okay so yeah children there
you go so for many of you not all of you
but many of you found found something
repugnant about at least one of these
okay so that's something to think about
when you because it's often I just
difficult to understand other people's
repugnance for things you're willing to
do all right so let me end repugnance
can be a real constraint that can affect
what markets we see what market
designers can do a lot of my colleagues
at Harvard and elsewhere do what we call
behavioral economics and we think about
how people can be better model than it's
perfectly rational normally we think of
them as individuals but this idea of
repugnance sort of takes us more into
sociology a little bit you know we we
think about what whole markets don't we
see so not just how do you make choices
but what choices do you not even get to
make because some markets don't exist
you have very little opportunity in the
United States to sell your kidney even
if you want to do and in terms of market
design you know we need to keep markets
thick we need to keep them uncongested
need to keep them safe and reasonably
simple to participate in these are all
things that you know when I talked to
Hal about what he's thinking about he's
partly thinking about these things when
he thinks about ad auctions and some
kinds of transactions are repugnant
that's what I've learned so far and the
thing about designing markets for an
economist is it gives us a different way
of looking at them ok we're not just
looking at them at the aggregate they're
not just the confluence of supply and
demand we have to understand them in
enough detail to really understand how
they work and and so that we can not
just understand them but can fix them
when they're broken thank you
time through we have time for a few
questions if anybody would like to ask
them here's a question so a two quick
organ donation or organics change
questions so um how much does the
exchange I mean presumably an efficient
exchange market actually increases the
overall pool of donors and get so what's
the can you quantify we don't know you
know right now medical privacy laws are
pretty strict so right now there are
70,000 people on the waiting list for
deceased donor organ what I would love
to be able to do is write each of them a
letter and say you know maybe before you
enter the waiting list for deceased
there was someone who is willing to give
you an organ but couldn't so so the
belief though presumably is that it will
increase the supply relative to the
demand compared to what we currently
have but less than an organ market would
I use and um so although although
there's a lot of debate on organ market
there's some people who think that the
organ market would crowd out some of the
altruistic giving and that there could
be problems okay so that's the mean
that's essentially my other question
which is you know the proponents of the
exchanges the you know both the
researchers and the organizations that
are in favor of them right some subset
of them find the market idea repugnant
presumably in some subset of them don't
find the market idea well you got it so
for the ones that don't find the market
idea of repugnant in and of itself do
you think the sort of favoring of the
exchange idea will cause them to not be
in support of market ideas because
they've put all this investment into the
the exchange well just speaking for
myself if there was if there's a
something a better solution I'd be I'd
love to see if there's a terrible
disease but but in terms of speaking
about repugnance I think of repugnance
as a real fact of economic life so the
better things that might come along you
know perhaps the market could solve this
problem but maybe someone will solve the
problem of
of immunosuppressive a reaction to pig
kidneys so we'd be able to grow you know
animal kidneys and I don't know which
will come first I mean there's there's
no reason to think big kidneys are
coming soon that's a really hard problem
repugnance may be a hard problem to
think how long it took you know to
charge interest on loans and things like
that I'm just wondering if there's a
single thing that repellents can be
attributed to like a root cause you gave
the example of gmail and ads and so on I
mean I'm prepared to believe that for
example people don't find Google
scanning emails for spam filtering or
pregnant because it's a neat benefit but
adds to most people they'd rather not
have them than have them is king can it
be analyzed down to a root cause that
you say you know people find things for
pregnant because it's a nick negative to
the in more so so I am a little
skeptical about this when I see things
that are repugnant I often find things
that to me appear extremely similar but
are not so I'm not optimistic certainly
that I will be able to find a root cause
of repugnance and when you started
describing the gastro no logical a
market and you show the figured how it
collapse and was revived again I seem to
notice that even after the revival about
ten percent remained out of it how could
it go together would still go together
so we think that they'll be that in the
second year of operation there are fewer
going to be out but but but sometimes
there are in a market even with a
similar name like that sometimes there
are programs that are really fishing in
a different pool right so they only hire
researchers rather than clinicians or
something like that so I think that well
so for instance we've done a match for
New York City High School's and about a
hundred thousand kids are matched each
year and under their old system they
sort of failed to match adequately
around 30,000 but we still under a new
modern good system failed to match about
3,000
some proportion of those 3,000 are kids
who for one reason or another don't
submit a rank order list you know when
you've got a hundred thousand kids
there's some small percentage that for
mysterious reasons you look into it some
of them are involved in the criminal
justice system and aren't available some
of them are in homes that don't support
them in you know adequately so I don't
know what the answer is right now about
you know the ten percent missing I think
it'll be down to about five percent but
they'll always be some small percent
that don't participate in that make
their living in some way that we don't
know about one more question one reason
that I didn't raise my hand and say that
I was okay with the you know kidney for
cash idea was not that I thought that
kind of the ideal exchange was was so
unacceptable but I really wasn't sure if
I like to the way that people might
behave under a system where such a thing
is is legal could that be part of the
repugnance phenomenal absolutely so many
markets that we find repugnant there's
also other things we don't like about
them so it's not simple republic
repugnance and sometimes repugnance is
just used to recruit allies so so in the
long list I gave you there there are
certainly markets that you don't have
externalities for example so so you
might object to prostitution not because
of you find prostitution repugnant but
because you think its associated with
crime or with human trafficking or with
you know a lot of things that
prostitution seems to be associated with
you might you know you could object to
selling kidneys because you're concerned
that if it were legal to sell kidneys
when you went to get a mortgage on your
house the banker would say to you you
know you're well employed you qualify
for the best rate just check here you
know and and metal assure that you can
get the best rate and you say you know
check here it says you know you can
collect my kidney well
so so there are a lot of objections that
are associated with this the people who
are in favor of markets people like Gary
Becker at the university of chicago i
think would answer that by saying make a
list of the things you don't want and
we'll keep them against the law you know
it's already against right now it's
against the law to sell kidneys we can
make it against the law to write a
contract about a kidney we could make it
against the law to sell a kidney to
anyone except one national buyer we you
know etc etc so so I think as the debate
goes on between people who don't want
markets bikinis and people who do the
irreducible part is the repugnance often
everything else we could talk about so
Ally was very inspired by the cartoon
and by the talk I'd like to take you out
to a free dinner or charlies okay okay
thank you thank you
