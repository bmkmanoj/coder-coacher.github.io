you had to learn about to talk through
the back channels so let's write that
straightened out on the future
technology that come through the regular
system my name's Harry Robinson I worked
up in Kirtland I report to - and one of
the jobs I have is to bring in speakers
and one of the perks of this is I get to
bring in speakers that I really enjoy it
learned a lot from so John is one of
those people how many people have used
exploratory testing in some way okay so
if I but part of the frustration with it
is to really ever say well how do I know
I've done a good job how do I learn to
do this better and job is actually one
of the people who has answered those
questions and a largely for me so now
your labs are the real Johnny Thank You
Harry thank you all for being here I
want to correct something right away
will those of you who didn't raise your
hands you've done exploratory testing
you just don't know it yet okay how am I
for sound am I good when okay good
my name is John Bach and I've been
testing for ten years my focus is
exploratory testing or unscripted
unrehearsed improvisational testing okay
and I want to show you I guess I would
say I'll show you that you've all done
it because I have a lot of pair of
dominica examples okay
all right I'm gonna talk today about
some definitions and maybe this is why
you didn't raise your hand maybe you
don't know you're doing it that's just
what this is what I suspect so what I
love I love this magazine by the way I
love Wired anybody here wired okay this
is the latest issue I got at the airport
of slipping through trying to find
something as I often do accidentally in
an exploratory fashion for this talk and
I found something page 30 it's titled
let's see you lousy ting go you and it's
it's a there these are linguistic quirks
around the world for example niconico I
don't know if I'm saying that right
that's the Indian Asian word oh sorry
does anybody know what that is
other than it being an Indonesian work
because I've given it away a little bit
the Indonesian work for someone with a
novel idea that actually makes the
situation worse
so that's what they call that right and
then interesting how about X or POC
anyone exert POC I may be saying this
wrong so though well it's the Inuit way
of describing the act of repeatedly
going outside to check if someone is
coming outside the igloo I would presume
I don't know what anyway so these are
interesting words from from different
cultures well I want to talk about the
main thing I want to talk about today is
what is exploratory testing and what are
the words we can use to describe what it
is we're doing okay I'm actually going
to show a curling video does anyone know
what curling is the sport of curling
okay if you don't you're about to okay
because I want to take something that
looks really easy and say oh that's easy
anyone could do that and see how many of
you resonate with that and then talk
about the terminology that they use okay
but first first I haiku
Oh masters of tests describe to me your
methods we launch in an hour okay does
this sound familiar to anyone when you
have like one hour to test or one day to
test and you got the whip can we ship
yet and wait a minute you'll pry this
out of my cold dead hands okay
that may be a sign that you're doing
exploratory testing no test cases you
know just your wits your intuition okay
no speck okay okay here are my
assumptions well some of you said you
didn't do exploratory testing and we'll
get to that but it's okay if you have it
if you well like I said worth it but
maybe you might need to do it so you got
to know how it's done
so you can at least care about it enough
and more importantly do you know if
you're doing it well let's Harry say
okay I'm gonna flip my monitor for one
second so I can see my screen okay good
okay here's the problem that I face when
a just round random pounding on the keys
you know can any toddler any child do it
what's the what's the big deal
okay that's problem number one that I
face problem number two I don't know how
this tester does it she's just amazing
give her 30 seconds she can find a blue
screen I'm in awe I don't know how she
does it
I just keep keep doing it keep doing it
and you do what you do and I'll just
report the bugs you report camp a can't
be right my talk today is attempting to
bridge these two camps to say you know
you people and number one it's harder
than it looks and I'll explain why I
think it's harder than it looks and new
people in number two don't worry you
don't have to be like a Zen master to do
this well I'll show you some skills and
tactics 14 of them to be precise okay so
hopefully we'll meet in the middle and
then and my ultimate crusade
to evangelize if it's not apparent
already my my candor and my diction in
my tone
I want credibility for exploratory
testing okay
I'd I want it to be I wanted to be
brought from the alleys in the shadows
and into the light
okay okay these are common sentiments
I've heard so this is my
counter-argument this is how it's
exploratory testing is observable
evaluatable and teachable skills okay
all right
let me let me just demonstrate for those
of you who said you weren't sure if
you're doing a slore Tory testing let me
find the right talk here well well
that's launching let me try an
exploratory exercise right now just off
the cuff here are some ideas I can think
of with that little UI that you saw
before I think that's gonna be really
slow to launch so apologize for this
okay let me toggle this back okay good
okay so take three identical numbers
right that's an equilateral triangle
okay three different numbers makes a
scalene triangle or three unequal sides
there's a triangle called an isosceles
triangle that makes two equal sides okay
so one of those three triangles is what
this program will will create okay so I
don't have a spec it's in my head you
just heard the spec and I could think of
ideas to test this is this working so I
try a conformance test okay three three
three equilateral one two three
scalene two two three isosceles what
about large numbers more than a million
characters yes one oh thank you so one
two three four five okay this is
important now I just heard some some
domain knowledge here because this is
not a triangle by the way it's because
the two smallest sites have to be
greater than the third side for the
triangle be legitimate okay so don't
expect you to be trigonometry majors too
oh this but it's a it's will help with
the oracles problem okay the oracles
problem is do you know what bug when you
see one okay so you may have to know
some some math okay so three four five
is a scalene okay so I try large numbers
I try letters in there I try tab order
just to see if I could get it to crash
holding down the tab keys is called a
shoe test what if I took my shoe and put
it on the spacebar you know
also known as the ham sandwich test
because allegedly someone left their ham
sandwich on the return key once upon a
time in our folklore and it cost a
blue-screen okay all right there's a I
think can I cut and paste into these
fields you know you see well I'm kind of
scattered right so it does seem like a
toddler could do it that I'm just random
randomly pressing on the keys but what
if I gave myself a mission and what if
that mission was still unscripted but
the mission was to get it to draw a
triangle outside of the boundaries of
the box okay what would you do
okay anyone have one idea that they
would try to try to reproduce whether or
not a triangle can be drawn outside the
boundaries of the box negative numbers
okay so maybe it'll draw down here or
out here or something like that okay so
that's one idea
any other ideas how large is large okay
okay okay try to make something that
doesn't launch it's a triangle okay all
right let's talk more about this okay
here are some questions that come up
that you may be asking yourselves
they've come up for me isn't it
unstructured and unmeasurable I'm here
to say no it's not the structure for the
structure part of exploratory testing
can be giving yourself a mission like I
just gave you I gave you a very loose
charter if you will okay what about the
measurable part well what if we spent an
hour trying to reproduce that one buck
that tech support is reporting that a
customer saw a triangle outside of the
bounds of the box and what if in that
one hour we kept track of three
activities
okay mouse clicks and keystrokes or
testing activities any time we stopped
doing that and found something we were
suspicious of like a bug bug
investigation and reporting let's call
that activity number two and the third
activity like anything we had to do to
kind of set up to begin testing in the
first place or times we had to stop to
maybe get more information about our
mission like call tech support and say
what operating system were they running
so what if we just kept track of those
three activities in terms of a
percentage in a given hour how much time
we spent well that's measurable
it's unscripted it's unrehearsed it's
intuitive its improvisational but I just
gave you three different metrics if you
will that we could do in an hour which
is another measurable unit time this by
the way is something that my brother and
I invented called session based test
management you can google it I'm here
I'm talking to Google I get that it's no
longer just an ordinary word session
based test management is a way to manage
and measure exploratory testing in with
time and with metrics there's a couple
other things to it but I'm here to
refute number two with that with that
one example okay
not too long ago last February several
colleagues and I got together and we've
been doing exploratory testing for a
long time and we wanted to talk about
exploratory testing the way we knew it
because maybe there are some important
problems and disagreements that we had
about this let's really study what what
in its exploratory testing is about here
is our mission teaching styles what
teachings teaching styles did we have in
our teaching arsenal could we come to a
consensus of what exploratory testing is
there any particular models or exercises
that are fun or useful to teach like the
triangle program is a classic one
what about they need disagreements
that's the fun part maybe there was
important disagreements so that was our
mission so several conversation starters
what makes exploratory testing effective
or ineffective are there particular
behaviors that we've seen over the
course of our careers people we've
managed that kind of go away from making
exploratory testing kind of an accepted
legitimate approach and I say approach
and that technique on purpose okay
descriptive testing where you have the
test steps written down okay is one
approach exploratory testing is the
opposite approach but it's not a
technique because within both of those
approaches you can do several kinds of
techniques for example you could do
scripted automation scripted domain
testing scripted flow testing scripted
stress testing or you could do
exploratory stress testing exploratory
flow testing exploratory beta testing
okay those are all techniques two
different approaches
okay so these are conversation starters
we've had for the exploratory testing
research summit to give you an idea of
how people who call us experts are
talking about what's the next big thing
how can how can we understand this a bit
more
okay all right so here's some
definitions that people at that summit
came up with Robert Sabourin awesome
speaker Canadian fellow who has a
company called Amy bug he says
continuous test design as testing
continuous continues continuous testing
as design continues and continuous test
planning as testing continues so
planning execution design all done
simultaneously there's no design phase
and then execution and you can never go
back to design okay Elizabeth
Hendrickson a style of testing in which
you explore the software while
simultaneously there's that word again
designing and executing tests using
feedback from the last test to make the
next test more robust or better or
provide information about it so she
mentioned this to a developer and the
developer said it's like tests you've
been testing as opposed to you know
test-driven development tests you've
been testing I thought that was pretty
clever
Michael Bolton operating and observing
the product with the freedom and mandate
to investigate it in an open-ended
search for information freedom that
started us thinking hey it's smarter
testing is about freedom the extent to
which you are in control of the test the
extent to which the idea of the test
comes from you and the control of the
test comes from you it wasn't written
for you and you have to follow the
script exactly freedom is a big part and
lastly campaigner author of a testing
computer software one of the great books
of our in our industry simultaneous
again there's that word learning design
and execution with an emphasis on
learning if this is on learning I'll
come back to that
oh well I'll come back to it right now
so what about this word ad hoc testing
okay
ad hoc there's some definitions ad hoc
testing doesn't necessarily care if you
learn so it is kind of like pounding on
the keys
you're divested from the information
gleaned from the test okay so that's why
I say all et is ad hoc because it meets
those definitions but not all ad hoc is
exploratory testing because ad hoc
doesn't care if you learn or not that's
the way the way I define it which is a
I'm going to take this time now to
invite you to challenge me on anything
you're going to hear today by the way I
meant to do that up front not only
questions but problems you have with
these definitions okay I invite you to
refute any of this because I want to
make our craft better I want to help
bring this into the light as I mentioned
and that that I want you to feel free to
give me feedback about that okay
exploratory testing paradigm attic
examples or analogies
think about these just pick pick your
favorite one that resonates with you
most a job interview let's pick that one
for a second ever been on the job
interview where you sat down in front of
the interviewer they had a script or a
checklist and no matter what you said
they did not deviate from that checklist
you can really say you know I really
know they think of it I know if I want
to work at Google I'm like okay so tell
me about when you were in eighth grade
they don't even look up from the
checklist it's like excuse me so when
they say excuse me can you say that
again that's exploratory testing because
the data they just got changes their
tests their test plan okay they're
adapting driving a car same thing
there's cruise control yeah we can set
cruise control we don't have to do any
thinking it just depends where we're
setting cruise control okay so driving a
car you get constant input that you have
to adapt to any sports team or sports
analogy they start off with a game plan
they call it a game plan right then they
adapt when things change
wow this team's tougher than we thought
we got to bring in the special gold you
know color game plan okay all right all
of those and lastly think and one more
up there
even going to a testing conference you
start off looking at the speakers here's
who I want to see here is her I don't
want to see here's what I think is
interesting here is here's my plan then
you go see the speaker you really want
to saw a see and you go oh that's just
his talk from ten years ago I know he's
just put a different title on it so you
get up and you walk out and so you adapt
as things come to light okay these are
useful because I find that people still
don't understand exploratory testing
they see of it they see it as random and
they see it as purposeless okay here
here I am with the pair of dominica
examples so at extras the exploratory
testing research summit Mike Kelley
offered this pair of demanding example
what happens if you have a certain
defect like the triangle program and
drying it outside the the triangle
drawing outside the box
Scot barber never have a developer walk
up to your desk and say I could use your
help
can you just whip something up okay
Michael Bolton again who is an excellent
colleague and consultant in Canada
working on a new build of an existing
product checking for bug fixes by using
old tests there's my brother James
please investigate this puzzling
situation or what happens if you're
asked to test something that doesn't
exist yet it's just a sketch on a napkin
or it's a the the first spec review
meeting and it's it's just they're still
flushing out what it's going to be can
you think of tests that it ways it might
fail even before you see it my answer is
yes you can and here's another one from
caner test from a quick test list okay
so these are loose scripts there's
another one from James Lindsley once the
script is executed choosing different
different tests and re-executing so even
if you when you have a scripted case
change some of the variables okay so
there is the bug that I that I reap Road
okay I deleted the input someone said
negative numbers that's exactly what
happened if my Perl program is working
I'd show it to you I'll try to get it
working once we hit a another slide here
maybe that link will work okay in fact
this may let me try this real quick just
to see if it'll launch
yes this might work haha it worked okay
great I just need to see it okay
negative number so that's a clue but it
may not be the only way to reproduce
this okay so let's try it
repro ideas please just shout them out
and I'll try to keep up with you
fifteen fifteen three okay isosceles
zero zero zero not a trying point Oh
decimals point three point four point
forty four before I click check what do
you expect you expected to draw
something a small okay all right does
that meet your expectations
okay so is this a bug hands hands up
it's a bug
it's a BJ that's the feature I forgot my
audience for a second Who am I
so she says the software is smart enough
to smart enough to scale up so hands up
who is it who thinks it's a bargain you
would report it okay Aryan and you okay
to out of like six hundred no three four
okay all right all right I won't ask why
I can understand why they might report
it because they say well it should be
it's not following a scale it should be
ska whereas she's saying oh it
calculates for you it's solved so it's a
future okay okay all right still no
repro or any other ideas ABC leave it
empty
so I'm here I'm continuing to hear ideas
so there's that so you're adapting to
each other because you're not content
that you've seen it yet right that's
what I'm guessing all right oh yes the
one two three that is an excellent test
okay it's an excellent test but keep
going so this is called the rumble strip
heuristic I borrowed this from my
brother the heuristic is a useful way of
solving a problem by the way that
sometimes works sometimes works for
example that when you're in a strange
city and you want to find a Burger King
find a McDonald's because the sign is
higher and brighter and yellow and
they're usually across the street from
each other okay but not always not
always so it's a rule of thumb okay
heuristic okay one of the definitions of
testing so the rumble strip heuristic
says well when you know when you're
driving and you're it's go late at night
and you kind of go too far off the road
and there's a rumble strip there's
grooves in the road and your car goes by
but that's meant to wake you up so that
you don't go off the road so when you
hear the rumble strip it's saying
something bad may continue to happen if
you don't take action now okay so the
rumble strip here says something bad may
continue to happen if you don't take
action now so don't take action remember
your testers you don't have to take any
action to correct it you take the
opposite action
so one two three any way you would
improv off of that now that you're close
you've got it to draw outside but it's
technically not a triangle and tech
support says no no that's not what they
saw
it's you're like okay 31 ah excellent
I'm glad that came up three two one what
does that tell you not a triangle no
line anyone does that tell it does that
hopefully your your brain is tingling a
little bit saying wait a minute
it shouldn't matter three one two all
right three one two not a triangle but
it's there
okay I want it I want to help help you
out a little bit using a dying idea I
already heard okay the decimals 1.9
check okay how about 2.1 check oh that's
interesting
2.2 all right
what does it think about 2.9 okay what
is it gonna think about 3.2 oh that's
interesting 2.9 well where was that
again 2.9 ok so it seems to kind of
adapt 8.1 well that's interesting
okay so I'm just I'm just doing some
improvisation so still no repro so we
can play with this okay so now we're now
we're on the trail and by the way this
particular technique is called Oh fat or
one factor at a time we're only changing
one thing because we're trying to narrow
in like a laser beam okay I think I've
spent a little too long on that because
I have some more good content we'll come
back to it okay
I mentioned scripted versus exploratory
before hopefully this will help you
explain the difference to anybody that
you feel may care about this especially
you know as you work with it to here is
purely scripted here's freestyle
exploratory you know there is a
continuum here have you ever ran a test
script where you said Oh set for all we
know what they mean and you decide to
tweak one little thing well are you
exploring or are you scripted well you
were in control of that particular line
item you weren't in control of the whole
test perhaps but you were in control of
a important part of the test perhaps so
it's not fully scripted so it may be a
vague script okay on the opposite role
have you ever assumed the role of a user
a particular user maybe your sister or
your brother a very particular persona
okay with a full history age date or a
birth date social makeup heritage all
that stuff okay that's a that's a role
okay so it's not a full script but it's
not completely freestyle okay so to know
where you are - what extended in my in
control of the test some people don't
think exploratory testing is an art I
just looked up the definition from
merriam-webster com it seems to me like
it's an art it's a skill that takes that
takes a cultivation you cultivate your
experience and take study okay
ah yes curling
I promised the curl so so who has seen
who has not seen curling okay a couple
of people in the eye okay
so you're asking yourself why curling
John Waker what is this about I got
infected with this commentary color
commentary and play-by-play for a sport
that Hux rocks down a sheet of ice with
brooms are you kidding me
but I saw this double take out and I'm
like that's got to be hard to do and so
I went to the web I started learning web
or the curling terminology and what a
hog line is what a tag line is with the
house meant how the points are scored
and I suddenly appreciated the skill of
these guys so I could certainly saw an
exploratory testing parallel this is my
life my career as a tester I see tech
exploratory testing everywhere the camp
that says oh how hard could be you know
and the camp that says I'll never be
that good somewhere we meet in the
middle hopefully so I started to think
about what I would do to become a
curling master and oh this is by the way
up on this site there's some great flash
animations of the what curling is about
and this video shows two rocks thrown
with equal weight or equal speed one is
swept and one is not
and it shows how one starts to curl or
change its trajectory a little bit
because the ice is not normal ice it's
it's special ice I didn't own it there
it's sprayed with a lot kind of a mr. so
it creates little pebbles on the ice
little bumps so that when the sweepers
come in they're actually melting those
little pebbles enough where it starts to
change the direction of the rock that's
a very strategic thing so sweeping is a
really important facet of curling so
when the when the thrower is saying hard
hard hard me sweep hard melt both
pebbles fast because I want that thing
to sneak in there right behind that
other stone okay
so there's some great little videos up
there okay so state is in my curling
mastership okay so I define a master as
a as an artist or performer in a player
of consummate skill okay so on your way
to becoming a great exploratory tester
just think of these as I've related them
to curling okay cool so you have to know
the
there's something called curling so now
some of you do you have to watch it
being done check so that's the red okay
have some curiosity hopefully you know
maybe not maybe this is a total
experiment I've never done this talk
with curling before so I think some of
you are engaged and that's all I need
it's just a few to feel like I'm not
wasting your time learn basic tech
terminology the hog line the hammer the
last rock in the end and try it so it's
not red because I haven't done it yet
okay
here's some more things okay this I put
put these in there oh I need to do the
audio so you can see so it's number six
realize it can never be good at it
practice get over the fact I can never
be good at it and compete in the
Olympics keynote and a curling
conference and moved to Canada become a
commentator for CBC this is this is kind
of how I started my testing career and
focused on exploratory testing I knew
there's something called exploratory
testing I watched it
being done I had a lot of curiosity I
learned some terminology and back 10
years ago there wasn't a whole lot
frankly so I tried it and then I
realized I could never be good at it
and then I practiced and Here I am you
know after a lot of things in that list
other than moving to Canada I haven't
done yet that yet but wouldn't it be
cool if there was a tester competition
with color commentary and play-by-play
this is something my brother and I
wanted to do at the software testing
analysis and review conference last
November is give a demo to people like
you and say if you're confused about
exploratory testing let us show you how
it's done
okay let us show you the 14 different
skills and tactics and I'll do play my
play and my brother would do call it
color commentary and we invite you to
out-think us in fact it was the title of
the talk was called thinking testing
outside the box be a CHS cuz I'm John
Bach and my brothers change and after
that so I was like oh look at the cheesy
title they come up who came up for us
James he goes I thought of that because
I go sorry man but it was
it worked because we're known for being
passionate exploratory testers and so we
wanted to do this color commentary well
to do that we needed to come up with a
language what is it that we are asking
people to look out for when we're
testing to watch for
I shouldn't say look out for we want
them to notice it okay okay so what
would a curling master might do okay
they what might study great games they
may compete or play for recreation then
we write articles about their
experiences okay
same for exploratory testing and you
know they may know and accept that they
won't win every game when you think
about what a master is to become a
master at at this this is what comes to
my mind okay here's how I got that thing
to repro okay so negative number so it
was a combination of everything I've
heard so far the three to one test was a
brilliant test because I thought well
that's interesting and then I tried the
same thing you did I'm so glad it
happened here
I did not script that by the way someone
said what about two three one and two
one three that's exactly what I did and
I got to see that there was written
really close spaces there were some
interesting disparities so I tried
decimals right and then I tried negative
decimals and got a triangle to draw way
up there so the sides the order of the
numbers did matter I didn't think it
mattered so I had to break myself out of
that assumption which I did by coming up
with some tests okay so all right enough
talk what about these exploratory
testing skills and tactics okay I
remember it as mr. Q comp grab C R and R
it's a it's a mnemonic it sounds like
jar jar binks I guess mr. Q comp perhaps
tiara okay here's what that stands for
mr. Q
top grab see R&amp;amp;R these are different
ways that I use in the lab where I work
I work for an outsource testing lab in
Seattle my job is to help us compete
with offshoring frankly and to find
better bugs and to find them faster
because we're more expensive dollar for
dollar so what that means is we have to
provide better value now this isn't a
vendor talk this is a technique talk and
an approach talk right so these are
different skills that I trained for at
the lab to help make us better okay all
right let me talk about each one really
briefly and I don't know what what's
going to be done with the slides but if
you email me I'll be happy to send them
to you okay so I don't expect you by the
way to remember all these I just when
you leave maybe remember something about
curling the guy who talked about curling
and how it's like underappreciated and
how now you're gonna do curling lessons
or something I don't know but don't feel
compelled to remember all of these but
challenge challenged me on any of this
or if I'm missing something especially
if there's a skill or a technique that
you have done and you've got a name for
it
tell me about it okay so modeling
alright this is the how are you going to
know what the product is going to do how
it works
what's the for example what's in the
file menu if you're testing a business
application or something that has a file
menu whether all what's on all the menus
okay what are the files that get
installed okay having a feel for the
product okay all these kinds of things
okay resourcing to what extent can you
gather and obtain the tools and
information to support the very act of
exploratory testing right it's also
getting people to help you you know if
you don't know ask go into the web
looking for more information
different things that's called
resourcing questioning the biggest thing
all testing is questioning in fact the
test is just a question in disguise all
right if it's if you'd not if you don't
have a question in your head when you're
testing you're not testing okay but
there's an art to it
what about loaded questions okay
questions you think you know the answer
to rhetorical questions okay sometimes
I've been in meetings where I ask a
rhetorical questions just to see if
someone will answer me like why are we
shipping this thing remember John it
solves this particular PO yeah that's
interesting what purpose do you think it
solves because we may not be on the same
page okay asking questions in a way that
elicits different kinds of information
okay
chartering this is crucial in session
based test management remember the
technique that uses time boxes to to do
is to frame exploratory testing every
session every time box has a charter or
a mission statement for example let me
give you an analogy Lewis and Clark the
explorers who set off from the Missouri
River in 1802 I think it was and they
their mission was to get to the Pacific
Northwest somehow right and well the
specific mission from Jefferson was to
to get to the Pacific Northwest get to
the Pacific Ocean by using rivers okay
and establish a trade route okay so it's
important to know that they actually
failed in that mission but they're still
called explorers they they found out a
lot of information about that territory
okay all right
observing okay well how hard can
observing be well there's a lot to
observing in fact there's a something
called inattentional blindness which
happens to scientists will happens to
all of us well sometimes when we're
looking so closely at something we
missed the periphery okay so at the lab
I teach classes with some objectives
that involve how to observe and look out
for particular behavior that you may be
missing
okay manipulating making and managing
contact with the object of your study
configuring it okay there may be
something you have to do with the
software to what extent and you are you
doing are you interacting with it okay
pairing up this is a technique you can
do exploratory testing alone or you can
do with someone else okay you can let
someone drive while you take notes work
together distributed cognition okay how
someone is cheating some people call it
cheating it's like no I'm I'm just
distributing cognition around so
generating and elaborating working click
quickly refactoring adapting revisiting
the situation later on okay kind of like
well I plug it back into curling of the
video you saw is there anything that you
can recognize in here what they were
doing or what we were doing with the
triangle program okay
like refocusing once I heard one two
three and then three two one that was
kind of oh wait I'm gonna just try any
numbers here I'm trying single digit
numbers less than five I'm deciding to
focus in there
okay so skills and tactics alternating
switching among contrasting different
activities or perspectives
let me give you some examples have you
ever been testing something where you're
just gathering data just to see what's
happening and you may do some analysis
later on but you're just gathering data
and then you say well I'm tired of
gathering the data now I want to look at
what the data is telling me I look at
patterns so you may alternate from data
gathering to data analysis okay I was
trying to test an IP address program all
it did was check the syntax of the four
octet
really simple is it from 0 to 255 are
you talked up you know in that range
well it was giving me invalid results
for valid numbers but I couldn't figure
out the pattern so I just tried hundreds
and hundreds of IP addresses that I
could think of
I just tried test after test after test
after test after test and I couldn't see
a pattern it didn't make any sense to me
sometimes it would fail with one one one
in the first octet somehow sometimes it
would pass with one one one in the first
octet and what is going on so over a
period of eight hours I alternated
between analyzing the data and say oh
that's interesting
I'll try this test this is what the data
is suggesting no it did it didn't work
so I need to gather more data okay these
are polarities what about solar work
versus team effort there are time that
you may want to pair up with somebody
that's a particular technique a tactic
you can use to exploit an alternating
skill okay more polarities sometimes you
want to really dig in there and
investigate and and sometimes you just
want to get a feel for the product you
just want to be more of a tourists okay
just but maybe in the the first session
session that you do for example if you
give yourself 90 minutes to explore
something give yourself a mission you
may just want to do some conformance
test just to get a feel for how it works
and try your devious stuff later on so
that's testing versus touring you may
want to try one feature now and then
take a break from that and try this
other feature just to give your mind a
break okay this is now all of these
things have been mentioning are things
that I've seen testers do and seeing
myself do
it as an exploratory tester branching
versus backtracking to what extent do
you take an idea and then get inspired
to try an idea off of that idea and then
come back to the original idea later on
conjecturing what oh here's what I think
is going on here let me let me see if I
can corroborate or refute my own
conjectures it is the moon made of green
cheese something like that how would you
corroborate or refute that recording to
what extent do you take notes of what
kind of notes do you take what do you
decide to write down do you use a
recording tool okay this is some people
call any use of any tool automation I'd
call it computer assisted testing
there's a product called Specter by the
way that records mouse clicks and
keystrokes another one called BB test
assistant that allows you even to embed
audio into your recording so you can
show a developer what your what your
thought pattern was that's recording and
lastly reporting no there's a difference
between recording and reporting right
because recording is something you do
for you perhaps reporting is something
you deliver to someone else so you may
not want to deliver them your raw notes
so it's a it's a separate skill okay and
we do it on time okay good
I will send links to whoever's
interested here's some useful links for
checklists and ways to help you think of
test ideas when you're stuck this is
created by my brother elements of a test
plan quality criteria is another that's
a better one than heuristic test
strategy model I'm going to scroll down
to this function testing scenario
testing claims testing all different
kinds of techniques remember that you
can use with either a scripted approach
or an exploratory approach okay the
these documents are freely available at
satisfice com my brother's website flow
testing random testing user - all kinds
of things
customers team equipment and tools all
the factors that may decide what kind of
test you're gonna run okay so where are
you at do you know there's something
called exploratory testing yes you do
you watch it being done yes you have
some curiosity create some definitions
ask some questions participate in
discussion thread study others
experiences and finally you know we're
all going to move to Canada eventually
to become a commentator for CBC so we
better just do it now and I'll leave you
with this about gaining skill becoming
better at this one from Ernest Hemingway
it's none of their business that you
have to learn to write let them think
you were born that way kinda like that
one quote from Bradbury and then a quote
from from my dad who wrote a book called
the illusions the adventures of a
reluctant messiah it's about a guy an
airplane mechanic who happens to be a
messiah and he doesn't want to be a
messiah anymore so he just becomes an
airplane mechanic that's all he wants to
do but people keep asking them to heal
em and everything it's uh so that's one
of the one of the quotes from the
Messiah's handbook they give you a
handbook when your Messiah apparently
according to dad and that's one of the
quotes in there so I believe that's it
I'll just end with a haiku okay
engage the skill set 14 different skills
and tactics what do you think am I
missing something was something
confusing can i elaborate on anything I
know I didn't leave many time for
questions but now's the time to ask them
any questions
any questions yes oh thank you oh I
don't know I don't know I just so afraid
I would get a question that I couldn't
answer
I've got like eight email addresses no
let me give you John BJ o n B as in boy
at quarter quar D e v.com okay zombie at
chord F calm I do have a gmail account
but I'm embarrassed to say I haven't
used it in a while and I forgot the
password and I haven't gotten around to
getting him so forgive me I was bestowed
upon that honor and I haven't used it
wisely yes I don't know enough about
test-driven development to wage a good
answer about that what's tell me worry
about the spirit of your question though
yeah
okay so let me see if I found a parallel
here for test-driven development which
is it's an agile way to create tests in
while it's is still in development and
do more unit testing sooner and do more
of the testing front-loaded before it's
even develop yeah I I don't know how I
would give an answer that would be a
perfect integration to what you're
looking for other than to try some try a
session try to come up with 20 or 30
charters or loosely scripted paragraph
of here's what I want to explore and
give yourself an hour or 90 minutes take
some notes my mind the the quick tactic
is notes bugs and issues so write up
your notes
write up whatever bugs you find in any
issues things that may be bugs but
you're not sure and see if after you've
done like a day's worth of that three or
four sessions see if that helps unearth
some more charter ideas or ways to to
build cases if that's what you need to
do on the unit side that's the only way
I think I can do justice to your
question okay yes sweetness
what's the biggest weakness from
exploratory testing I think the biggest
weakness is not knowing how to do it
well because if you don't know how it's
done
and how what what the skills and tactics
might be and you don't do them on
purpose and you can't explain the story
of your testing it only fuels a mystique
the mystique of it and it only
contributes to managers who may say oh
okay
then anybody could do it so let's just
offshore it or okay I just I'm confused
as to what you really did there whereas
if we came up with a language it doesn't
have to be this one but a language that
works that may strengthen exploratory
testing ability to be perceived as
valuable kind of like if curling didn't
have any nomenclature to it it was just
people in the commentators we're just
able to say wow that looked like a good
shot and they weren't able to describe
why I think that that would actually
harm the sport but it was because these
guys knew how to get excited and why
they were getting excited that I got
excited about curling and saw the
parallels with exploratory testing so I
think the biggest weakness is that
exactly what I'm trying to not to do
today is to give you guys some some
weapons to describe what it is you're
doing and to maybe pick out some of
these skills and technique and tactics
and say ah I need to be better at
note-taking or any I want to try see if
I can do some of this chartering stuff
okay or man I missed a couple of bugs
last round I want to see if there's any
particular observe observational tactics
and techniques I can try okay good
question thanks for for that yes
you're looking at it where is the reach
research going next and explore to our
testing he asked where's the future of
it this exploratory testing research
summit which is a new thing and what
what I'm excited about is working more
with it with this language and trying to
see if do some more research on how long
does it take a tester to come up to
speed or be considered a you know
testing expert or a savant or what is it
that testers do that makes them the guy
or the gal you want to go to when you've
got one hour to to to ship or one hour
to test what is it about them and and
then talking about it at venues like
this and at conferences and saying you
know it's not random it's very
thoughtful you know it's not
unstructured it can be structured
dispelling the myth that if you put two
exploratory testers back-to-back they're
gonna do the same thing anyway because
there's you know it's it's pretty
obvious what needs to be done and also
the myth that oh if you put two
exploratory or test your side by side
they'll do completely different things
so what difference does it make you know
both myths actually have some validity
to them but they can't exist in the same
space which tells me that there's more
research to be done okay so and we're
gonna probably have another there's a
there workshop on heuristic and
exploratory techniques in in may where a
bunch of colleagues and I will get
together again and talk more about these
questions where it's going next good
question okay anything else
one last question I think my time may be
up anyway my time is up
great thanks everybody appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
