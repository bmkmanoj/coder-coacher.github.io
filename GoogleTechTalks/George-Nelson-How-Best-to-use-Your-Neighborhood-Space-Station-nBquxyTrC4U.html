again for coming to one of our most
recent NASA googletalks we do these
monthly so it's good to see some
familiar places coming back again and
again today we have something really
special dr. George Nelson is here from
the International Space Station project
this is a live stream of the space
station as we're looking at right now
originally from Maine dr. Nelson's
affiliation with NASA began in 1998 as a
graduate student research fellow he
began full time NASA career in 2001 in
the training flight controllers and
asked sorry and astronauts on the
electrical and thermal systems of the
ISS after serving as the configuration
manager for the space station through
much of assembly he began its current
tenure as manager of the space station
technology demonstration office through
which all of the engineering and
technology research is conducted on the
space station he's based in Houston
currently and without further ado dr.
George Nelson Thanks hi thanks for
coming guys as she said this is a live
view from ISS it's from a payload which
is our term for an experiment or an
investigation on on ISS called HD for
high-definition earth viewing and we're
looking aft you can see a couple of
Russian transport vehicles the Canada
arm that's there as well as just a tiny
bit of the of the u.s. segment there
we're flying over the pacific and i had
a tracker up here we're flying over the
pacific and I think we're headed south
by now and we're about to yet we're
headed south we're pretty close to the
Hawaiian Islands and we won't really see
any land probably until we cross maybe
southern Patagonia in a while but
because of the way we got this set up
i'm going to i'm going to take this down
and throw up some slides there for you
and this is available any time you guys
want to look at it we stream it 24 hours
a day when you're at night you don't
really see very much we have the cameras
not tuned to pick up city lights or you
can't see any stars or anything but we
have this specifically to
stout some sensors for different
commercial off-the-shelf camera so
there's there's four different cameras
there's two looking aft one looking
forward and when looking down and a
little bit to starboard so they rotate
through and we take a look and they've
held up a lot better than we really
thought they would there's a couple of
CMOS and a couple of CCD sensors on
there the radiation environment is not
not very nice there so we didn't expect
it to last too long but they've they've
been doing okay we don't really even see
any pixel degradation as of yet so if
you go to ustream TV and search for hdb
that's where you can find this feed
anytime you want all right ok so when
when Terry Fong and Chris Provencher
asked me what's what what's the title of
your talk I thought I don't like I come
up with a title I guess I should find
one that really grabs people if some
something of some interest and I thought
that maybe maybe how to travel through
time with the ISS but then I realized
you know maybe I need to ground it a
little better in reality although for
the relativistic time guys out there I
got something for you a little bit later
and then you know there's a lot of
things you can do on ISS but you know
trying to identify bubbles and
commodities or other stock markets no
one no one is yet proposed that that's
something that you really can do so I
ended up going with how best to use your
neighborhood Space Station and I came to
that by by saying that there's a lot of
ideas on how to best use it and we're
talking philosophy we're talking
specific experiments how to fund
everything that we're doing and the fact
that is it really is yours so the whole
thing was built with taxpayer dollars
whether you're from the United States or
you're from a European ISA country your
canada or japan or Russia it was all
built with taxpayer dollars so it really
is yours and the way that the United
States has it set up is that you even
have direct access to it through a
mechanism that I'll explain a bit a
little bit later for you but it's open
to United States corporate and private
entities to help the tax base the United
States
if you got a great idea and you're going
to end up making money on the ground
after proving something out on ISS and
you're going to hire Americans who pay
taxes and make the world better we're
there for you and we hope you get to use
it and then being a neighborhood space
station when you look at the cosmos
overall it is definitely in our
neighborhood and and really it's only a
couple hundred miles up so it's pretty
close by we provide you access for it
and if you guys provide the things to do
on it well then that's one of the best
ways you can use your neighborhood space
station so the the vehicle itself that
we just saw that's about the same
location a little bit further south as
we are right now this was yesterday
morning it passed over you can see if
you've ever compared it to a UH ttle
flight before we started building ISS
this goes to a much higher latitudes
than the shuttle normally did that's
because we wanted to have access from
our Russian partners who launched out of
Kazakhstan and then they try and launch
over the top of China rather than rather
north of China rather than directly over
the top of them so that's that's the
inclination that we have and so that
sets up the angle that you see the
orbital track takes to the to the
equator okay so I want to talk a little
bit about what it took to build the
state space station so that you guys
understand the challenges that that NASA
and the program itself have been trying
to tackle in properly using it so i
think that russian number is actually
from july so i think you can say that
that's either 98 or 99 now total russian
launches most of those have been
unmanned progress which are is the
resupply vehicle from the Russian space
agency or the Soyuz spacecraft that can
take up and down three astronauts or
cosmonauts and that's also the primary
lifeboat the only lifeboat that we have
for the ISS in an emergency to get back
home 37 space shuttle launches so you
look at you think about how many we had
that's you know about a about a fourth
of all the space shuttle launches that
we did was for ISS it was the the real
workhorse it was the original intent of
the space station the space
program was to build a space station had
a big payload Bay to build up to bring
up all the parts we flew the Japanese
module that the Japanese build we flew
the European module that the Europeans
built we built we flew two modules that
the Europeans built for us in exchange
for flying there module and in a huge
American segment as well we've flown
some commercial vehicles as of late
there as well you know Elon's effort
through through SpaceX and orbital Space
Sciences orbital sciences is also flying
commercial vehicles to ISS unmanned and
in a resupply fashion for all the
utilization all the experiments that we
try and conduct there the Japanese have
flown for H TVs and the Europeans have
flown five ATVs those are also both
unmanned the difference between the two
the Europe launches from down near the
equator off of South America Japan
launches from an island called
Tanegashima the ATV uses a Russian
system to dock autonomously in the same
way that their progress docks to the
station and the HTV rendevouz with the
vehicle and then we grab it with that
Canada arm that you saw and birth it to
the forward end of the vehicle so I
talked about all this to say this was
you know the very first Russian launch
was back in November of 98 sericus
November of 98 was when the Russians
first launched the FGB now this was a
section that the United States largely
compensated Russia to build and then
with the space shuttle we went up and
attached our node 1 to it and then we
waited for quite a while until the
Russians were able to build their
service module and then it was a
habitable platform and since then we've
had continuous human presence on ISS so
that's been since 2000 I think also the
very end of 2000s and we've had
continuous human presence up there and
the amount of effort and time that it
took just to build the space station
you can imagine that that was the focus
get it built and then especially when we
put a sunset clause on the space shuttle
program itself there was even more
urgency let's get it built let's get
this done first so that was the primary
focus but now that is built using it is
the most important thing so any time
that you spend that much money in that
much time you're going to have a
considerable amount of inertia that you
have to overcome and then you complicate
it with the fact that it's a government
project and you have even more so it's
been it's been challenging to do the
change that was required but what we did
as soon as the space shuttle program
ended and we had fully utilized its
capability to get us ready to be without
it we reorganized a large part of the
space station program in order to more
properly reflect the priorities that we
now have which is doing the science and
engineering research on board so prior
to that day the the payloads office had
largely its own they were self-contained
they had their own engineering support
they were like their own little program
because they were just off on the side
and you know Chris was with me doing a
lot of the training that we would do and
in any simulation that we would run as
soon as a major malfunction would happen
was the first thing that happens turn
off the payloads and so that kind of in
grains into the flight controllers and
everybody who's getting trained at that
point that like that is not the
important thing the important thing is
making sure that the facility is still
running everything is okay the crew is
safe we still care about those things
but the primary focus now has to be on
getting the science done so one of the
things we did is we got rid of the the
separate program aspect of all the signs
they were doing disseminated those
individuals throughout the program there
are some optics type thing and I don't
mean optics the discipline I mean optics
the just how things look by moving the
program scientist on the org chart up
next to the program manager the the mail
code for payloads is 0 Z so historically
we've been at the bottom right-hand
corner of every of every org chart
that's that's moved up as well and
we're still we're still working to make
it better because we've had we've had
more than one accident where we have
loss of life right so we have several
decades of work building up processes
that ensure safety but when you're
trying to do scientific research you
don't need to necessarily focus on on
mission success well you need to focus
on the particular aspect of what you're
trying to discover so all the rigor and
extra money and cost that goes with
building a typical spaceflight project
we don't want to incur those costs in
order to do research and to use the
space station like the lab next door and
so I tell everybody you got to treat it
like it's a facility down the road and
I'm paying for your transportation costs
I take care of the the flight up we take
care of the crew being there we take
care of the power and the thermal and
the data all the stuff that you need all
you got to do is build it so that it
works for you not for us so we're still
we're still working to fix our processes
so that you and even other people within
our own agency have better access to
using the facility and one of the things
that we did was we set up three offices
so there was the National Lab office and
so that's what I alluded to before that
so anybody outside of NASA whether it's
another government agency or a private
private company or a public company or
an individual who has a good use for the
space station platform can go through
the National Lab office and we hired a
not-for-profit entity called casus the
Center for advancement of science and
space and you know one of the reasons
you want to do is we trust ourselves to
choose the the right investments that
NASA cares about for spaceflight and
space exploration and arrow sciences and
the like but we didn't want 20 years
from now someone saying you know we
really we could have cured this disease
if you guys had only let us fly on the
ISS so we have this not-for-profit
entity that hires the right the right
experts in all the different fields
where we were getting proposals
you properly vet and evaluate and
prioritize the different things that are
being proposed to fly on ISS so that's
one way you can get up there through the
National Lab office the second office
that was created was where i work the
technology demonstration office so we
have all the engineering and technology
research that gets done on ISS flies
through this office as well as all the
Department of Defense work so that's
kind of like the caveat the exception
that proves the rule for the National
Lab office that's supposed to be all the
external to NASA government agencies but
there's a peaceful purposes clause for
ISS and so all the work the DoD does is
is peaceful work and so that's directly
in line with all of NASA's needs so for
for accounting stuff we keep the DoD
stuff as part of a national lab
utilization but in practice it all flows
through us in the third office that we
came up with the science research office
so there's this whole this whole section
of the agency called the the science
Mission Directorate and so these are the
guys that that fund the Rovers on Mars
and the hubble and the Webb Space
Telescope and do a lot of great stuff
but they have their own bureaucracy
their own vetting of what they want to
do and all of their work and all the
work that they fund outside the agency
as well flows through that particular
office so one of the one of the first
things we did was set up those three
front doors let's see part of the change
that I said was challenging was
reminding everybody who the customer is
so when you work in a government agency
while you work for the citizens of the
country you're you often consider
yourself to be the customer you're
working for the people but the
contractor who's supplying you with
something they need to understand you're
the customer but now we're completely
different when we're running the space
station we're not the customer anymore
the customer are the principal
investigators across the country and the
world in our case that are trying to do
work there so reminding everybody of
that and reminding people that this is
not the last space program or the one
before that even where
are you have a mentality that worked
very well for us of you know failure is
not an option but in this case it's very
difficult way to run a research program
you know if you look at at some of the
more aggressive research programs like
the DARPA runs failure is almost a
necessity they if they are too
successful in the portfolio that they're
investing in the people get a talking to
like I don't think you're taking enough
risks so the risks that we are want
everybody to accept with using ISS are
not safety risks we're not asking to put
the crew of the vehicle at risk but
making making bold steps and and taking
risks technically to see if we can come
up with the best solutions is exactly
something that that that we want to
encourage so while we've become this
customer service organization and we
continue to help everybody figure that
out we tried to we've tried to help
change the attitudes just with everybody
that we work with every day so a
standard conversation would be as you're
walking across in between buildings at
at Johnson Space Center would be did you
hear about you know effort X they needed
three times to get that done can you
believe why why couldn't they get that
tested on the ground why couldn't they
figure that out and that's exactly the
type of attitude they were trying to to
change a little bit where it's okay to
have iterative tasks on orbit we have a
crew there for a reason you can build
you can build something and fly it and
if it didn't work the way it was
supposed to well how many times have you
been in a lab and it worked the first
time you know every time and that's
really expensive if that's the way you
want to operate so we're trying to get
people to accept that this is a lab and
it doesn't necessarily work the first
time every time and when you discover
how it goes wrong that's the benefit of
using the lab so what kind of things can
you do up there I'm talking about all
these things that you should and could
do what kind of things can you do there
well let's look at a few few things that
we're already doing up there and kind of
split down the middle between non NASA
and NASA so there's you know biology and
biotechnology investigations that are up
there they're on both sides
most of the human research has been
funded by NASA there's not a lot of
commercial need identified yet with
people spending money of their own money
on trying to figure out the human
effects and it's a great importance for
NASA if we're going to take long
duration missions to Mars for example
the physical sciences are funded both by
NASA and and by other government
agencies technology demonstrations it's
one of the things that I end a lot of
time harping on other entities about is
the fact that this is a lab that can be
used it's really difficult within the
aerospace community to change the
paradigm that that most the most
executives in most aerospace companies
are used to that paradigm is we'd love
to do something for you NASA and we love
you to pay us to do it so I'm trying to
get to the point where they're investing
their own money and keeping their
intellectual property and utilizing this
national asset at the same time so it's
it's a tough it's a tough thing to
convince people of because you know the
the performance period cycle of that
particular vice president is probably
shorter than the return on investment
for whatever they're going to fly to ISS
and test out and then when we finally
decide that we're going to go back to
the moon or tomorrow's one day we buy
that one because it did so well on ISS
right so that VP is long gone by the
time his company gets that ROI and so
it's it getting to the right level of
the different of the different companies
and the different corporations and
getting them to accept this possibility
has been a challenge we're getting there
and and I think you'll see some things
coming up soon what else astrophysics
you know NASA that's kind of NASA's
mandate right so we fund the
astrophysics work that gets done up
there earth sciences there's a lot of
different things both funded by NASA and
not we'll talk a couple examples about
that later and then on the education
side you know you guys work for one of
the entities that doesn't awful lot of
work in that area and NASA tries to to
use the assets that that we have to do
the same sort of thing
so some of the you may have seen you
know some videos of or pictures of the
astronauts working inside the station as
an exposure facility we have a lot of
options on ISS and outside the vehicle
we have for logistics carriers one two
three four there on the main trust that
goes across that was all part of the
United States contribution and on those
we have some some spare parts that we
flew up there that were so big that we
knew we needed to fly them up on the
space shuttle first so we have those pre
positions when we have to remove and
replace the originals but we have a lot
of payload spots on there so some of the
different things that you can do up
there is look up or look down or or take
material testing in that environment
there's a lot of atomic oxygen there
there's as I said before the radiation
environment if you want to do other
things in this area you need to make
sure the materials are going to respond
over periods of time and n respond well
both the Japanese and the Europeans have
exposed facilities that they have the
opportunity put stuff on the United
States has access to both of those
facilities as well and then we have some
we have some specific areas that we've
placed different investigations like the
AMS is not on an ELC but it's out there
on the truss and we'll talk about that a
little bit later too and the Russians
have their own investigative program as
well by far it seems the United States
and its partners have have invested more
so far in the in the research side of
ISS so why would we take all this time
and money to do this sort of thing well
it's the concept that the nation's
explore in order to advance and the
exploration can come from physically
going somewhere to explore or just
further observation of either natural
phenomenon or are things that you can
observe
and that exploration drives technology
breakthroughs and scientific discoveries
and and and without that exploration
that that cycle of improvement can can
be broken but the ISS partnership in the
fact that it really spans the globe has
transformed the space exploration from
an effort for the advancement of
individual nations like Russia the
United States in the 60s and China right
now to an endeavor to you know it's
committed to the advancement of
humankind i read that directly because
it's pretty heady statement right those
get a hold of yourself but but the
reason is justified is the fact that we
have just as of last year almost 70
countries who've managed to participate
in ISS using it not just the not just
the partnership country so you can see
the the four main partners at the top of
that ring the United States Canada Japan
and Russia and then the rest of the the
ISA represented countries in the rest of
the flags and then all the other
participants that I mentioned on the
side so we've gotten a lot of use of the
ISS so far across the world and it can
have a can have a significantly
stabilizing effect beyond beyond just
individual principal investigators from
different countries collaborating so
carrying on with the humans explore our
concept so you know they explore in
order to advance so you can debate all
you want about Columbus's and initial
intentions or or final intentions but
it's hard to debate with against or
about the the influence that his initial
trip had on Spain and and the subsequent
trips that continued they didn't go once
and stop they went and continued to go
and Spain you know significantly left
the Iberian Peninsula and at one point
claimed nearly half the world in
contrast in the it was the 1400s the
Ming Dynasty had sent out a large large
naval fleet that was larger than
anything the Portuguese were flatware
were sailing through the Indian Ocean
and then when that monarch died and his
son took over he pulled back and they
stopped the naval exploration and
there's 11 train of thought that says
you know that helped lead to to the Ming
Dynasty zend was there their lack of
continued exploration then they weren't
there when the Portuguese came in with
much smaller boats and like I said you
can you can observe from where you are
or you can go there to observe natural
phenomenon if you if you if you look far
enough you can see some interesting
things like and and in gained something
from it so you have Isaac Newton proving
everything that he was looking at by by
observing the curvature of a comment and
you know that led to calculus and
proving that and a lot of the missions
that actually went somewhere to explore
the the standard way to do that was
would to bring a naturalist with you a
scientist or a naturalist so so we have
Captain Cook and it shows the resolution
there I think his first trip was on the
endeavor and that was to Tahiti to
observe the transit of Venus and so that
the big thing there was trying to
discover or to prove the size of the
solar system and the problem is that you
know science takes a lot of time so they
got back from that trip and the royal
society that had funded them based on
the recommendation of halle several
decades before we're completely
unimpressed with with the data that they
brought back this is this is no good at
all but it turns out that later on when
they were able to double check a lot of
the work in the next transit they were
able to say that they were within less
than I know it was less than half a
percent accuracy for for the size of the
solar system so science takes longer
than the exploration itself you know
subsequent trips you to scout he was
looking for a Northwest Passage and
found Hawaii I think that's a good
that's a good return on investment there
on on on Darwin's trip you know he
was a trip the the trip of the Beagle
the second one the one that the one that
the Darwin was on he was observing a lot
of geology stuff and that was a trip
that was specific to map the west coast
of South America so it was it was a it
was a strict exploration mission to
bring back cartography map out the west
coast but Darwin noticed you know
seashells at altitude when he was when
he was ashore and then noticed a lot of
the other natural stuff and it was until
20 years later that origins of species
was actually published so my point all
this is that science takes longer period
of time than the specific exploration
that you're conducting so some of the
things that we're doing up there biology
you know whether it's an animal cell or
whether it's a bacteria we're
recognizing that particularly in things
like gene expression that the
microgravity environment ends up
stressing the organism and that
stressing of the organism ends up
expressing itself in jeans for the same
way it does in a in a large organism if
you stress it a certain way certain
things come out or recognizing the same
thing in observations on ISS and when
you yeah go ahead it can yeah and I
think the one the sticks in my mind was
a Shannon lucid did some work on mirror
before we had ISS that showed higher
rates of mutation on things but they try
and they try and back that out and make
sure that what they're looking at is
this and and the important thing is not
necessarily that oh it's microgravity
that turned this particular expression
on it's recognizing that when that gene
is turned on this happens so that you
can then go ahead and prevent that or or
rum or encourage that in order to do
what you need to do on the ground but
the ISS is considered a radiation
environment and look
crew or considered radiation workers so
we do a lot of work on on monitoring the
radiation environment and and I'll
mention that again and a little bit
later when we talk about some of the
technology stuff they were trying to do
then okay okay so other biology stuff
just you know larger scale systems right
so plants it'd be nice if we could if we
could be able to grow plants on a
transit mission so these are you know
some of the things that we're looking at
but there's also fundamental research
involved with with some of the work that
we're doing with plants up there human
physiology there's plenty that goes on
with the human body when we're up there
and some of them that we manage to even
start to overcome so we've had a lot of
a long time you've probably heard about
crew coming back after a long-duration
mission basically with osteoporosis
right so you as soon as you get up there
you stop stressing particularly your
large bones of in your legs and your
back and your hips because you're no
longer loading it every step of every
day and your body is very efficient and
it just starts flushing and everything
out to the point that was beyond what we
even thought of when we built the
environmental control and life support
system for urine processing it fouled
nearly immediately when it got up there
because it wasn't built to handle the
large amounts of calcium that the crew
is dumping out every day but through
through some through the right ratios of
protein and potassium we think we've
over again and serious at then lots of
time exercising we think we've overcome
most of those issues for the crew and
we'll see whether that ends up you know
helping my grandmother or somebody
else's grandmother later on and that's
one of the one of the ways that it
actually does transition into an earth
benefit when we research these type of
things plenty of physical sciences work
that's up there you know this is so I
didn't make this particular slide in
this one this one often turns and
it to view is a little hokey but every
you guys all understand there's no
convection space right because there's
no gravity right but the the thing that
I didn't even realize until a couple
years ago is that we don't have any data
on for instance large-scale combustion
and we've done a lot of work on in
flames in space but it's all been very
small very contained and so we're going
to do some large-scale fire tests using
ISS and at first when I first heard of
it i was just i thought we're going to
do some big Wrath of Khan glowing orb
that is going to burn up out of this guy
this is going to be the coolest looking
thing it's not going to be that cool
looking but so we're going to do is
we're going to take the orbitals Cygnus
vehicle and that is a vehicle that
normally burns up when it returns so we
have two commercial cargo vehicles that
I mentioned for the United States SpaceX
has a heat shield and is recoverable and
we bring back science to do analysis on
the ground the orbital vehicle right now
is designed to burn up so we put garbage
and other things that we want to get rid
of into that vehicle and it hits the
atmosphere at the right angle so it
burns up but we're going to take a large
part of the inside of that vehicle I
thought we were going to set the whole
thing on fire when the proposal came to
me but they're going to do it multiple
times on multiple return missions of the
orbitals Cygnus and we're going to get
data from it and it's just going to be a
large box on the inside as burning
within the box so it'll still be a
controlled reentry everything will be
fine and we'll be far less like the
movies but it's still going to be it's
still going to be very interesting data
for that astrophysics and fundamental
physics so way out of my league with
this type of stuff but so we got a guy
named Sam cane who's got a Nobel Prize
at home who came up with with this
particular effort he realized that this
was the only way he was going to get
this particular research done he's
looking at dark matter we got a special
spot right for him he ended up
redesigning everything to have a
permanent magnet instead of electro
magnet this has been the work of
thousands of people just for this one
particular experiment and and we'll see
if he doubles up on his prizes by the
time he gets all this data together and
gets all his publications out
and this is the type of stuff that he's
looking at I'm not sure this doesn't
have the info on a number of hits so the
the number of data samples that they've
they announce that they've had through
AMS is almost getting silly now I think
it's I can't remember to which power it
is but it's at least you know ten to the
twentieth number of hits and particles
that they're taking and so the vast
number crunching that goes on with
trying to decide what they can infer
from all this data that they're getting
and so most of that is to come okay well
so now more into the area that i am i'm
an engineer so most of the stuff that
that i have a little bit better
understanding for it is in the area of
Technology and engineering so we do some
stuff up there with that we got the
Robonaut project manager right here and
Rhonda Fleur and that's one of the
things that we've done up there and
there's a lot that we have to figure out
if we're going to go somewhere else so
we got the ISS there now and it's state
of the art right there is there's really
no better space vehicle that's flying
anywhere regardless of the fact that we
got you know older laptops and we've got
computers that we call mDM's that are
running what are they running yeah 2
86's or something I mean you know so
they're very reliable they're rad
hardened and they do very well but it's
the state-of-the-art system and it's
built specifically the whole vehicle is
built to be where it is in low Earth
orbit where we can launch a Soyuz or
maybe later on a commercial crew vehicle
or something else and get there very
quickly or in a real emergency the crew
can come home no problem very quickly in
the Soyuz but if we're going to go for a
long time a long distance away there are
other things that we want to do we want
to use the space station to prove out
all of the technology that we need for
that we don't want to find out halfway
to Mars the urine processor doesn't work
that's not so great so um we tried to
come up with arioso what things do we
want to do up there and obviously
any any engineer in this room could
probably come up with with most of the
the general areas that we needed to do
figure out your environment get your
reliability and where it needs to be
look at the logistics that you do or
don't need for the mission that you're
potentially going to do and reduce that
risk implementing it somewhere else so
we came up with it with a bunch of areas
and and we use the we use the National
Academy of Sciences the National
Research Council the agency does to tell
us what to do a lot on the science side
they have something called the decadal
survey and that's like their Bible if
it's not in the decadal survey you're
not going to see the science Mission
Directorate spending money on it on the
tech side we also get inputs from the
National Academy and and the underlined
ones are the ones that they had
recommended that you know we focus on
but sometimes where the underlying ones
are the are the specific experiments
that address areas that we were told to
concentrate on but a lot of them don't
necessarily complete the complete the
the problem they don't put to bed the
problem so we started throughout with
all our partners we got these teams
together and we said okay we're going to
figure out and prioritize what we're
going to use is s4 for technology
demonstrations and we all sat down and
we came up with Holly areas that we
thought we were going to come up with in
the first place and we and we did
prioritize Equalists the environment
control my support systems as as the top
one you know so we have a lot of
consumables that we end up using of the
ISS version of Eclipse we end up relying
upon a logistics train the the resupply
vehicles that we have for that equals
there's things that we need to do in
order to go to Mars for instance with
eClass and we can identify those so that
was good and then on the radiation side
of things we said we need to figure this
out too because it's a different
radiation environment once you get
outside the Van Allen belts and we got
to know all about that and so when we
looked at it we had a million options on
what to do for environmental control and
life support systems and all of us were
you know well-rounded generalists in the
areas of space technology and we didn't
think it was really fair
the six or seven of us that were on
there were tests on this team to make
these large decisions on top of that
it's a political environment that you
have right so you have one idea that
comes from Alabama you got another one
that comes from ohio yet other one comes
from texas and no matter which one you
choose somebody says well the reason
they chose that is because of this and
then somebody calls an elected official
and then all of a sudden year you're
designing your spacecraft inside the
beltway instead of where it needs to be
you know on a drafting table or the
modern equivalent of it so what we did
is we said all right we're going to you
we're going to set up teams and we're
going to use in the exact same way that
the rest of the agency uses the NRC and
the national academies and and tell us
what's going on because while on the
ecocide we had a million options on the
radiation side we had a real lack of
options we sense the heck out of
radiation up there and that's what all
the all the proposals were sensing
sensing sensing sensing so we're going
to be able to tell a crew your smoked
but I'm not sure how we can tell them
that but you'll be okay so so that's one
of the things that we've tasked that
particular team with and we've called
the system maturation teams and we've
set one up for Eclipse we set one up for
Common Era we set one of her radiation
we set one up we already really had a
program for the human research program
really already existed before this so we
said hey you guys make sure you
concentrate on that so we did that for
all the technical areas so that we could
properly identify and we told them we
just want you to come up we just want
you to evaluate the technical solutions
first identify the technical gaps and
then help us identify the solutions and
we're trying to take you know any
politics out of it as to whose idea so
we have experts from across the agency
we populated it from from every Center
and when they come to a consensus we've
got it so the technology investment
teams within the agency and the programs
can say well what does the SMT think
about this and they say oh they think
this is their top priority and that's
how we get things funded and flown and X
cubed and it's important because if
you've paid attention to any federal
budget discussion over the last few
years it's a zero-sum game right so if
we end up choosing the wrong thing to
invest in and it costs X dollars those
dollars are gone right and it can't be
used to spend on something else so when
when we look at the
the technical gaps that we have we have
to agree that their general enough that
they should be addressed now before
congress or a president tells us this is
your mission because everything that
we're doing now is based on a generality
we know we want to go out there
somewhere so we look at all the
generation eric solutions to these
technology problems and prioritize
filling in those gaps based on what you
need that the lead time in order to
develop them if you know you need four
years on an ecosystem well you better
make sure you have four years left of
ISS by the time you fly it in order to
vet it out and then make any mods that
you need to once you're there and we're
trying to get the teams to develop and
some of them have already you know
specific roadmaps so that we can then
say you know what we're done with the
space station we've met every goal check
check check check and we can hand it
over to commercial entities or we can
simply let's transition to deep space
because we've managed to address what we
need to using this vehicle an important
thing to understand is that people look
at things differently depending on who
you are and actually is missing there we
go okay so depending on who you are you
might look at the flow of how the space
station got up there a little
differently if you were building it if
you're a part of the project management
you you design it and then you assemble
it and then you start using it and then
you think about okay do we need to use
it for a longer period of time where are
we good then you look worried about
extension if you're on the science side
well in the design you people are
probably people are telling me that
there's going to be a space station
let's let's hold off and see if one
actually gets built and then we start
building it and they're like all right
well let's wait until it finishes and
then okay you guys are really done okay
go right ahead and we really saw that we
saw this gap after we were finished
building it we turned around and said
who wants to use it and there hadn't
been this backlog of science waiting to
use the ISS because that's not the way
that you get your research funded is by
saying I'm going to go do some research
I'd like you to give me several million
dollars and I'm going to conduct it on
that vehicle that doesn't get exist so
we had to wait first we had to
we had the promise that it got up there
then we had to deliver it and now we're
seeing a lot more a lot more usage and
requests for use now that it's been
there and it's a it's a proven commodity
and then if you know if you're just in
the in the organization you first you
worried about all the requirements and
how to get the things done then you're
worried about building the vehicle and
getting the crew there and and this was
this is the transition that I was
talking about before this changing your
focus to research and then okay are we
going to continue that or not and then
this kind of just mentions the things
that I've already talked about with
operating safely it's probably not
enough you need to take enough of a risk
so that you get the proper return on on
the investment and is what I was talking
about before that it's a real laboratory
and it's okay if things don't work the
first time and getting people to accept
the fact that that's that's perfectly
acceptable okay so I mentioned some
earth science stuff before and said that
I talked about it so it turns out is a
really great platform so I mentioned
that we are at a higher inclination then
a lot of space shuttle flights would
take so we would flop we would launch
out of Florida and so you would from
that latitude you'd get to a higher
altitude by staying at that latitude
instead of going to a higher one and
that's probably where is s would have
been if it was just space station
freedom a soul United States effort but
because we wanted to have access by our
partners to the vehicle we have we're at
a higher inclination which ends up
providing a lot more access and a lot
more visibility to the ground that we
wouldn't have had otherwise so you end
up covering eighty-five percent of the
Earth's surface flying over it where you
wouldn't have you'd have been kind of
skinny down no no further north in
Florida and then every one two three
days he end up passing over ninety-five
percent of the world's population so not
only is an international space station
because of investment but its
international in that if you go to your
computer and you look up ISS sightings
you can see it go right over your head
off
and it can make observations of where
you live which can be significant as
well some of those observation can be in
the hyperspectral zone so this is this
is looking at a lot of stuff whether it
be ocean temperatures or or reactions of
the ocean to changing temperatures or it
could be we've had agriculture requests
to look at things like like the Napa
Valley for for the way that agriculture
is responding or not to to climb it I
mentioned the relativistic aspect of it
so in 2016 we're going to the ISA is
going to fly the Asus so this is an
atomic clock it's going to have two
clocks in it actually one is going to be
one is going to be based on cesium atoms
I think camera or what the other side is
but between the two clocks they'll have
an accuracy of better than one second
for 300 million years right so they're
going to compare that to very accurate
clocks on the ground and compare and and
end up proving out some some Einstein
stuff or or or maybe proving it to be
debatable but between a gravitation and
and relativistic time so even before we
said hey everybody it's open for you so
open for business come and use it we'd
already done some significant things
really in the spare time we're spending
a lot of time building it but in the
spare time we still manage to do quite a
lot of stuff Maxie was was a joint
venture with Jackson us and and so they
were able to observe and the compliments
and other observation of a black hole
swallowing a star this first time that
had been done they noticed something
with the crew that there were certain
crew members they were coming back with
vision issues so they realized that it's
that it might be its environmental for
sure but it might affect specific crew
members more than others so we've been
looking at that and whether it's
intracranial pressure or whether it's a
gene expression type thing microbial
virulence so that's what I mentioned
before about the stressor on
everything not just sells but but
microbes as well and so there's some
resulting from that there are some
candidate vaccines for four different
things that that have been out there and
I removed the slide from it but there's
there's that valley of death 444
technologies and science research that
comes out right so there's there's this
there's this rush up with results that
end up being obtained from all this work
and then getting across that final
Valley to whether it be something that
you can do a human research trial on or
whether it's a true commercial product
or anything you got to get across that
big hurdle so you can hear a lot of
stuff that gets to the point that I'm
talking about right there that never
gets into a hospital or or into into
bestbuy or somewhere like that let's see
the NASA exploration mission side that's
largely what we're tasking the smts to
help us come up with the proper
investments to do and and they're well
on their way to doing that we've have
had some spin-offs in technology area
like like robotic assists for for brain
surgery there's there's a need for
telemedicine when it comes to having a
crew being that far away from from Earth
there's a filtering for for air that has
come out we you need the crew to breathe
the same air all the time and it's got
to be compatible with with human life
and then see the last one remotely
guided ultrasound for maternal care
another telemedicine application so my
original question or title was how best
to use so here's here's some final
points on how I would best use it in my
recommendations for it so prioritize
your resources of limited life so that
the saying that a lot of people have in
the NASA area have heard me use a lot
was use the space station now the ground
is going to be here forever so there's a
there's a there's a premise that you
can't fly something until you're ready
to fly because I can't be that guy that
people are talking about that it didn't
work the first time we flew
dioxide removal solution called a mean
swing bed which was going to be
applicable to the next Orion vehicle
that we're building and we built it by
NASA standards we built it on the cheap
and it flew up there and hit didn't work
and we ended up using the crew to fix it
and it wasn't it wasn't a small amount
there were wasn't a small amount of time
that we ended up doing and we consider
bringing it home which was also another
acceptable solution we have paid for the
logistics so you can fly something there
if it doesn't if it really doesn't work
and it really can't be fixed on orbit
will fly it home will tweak it and fly
it again if it's of the right priority
and the right need for either you the
country or the agency so prioritize the
work that you're doing and and funded
appropriately you don't need to
overspend and I don't recommend under
spanning force the institutional change
that's required so we did the
reorganization that we need we're
redesigning processes still every day
there is a specific team at JSC right
now that is changing the entire process
by which we accept experiments to ISS
because we deemed it as too expensive as
did some of our customers if you guys
are if you guys are providing products
that are too expensive for people to use
you're going to make you're going to
make a change well as a government
agency there's not always the same
impetus but we have enough people that
care enough about this that we're doing
exactly that and then change the
perceptions of your organization how
they perceive everybody who is going to
be their customer have a plan and
measure your performance to it that
might scare people who are big on
fundamental research it doesn't have to
be the results that you plan for it just
needs to be planning appropriately for
what you want to investigate and explore
on the tech side we have specific goals
that we need to get to embrace the
private sector so we're certainly doing
that in the logistics train we don't
have any NASA owned assets and that's
been something to get used to we pay
SpaceX and Orbital to get stuff there
and back and for now we pay the Russians
for for humans to get there and back so
I think we're doing that and the part
that I discussed before about trying to
get American entities to recognize the
space station is there for them they can
keep all their intellectual property and
we assume effectively all the risk if
you build the hardware getting that word
out is important and then getting word
out is really important that people
understand the benefits that we're
getting so if you have if you have
people that are properly reporting the
work that they do whether it's something
as significant as origins of species or
not it's important to for people to
understand this was possible because of
this asset and it's a good that you know
our elected officials can understand all
right this is something that is actually
benefiting people in my district people
on people in this state or just people
on the earth in general so increasing
the increasing the public knowledge is a
real thing and even that is a benefit to
everybody here so that's all I had and
so I can open it up to two questions so
it's it's kind of a double track
question but I don't hear much about the
International Space Station in the media
and we have in parallel we had Maria
claw way here last week talking about
building inclusive environments and
getting more women and minorities
involved in stem and CS I don't in any
way mean to propose doing like crass dog
and pony shows with the International
Space Station but do you have an
outreach effort to try to get kids of
all backgrounds from all around the
world excited about what the
international space station is doing and
engaged with the experiments that are
happening there well you know very
honestly it's not something that
historically NASA's done very well just
outreach in general and I think that
when you have the the type of people
that NASA historically has been
attracted an attractive to they're all
about the mission right and so if you go
to the moon that's going to get people
excited right but when you talk about
science research you know I think of
that I think that Big Bang episode where
they're like let's get to work right and
they play the theme to Rocky while they
stare at a white ball
for an hour like that nest that doesn't
always get people excited right so I
think one of the best one of the best
outreach activities that ISS has had has
been through YouTube and Google when
they were able to get I can't remember
how many proposals they got but they
ended up you know selecting two to fly
on ISS that is that's not an
insignificant thing particularly for
those kids that manage to do it and
exposed everybody who even tried to be
selected to the process of developing
and proposing scientific activities I
think that's great we recently had a
three-day wasn't really a retreat but we
had three day discussion with the ISS
leadership recently and that was one of
the things that we talked about was the
outreach aspect and making sure that
people understand everything is is
really part of all of our jobs so it's
one of the reasons I'm here you
mentioned a couple of times that the the
resources limited that it would have a
you know an end of life at some point
could you tell me when that is and then
what what is NASA considering for you
know as it develops larger and perhaps
more complex space stations well so the
so I I was talking to the it's kind of a
complicated answer as to what the space
station life is right now because you
have so many different political
entities that are involved with it so
2016 was the original date the United
States has approved 2020 our partners
are working on improving 2020 but
there's general acceptance within for
instance my colleagues within the space
station program from other countries
that is 2020 the the current
administration has said that they are
good with it being too 20-24 there's
there's a general rule shocking that
they follow any rules consistently but
with a general rule within the Beltway
that you don't commit two
administrations beyond you to anything
so that so there that's it's not law but
the butt 20-24 is kind of
general acceptance within the United
States as to how long we're going to
have and use the ISS and then everybody
within the program itself has been
working to certify all of the hardware
to make sure that the vehicle itself can
last at least until 20 28 so we think we
have a reasonable a reasonable future in
being able to in being able to provide a
product to the customers that are out
there and it's important that people
understand that that that horizon is
well down the road because a lot of
these investments take several years to
first fund and then build and then fly
and then reef lie if they need to so
assuring people that we're going to be
there for a while I think it's an
important thing to get across yeah same
2016 would probably kill most people's
yeah we addressed we addressed that
pretty pretty early on after assembly
complete that we were going to need in
order to do we need to do it needed to
be you know minimum 2020 we got
concurrence with that and then general
concurrence on we're looking at 20 24
and then the whole time you you don't
get to go beyond 20 24 if that is what
your goal is right so we're trying to
make sure that it's that everything is
capable of sustaining flight well beyond
20 28 so the next step for NASA is not
necessarily another space station but
more along the lines of a trip to Mars
is that what I'm hearing I think that is
the general you know you can get in
trouble by saying this is what we are
aren't doing these days but the the
general consensus is that all the prep
work that we're doing particularly in
tech and human research is to enable a
trip to Mars now whether you do that by
making a pit stop at the moon or whether
you do some asteroid work first or
wherever it's it's it doesn't seem to be
offensive to anybody to say that's an
eventual destination and it happens to
be really hard so all of the tech
solutions that we have are really
bounded by that extreme of trying to go
to Mars did you have an updated take on
Kessler syndrome
is there is there a way that newer
satellite companies like skybox and
things like that sort of change that
equation well so the access of other
companies is is there I don't know if
you heard that part I'm not I'm not good
to be able to give you an update on any
of that stuff but but the access of
private entities to ISS is established
and it's a really open road to get there
through through cases the Center for
advancement space science and and those
guys can help anybody get there that the
law is written that half of the US
assets are national has designated a
National Lab they didn't specifically
tell us how we were supposed to measure
that percentage or whether it was
measured on a monthly or yearly or five
year basis but we haven't really
approached fifty percent about mass yet
on each launch so there's plenty of room
there for private companies to try and
do stuff yeah just following up on the
question about lifetime what's the
average proposal to flight time for
projects that come into your office for
the things that come into our office you
know we there was when I said you know
one of the things about embracing the
commercial sector is we had to let those
guys get off the ground because we
didn't end up starting with the it
wasn't Boeing and Lockheed that ended up
proposing to be the commercial providers
for the commercial cargo so SpaceX had
to start from the beginning orbital had
to build their whole vehicle themselves
as well so there was a significant lag
in our ability to deliver hardware for a
while until they really got going so for
instance the cameras that I showed when
we first got in here we were racing to
get those built just in case another
payload wasn't ready for space x3 and
that was in 2011 and we didn't launch
until this this year to get that going
but but now I think we're we're about to
start cruising
I think with with real regular transport
so it's it's it's quite variable when
you say how long does it take most of
them are not you know that's a very
simple payload you know for cameras in a
box outside make sure that it doesn't
fall apart right so that was very easy
to build most of them are not waiting
for a ride but but for instance the legs
that went on Robonaut those waited for a
while and and that particular project
needed to figure out their funding
profile as as them as they weren't
integrated at ISS and so that goes that
falls into part of my responsibilities
when we prioritize the work that gets
done not just what just the up mass but
what the crew spends time on and that's
part of the discussion when I say no
this has to be the top priority because
that researcher is losing funding at the
end of this quarter so that's why it's
the priority was and so loss of science
is a huge driver in getting things done
at ISS it's one of the reasons that the
human research program gets so much time
because if you go through five months of
a crew member on orbit and you need the
sixth month in order to complete the run
it's complete loss of science this guys
coming home you can't do anything else
after that so that becomes a priority
one of the discussions but we can get
stuff you know that the standard
template is 18 months 18 months from
when you get you get effectively
manifested for that increment for that
period of time and then fly you got to
be on Doc it depends on you on the
launch provider but Gabby on Doc usually
90 days ahead of launch so it seems like
cost is the primary limiting factor on
the life span of the ISS I'm not sure
that's true I mean it has to so whose
cost so so so cost is a significant
factor in the in the investment of the
science that gets done you know way back
when the space station was conceived
they were going to be two pots of money
one to operate to build and operate the
vehicle and the second pot to do all the
research well long ago that second pot
failed to
and so we're in the in a situation of
build it and they will come and part of
that is getting the word out so the the
there is a you know a nominal amount
that of NASA's budget that is required
in order to continue flying the ISS so
that that would be required if it was
going to continue to be a government
asset it's possible when NASA has met
all of its needs that it gets turned
over to to to a corporate entity that
manages to continue to use it it
depending on when that is it might be
the hardware that is the that's the
limiting factor on continuing to use it
and are the costs going down as
companies like SpaceX reduce costs to
launch well I mean that we only have one
contract so far for commercial cargo
there was we were talking earlier that
they were going to talk we're going to I
think there's a pending announcement on
Commercial Crew my one of my bosses is
off doing the work for the second
iteration of commercial cargo so to say
that anything's coming down would have
to await I'd say the next iteration of
contracting to say that it's sensative
is coming down but that that's the
that's one of the intense of of using
the commercial side of things is because
they don't they don't require themselves
to adhere to the 40 years of bureaucracy
that we've set up for ourselves isn't
that next round of contracts today it
might be I haven't seen whether they're
