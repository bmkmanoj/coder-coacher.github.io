 we're glad to have Steve Schill
hair and I just have a quick bio to read
about him Steve shell has been working
on a senior site as a senior scientist
for Nature Conservancy's since 2003 in
this capacity he worked closely with
governments in the Caribbean and Africa
on conservation projects identifying
high-priority conservation areas
improving management capacity and
implementing monitoring measures his
passion is learning and applying new
spatial technology to confront today's
challenging conservation problems
working primarily on marine conservation
issues he assists governments to design
and declare new marine protected areas
using information products derived from
satellite and drone technology Steve
receives doctrine geography the
University of Southern Cal Carolina and
is currently an adjunct professor at
Brigham Young University's Department of
Geography where he teaches courses in
remote sensing and if anyone has
questions that there's a dory into the
word conservation and will save probably
last 10 minutes for Q&amp;amp;A so right Steve
yeah i graduated from the original USC
yours at south carolina gonna cap all
right yeah who is doing well in the
n-c-double-a yeah well thanks for the
opportunity to come I love talking about
technology and how you can apply it to
to today's conservation problem and many
conservation is is a really tough
problem to solve and we really need
technology because there are some
challenging we've got growing
populations diminishing resources it's
one of those wicked what they call
wicked problems how do you solve for the
future what what is what is our
environment I'm going to look like and
it's going to take technology
IG to really solve these issues so like
Rob said I do a lot of work with coral
reefs that's coral reefs and mangroves
are the two environments that I work on
the most my PhD was looking at oyster
beds and learning how to detect oysters
using different remote sensing
technologies and I really like that land
water interface because it's so dynamic
a lot it there's a lot going on there
and then as I started work with an H
Conservancy I focused a lot on mapping
coral reefs and understanding what
technologies we can use and also how to
monitor them not only map them and
create baseline maps but but how to
monitor them and I'm going to talk a
little about that but most of my talk is
going to be focused on coral reefs and a
little bit on mangroves so just to start
off you know a lot of people don't under
they do really don't appreciate coral
reefs the way that we should so what
percentage of all marine species live on
coral reefs so think in your mind what
do you think it is and it's actually
twenty five percent even though coral
reefs only occupy about point two
percent of the the global ocean space
they have over a million species
twenty-five percent of you know
biodiversity they're really the
rainforests of the the ocean so which of
these benefits to coral reefs offer our
society now many people think
automatically think of tourism you know
they love to go down into the tropics
and scuba dive and snorkel but they
offer so much more than recreation
coastal protection I'll talk a little
more about that food source a source of
protein for 500 million people around
the world livelihoods it's all the above
and there's also much more the coral
reefs give us such as medical a lot of
arm
suitable companies are studying coral
reefs it's the answer to this question
is all the above it's actually being a
very in the medical community cancer a
lot of studies have been have come from
coral reef environments and we're we're
discovering new species and there's
really interesting things that we can
learn from coral reefs in coral reefs
act as a storm barrier to coastal
populations and they actually reduce
there's been several studies on this by
the Nature Conservancy and others up to
ninety seven percent of energy of
incoming waves is that energy is reduced
from those barrier coral reefs so they
provide a lot of protection just like
like hurricane sandy we have natural
coastal environments such as the salt
marshes that absorb a lot of its energy
the mangroves coral reefs also attenuate
energy from incoming waves so that's
that's a huge service for coastal
populations and also besides all those
economic benefits we add them all
together how can we put a price tag on
coral reefs but actually if nine point
nine trillion is the latest literature
but just coastal protection alone I
think its nine billion dollars in annual
services that coral reefs provide and if
you think about governments trying to
make decisions on whether they build a
seawall or whether they invest in coral
reef restoration we're trying to make
the argument that it's much more cost
effective in terms of maintenance in
terms of all the other benefits that you
gain from coral reefs terms of fisheries
the recreation value storm protection
we're trying to governments to focus on
restoring coral reefs and not build that
see law which will not only deck degrade
their marine environment but it costs a
lot to maintain those and governments
are slowly realizing this so you've
probably heard in the news there lots a
lot of this gloom and doom about reefs
and how they're we're losing a lot and
we have less of what we've lost about
thirty percent I work a lot with
Caribbean and we've gone from about
thirty percent coral cover back in the
70s 80s when it was measurers lot
there's a lot more coral and now we're
seeing five ten percent coil cover there
are some areas where we're seeing come
back of endangered species and we're
trying to identify those areas and get
them protected and so there are hope
spots that we're trying to focus on or
trying to understand why reefs are doing
long summer is and they're not doing
well in other areas we know a lot of it
has to do with global circulations we
know that overfishing is a problem a lot
of these reefs to pin on Mike parrotfish
that herbivores that graze the algae off
up the the coral reefs the pollution is
a problem of the rising sea temperatures
is a problem we're seeing that in the
Great Barrier Reef and reefs are
resilient it's nature's resilient
overall if you give it a chance it will
come back and that's that's why we're
doing a lot of worked with governments
to try to help them adopt management
practices that well and and best use
practices around these races to help
them recover this is a lionfish and
you've probably heard about this it's
not endemic to it's not native to the
Caribbean it's an it's native to the
South Pacific and this has been a big
problem there a lot of theories on why
this species of fish here but it has no
natural predators and it has a very big
appetite and they have like in Cayman
Islands they'll have lionfish derbies
lavelle bill they'll have competitions
where they'll try to
harvest as many as they can and the
spines on this on these are very very
venomous so if you see one of these when
you're scuba diving and I'll just just
watch don't touch as is the the role in
scuba diving but they it's a problem and
they're here to stay they have a pelagic
larvae duration that's so that's the
larvae in the water column will drift on
the surface of the ocean for 90 days and
it can it can be dispersed in over a
wide geographic space and this is a
problem because we found them down at
depths of 200 feet whenever I go scuba
diving them I always see them they're
here to stay so we've got to come up
with ways to be able to manage for for
this one so this causes a problem with
coral reefs we've got dead zones these
have been mapped around the world such
as the outlet of the Mississippi River
whether it's incredible amount of
nutrients are coming into the ocean and
and that basically depletes the water
column of dissolved oxygen so there's
these large areas of the ocean where
they're essentially void of life there's
overfishing we have what we call a
shifting baseline of what a big fish is
you know when you tuck your grandpa what
was the size of fish you caught oh is
this big and I was considered a big fish
but now you know as you can see here
this is a key west 1957 1983 you see the
fish are getting smaller and smaller
there's more pressure or technology of
getting better to catch fish and we have
a shifting baseline so a big fish that
used to be like this is now this big so
we've got that problem this is a news
clipping I just took off this morning
from BBC showing the records that were
set last year 2016 in terms of the
global temperatures and everywhere in
this dark red a record was
and this is kind of a disturbing trend
one that doesn't bode well for corey's
but like I said there are hopes pots and
as a conservationist you've always got
to have hope but we're seeing the
bleaching that that's going on and
corals can recover and we've seen a lot
of places where it is recovering
especially in the care of the end but if
it's there if it's if they're stressed
for too long then they don't recover and
this is essentially when the corals
expelled a symbiotic algae and they turn
white and they and they bleach this is
what bleaching is and but it is like I
said it for large areas if it's
prolonged to too much stress recovery is
very difficult now how did I get into
this type of work well back in 1992 I
was on an airplane and I was I looked in
front of me at a time magazine that was
left there and I and I was I was 19 at
the time and and I pulled this this time
magazine out and I read about the
conference that was occurring in rio de
janeiro in 1992 that was the first time
the government's got together and said
you know we have a problem our
biodiversity is in decline and it's
declining pretty rapidly we're losing a
lot of habitats globally we need to come
together and do something and they
created what was called the convention
on biological diversity where they make
commitments to protect to do inventory
the habitats that they have within their
country 196 countries sign this and and
they made commitments to to protect
these habitats which in return would
protect these species and try to curb
this loss of biodiversity well in the
Caribbean in 2013 10 governments came
together and they decided well nigh
there's 10 now at nine at the time in
2013 and Richard Branson
the nature conservancy led this this
initiative and Richard Branson said why
don't we all meet together on my private
island in British Virgin Islands Necker
Island and there is doing a brotherly
handshake with Keith Mitchell the prime
minister of Grenada and and they they
came together and said we need to to
come up with a solution of this and
those countries pledged to protect
twenty percent of their marine space and
develop management strategies and
develop a conservation trust fund to
fund the management of these marine
protected areas so that's what the
Nature Conservancy is doing is we are
working with governments to identify if
you're going to protect ten percent or
twenty percent of mangroves or coral
reefs with which twenty percent you
protect so we use science to answer that
question we use a lot of satellite
mapping we use a lot of experts to
understand where those areas are now I
want to tell a quick story about this is
Louie the loggerhead lock Louie the
loggerhead and and this story tells you
the value of nature in protecting it and
making this argument to the government
on on what we need to be doing to to
protect nature and you can you can ask
yourself a question how much is a live
turtle worth versus a dead turtle you
know in the Eastern Caribbean you can
get on a four hundred ec Eastern
Caribbean dollars for a bucket of turtle
meat now in many of these countries it's
illegal some countries actually have a I
think st. Vincent actually recently
banned the harvest of turtle but it goes
on illegally and so you ask yourself you
know what's what's worth more alive
turtle or dead turtle and this story
answers that question so I was in Haiti
and we were talking to the Minister of
Tourism we were down in a city called Li
ke and the southern peninsula and he
owned this this
restaurant and he was getting it set up
in the corner I noticed he was trying to
build it hadn't opened yet but he was
trying to build a little aquarium in the
side and I was looking at it going I
wonder what that's for and we were
sitting there having a having a meeting
with him talking about how can we ideas
for bringing tourism back to Haiti and
there's beautiful beautiful beaches in
Haiti and they're trying to bring trying
to bring tourists back and while we're
sitting there there were two men that
came into the back and they were
carrying a turtle and it was it was the
loggerhead turtle this one right here
the Kerner turtle and I merely stood up
and I had Natalie's any with me who's
she's a fishery scientist and we're like
you know what's going on why is why
what's the turtle doing it in here and
the minister of tourism said oh that's I
hired these these people to get a turtle
so I could put it in my aquarium that
I'm building here and we were like that
turtles not going to survive in that
aquarium and he said well I don't want
that turtle anyway I just you know go
sell it in the market it's too big and
it was a pretty big turtle and Natalie
immediately goes you're not going to
take that turtle Oh market how much do
you want for that turtle will buy it and
and I said in he goes a hundred dollars
he said I wanted Hunter dollars that's
how much I paid these guys to catch me a
turtle and and Natalie looks at me and
says Steve you have a hundred dollars
and I I had our village but I said well
isn't this going to encourage more you
know harvesting of turtles if we do this
you know and she was like I don't care
steve when I know what this turtle died
we're we're going to buy this turtle and
so until I said okay we're going to buy
a turtle and so I got a hundred dollars
i paid it and and we took the turtle and
we we said well we got to get this
turtle back in a safe place you know
it's going to die if we don't do
anything and it was really struggling
they'd brought it in and put it on its
back and so
got it and and we I was with a team from
you net and when you're in Haiti you
know he have high security this several
years ago and you go around in these
these SUVs and they have constant
communication in case there's any
security problems and so we go out to
the the the SUV that's parked out there
in my Chi and the driver there is you
know he's going he's asleep in the car
and we're banging on the window saying
open up he's looking at us forget this
big turtle and he's like yeah I can put
that turtle in my car yes we are you're
going to open up this this car we're
going to we're going to stick at the
back of the car so he were like we got
out we open it up they put the turtle
and back and say okay let's let's go
let's get out of it to a remote beach
and let this turtle go and he wasn't too
happy but you can see the turtle is
thrashing around in back and we were on
the patient roads it was quite a ride
but we eventually we eventually made it
to a site where it was it was pretty you
know this was an area that was away from
a lot of the villages and but there was
a restaurant that was there right on the
beach and this is where a lot of the
expats from port-au-prince they come and
they they basically enjoy the
environment and relax on the beach and
we pulled up next to this restaurant and
we open up the back and it was kind of
an open-air restaurant so a lot of
people were we're eating and just
enjoying the sunset and we open up the
back we bring this turtle and it was
really amazing to watch almost every one
of the restaurant put down the fork got
their camera stood up and followed me I
was like the Pied Piper they followed me
out on the beach you can see them here
they're coming out but they were
probably like 20 20 or so people and we
put the turtle down everyone's taking
pictures and you don't see he you don't
see a turtle very often Haiti but this
turtle slowly made its way into the
ocean and Emma was clapping here
and never is taking pictures and you
know there are many areas in the
Caribbean where turtle walks are held
and where people come to learn about
turtles and you think about the value of
this turtle versus live versus dead
Natalie and I wanted to take a sharpie
and write and write you know property of
Steve and Natalie do not touch or
something but we let this turtle swim
away and and and hopefully it's it's
still living a long productive life but
it just it taught me a really good
lesson of you know how people respond
and how you can have sustainable tourism
through you know tourism that you know
people can come on a regular basis and
enjoy nature and that's something that's
that is sustainable and can provide
livelihoods for these people so now I'm
going to talk more about the technology
that was my long one long story that I
wanted to share with you but you know
this was a study done by NASA by Woody
turner and NASA it's showing about all
the different technology that we have to
study nature we have citizen scientists
with your cell phone they're taking
pictures and geotagging uploading them
to two sites that can be mined we have
drones satellites we have collars that
we can we can track movements of animals
DNA is incredible science that's evolved
quickly over the last couple years
camera traps is another big thing these
are all these are all technologies that
can benefit science and I kind of
thought about the top five that have
really made a difference in conservation
so we have DNA analysis and databases
camera and acoustic traps being able to
catch illegal activities and transmit
them in real time mobile smartphone
technologies that can predict we're
getting satellite data
and getting it processed and have
real-time answers such as fires and
things like that virtual watch them this
is what's really been exciting is the
huge massive data sets Google Earth
engine is they has an enormous archive
of historical four years of satellite
data that can be mined very quickly I'm
like we we could do this when I was in
grad school but very exciting the things
that are going on with deforestation and
and actually with with global fishing
there's there's new exciting
technologies that are happening
satellite tracking is another I'm not
going to cover all these that mostly I'm
also want to focus on remote sensing and
that's that's basically detection of
features from a distance and being able
to extract information from those
features so these satellites basically
divide light into slices and because
it's divided we can look at spectral
curves of how reflective changes / /
light different light weights waves and
that's how we're able to map certain
features because they look differently
in a satellite and you can see here
here's an image showing certain bands
and you can really see through the water
column because these are shorter
wavelengths they travel through water
better and as you move up you're able to
detect different features in the visible
range you can see through the water
column but as you move into the infrared
that becomes more useful for terrestrial
studies and that energy is absorbed in
water so you can't see the reefs anymore
under the water so it's there's a lot of
information in there that we can use to
be able to map features especially in
the water column that's mainly what I
what I deal with is mapping what's under
water so things like radar there's so
there's passive remote sensing where
we're capturing light that's being
reflected off the earth and then there's
active remote sensing where you were
actually sending energy Dan and
recording how it bounces
like lidar and radar so in many areas of
the world we this is this is work I've
done and get long in central Africa
where clouds are always there it's
really hard to Matt because it's it's
tropical it's very humid you always got
clouds but with radar it goes right
through the clouds and and here's a
there's a map a radar map of galvan
we're mapping a lot of wetlands there
and if you zoom in you know the radar
interacts with the surface of the earth
earth differently depending on what
objects it interacts with you can see
palm oil plantations right up here there
they react differently we're able to map
we're doing a process right now we're
we're mapping a huge what's called a
Rams our site it's a wetland of global
importance and we're using radar to map
a lot of these different habitats and
it's never been mapped because this we
want to be able to manage for this area
you manage it unless we know what's
their radar can also be use to detect
boats now they're corner reflectors you
can send radar down and you can it can
really easily pinpoint boats and this
has been helpful for illegal fishing
lidar can be used which is laser being
sent from a plane to be able to
penetrate through vegetation this is
actually in kruger national park whether
they're mapping it's just a distribution
of termite mounds so those small mounds
that you see there are actually termite
mounds so we're able to map things that
we were not able to do before the
resolution of the satellites is becoming
very fine we're actually able to do
census on wildebeest you know before
these tests take a helicopter fly around
and try to count the wildebeest in
Africa now we can actually detect we'll
the bees from space and be able to count
count now this is an interesting use
we're in st. Vincent in the grenadines
we were working with the government to
map the different habits habitat text
there and st. Vincent the island of st.
Vincent on the northern end is a huge
volcano and it's very
remote there's not a lot of people that
was there and when we got the satellite
imagery this was about 10 years ago you
got the salad image we noticed on the
northern end of the island that there
are a lot of white dots we're thinking
what are all those white dots and this
is an example from the satellite imagery
and as soon as the Department of
Forestry they looked at it and go we
know what that is that those are ganja
farmers marijuana farmers that have gone
to this remote area and they cut a slice
of the slope off you know clear at the
milly plant marijuana and they grow
marijuana and we mapped over 300 of
these and the Department of Forestry
knew that they were there they had no
idea this kale so we're able to help
Matt you know what's going on and you
can actually see what it what it looks
like there we did actually did a hike
across the volcano and took a couple
pictures this is another interesting use
of satellite imagery this is an island
in Jamaica that is part of the Pedro
bank which is a huge 2,000 square
kilometer very shallow bank it's about
an eight hour boat ride mr. Fisher's
both out from Kingston and there's a
small there's three small keys there
where Fisher's lived and they live in
these shantytowns these these you know
metal sheet metal huts and they live
there for months at a time and then
hurricane come through this hole the all
these Keys just get washed over and
everything gets gets removed and then
just come back and I build again but
they live out here and they fish and
they fish in the Coast Guard boat comes
every every week but we were doing a
study to map the coral reefs in this
area because it's very remote and we
wanted we weren't working with the
Jamaican government to be able to
identify areas to protect and I got a
satellite image and what's interesting
is you'll notice there's a division on
this key we have half of the population
living on
half the island we have where people
live and half the island is where people
don't live right and there's actually
birds here but when they need to go to
the bathroom the fishers they go on the
far far side of the beach that that's
basically the bathroom at that's the
public toilet and when they clean their
fish they do it down here okay and now
what you're looking at is is the visible
this is this is the natural color that
we're looking at but when you when you
look at the infrared we know that plants
and algae they reflect infrared energy
and you know you'll notice that there is
vegetation in the water right and
there's vegetation with us where the
fishermen clean their fish and we were
able to detect from space the impacts of
this fishing community going the
bathroom on that end you can see that
there's actually an algal bloom that's
going on on the far side because of that
the red you see in the ocean that's
algae that's growing and floating on the
surface of water it's photosynthesizing
but you can see the the activities you
know from space it's pretty amazing so
this is typically what I do I this is my
my boat what's not my boat but it's it's
my office in this is in Haiti and you
know we have a solar panel panel set up
we try to understand what is under the
water and we document it and so I'll
take trips where all I'll go with my
team and we'll we'll map what's under
water and i use i'm going to show you
this this is an area in southern Haiti
not far from where we release that
turtle and we use an underwater camera
and our job is to identify what is that
a certain location what type of
underwater habitat exists there and we
can see that with this camera so we'll
go to certain locations well gps it will
drop the camera down will record this
information and we'll do hundreds of
point
today and this is an example of kind of
the work that we do and we we take this
information and we use it with the
satellite imagery to create information
products we create maps have never been
made before this is the symmetry that is
derived from satellite imagery where we
while we're going in that boat we're
taking depth measurements and and
because we know depth at certain areas
we can create a regression where you
know light will reflect at a certain
depth it will look this way the
reflection of light at 10 meters or at
50 meters it looks like this and because
of that pattern we can actually predict
depth and then we can also use that
information to predict what habitats are
there because we have catalogued with
all these underwater videos that we've
taken we can catalog where those are and
then we can train an algorithm to
predict what habitat it is across the
entire satellite image and so we can see
the distribution of seagrass of reefs
different types of reasons sometimes we
can even detect certain species of reefs
we're actually able to predict species
sea grass species this is an example of
a sea grass prediction model we we ran
in our being able to map the
distribution of this out spatially and
this information we run it through
models to identify the places to protect
we use a program called marks and which
answers that question helps answer that
question what if you're going to protect
X percent where is the best place to
protect and so these areas here we
identified as meeting the conservation
objectives for this marine protected
area and as a result Haiti created their
first marine protected area in this this
area we also use drones now sometimes in
the boat we can't get to the shallow
areas and so I was teaching a class at
BYU in it part of the class we we talked
about
drones and when I was talking about
drones they noticed that one of the
students in my class kept correcting me
no doctor shows like this this this is
really the story about job then
afterwards that pole missoni said man
you know a lot about girls and he he was
on the the cheer team and he hurt his
back and he was in he was in bed rest
for like four months and what did what
do you do when you're in bed rest for
months well you learn how to build
drones that's what he did he who was on
YouTube and he learned how to build
drones and i said if i get to a budget
can you I want to build a drone but we
can land on water because i want to get
over to some areas where I can't get the
boat and I want to find out what's there
and so within a month you know I gave
him the budget he had this built I took
him down to Haiti and we flew it around
and it's that I mean that's a low cost
I'm all into low-cost solutions we built
this on a budget of about fifteen
hundred dollars all the electronics
that's actually a Tupperware top you see
there but we can land this on the water
and it's it's got a gps pilot in it gps
auto chip that we can know exactly where
it goes and we can record what's there
we also use drones like this as the solo
3dr with a 20 megapixel camera that we
can fly and we're training governments
on how to use this technology you can
actually have a drone like this you know
for under a thousand dollars and be able
to map areas and be able to monitor them
monitor them consistently over time but
we're able to see because as the drone
flies over its taking pictures at
different intervals so if as its flying
over it gives it at this angle it gives
it at this angle and a visa to this
legal and it's able to actually create a
three-dimensional model based on stereo
pairs that it's taking so there you're
seeing the difference between the photo
taken from the drone and the actual
height so the red actually indicates
higher elevations and this is this is
really available we can apply this in
mapping reefs these are some of the
pictures
taken from the drone being able to
identify these rare species and map them
out we can also create information
products for governments this is in the
Cayman Islands where they were thinking
of removing a certain area of beach rock
and this was really interesting we flew
this at about 400 feet and you can
actually make out the the height of
beach umbrellas you can see those beach
umbrellas there and this is all with the
instruments that are that are a thousand
dollars in left and less so it's really
exciting to be able to train governments
and how to use this so they can be able
to monitor their own green space this is
an example of drawing a transect through
imagery create captured from a drone and
we're able to actually look at depth
underwater as we draw a transect up onto
the beach so very very powerful not only
for conservationists for engineers and
people interested in coastal dynamics we
actually took the same idea and we
recently developed this reef rover in
the Cayman Islands where we took the
pilot chip we put a camera kind of a
glass-bottom boat approach and we can
set up areas to map underwater and these
are some of the products that we're
getting it's the same principle to an
aerial drone but we're applying it to a
surface boat and as it's moving through
the water on top of the water following
a pre-programmed path it's taking
pictures every two meters that it moves
it takes a picture and then we're able
to reconstruct that using photogrammetry
software and be able to monitor changes
in time and this is something that has
been very difficult to capture in the
past this is some of the work we've done
with mangroves real quick this is the
last part capturing the health of
mangroves using the infrared to look at
biomass and areas of photosynthetic
tivity um in in gabon we use these
drones with my colleague we launched him
off the back of the boat to help map and
do ground truth over a large area of
wetlands that was previously
inaccessible you know in Gabon you don't
want to be doing a lot of fieldwork
because there's a lot of angry hippos
and you know the gala notorious gavel
and viper drones are a great way to
capture high-resolution information this
is some of our scientists witnesses work
we did last year where we were trying to
identify different habitats different
wetland types different habitats as we
create these maps and these are some of
the images from the drone we're able to
identify mangrove romaine Grove c4
antedated Savannah's flooded forest and
capture a lot of information in a short
amount of time and then we take all that
data we interpret it we create areas
that we know certain habitats exist and
then we can apply it over a large large
geographic space these are some examples
from that trail but the government's
using this to make decisions on how to
how to best manage that this is the
surface model of that same area where
you're able to actually see the height
of the vegetation and be able to use
that to as a baseline to to look for
change in the future so you know it this
is just a real exciting time to be a
conservationist because there's a lot of
lot of interesting tools out there is my
last slide this is in the in st. Vincent
this is the kind of this is the kind of
scene that gets me excited when I see
these rare corals that are actually
thriving in this environment and we're
identifying them studying them trying to
understand why they're doing well in
some areas and not soil in other areas
of the technology is is really helping
us create better ways to map them and to
be able to monitor them into the future
and
this is what we're hoping to pass on to
to the government's and and have them
continue the work of trying to protect
these habitats because they're really
important so thanks a lot there any
questions in the Midori all right you
guys have any questions yeah and then
the people who are actually doing the
conservation at first probably aren't as
aware of all the up-and-coming
technologies happening for example the
Silicon Valley what do you think would
be a good way to connect those two
worlds accenture what could be a yeah
well doing things like this it's all
about communication and getting at and
you know we have at the Nature
Conservancy we have a great group that
tries to stay on top of what's out there
and and i think you know i know that
there's when I was coming here to give
this talk I contacted our California
Chapter and we have a representative
that it manages all the relation all the
relationships with Google for example
and I think you know just just managing
that relationship and in communicating
and there's the Google Earth engine
that's that's the summit that's going to
happen I in June and Dave towel leads
that has been doing it for several years
and he gets a lot of conservation people
that come and and we just we just got to
continue to communicate and I've got to
recruit more
conservationists from the tech side to
count to come help me but that's that is
a constant challenge this drones in
particular changes so fast so the
technology out there got it just you
know continually read on what the latest
thing is to stay on top of it but what
I'm really interested in is I mean
there's big fancy Cadillac versions like
like the Caitlyn see viewer is a
basically a Google car a google street
view car for underwater i don't know if
you've seen those but there are some
areas that on google earth where you can
go and they actually see coral reefs
they have this really nice camera system
that scuba divers will visit you know
they'll float through the water column
and capture these pictures just like
people streets are and that's great but
that's hard to replicate widely and be
able to use it as a management tool in a
lot of places so I'm really interested
in what can we do for a thousand dollars
you know that can be replicated and can
capture really valuable information that
can be used for management
decision-making you know that that's why
I'm constantly you know looking at
what's out there to see if we can adapt
it like that riether over the Cayman
Islands we built that we got a grant and
we built that it was fifteen hundred
dollars to build that using parts that
we got off the internet and put together
and now the Cayman Islands is using it
to map areas of where we're a ship will
ground it to a reef and they want to map
the damage or they're interested in how
a storm has affected how briefs have
broken off in the energy of the storm
and they'll send it out there you know
so I'm really interested in trying to
use trying to develop complex of tools
it can be I can pass the capacity on to
our partners that can carry out the
monitoring because we can't do it all we
need we need tools at a replicable and
people can use easily
yeah so the long answer but that guy
turned yeah I guess it's kind of a vague
question so a lot of what you've
discussed is gathering and creating data
and opposed like mentally at least
wondering okay but then what like how
does that link to conservation you've
mentioned like decision making and
monitoring all that could you like
perhaps helped me to be more concrete
and like we got information how does
that turn into conservation yeah so so
like like grass great question like
these countries are hungry for
information right a lot of them they
don't they don't really know where their
reefs are the Fisher's know whether we
start but it's all in their head you
know they you can tell them anything and
a lot of the times we take our Maps let
me say is this accurate and making some
of some of them have a hard time
relating to a map because then I used to
it but you know we're trying to help the
government's make the decision they made
this commitment they need to protect
twenty percent of their marine space
what's the best twenty percent to
protect now understanding where your
resources are is very important so
creating those maps knowing the
distribution of those maps but not only
knowing where they are but knowing what
services they are providing so we run
this through models and we we identify
resource that are providing the most
benefits in terms of Fisheries in terms
of storm protection when waves come in
they're absorbing that energy and
they're protecting communities you know
where are where the tourists going and
we're actually mining the flickr
database these social photo sites where
people go out take pictures with your
smartphone and the upload them we're
mining those to understand and we run
them through algorithms to understand
you know which ones are underwater which
ones aren't to know the footprint of
tourism and where people go to enjoy
Reese so we're trying to create
information products they be able to run
it through models to be able to give to
the decision maker in the government
saying okay these are our
recommendations for where you need to
protect
it's such a great feeling when like in
Haiti we were able to take the outputs
of our model and that was signed into
law within six months they created
Katie's first marine protected area so
now we're working with them to get them
funding to be able to actually manage
because it's not managed not worth
having a park there so in working with
the fishery working with the communities
for the most part they really understand
that they need to do something because
they're on a trajectory that's not
sustainable there's not going to be any
fish left in the ocean if they continue
in certain paths or if their race
continued to die so for the most part
you know they know they know there's
will probably want to do something so
they're eager for help their gear for
ways to adjust and figure out how to be
more sustainable so we're these
information products are helping them
what's that any questions all right yeah
all right hi hello so I am interested in
nature and I and I do have like I do
have a giant background cycle here is
like I mean we we actually work on
google maps and there's engine so I'm i
guess i'm curious i calm how can we give
back to the community in terms of like
what kind of like volunteer
opportunities are there that we can do
on the side to like you know during our
downtime that may help in terms of like
mapping processing and things like that
you know which i guess which areas oh
which websites or whatever would be yeah
yeah there's there's a lot of there's a
lot of crowdsourcing things out there
and a lot of them are mostly for like
natural disasters and things like that
but I would love to see a platform that
was specifically set up maybe and maybe
it's out there I just don't know about
it where where communities can go on and
you know Matt certain things I mean
because sometimes it's pretty easy to
detect certain features that are
important like in nature are in the
nature conservancy we map the habitats a
map you know what
protected areas are we didn't know where
those are and then we map the threats to
the habitat so mapping the human
footprint is really important I've
actually employed a lot of students who
have done a lot of work mapping roads
and buildings and actually finding areas
where where people are going into rivers
where there illegally fishing with in a
park and using information in giving
that to the Rangers so they can do more
effective patrols so I think
crowdsourcing you know apps are a real
great way to help that I just don't know
if those are out there but maybe that's
something that we can we can work with
our tech organizations like Google to
figure out how to do that but you know
other than you know sure the Nature
Conservancy has has city events and
activities and I'm not really involved
with what the activities here in
California but i know in each chapter in
every state me of activities where they
have beach cleanups and things like that
but yeah I that's something that that
I'd like to pursue more and get get more
opportunities for people want to
contribute to so if you hear about
anything let me know sounds like Earth
engine is a good tool to keep workin on
there I'm hoping to come in June to a
Google Earth engine I don't know what
your percentage of people that are doing
it for conservation that's mainly geared
toward NGOs seems like yeah all right
pick your own thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
