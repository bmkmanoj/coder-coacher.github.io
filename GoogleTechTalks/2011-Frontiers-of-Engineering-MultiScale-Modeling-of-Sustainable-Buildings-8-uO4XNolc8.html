dr. Yellen s rubric and she's from Penn
State and is going to talk to us about
modeling multiscale modeling ok thank
you any so it was really great
introduction into my talk from any John
John and John and my name is not John so
but it starts with J so we rhymed
everything together very interesting
discussions buildings are really a big
challenge so we started from a problem
and then we are introducing tools that
we are trying to deploy to solve these
problems and the problem is really huge
I would just scratch a little bit
surface of a multiscale modeling there
are other approaches i am talking about
one part of one type of multiscale
modeling in this particular presentation
and also will discuss some potentials
and results how many of you have because
i have heard there were questions about
the collaboration between architects and
engineers how many of you have heard
something that is called department of
architectural engineering those two
words smashed together hands okay not
bad maybe 10 people in the room out of
hundred the program exists already 400
years so it's not a new discipline and
it suffered for on all good things that
multidisciplinary programs do suffer
discussions between generalization
specialization going too deep too broad
and all of those beautiful things that
buildings are plagued with when we start
executing this design process in
operation so this is just a different
perspective slightly more general and
there are numbers are not here you have
seen them buildings are enormous energy
consumers but also they are affecting
our environment and all so for now our
population is increasing and also
rapidly increasing its presentation in
urban settlements and sustainable
technologies in build environment could
be an end
I never say it's the answer there are
many different answers to the question
and we need actually much more creative
approaches than what we are doing right
now so that's why I'm here today and
hope to engage some of you and motivate
some of you to participate in our
research area because we need much more
people than what we have an interesting
concept and why this area of research is
so complex it is really that our other
environment is connected to indoor
environment and its really connected
directly to you as a human being you as
a human being in this space field may be
comfortable may be uncomfortable but you
should also know that your health can be
affected just by sitting and breathing
in the same buildings here after year
after year after year and we can talk
about that a little bit later Mon but
this multi scale prayer presents our
existence of this problem is now
becoming obvious not just because we're
talking about it but also because we are
stealing our tombar signature in that
co2 emissions and it's not really that
our carbon footprint became obvious from
industrialization air if we read the web
it my all the research on co2 we can
find that we are we ever since we
started doing agriculture we were
producing that co2 that was visible in
atmosphere so we just right now having a
press unprecedented scale at which we
are affecting the Earth atmospheric
processes and that's good and bad I
think I personally think it's exciting
because for the first time we realized
the power of our our systems we did have
this population migration from ruler to
urban and if you talk to urban planners
there are many different reasons why we
did migrate and they're not just to
group people into conducting
manufacturing processes there are also
other systems that are serving human
population that is organized like that
so for example your food services your
sewage your energy that you are using
are also grouped into this organization
called urban settlements you also have a
lab
more other of other interesting services
that are grouped such as education or
health services so that those are other
reasons why we grew up in these kind of
settlements and also there are a little
bit more interesting other aspects that
are related to our creativity and
playfulness such as art and other type
of collaborations that we engage as a
human being so being so in principle
this trend seems to be relentless and we
will organize ourselves in different
type of forms and shapes right now we
have something that is a historic
overlay of a previous era but we are
really starting to develop much more
interesting solutions so we've heard
this discussion about potential for
having the human human grouping
themselves into settlements that look
like trees I personally don't know if
that's possible not possible but what I
would tell somebody especially young
students who are very excited I would
say go and explore it why not maybe it's
possible maybe I'm just too old and too
settled in my way of thinking I just
don't see the possibility but you can if
you believe in something you can do it
and we only just need to invent new
materials and new other couple of things
and we're dunham and usually young
people really love it they love the
challenge they don't realize how hard it
is and if you let them run and support
them many of them actually come with
unbelievable outcomes so I've been
nothing but astonished and surprised at
creativity of our young students and
findings that they come up with out of
this kind of challenging questions so
whether we are similar to school of
fishes trees birds on trees or maybe an
ant colony it's still to be discovered
and maybe it's a combination of all of
these solutions parts together in some
useful form so we do understand the
buildings are extremely important so
this demand in energy is only two remain
strong even if we improve the corner of
our energy efficiency significantly as
our population is growing our own needs
are going to increase they had different
design paradigms in this building
industry and I'm just covering the past
30 40 years roughly so since the 1970s
there was that first energy crisis when
we started really worrying about what to
do with the buildings and then we
wondered whether we just recirculate all
of the air and then we want the robot
whether you are comfortable we started
seeing that by sealing buildings making
them energy-efficient and making them
comfortable for you also can result in
some health and sometimes adverse health
outcomes for you as a part of a
population we had a reasonable and
important security issues we are
currently talking about sustainable
technologies and trying to define what
sustainable technologies are it's a big
question that we can also spend another
30 minutes to talk about but future
trends are really in looking into
opportunities to explore this more
dynamic approach to buildings looking
into whether looking at the predictive
modeling understanding how we affect
climate change and in feedback loop our
help gets affected with our different
solutions so when we talk about
sustainable buildings digits are my two
favorite sustainable buildings right we
have a ski resort in Dubai and eat a
project which is basically tropical
paradise in southern UK and they are all
about using a lot of energy but i tend
to consider them to be sustainable
buildings not because they are really
sustainable but because assisting in
terms of the energy consumption but
sustainability can be also seen as a
broader concept of how we are going to
preserve our ecosystems so that our
biology contrived and we might be living
in a planet soon or sooner or later that
is not that user friendly to our biology
and discovering how to portably take and
efficiently take our our ecosystems will
be extremely
it so these are sustainable buildings
probably in the future at the present
day what we can do in this business we
can look at you personally indoors and
the no bias there we have a lady on a
computer in her office working and
having her office environment to be
comfortable for her we have energy
simulation software at present that can
provide you how building goes throughout
the day in terms of the energy demand
and there are some issues with accuracy
better lower but we are improving that
stuff you can also use computational
fluid dynamics cfd varna now beautiful
fluid mechanics developments and we can
actually find the interaction between
these two simulation tools and we can go
into more details to know what really
goes around you as a person and we can
couple this software in a loop and with
a different fully dynamic coupled
approach we can find hour by hour what's
happening in this space that's a very
powerful knowledge that can be
transferred to building designers and it
is transferred so a lot of these
developments are right now used for
different type of troubleshooting of
problems in our designs here is just an
example I'm just giving examples to know
or to understand what's possible we
looked at the two different systems
something that was called displacement
ventilation similar to an open window
little breeze coming your way and you
can have a thermostat to control the
temperature you can have occupants you
see engineers look look at the occupants
as cubes my colleagues architects always
get annoyed by this but we get some
useful data for them and here is a
little animation what happens throughout
the day for center of this room or any
other kind of room that particular room
that we had a set up we can do that for
this room no doubt about it and we can
find them here is a temperature
distribution blue is from 20s or 20
degrees Celsius or 70 Fahrenheit and
you're 27 is red which is close to the
ceiling I was not worried about the
temperature isn't ceiling because
nobody's yet there in this particular
setup and we can see how
the temperature changes throughout today
and I can decide which system will work
better for me in this particular space
built as a building owner and we can
look also here there are some standards
that approximate how human occupants
perceive that space and we can see that
this place manipulation versus this
other displacement of chill sealing a
ventilation had a different temperature
stratification from your ankle to your
head and we can find that this
particular limit here at three that was
set by this standard was exceeded for
this combined displacement installation
and joe ceiling in the afternoon so i
knew that you would be uncomfortable
there i don't need you to complain to me
i can actually predict this in a design
phase and we can also look at what
happened with the co2 levels and vo sea
levels these are vertical certifications
for us for volatile organic compounds in
co2 in I picked 8am and 4pm for circles
and triangles and I can actually really
know what these distributions would look
like so sorry and you can see that
actually in the afternoon my
concentration levels for both co2 and
VOCs were lower anybody has an idea why
that would be the case and typical
source of BOC or volatile organic
compounds would be this lovely carpet
that we have here so that ventilation
that is diluting co2 and they're loading
those VOCs had resulted in a lower
concentration anybody has a guess
actually it was afternoon so solar
radiation was higher to the windows they
did not have a shades so the ventilation
rates were higher and therefore dilution
was better so for me that was great but
from the energy perspective that was
horrible because i was using much more
energy to ventilate that space and
therefore there is a real interesting
optimization process where the air
quality requirements and mains are in
collision with my energy demands and
everybody is now trying to think how can
we do this optimization without really
affecting adversely your biology so just
saving energy is not good enough
these are some historic data collection
concepts that we had you can see
instrumentation in offices and some
homely Direction air velocity and
temperature probes and some gas
analyzers and then we have this little
package instrumentation here so we need
better instrumentation so any of you
working on instrumentation if you want
to create portable small wireless
instruments that are extremely cheap I'm
thinking five dollars 250 and their
commercial all of the parameters that I
need I why not be ambitious you five
dollars is not that much that we can
distribute around the building we need
it we badly need it if you want to
develop new models we need them so in we
need the measured data and here is an
example how well we can predict in their
environment with them with the current
simulation tools we already define what
the critical simulation parameters in
terms of the boundary conditions such as
diffuser air flow you can see at the
bottom I spent quite a lot of time on
these little guys called diffusers
because there was a difficulty in
deciding how to accurately simulate
those and because all of the airflow in
this room is from those diffusers and if
you don't simulate them properly you are
not going to simulate any other
transport process appropriately not heat
not particles not concentration so very
important problem that was resolved and
now all of these bottles are actually
part of all of the fancy see of these
other packages that you buy and they
have specialized package for CMV so
that's what we have done that by
developing new knowledge and letting the
industry adopt and enjoy some of this
knowledge and using this knowledge best
way they see and these lines that you
can see here was a subfloor plane and
vertical lines the line here is a
simulated data and dots are measured
data for a temperature distribution
incredible precision considering how
complex this airflow feel here and for
those who are having some background in
fluid mechanics these are transitional
flows at 10 to power 5 reynolds numbers
extremely hard to simulate properly if
you go to
some transient changes in such
environment like this space I'm just
giving you some feeling you can predict
here is a 24 points of the measured data
in that room that I have shown you
previously and vertical axis is
temperature so I was able to correctly
predict the temperature within half of
degree degree in that room at very
different locations also we distributed
different tracer gas and compare the
concentration in experiments which are
this pink line versus online which was
orange line which where our simulation
so agreement is really nice so we can do
a lot of stuff for indoor environments
and this technology is now deployed to
do cutting-edge research on data center
cooling systems optimization Hospital
ventilations some atria and other
interesting architectural solution for
buildings I have to mention that we have
found that beautiful buildings even
though the engineers are not very much
married to aesthetics are actually
really important for occupants because
we have found that occupants who find
their buildings aesthetically pleasing
engage in mud better maintenance and
operation of the buildings so they
become more energy efficient as a result
of that emotional connection to the
building so this building story building
research story is actually deeply human
so we cannot forget about the human
factor either biology or psychology or
behavioral science when we are trying to
engineer our systems these are just some
applications there are many more so when
we got this really wonderful Chris Pike
will be talking about that LEED
certification process that can tell you
how well your building is doing or not
doing and there are many criticisms
about the system being not the
quantitative enough or this or that I
really find it to be great very
educational and very informative we
compared this EPA collected base study
based study here and you can see those
were 100 offices randomly selected all
cross United States
and occupants were asked how they felt
about certain aspects of their
environment and then we did the same
study in a building that was nearby our
home institution and was lead certified
energy-efficient a really nice
ventilation system and we checked how
occupants were doing compared to the
average u.s. building and we have felt
found that occupants felt really good
about their building in principle if you
ask them whether the air was dry too
little air cold hot other too much
movement humid small chemical others are
building performed in all aspect better
than the average US office except in
this concept of being too dry and if you
are ever interested I can tell you what
we have found about that our occupants
were right that something was wrong but
they were wrong about what was wrong but
look at the diagram here this is very
interesting diagram cumulative density
function of symptoms per person when we
are again the list of items that we were
looking at included really health
outcomes so there was a respiratory
health cardiovascular health and much
more detailed questions that I don't
need to go into right now but we have
found that the cumulative density
function for that particular building
versus the building's hundred average
buildings were actually the same so
occupants were not really doing better
they were just feeling better in that
particular building it's just one case
study I don't draw any conclusions we
are right now on our mission to do our
hundred leed-certified buildings and do
the comparison and produce scientific
results this was just a little pilot
study to tease out the information
whether it was worth while pursuing so
what we're doing right now we are
integrating our knowledge you see I
personally worked on this scale a lot I
know how to deal with the energy
consumption and your comfort and
perceptions in indoor spaces I have
colleagues this is a very nice project
funded by NSF under that every project
my colleague Jones I has a piece a
really great project as well
so all of those projects are all going
to make a real contribution in this area
and we have found that we could really
or this is our ambition and use some of
the Google tools and if you guys are
interested in talking to us please do so
and an existing data censoring network
that my colleague Matthew Welsh who now
works for Google created we have our own
simulation tool on Sorel solar
irradiance I have a little bit of
simulation here that I will show you on
computational fluid dynamics outdoor air
flow we can then send the information to
indoor spaces and kira's are also very
neat part my colleagues from public
health school of public health at
Harvard are helping us to collect some
really more detailed data about you as
occupants in your health and we are
still banging our heads against the wall
on how to specifically to do this and
make some recommendations that can be
useful to architects engineers
policymakers and other stakeholders in
this business on how to how to design or
how to use at least these tools and
design different urban settlements here
is an example of our particular campus
and we did a lot of things with this
model we simulated it we put it in a
wind tunnel we measured there are all
over the campus we dragged our little
sensors networks and i usually get phone
calls from office or physical plant
asking me what are you doing now we tell
them we are doing research so we just
hang some data collection systems of
lamp posts that was the best holder that
we could come up with without
jeopardising being rejected to
distribute our sensor network and we
have a models again that we put these
are just the four building models of
this particular dormitory we have a
larger models we look into producing new
turbulence models for this kind of
simulation so they can be quick you
don't want to be waiting for hours and
hours at a time to get some useful
information about the airflow and this
again for those who are in fluid
mechanics this is an interesting model
we can discuss about it
and ours on em but it's very simple what
you can see and we have found that the
model predicted a really nice
distribution of contaminants behind the
building with this was an experiment
collected by other research groups we
use a standard method versus our model
and we can find that the distribution of
contaminant concentrations in the wake
of this building and it's very important
problem in this particular field we have
found that our model predicts it very
nicely and we are order of magnitude
faster in terms of a simulation time
required for this application so you can
see this is again some anonymous campus
like Google campus and we at that time
did not have a distributed sensor
network we just run the simulation for a
sake of running it and i have found very
interesting that I in this particular
case at that time just being desperately
out of money for instrumentation I
actually went around and asked human
occupants of these campus and ask them
was there any area of a campus where
they felt high wind velocities in winter
summer and so on and we have found that
actually at that time the model was
really correctly predicting the high
wind velocities and I don't need to use
the names of the buildings but they are
here and here and it was a very nice win
channeling that later we used in other
student project to propose use of wind
turbines in those sections of the campus
so in principle from this particular
outdoor air flow studies we have found
that the different urban densities
result in different local temperatures
that's not the brainer but we are
producing correlations that will tell
you what your how correlated your urban
density is to the convective heat
transfer and basically local
temperatures for your incoming point
there is a very interesting story of
Houston these days that cannot get
cooled free the Galveston Bay Breeze
because the urban density is so high
that the breeze cannot really enter the
city and cool down the city so Houston
is about to see higher and higher
temperatures progressively we are trying
to avoid this in other cities so we are
looking into that those correlations
that's the main motivation so also are
cooling equipment
and I was looking what would be the rape
I can give you some numbers i did some
back-of-the-envelope calculations how
many degrees your city would get up
warmer and how much your cooling
equipment will become less efficient let
me not disclose those right now but in
principle there is a significant effect
that is worthwhile doing research in
details and we are doing that right now
and again different cities in the united
states have different urban densities
and we are enough resistance dividing
them in something that was developed as
a concept by my colleagues from
geography in urban terrain zones and we
will be able to tell you hopefully four
years down the road how different urban
terrains affect your maybe local energy
bills your local health your local
different things but all this is what
all of this kind of multiscale modeling
can provide to you so in my last eight
seconds I would say we need everything
you can think of all of the engineers in
this building right now can actually
start working on this problem and 100
years from now we will probably have
some interesting solutions so we need
censoring networks predictive models
enclosure materials efficient power
distribution power generation hybrid
cooling equipment to improve our
footprint energy from spring and air
quality in buildings people can think of
other things how do we organize as a
communities so social engineering
science policy you name it buildings are
there for you to tackle them and as a
conclusion we are all connected in this
unifying theme and can make a
contribution to this research area thank
you
come on stock MIT very interesting
presentation I was a bit surprised and
on may be daunting a couple of things
that you mentioned one of them was
detailed in the fluid mechanics when you
mentioned that modeling the details of
airflow inputs is it is important to
predicting overall properties that the
consequence of that would be that we
need to model every single detail in
this room in order to get it white that
would be extremely daunting in terms of
large buildings the second point was
done when you mentioned ski slopes in
Abu Dhabi and you call those sustainable
initially I thought it was a joke
actually it's half a joke at either okay
I would say that the so it was it was a
joke ah no good like it wasn't a joke
I'm curious about your question you well
I you propose a very relative a peculiar
definition of sustainable as something
that can be used for a particular
purpose in the future for example as an
experiment to design I guess landing on
different planets or living on different
islands fixed wouldn't it be the case
that if we propose such a definition of
sustainable a that is dangerous not only
the public opinion and so on but be
there might be better ways of coming up
with experiments to come up with ways
and landing on different planets we
don't maybe need to have ski slope in
Abu Dhabi yeah I won't go to Mars
without a ski resort no that's what that
was not my proposal I just like this
open minded open-ended questions because
I do agree deeply with you as an
engineer that I would like to have very
energy efficient very premeditated very
organized landings on Mars and
settlements that's my motivation but I
do also understand through my exposure
to other fields and other people that
some of them would find that gross and
if they have enough resources they will
build and they probably would build a
ski resort and it's not my business of
judging whether that's right or wrong
that was my position it's humans we have
played
other than just being practical that's
that was the only message i had in there
with respect to modeling I can say
you're absolutely right it would be
really a daunting task in terms of not
just the simulation but in putting all
of these neat nice details that you have
here so with respect to diffusers and
the details in indoor spaces we spent I
would ask me to five years different
research groups looking at different
things and we have found what's
reasonable to put in and what's
unreasonable to put in and that the
things can be represented for example
diffusers with their appropriate
momentum and mass flow and the question
is just how do you come up with the data
for from manufacturer catalogues and we
have found that as well so a design
community can really follow the process
you're welcome here hi Audrey Ellerbe
from Stanford University it was really
intrigued by your comment about the bay
the emotional attachment that humans
have two buildings and how that can
affect just our care of the building and
ultimately sort of the sustainability
and energy issues so it was mentioned
earlier that there are behavioral
modifications that could help to
alleviate some of the energy concerns
that we have I was wondering has anyone
looked at how things like dress codes in
certain businesses could affect energy
usage so when I'm at home I can moderate
how much energy i'm using by changing my
clothing right from so in some way I can
take responsibility for that has anyone
looked at how different companies who
promote more casual dress codes might
have different energy uses than
buildings that require formal attire
that's a phenomenal question I have not
I'm not aware of any study like that and
that's probably why the reason we have
this conversation but I can tell you
there is a quantifiable thing to be
measured there absolutely yes your
comfort will be affected with your
clothing level just to add to that Japan
adopted a policy where people could
dress down so that they could decrease
the air conditioner load in their
buildings so as to decrease electrical
demand
sounds very reasonable and there are
another aspect of that adaptation and I
know they are doing it at different
universities actually always students
are great population to do experiments
with because they're open-minded you can
gradually increase the temperature and
see when the people start really badly
complaining about that particular
building so that you learn something
about your population there are some
general thermal comfort diagrams that
are developed for some generic
population but you can learn about your
population and I do believe if we do
this thing right you will have a really
strong interaction between the human
population in the building building can
become itself a little bit more alive
and there are really strong reason why
did not is the case right now and again
we can talk for another hour about that
yeah so this is angela from purdue so
i'm very interesting your multiscale
modeling so in this CFD simulation you
have small scales that are coexist with
larger scales now in the simulation I
expect certain space discretization is
needed so often we in our area cut week
I dimension then see this the difference
they could be all the summer magnitude
difference for example even beyond
machine precision so for example if you
are doing double precision computing
animals you can capture 16 digits of
difference then these skills could be
beyond 16 others among to difference
there I'm wondering how you handle that
we're not handling that in such a direct
way it's impossible and I believe right
now it's unnecessary because we don't
understand the processes really well so
what we are trying to do is to see what
are the drivers from the smaller scale
so can be classified into I'm just now
telling you something that we are doing
and we have no solution to that question
but we are looking into types of spaces
types of buildings and looking what is
the range of for their performance with
its more detailed small-scale
simulations and then picking up that in
formation to see what out of all of
these cares really comes as the most
important things that are affecting the
properties at the lighter scale an
example would be so many spaces of this
kind how each of the space really
affects this building so if you have
laboratories it overtakes the rest of
your building so I don't need really to
spend too much time on everything else
if I can understand your laboratories I
can tell you how to improve energy
efficiency of your building and same
thing for a larger scale on your campus
you can find actually on a campus we are
now classifying buildings based on their
energy consumption and we classify them
based on whether the building response
to your weather data or does not respond
to your video data at home and
everything in between and we are finding
why why is that happening so those are
just examples how we are looking for a
driver's from a smaller scale that
create emerging property on your larger
scale and that's all we can do for now
okay so it's not like a cool simulating
these toasty and no not yet I see okay
thanks with Whitney Clara Pacific
Northwest National Labs maybe you've
already looked at this but I'd be really
curious to combine your models with
models of distributed generators to look
at the effect the net effect on air
pollution emissions inside buildings
because there could be and that decrease
in fuel consumption or not decrease in
carbon dioxide emissions but maybe
there's an a net increase in air
pollution Russians inside the buildings
please come forward I just don't want to
monopolize the time I would just say
what we are trying to do on that www
building signs that psu.edu we're trying
to actually post as much of the code as
much of the information that we have as
we are producing it and enabling
different collaborations are you working
just independently of us that would be
really wonderful my biggest problem
right now is the interface because if we
just dump things we will cause more
problem than
then good and if you are understanding
the code we can give you the code no
problems but there is this google kind
of question that you guys know better
than us how to do how to interface with
the public so that we can or public in
terms of the research community to speed
up the development there are many
interesting questions here Tim Denison
from medtronic I was just curious you're
talking about the distributed sensor
system and i was wondering instead of
trying to put in that infrastructure
like take advantage of me carrying this
around is there work going on we're like
i could put in 200 pounds my preferences
for temperature and humidity and you
know how tolerant of an individual i am
and then so hundred people stream into
this room you get an estimate of the
Watts that we're going to put out and
then kind of take what's the ideal set
point for this room you know is there
any advantage that's being taken with
mobile devices today I actually oh we
are going to collect data from your
mobile devices again these are because
we came to the frontiers we are trying
to figure out what to do we can really
collect the data and we are right now
collecting them from compute your
personal computers because it's a
college campus so everybody has a
computer everybody has also PDA device
but we still did not do that part yes we
can collect and should collect the data
but the next question is how do I use it
and if hundreds of you provide me a
feedback do I use an average number do I
group you in the cold people and warm
people actually if I have 30 seconds
more I don't know if we are at the end
how many of you feel in this space I
will ask you three questions so-called
neutral and hot usually the scale is
longer there are five things so call so
if you're on the college side to really
cold neutral to really hot so make up
your mind you see now we are starting to
discuss this you know okay so how many
of you would feel cold in this space
okay we
have roughly thirty percent how many of
you feel neutral ok this is fifty
percent I'm just counting roughly and
how many of you feel too warm roughly
twenty percent so we had twenty percent
of too hot fifty percent neutral which
is great actually and thirty percent on
a cold each side that really usually
surprises people if if you are in one of
these categories you don't even realize
that there are people around of you
feeling completely different from you
and it's a very interesting controls
problem again with my ID I'm don't do
that by my colleague who is part of the
project is doing that how do we really
decide on what to do with this pace now
this is in the area of a creek creative
solution is hi Kathy Bates from Eastman
Kodak very interesting talk you spent a
lot of time talking about temperature
and air quality which are very important
to me in my office another thing that's
important to me is um light quality and
I can see a situation where that could
also be in tension with the energy
consumption of a building so I was
wondering if you or any of your
colleagues have looked at that if you've
done any experiments on students with
that it might be little circle to do
that but i'd be curious on that I mean I
can learn with advertisers work by my
collaborator or there are other people
in this particular project you see this
section this little square to it
represent an entire research group that
are looking at the first of all your
solar input on the enclosure the shading
my colleagues the name is Christopher
Reinhart and shading building to
building so urban density not only
affects the wind but also what in terms
of the solar input your building is
getting so two of us are talking to each
other in our different languages of
software's to see how do we make a
better decision that is not just based
on wind but also on solar or solar and
wind and yes then internally you have a
smaller scale process on visual comfort
and he just finished the survey on
adaptive visual comfort I know that he
developed a new concept so yes visual
comfort is part
it and that particular building that I
gave an example had the very low
lighting levels because everything was
deemed to save energy and that was one
thing that they modified after our study
immediately was they increased the
lighting level because the the response
was just overwhelming nobody wanted to
be in that our building sits Orion are
on Corrado State University she talked
about multiscale modeling and then
you're talking about energy management I
would like to hear your opinion about
how you handle the how you
computationally handle the different
time constants in this modeling the
electrical system has a very short time
constant thermal as long time constants
so anybody who worked on a cooling of
data centers can really appreciate the
difference in how our mechanical systems
in terms of I'm just thinking about the
we calculated time constants for that
problem and some so you are talking
about seconds and sometimes I think in
milliseconds in your computational
efforts and we are talking about minutes
and hours the original resolution
because the mechanical equipment is
thermally inert so what we can do is we
can allow bit predict how your building
will be occupied and try to jumpstart
mechanical systems and the reason why
those systems are slow again the way we
we do the generation of cooling capacity
and rejection the whole process is
roughly 100 150 years old we are right
now starting to see some innovations but
what you are using in standard buildings
is a pretty inert very old system we
change the refrigerants a little bit and
some aspects of the of the cooling
system but or heating systems but it's
pretty old technology we don't have a
better ways of generating cooling and
heating capacity yet or faster ways you
can use electricity for example for
heating but that's outrageously
expensive yes
all computationally computationally
again we did the little trick on
emerging properties so my colleagues
provided for the data calling center
they provided for me the typical typical
loads and then we started working from
the typical load so for merging property
of your system loads to our largest
scale simulations that's all we can do
of course the question is not yet
resolved at those skills absolutely it's
a phenomenal research question and again
I brought this more as a question rather
than me having am all of the answers I
can share my experiences well thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
