start let me say that for me it's 1am
because i had i come from Paris and if I
feel asleep don't hesitate to to wake me
up just took the plane this morning okay
let's start so as John said I'm working
on Graham the groovy project manager and
spect lead of jsr 241 which is the the
jsr which is a standardizing the groovy
language um eyeballs
we've got Ruby see I it can also be
interpreted at current time for instance
if you want to store some business rule
or something like that you can load and
compile on the fly groovy script and if
there were there was an equation you
should try to remember at the end of
this talk is that ruby is the result of
an addition of three things it's an
expressive language with the java like
syntax with new features derived from
java and it has got some powerful
libraries and it is it has got some meta
programming facilities and willem it's
what makes groovy a dynamic language so
speaking of the syntax before showing an
example first of all as it is Java like
the learning curve is rather flat
compared to all the languages which are
totally different we share the same
object oriented model and libraries as
java so we don't have to learn new
libraries so there's no impedance
mismatch same object model almost the
same syntax can reuse everything you
already know all the libraries you've
written already and it adds a few
additional syntax sugar like properties
supports you can use strong and weak
typing it's up to you and we've got
things like native syntax for lists Maps
regular expressions and you can do
operator overloading we've got g strings
but suddenly the sexiest feature of the
language i'm not going to show you mine
but well i'll show you some sample
code you know it's interpolated strings
where there are placeholders and you can
replace parts of the string with
variables from the contexts and we've
got closures those reusable or
assignable code blocks that you can see
in other languages like Ruby or small
talk so let's see first example so it's
a small script with a class so here we
see a speaker class so it's a groovy
beam it looks like a javabean but you
see two properties name and age you
don't see getters and setters because
they are auto-generated for you and it
can be not the next thing here you can
see g string so when you call to string
we're going to replace door name on
dollar age with the the value of the
properties you also see that I've
omitted the region keyword it's not
mandatory if it's the last expression of
your method body and so either a
property is strongly tight or it can be
weakly typed so you use the DEF keyword
and here you can see the native syntax
for list so it's just square brackets
and comma separated list of things and
there's also syntax for maps as well
here I'm creating a new speaker and
although there is no constructor like
that its trick added by groovy in fact
they are calling the default constructor
and then we are calling the set name and
set age setters automatically so what
you see between parent s is a map
literal so there's the name key Mikey
mouse value hte80 value
what else color the upper variable is a
closure a Carrera is just a block of
code separated with curly braces there's
an implicit parameters called it so it's
the sole parameter opposite of
disclosure sorry I'm going to retrieve
the string representation of the
argument and i'm going to uppercase it
there's the regular expression syntax
and the mature operator and it's another
closure that is passed to the final
method find out with the method that is
added to collections so you can find all
the items in this collection that map
that correspond to the criteria matching
the name and you can pass named closure
has method arguments as well and you can
inline the closure that you pass to her
method each is going to iterate over all
the elements that we've found I think
that's all for this first sample of
glory code so looks like Java but I've
already shown you a few of the tricks
few of the sugar added by groovy like
native syntax for lists Maps regular
expressions and closures and properties
okay so there are three main use cases
for using groovy you can use it just
like a shell scripting language like you
would use bash or Python or Ruby so you
can test stuff interactively in a
console you can even well ever eaten a
little module which is a quite fun where
you are driving office applications from
groovy you can launch word launch Excel
PowerPoint and so on
so a second use case is well you can
build standalone standalone applications
you just want a full application in
group so it's nice or a small to
mid-sized applications usually when
application applications get bigger
you're tend to prefer slightly
statically typed language but it's nice
for its proper prototyping capabilities
and the third use case which is to my
opinion the most interesting one is when
you integrate groovy in your application
your Java energy in a j ee application
there are buying sways for integrating
root into your into your application
through GSR 223 which is a which are the
scripting API added to jdk six we've got
our own proprietary means of integration
and you can integrate groovy beans as
normal spring beans in your spring
application you can use you can use
groovy to avoid using too much XML by
using some programmatic configuration
what else you can externalize some
business rules in the form of movie
scripts and you can also write
domain-specific languages I'll save few
words about that later just to tell you
that it's a serious project it's already
used in production and it's been used in
production for over two years already
for instance there's mutual of omaha
which is an insurance company fortune
500 in the u.s. we've been using groovy
to write the risk computation algorithms
for the insurance policies and they've
got like fifty thousand lines of groovy
code in their mission critical
application half being pure business
code and half being test code so it's
one of the biggest applications
using grooving the order it's funny
because a lot of financial and stickers
institutions are using groovy for
externalizing business rules and one of
the key feature that's made them choose
groovy is that when you use arithmetics
when you are adding decimals together
we're using big decimals so we've got
exact arithmetic and it's nice for
actuaries business domain experts were
like handling real operations it's funny
well there are many other use cases like
you know the French Ministry of Justice
which used groovy just for as a
developer tool for creating using our
own template engine for creating struts
views struts config files and so on from
a uml model oh Rocco is using groovy in
its oc4j container for manipulating
gemacht beans as as if they were local
beans and many other frameworks are
using groovy like spraying the right
framework the service makes jbi
container and can web test well and I
vomited many others so I've only shown
you a little example of code but there
are many features many syntax sugar that
I haven't explained so far for things
like manipulating JDBC api's our own
template engine i mentioned joe mix
beans regular expressions and swing you
eyes i'm going to show you a demo with a
swing UI and there are external modules
for dealing with soap web services or
xml RPC services with a few lines of
code there's even a small project
building a rule than giant engine sorry
jsr 4999 compliant from this energy but
now I'm going to speak about another
topic domain-specific languages it's
interesting because groovy allows you to
write domain-specific languages let me
show you that so first of all a DSL so
what's a dsl dsl so small language which
does need to be turing-complete which
covers a particular domain of knowledge
of expertise our cover's particular set
of tasks can other different forms
textual form graphical for and you read
produces some result configure objects
or trade data structures and it can be
embedded in the host language two kinds
of dsl external and internal dsl's and
groovy is the tool you can use to write
in turn all the SL so that you can write
dsl inside groovy programs or inside
java programs so usually you want to
create dsl's to have a more expressive
language to model the domain of
expertise you want to model to share a
common metaphor between developers and
the domain experts and if you want to
have domain experts help with the design
of the business code it's very handy for
instance when i was mentioning a mutual
of omaha both domain experts and
developers are able to write those
insurance risk calculation stuff
together so let's go a bit further some
examples of dsl SQL or HTML RDS health
or even regular expressions a kind of
DSL there are notations like e BNF for
modeling
widget syntax or the chest notation the
music notation and you can like business
dsl's like a life insurance policy I
mentioned and other things as well so
why do I speak about dsl's because grube
is dynamic language it's got a malleable
syntax but it can customize to your
needs to create your own derived
language so you can write things you can
do like create nested tree structures
since it's a dynamic language the diet
the method despite method dispatch
property access happened at runtime so
you can intercept method called property
access and you can even inject new
behavior inside your classes even on JDK
classes you can add new behavior or
change the behavior of JDK classes and
do some wacky stuff like operator of the
loading and song I've written a tutorial
on that step if you want to have more
detail about the stuff you can do with
groovy you can look at this URL so I've
got a little oh yeah one more example I
mentioned nested tree structures you
know the Builder pattern lets you create
tree structures graph of objects very
easily and at the syntax level groovy
allows you to configure tree structured
data so for instance in my example here
I'm bill I'm oops sorry I'm building
some mock code here some HTML so I've
got a root node HTML and a head nodes
below the HTML node well you see the
stretcher right on the right and its
really up the syntax level you see the
nesting of the elements so title is
below han which is below HT
mmm so it's nice way to express trees
torturous we've got different builders
the example uses a marker builder but
we've gotta swing builder because swing
you eyes are typically nested you've got
a panel with other panels with buttons
inside that panel and so on sirs tree
structures and you can build your own
for instance if you if you want to model
map description or 2d or 3d scenes you
can do that with the Builder and the
other few tricks i'm going to show you
in my demo just after this slide is the
fact that you can add properties or
methods to things like numbers you
cannot do that in general so i can say
thirty-five dollars and i can do
editions because I'm overloading
operators as well and the nice trick all
saw that you see four days from now just
10 hours you can represent time and you
can use named arguments for readability
for instance if you want to say that
monster removes on the x-axis and y-axis
from a certain distance and you're able
to write your own control structures so
if you like to write your own if all
your own loops and so on you can do so
now a demo so i'm using g data to access
google calendar from GUI so let me show
you the code first so there's a yes
something I didn't mention we've got
plugins for ideas so there's a nice
plugin for Eclipse this jetbrains
recently announced that they are
building their own group
plugin so it's a work in progress it's
not yet on par with our Eclipse plugin
so here you see my lil G data demo so
you can see well I've hidden my password
and ID here is the URL of the feed of my
calendar and I'm using some new methods
I've added to things like numbers so I'm
using a category I'm adding method
through a category system and it will
allow me to write things like that so I
can well I'm retrieving the service the
calendar service I'm passing my own
credentials with my ID my password then
I am looking for the events spanning two
years one year ago one year ahead of
time and I'm going to print all the
items which are in my calendar and after
that I'm going to create a new event in
my calendar so i'm going to show you
that so gree on the common line g data
ok g data groovy i'm going to launch my
little script it takes a little time so
past here and act here evens yeah so
interview my birthday my wedding and the
java one conference and we've added a
new even to our calendar so let me show
you that it's not that window ok so yeah
just just for the record the hiber the
job of guys just blogged about their
support of movie enjoy both seem so it's
brand new i'm going to show you so here
is my calendar i'm going to refresh it
and you should see somewhere where is it
yeah this is the event i've just created
with my script so this is some tests
from some consonants and test
countenance i I've just added so you
seen a few lines of code it's quite easy
to create new even deal with your own
calendar with a small dsl handling date
and time ok my slides yep
so here the calendar service is the
class which is from the sharra from g
data it's not something we've created
ourselves you it's not me so the only
thing I pro I provided here is the small
dsl with date and time handling and
we've also added a few new methods on
the calendar service for instance this
get feed method doesn't exist on the
calendar service it's a new method I've
added through the g data category so i
can add new things without extending
your own classes i can add new methods
new properties and so on so i've added
this get feed method which hopes sorry
google may not fire which retrieves
evens because the this stuff one year
ago is a special class i've created so
it's a time adoration class I've created
so I created a new get feed method that
is able to handle those objects are
created yeah
yep
yeah in that block and even in that
thread so it's just on that trend here
so if you use the calendar service
elsewhere you will not benefit from this
added method if you don't use using
yeah it's well it's lexically scoped
here but it's also scoped at the thread
level
so no it's not this one okay so first
demo so it was really just very small
example of dsl you can even build bigger
dsl it's just a small example so you saw
the code of highlighted the important
bits so another well groovy 10 was
released in January so it's five month
old but we are working on one dot one
and last week we released one that one
beta 1 which adds a major feature to the
language with annotations and well other
things like static imports as well so as
of now movie is the sole alternative
language for the JVM that supports
annotations no other languages support
annotations apart from Java of course so
groovy one that one is currently in
development yeah I mentioned that we've
just added a notation support at the
moment is just a notation usage you
cannot define your own annotations in
groovy that it will come in the final
release and one that one so with
annotations you can leverage frameworks
and tools like Joyce testing g you can
write your own ejb3 jpa annotated beans
with groovy your spring beans using
spring annotations like at transactional
things like that and yeah i mentioned jo
sim just let me show you this blog entry
here yeah emmanuel banner from jboss
just blogged today about the fact that
you can use groovy to write jeebus
applications so here what you see is
just a groovy beam
and you can see that you don't have
those ugly getters and setters you just
use properties and you add annotations
it's really nice so it's brand new out
of the oven and yet i already mentioned
that we're the sole alternative on which
providing support for annotations so now
i'm going to demo the usage of
annotations so I've got where is it so
I've got a demo showing testing g and
google joyce some so let's say so i
showed you the eclipse plugin i can show
you the groovy plugin LD sorry the
IntelliJ IDEA a plugin what I didn't
show you and be in the plug-in that
you've got cut completion if it's if it
wants to work no okay it usually works
nevermind it's a work in progress anyway
so here I'm creating a simple interface
calculator to add two things two numbers
of whatever i'm going to implement my
calculator i'm going to provide a
concrete implementation it's going to be
a singleton so i'm using the the joists
at singleton annotation and i'm going to
create a client that's with a calculator
that is injected by joyce and i execute
some calculation by calling the
calculator okay and for testing that I'm
going to use test Angie so I'm going to
configure the injector some using the
create injector methods I'm creating a
new module
and here you can see a configure well so
it's a trick for creating and some kind
of anonymous inner classes goody doesn't
support anonymous inner classes but you
can use those maps that you can coerce
to an interface so this is a map with
the configure key and the closure this
is a closure and we transform that map
that you see here into something else
it's a module it's an interface and then
I'm going to retrieve my clients and
then I'm creating a simple test method
which going which is going to assert
that the result of my calculation is
correct going to launch that from the
shell so we've got a special integration
with groovy intestine G written by
aleksandra papa school which is a
committee the committee on both testing
g and groovy so that's why I've got a
special groovy mg command how is it
called test enjoys oh I'm launching it
so it's going to pass my script and I've
got the result here one test was run no
failure no skipped tests and I think it
also generates some tests so here you'll
see the HTML output generated by testing
gene ok
so that was the second demo the code
I've just shown you so the part which is
leveraging Joyce the way i'm configuring
Joyce oh I bind the interface with the
concrete implementation and how I use
the add before class annotation to say
that before the tests are run I want to
execute that method and the test method
just below what else I'm going to show
you some other demos on how to mix
groovy and Google services or api's so
we've seen how i used GData API with my
small date and time dsl and and so i'm
going to show you a few other things so
you guys are offering some really nice
api's and tools like Google Maps
geocoding surveys the GData API for
google calendar and other services as
well and there's also google talk i'm
going to show your demo with google talk
and how can you reuse and how can you
mix and match groovy and all those
services and what we can do for you let
Caesar so first of all it a little swing
mashup where I'm going to use Google
Maps the Google geocoding service and
well i'm going to use flickr sorry even
if it's not google stuff
here is my mashup class my lil scripts
so well I shouldn't show my guru and
figure keys on hiding that I'm using the
swing X swing components which are some
nice components some open source
components which lets you we use google
maps from swing interfaces and there's a
special tile factory which is calling a
special URL that will be forged to
retrieve the tiles of of the maps and
well but the best is i'm going to show
you the example groovy masha you know
you will understand what it does
ok so it's loading ok so the main part
of the screen you see the google map of
bars my town i'm coming from Paris and
on the Left I'm going to show them some
flickr photos associated with the
address i'm going to type here so for
instance if i want to go to San
Francisco ok I'm going to re-center the
map on San Francisco and of course can
zoom in and out ok I'm going to be at
the most Connie center for the rest of
the week cap or Java on what else I
could show you the Statue of Liberty for
instance perhaps you'll see some nice
pictures as well yeah liberty islands
and oh we don't see the stage of the
Liberty but it's some new york pictures
ok so there are different things
happening here though google map the
geocoding service is being cold because
i want to retrieve the coordinates so
that i can update the map with the
coordinates associated with this address
and then also using the rest service
from flickr to retrieve some pictures
and how is it down back to the code
so first of all I mean instantiating the
tile factory which is the class
responsible for finding the tiles of the
map I'm centering the position on Paris
so starting position then I'm going to
use the swing builder so the swing
builder is this nice stuff for creating
tree structures and you can see that I'm
creating a frame inside that frame you
see a panel inside that panel you see
another panel you see some constraint
some layouts and inside that panel
you've got a text field what else you've
got another widget which is the map
viewer you've got all the panels so the
structure of your swing you I is visible
from the code which is quite nice and
there are three interesting aspects here
and then at the end of the script I'm
packing the window and make it show up
so there are three parts which are
interesting here first of all in this
part that I'm going to highlight I'm
calling the geocoding service so i'm
calling the URL of the geocoding service
here then i'm using we've got some some
some special xml puzzles in groovy so
I'm retreating the texts from the URL
I'm passing that stuff it creates a node
structure a dome dome structure and then
it's interesting because you can
navigate in your dome model very easily
from groovy because it's just like
accessing properties so on the node I'm
accessing a chip a child node called
response another status node which is a
child of response and the code node
which is a child of status in a single
line you've got
next path like way of expressing your
way inside an XML document and I'm
checking checking that the status code
is okay and if that's the case I'm going
to Center I'm also extracting the
coordinates from the XML feed and then
I'm centering the map here and if the
address is not correct for instance fine
writing some form dumb stuff I'm going
to have a little message telling me that
the address is wrong and that's the
message you show here then so when I
choose when I set a new address i'm
going to call this service to recenter
the map and also calling flickr almost
the same way i'm calling the rest URL
I'm passing the XML and I'm retrieving
the photos I'm interested in so I'm just
retrieving a few photos not all photos
returned then I'm creating be the URL of
the pictures and I'm setting you saw the
buttons on on the left and I'm changing
the button so that they show the new
picture so again there's this nice
syntax for accessing the elements of the
XML feet and one last thing perhaps yeah
that's the part which is creating the
the left built-ins so that's it you see
how we managed to match up different
aprs it's nice for prototyping if you
want to try some new new stuff and
access very easily some some XML
services
in a few lines of code you can do that
in Rudy I'm going to close this
so yeah the the Quran showed I'm just
show a few minutes ago so the URL of the
map tiles the way I'm retrieving I'm
amusing the geocoding service how I can
access the XML nodes and the same for
the same step for flickr now another
little demo so i'm going to use google
talk this time you know that google talk
is based on the jabber protocol and you
know it's just some xml payload which is
exchanged between the clients and the
servers and there's a nice library in
Java which is the smack library that you
can use to access google talk or older
jabber servers and groovy has got a
special xml-rpc module i'm going to use
the groovy xml-rpc support to create a
client-server system which lets you
invoke services remotely through and
through google talk so let's see the
code is here so I've got a client and
I've got a server so first of all I'm
going to start okay i'm going to stop
the server here chito server and in the
other window i'm going to launch the
clients so the the server well it's just
a simple stupid service which is the Eco
service so it will echo whatever it
receives whether it's a number is trying
or whatever it's going to equal it and
you can see the use of the smack library
so I'm going to
to google talk I'm connecting here i'm
logging there and i'm starting the
server and the nice stuff in fact is
here here well i'm creating my own
server which is going to use google talk
as the medium the transport medium and
here it's a i'm defining a closure which
is going to be the service which is
exposed and executed remotely and on the
client side well it's almost the same
code for the connection parts now i'm
going to create a proxy around the
service which you see called here so I'm
calling the eco method on the service
proxy which will in fact called the
remote method so I'm going to ask the
server to eco have a world and this
number ok so the server is started here
well it's not a very impressive demo
going to see some message message is
written in the console it's very simple
ok i'm going to i'm sending hello world
and 345 and on the server side it's
being cold you see the arguments of the
remote method so it's a basic service
you can do certainly i'm sure you'll
come up with some more interesting ideas
but it's fun to know that you are able
to use google talk as a client server
system in a few lines of code and the
nice bit in is really that part the way
you are defining the closure defining
the remote method then
that is exposed through google talk and
then the client parts which is there so
i used two different accounts my G La
Forge main account and my older I've got
two accounts I used one for the client
one for the server and that's it so the
summary and what's interesting with
groovy compared to other languages on
the JVM is that there's no impedance
mismatch so it's really since it shares
the same object oriented model the same
syntax the right syntax you can reuse
all the Java libraries get that but you
have written yourself although the
dedicate or all the frameworks and tools
and also the fact that it's using when
you're using a string it's just a java
string when you're using regular
expressions it's the java.util reg ex
stuff it's not a new or different
regular expression syntax like it would
be the case with other languages so it's
nice to see that it's easy to learn and
you can leverage all the stuff that
you've worked on and that you already
know and as I said already it's also the
first alternative language that support
annotations so welcome to ejb3 SJP a
annotated beans Google jewels testing g
and so on all those frameworks that
leverage annotations and with my small
dinners I showed in a few lines of code
how you can integrate groovy with Google
Maps geocoding service google talk
google jewish testing g and so on
so going further well we need you if you
want to play with groovy and well just
have fun it's a first first start first
step you can report bugs provide patches
if you want you can integrate groove in
your apps it should be firms and you can
also help us improve our IDE plugins
it's one of the areas where we are
focusing on at the moment so it's very
important for us to have a really good
tooling support ID support so it's a
work in progress but we are so that's
the Eclipse IDE plugin which is worked
on by four active committees son also
is working on reinvigorating they had a
embryonic NetBeans plugging in there as
a team dedicated to bring it bring it
back to back to life and as I said
jetbrains announced recently that
they're just started working on the
plugin and the during the demos here
what you see the syntax highlighting and
so on that's the groovy plugin they are
working on so you can think like code
folding or navigation and so on they're
working hard on that what else in
October that dedicated conference
dedicated groovy and grails with
different tracks on the groovy language
on the Grails web framework I didn't
mention the grades web framework to web
framework based on groovy spring and
hibernate and other libraries like
quartz side mesh for decorating pages
and a few Ajax API is like a dojo and so
on and there are some famous speakers
from interface 21 or Google jables and
sun coming to this conference so it's in
October and it's in London so if you
want to cross on the other side of the
pond you can come and see us and
additionally yeah north of just stuff is
running a you know this north american
tour with conferences all around the USA
every two weeks or something like that
in the depth and they've got a dedicated
groovy and grails truck so if you want
to know a bit more about brilliant rails
you can go there some further reading so
I've caught her groove in action and
there's a nice book on grains as well
and
are here are a few URLs my blog the URL
of the groovy website there's a
dedicated new site called about groovy
calm my domain specific language
tutorial there's a general blood like
aggregator just for groovy so you'll see
groovy and great stuff just on this
aggregator well I think that's all if
you've got some first of all thanks a
lot for your attention and if you've got
some questions I'll be happy to answer
them thanks a lot yep
how much of
mm-hmm
lifeboat and
Yeah right so first the perform on the
performance aspects since its dynamic
language and that what we call the meat
object protocol which is this stuff that
is running the method dispatch in
property access because of this of grew
being a dynamic language we've got of
course an overhead compared with rule
java code so we have to handle the logic
behind choosing the right method and so
on so groovy will always be a bit slower
than Java so I don't have exact figures
it can vary from well the the last
figures i've heard were like it can be
20 persons the performance from java 280
persons so it's a bit slower it can be
up to four or five times slower in
certain cases or it can be almost as
fast as java in other cases it depends
so that's the first aspect and the other
question was about yeah yeah how so us
we've got a runtime system which is
handling the way method methods are cool
in fact when you are in your code when
you're doing foo dog bar parenteral when
you're calling the bar method on food
before doing the actual call we're going
through some custom classes to make the
actual dispatch and that's how you can
plug into this runtime system to
intercept method calls so you can even
create an existing methods you can drop
method calls to methods that don't
actually exist so that's the kind of
things you see happening in them you
know in my little dsl example where you
can do one note hour ago well one is
just an integer so how the hell
going to intercept this property on an
integer well i'm using this runtime
system I've got you know in Java there's
the class concept so with a certain when
an object has got a class which defines
the behavior at compile time of all the
instances of this class and in groovy
the runtime system has got a special
class which is called the meet a class
which defines the runtime behavior of
your class so each class has got its own
meet a class or default metaclass but
you can customize that to drop method
calls and add new stuff yourself that's
how it's working
yeah exactly yeah
yep
I am and so following up on that will
would adding invoke dynamic to the JVM
help or would you still essentially have
to go through the same in direction the
f go through now so invoke dynamic is
not progressing much lately so it's hard
to know whether we are going to be able
to leverage this new byte code
instruction that's hopefully well we've
got the core the core committer the main
developer on groovy with a full-time
developer on the project as part of the
day expect the expert group up with Jess
are so I hope is going to provide some
directions to this jets are so that we
can liberate Vista for self so that it
helps us improve performance and so on
no other questions
so thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
