in the platforms group and it's my
pleasure to introduce you to John Davis
from da energy he's going to talk about
flow batteries which I think is an
incredibly promising technology for
energy storage so with you here's John
hi there my name is John Davis and I am
the vice president of business
development for dia energy and what
we're gonna discuss today is Flo battery
technology it's an energy storage
platform and and brand-new technology
that is a game-changer in the way that
both grid generated and non grid
generated energy can be utilized more
efficiently and so I have a slot a
number of slides out of the presentation
it's about 45 minutes long so then we'll
you know answer your questions as we as
we go through after we finish the
presentation so let's do an introduction
to D energy dia was founded in 2006 and
we're here in the heart of Silicon
Valley in Fremont we were based in
Fremont we have developed a technology
that was originally researched by NASA
in the 1970s NASA certainly had a
distinct interest in in energy storage
for long haul space missions and this
type of chemistry that our battery is
based out of was initially X explored by
and researched by NASA in the 70s it's
called a redox flow battery and it is
based on an iron chromium chemistry that
is dissolved in Sophia I'm sorry
hydrochloric acid these mission is to
develop technology develop the
technology into applications that are
you know that make a difference in
allowing energy to be much more
efficient so we are developing our
products to
for energy storage and management
solutions that that focus on industrial
and consumer applications similar to
some of which are telecommunications and
of course datacenter backup power a type
of applications we want to be able to
maximize the utilization of power at
various generation capacities and one of
the applications you'll see me discuss
is off-grid power and how we can better
utilize the use of of genset and
renewable energies for for use and make
it much more reliable and by doing this
you know for mission-critical
applications by using energy storage we
can significantly reduce the expense of
of on-site generation the battery is
extremely environmentally friendly no
heavy metals nothing that is that will
harm the environment and of course we
are very excited about the technological
breakthrough that that dia has has come
up with with this technology our company
is a is a relatively new company we're a
start in start-up mode we're moving from
startup to production we have a handful
of top-tier VC firms here locally that
continue to fund our our research and
development and operations and one of
the new press releases that has just
been made is that we have completed a 30
million-dollar Series C fundraising
event that is pushing us towards very
quickly towards commercialization so so
what is a flow battery well a flow
battery is a type of rechargeable
electrically rechargeable battery of
which the energy is stored chemically in
a liquid electrolyte and unlike
conventional batteries that are stored
they're the reactive materials are
actually dissolved metals in the
electrolyte
so the flow battery has a number of
components involved to do that it has
tanks that in fact hold the reservoirs
that hold the electrolyte with the with
the metal that is in immersed in it and
it has a series of pumps that moves the
liquid through a cell stack now the cell
stack is actually very similar to a fuel
cell technology it is a membrane based
cell stack sometimes its uses even a fee
on which is the same as a hydrogen fuel
cells in our case we have a little bit
of a derivative of that but what happens
is that the ions will pass through the
membranes of the cell stack and
electrons will flow from one side of one
reservoir to the other side of the
reservoir and basically it will harness
the the differential the voltage
differential between the two reservoirs
through the cell stack using that as the
engine so it's kind of a hybrid between
a fuel cell and I like to call it a
closed-loop rechargeable fuel cell it
doesn't use any fuel like I said it's
electrically rechargeable and so it's
it's in between a battery technology and
a fuel cell technology why this makes
this very interesting and usable is that
this type of technology can be charged
and discharged literally many many
thousands of times without any
degradation or ill effect on the system
at all so unlike conventional battery
technologies where for example lead acid
systems require you to have to replate
the lead each time you charge the system
there's no mechanical element to the
battery that a lot that requires that
type of activity so the ability for the
system to charge and discharge many many
thousands of time
becomes much more available for you so
our system is basically a like I said
it's a green technology using iron and
chromium with hydrochloric acid as the
electrolyte it's packaged in a small
package that looks similar to about the
size of a refrigerator so you basically
have two tanks that are in this
particular outdoor enclosure and you
have a cell stack that is placed on top
of the tanks and the other two
components are two pumps one of which
for each reservoir that moves the
electrolyte through the cell stack and
then basic electronics that takes the
raw DC voltage that's generated from the
system and converts it and conditions it
to some sort of usable voltage that can
be anywhere from 12 to 96 volts DC so
basically as I've mentioned the the
components involved are that the
electrolyte there's two different
reservoirs of which both reservoirs have
exactly the same chemistry and same
liquid the difference is that what
happens is that the metals will move its
move through different balanced States
so one side of the of the system will
have its the the metals become much more
positively charged than the other
reservoir and there will be a voltage
potential between the two reservoirs of
about one and a half volts so if you
have that on a large scale what happens
is the cell stack acts as an amplifier
and allows you to generate a large
quantity of current when you move the
the tube electrolytes through the cell
stack thus given you a usable power or
generation source so the differences
between our technology and incumbent
lead-acid battery technology is that
traditionally lead-acid batteries which
have a very long history over 100 years
of development and and literally have
been in the same type of chemistry for
that that same time have very little
usability after you discharge the system
at approximately 25% you can go below
the 25% discharge cycling capacity for
lead acids but what happens is it always
will damage the battery and cause the
battery to not be able to charge back to
the rate that that you originally had
when the battery was first first new and
usable so one of the issues that you
have with lead acid batteries
specifically in a backup power type of
application is obviously it can always
continues to degrade and lose its
capacity over time the more you use the
battery the faster it degrades with our
technology we've gotten past that issue
and we now have the capacity of charging
many many many thousands of times with
no degradation of its performance over
time so what that means is we can use
the full scale of the battery for usable
energy storage and that opens up a lot
of brand-new applications that now
traditional energy storage systems would
not be able to us to be able to satisfy
and so with by developing a system that
has the ability to move through its
cycles many many thousands of times you
you now have the capacity of using a
daily cycling system for various
applications like storing solar energy
on a daily basis or working on a system
that's off the grid that's running off
the diesel generator and being able to
turn the generator off for many hours
during the day and using your stored
energy as your primary source of power
so the ideal energy storage product is
that it needs to be insensitive to
temperature which lead acid batteries
are not they have a they're affected by
both very cold weather and by very warm
temperatures they need to have the
capacity of being fast charged so the
ideal situation is that you can charge
the battery as quickly as you discharge
the battery again lead acid batteries do
not have that capacity as as you move
through time and lead acids are charged
over and over and again it takes much
more energy to get the the battery back
to its state of usable storage up to
approximately five to one charge the
discharge ratio if you had the ability
to do infinite cycle life so every day
being able to cycle the system time and
time again with no degradation
performance is obviously a huge benefit
being able to charge the system
efficiently trying to have a system
where it you put as you put back the
energy in the same capacity that you
have as you use as opposed to having a
large quantity of energy you have to put
back into the battery just to get it
back to where it originally was would be
would be a great benefit and of course
being able to have no hazardous
materials in the battery would be would
be fantastic of course lead acid
batteries traditionally have have had
the environmental issue of disposability
to four lid obviously you can recycle
that acids but but in many parts of the
world that that just doesn't seem to
happen so here's here is a graph of a
traditional lead acid battery in a high
cyclic application in this particular
case we have used a diesel generator and
an off-grid application a telecom
application where the battery is being
charged on a daily basis and of course
the graph in the middle
shows the the result of charging and
discharging a lead-acid battery over
time traditionally you will you'll see
that that the graph shows that the
capacity of the battery begins to lose
capacity immediately after each
discharge cycle to a point of not being
able to have a usable charge associated
with the battery at any given time again
with our technology our goal and and
what we were able to do is have that
high cyclic capacity where it has the
ability to charge and discharge at
exactly the same rate to the same
maximum charge ratio each and every time
well over 10,000 cycles so in what
applications would in fact you could you
use high cyclic energy storage well dia
has focused a number of applications for
example on very remote sites that would
be similar to like Telecom sites
everyone knows that telecommunication
sites have the need for backup power in
the US and North America the use of
lead-acid batteries at telecommunication
sites are basically an insurance policy
in the case that you lose power on a you
know on a infrequent basis but on sites
throughout the world the telephone
industry is is exploding and in places
like India in Africa Latin America and a
lot of these sites are actually off-grid
sites it the ability to run this assist
the site off-grid and pay twenty
thousand plus dollars in diesel fuel at
a specific site is very cost effective
at these locations so it is believe it
or not there are literally hundreds and
thousands of sites throughout the world
that are running telecommunications base
stations off of diesel generators 24
hours seven days a week
so one of our major applications that we
have pushed towards is taking the high
cyclic capacity of our battery and
working with the diesel generator on
these types of sites storing the
excessive energy that a diesel genset
generates because the diesel gensets are
extremely inefficient and they throw a
lot of wasted energy away in heat and
then and then turning the generator off
for a as much as 12 hours a day and the
cost of fuel savings at these types of
sites by running off of the battery 12
hours a day pays for the battery in in
literally a year to two years so the
return on investment is very high and of
course if you mixed that with renewable
energy if you took solar and wind and of
course have these mission-critical types
of applications where you use the
battery for storing whatever excessive
energy is being generated by either
solar or a wind and the diesel genset or
allow the battery to smooth the effect
of the inconsistency of renewables then
of course it your power system becomes
much more reliable and you know in the
case that for example in the case of
using this as a traditional backup power
for a UPS system the battery system
looks like a lead acid battery it you
know it operates exactly the same there
is no differential to any of your
infrastructure as to whether this is a
lead acid system or a or a flow battery
technology the difference is that the
level of reliability that the flow
battery gives you for allowing you to
not have to ever replace your battery
systems again is is paramount so of
course you know our company has focused
significantly on a number of very remote
applications and sites we have pushed
very dill
gently into the telecommunications arena
in India and Africa and of course in the
US and Canada and other places of the of
the world we still can compete with the
incumbent technologies of lead-acid and
other technologies in the traditional
use of batteries and and again like I
said allow the sister systems to have
much more reliability by using us you
know the technology that basically does
not degrade so this is what our system
looks like this is our first product
it's a two and a half kilowatt system
and it has the capacity of giving you 24
kilowatt hours of energy delivery each
day so that means that it can it will
have the ability to discharge for hours
each discharge cycle it operates at a
very wide temperature range down to
minus five degrees up to 50 degrees C
without any ill effect on the battery
whatsoever it has a very high fast
charge rate so it actually can charge
faster than it can discharge which makes
it very good for these high cyclic
applications so for example if you have
an outage and if you had a system that
was a UPS based system and you had a
four hour outage the battery can cover
that outage very easily and then would
only take two hours to recharge itself
to get the system back to a place where
it's 100% ready to go the next outage of
course you can discharge the battery
completely to zero no energy we aware
there's no more energy storage at all
but it has no ill effect on the battery
whatsoever so again that's that's a very
high-value feature we're offering
because of the reliability the system we
offer a five-year warranty of the system
I'm also I should mention that the
battery can be designed to support
various
voltage ranges that are you know very
standard ranges for both
telecommunications and UPS applications
the electrolyte at the end of the life
of the system is reusable and and
recyclable so we can take the
electrolyte we can remove the the core
elements of the system which are
basically chromium and iron and and then
reuse the system for you know and
rebuild the electrolyte for use at a
later date so that the electrolyte does
not have it basically has an infinite
life for the electrolyte itself it's not
flammable there's no emissions that the
system puts out there's no hydrogen
emissions so it's again a very safe
benign technology that can in fact be
used indoors our product roadmap is that
we have started with a two and a half
kilowatt small package again focused a
lot on the cellular tower networks that
are throughout the world we are
designing our next step will be a five
kilowatt package which will be in a
little bit larger outdoor enclosure our
plan is that the systems in fact and the
technology is very scalable by adding
more electrolyte you add more energy
storage by building the cell stacks or
ganging cell stacks together you add
more power so because of the system
being as modular as it is we have now
the ability to scale up the technology
product wise to allow us to build
systems that are much more larger in
scale and opening up the use of this
same technology for many many other
applications including Grid applications
wind and solar on a larger scale many
other applications on the Laurent you
know for telecommunications and other
UPS based
situations basically it's a very simple
machine there are base there are four
components to the machine that that make
the system operate the intellectual
property that we have developed is based
on our cell stack it's like I mentioned
before it's a basic cell stack design
similar to the fuel cell industry and it
basically handles the conversion of as
the electrolyte flows through the
various cells in the stack it it
basically trans transports ions through
a membrane and allowing the power to be
generated at the cell stack level the
next component of the system is the
pumps
so we basically pump a liquid through
the cell stack so that's a you know very
well known technology pumps are off the
shelf and you know so it's not a
unreliable part of the system and the
third part of the system is the
electrolyte itself which is just basic
hydrochloric acid with with our salts
that are immersed in the system and the
the fourth is the electronics that are
used to convert the DC system to from
you know from raw DC to usable DC I've
got a question I'm sorry a good question
the concentration of the hydrochloric
acid is one-fifth that of Clorox so it's
it's mostly water a very diluted
solution
if you look at various graphs of how our
system compares to incumbent lead acid
Technologies again what you see is that
there is no other technology out there
that has the ability to give you a flat
line discharge curve over a very long
period of use and allow you to have the
same amount of energy storage at cycle
number 10,000 as opposed to cycle number
one led acids do not do that the other
the other problem is led acids are
directly affected by by higher
temperatures so most of the time as as
you are well aware and probably your
data centers you have a large scale of
lead acid batteries used for UPS
applications that you have to condition
and you have to use in an
air-conditioned environment which takes
energy itself to to allow the batteries
to to attempt to have some level of
lifecycle that that you have that you
get the most amount of investment from
money from use out of that particular
investment so our system basically
allows you to not only have the long
lifecycle but not have to be concerned
with the environmental issues of
conditioning the temperature of the
battery to make it work and operate
properly so again one of the
applications that I'm sure that will be
of interest to Google will be a data
center UPS use and I was inquiring a
little bit about the use of of your lead
acids earlier and the use of being able
to whether or not you're using lead
acids in in UPS applications in parts of
the world that potentially do not have
role
Viable Grid applications those are the
sites that you're going to be replacing
lead acids much more readily than than
sites like here and in this facility
where you know your grid is very
consistent and and have very few outages
but if you have these types of sites
where you're running your ups quite a
bit and you're having to turn diesel
gensets on to cover the outages on
long-term scale the the DIA system will
allow you to to number one reduce the
amount of money spent on energy storage
because it's a one-time capex expense
for a long period of time and also they
reduced the amount of potential diesel
fuel that you potentially would have to
have on site and run you know and having
to run a diesel generator as an
augmentation in the case that you're
losing power for a much longer period of
time so there's a lot of ancillary
benefits to having a system that gives
you four hours or plus runtime out of
battery as opposed to having a much
smaller battery system that you're
having to bridge to a generator to to
keep your data centers up and running
and again of obviously everyone is is
very interested and excited about
renewable energy you know Google is a is
on the forefront of that and you know
this platform now allows you to have
inconsistent renewable energy be able to
be much more smooth and consistent for
the use for your four data sites or
other types of applications throughout
Google's infrastructure so by using this
on a daily basis and smoothing this the
wind or capturing solar in the day time
and then using the battery at night for
for delivery of power to
mission-critical applications is now a
very do
application so today we are located dia
is located in Fremont our headquarters
is right across the bay
we also are have developed a
manufacturing facility in India and we
are making systems and delivering
systems worldwide from both our
locations here in Fremont as well as in
India
and with that that's my presentation I
hope that I've been able to share a
little bit more information with you
about flow battery technology and if
you've got questions I'm happy to answer
right good question the question is is
there a concern about if there is a
leakage if if there's you know obviously
our system has a chromium in it it also
has it's in basically it's an iron
chromium alloy so the difference is that
this the amount of chromium in the
system as opposed to iron is very low
there is really no issue with with the
system as if there is a major leakage
that would be in a worst-case scenario
you're looking at basically the needing
to the dilute the hydrochloric acid and
that was typically the the big issue
that all of our systems have secondary
and third containment so if there is
some sort of leakage we sense that
immediately the system will completely
shut down will limit the amount of
leakage that occurs and contain the
leakage within our our cabinet works we
mitigate that as much as possible yes
good question the question is what is
there is what will be needed to refresh
the system or you know after the end of
life basically what we see is that the
cell stack needs to be replaced the
electrolyte doesn't necessarily see much
effect on the electrolyte the pumps
potentially might be need to be replaced
but because the system is a machine it's
serviceable and has the ability to be
restored by having new components put in
the Machine very easily right now we are
measuring at a round trip efficiency of
about 72 percent at the DC level
obviously by putting a system on an AC
inversion you lose a little bit more
efficiency but the DC to DC
charge ratio and the efficiencies of our
system are extremely high 768 to 72% and
that's measured again after a quite a
number of cycles you know throughout its
lifecycle so that is very consistent
I'm sorry Savior that's the round trip
efficiency of yes the well most of the
most of the loss of efficiency is during
the charge cycle the discharge cycle is
probably much more higher efficient than
than the charge cycle and most of that
is based on converting is is lost in
electronics and we lose quite a bit of
some level of energy in converting to a
level of voltage that the system needs
to have to push energy back into the
system as opposed for it naturally
wanting to come out like any energy
storage system it wants to deliver you
know and so discharging becomes a very
easy natural thing for any energy
storage system so putting putting energy
into the system is more less efficient
than than the delivery of energy let's
say I had one back here and let me get
this guy back here that's a great
question what's the question is if you
charge it and put it in an idle state
does it have any any loss of energy over
time what we do is we turn valves off in
the system that isolate the tanks from
each other so because of the system is
has various balanced States in the in
the metal they don't change that doesn't
change so as long as there is no path
for for leakage current between the
tanks then it will stay in that state
indefinitely
so the question is I'm going to convert
that question to what is the what is
what is the how much energy does it take
to for the machine to run a cell less
than a hundred watts so it's very you
know when we've Rattler when we've
raided the system two and a half
kilowatts then that is the output of the
system if you use happy the power yes
you have twice the amount of run time so
you have amount of energy storage which
is 2400 L which is approximately ten
kilowatt hours so if you're only
discharging a kilowatt you would have
ten hours of run time if you're
discharging at two kilowatts you would
have approximately four or five is
exactly the same that's that's correct
and the the capacity is independent of
power delivery because what we've done
is we've separated the electrolyte from
the power system unlike the lead acid
battery is one big block so to scale
that you have to buy both power and
energy in one block so what we do is
we've segregated that away from each
other so if we want to have more run
time or if this we need to build a
system that has more run time we just
need to add electrolyte and so you have
a two and a half kilowatt system then if
you need ten hours of run time have
bigger tanks with more electrolyte if
you need more power you can you can
increase the the size or the number of
cell stack student for delivery of power
I mean let me have this question here
the absolutely the the some of the new
technologies for let asked the question
is what are we comparing to as far as
the basic technologies in Alette acid
most of our comparisons are in our
scales our VRLA SBR la technologies not
flooded and most of which are aimed
again added telecommunications
applications that we you know that we
that we significantly push our value
proposition towards back here in the
back
yes there is well there is comparison
but the application use is much
different we can't you know this is a
machine we can't make a system that is
in the package that will let that a
lithium-ion battery is lithium has an
extremely high energy density but the
price you pay for that is that when you
scale that up to multiple kilowatt range
for applications other than maybe
hybrids or that type of thing it becomes
extremely expensive and hard to manage
lithium also has the issue with
temperature and that type of thing so
the question is there a vehicle
application not in the foreseeable
future where we're still fairly low in
energy density for vehicle applications
are this machine two-and-a-half
kilowatts probably weighs two tons
failure of the system is the system has
a lot of it's a smart system so we have
the capacity of monitoring the delivery
of energy and how it's being delivered
you know there it's not unlikely to have
a small leak it's not unlikely to have a
cell stack to fail membrane might might
have a failure that would cause the
electrolytes to leak into each other it
doesn't affect the electrolytes at all
but would require the the cell stack to
be replaced so there you know it's like
any machine there are a number of
different failure points that what we
don't see is we do not see failures of
our pumps we very rarely see failures of
our electronics you know it's we were
building the system to be extremely
reliable and if operated in the
conditions that that we have set forth
the system should have a 10-year life
span
anything else yep great question what's
the biggest challenges or a road map our
biggest challenges is that we are
overwhelmed with you know with interest
in this type of technology for various
applications that that we want to be
involved with obviously building you
know starting a company we've focused on
a very high-value application of
telecommunications with a small system
our next step is to scale that into
various applications that would be
utility grid types of applications which
you know the the telecommunications
industry we're estimating is two billion
dollar opportunity a year you know cap
capped out today and as far as as far as
battery technology is concerned the
utility market is screaming for energy
storage and with the with the
development of Smart Grid technologies
being able to integrate renewables at
the utility scale level for distributive
generation the need for reliable high
cyclic energy storage is paramount and
and we certainly will be working towards
supplying that solution
yes right the question that we you know
that we get poses to us quite a bit is
how can I have one of these in my home
is it gonna be cheap enough less
expensive enough for me to have the
ability to have this as an appliance we
would like to do that at some point in
time as a as a small company we focused
on high-value applications that generate
revenue for us so we are able to to get
the economies of scale today we're
selling our systems in in you know this
small package and competing with lead
acids in the you know in the 12 to 15
thousand dollar range for a two kilowatt
system sounds a little bit high but as
we move into larger scale systems what
we want to do is offer systems that are
approximately twenty five hundred
dollars a kilowatt and and that means
that we we need to build systems in a
100 to 250 3 4 or 500 kilowatt size
systems that are containerized thanks so
much for for allowing me to present to
