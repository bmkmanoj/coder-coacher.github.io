to understand what our policy should be
our position should be on nuclear energy
with respect to you know global warming
climate change renewable energy and and
dwindling fossil fuel supplies and we've
been reaching out to various experts to
understand the problems of waste and
safety and proliferation and in a
conversation we had several weeks ago
with sig Hecker I learned I had a
dramatic kind of change in perception of
what North Korea was and why they did
what they did and and so we invited sig
to come and share that with a greater
audience so please welcome Siegfried
Hecker he'll tell you about his visits
to North Korea and and why why countries
build atomic bombs thank you thank you
very much Chris
ladies and gentlemen both of those of
you who are here and also at the remote
Google Sites I welcome you and I thank
you for inviting me to give a Google
seminar as Chris had indicated I've been
talking to a number of the folks from
Google about nuclear futures in nuclear
energy and of course nuclear energy it
turns out is the story of promise and
peril and I've worked on both of those
aspects for a good part of my
professional life I spent 34 years at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory the
birthplace of the bomb and I was
director of that laboratory for about a
dozen years and then a little over five
years ago I came out to Stanford where I
continue my work on what I call nuclear
Risk Reduction and that is mostly to
worry about the peril side of nuclear
energy and what I focus on principally
issues of nuclear weapons nuclear
weapons policy nuclear proliferation
that is the spread of nuclear weapons
around the world and nuclear terrorism
but of course all of that is intimately
connected to nuclear energy and I was
set to give a talk last week which I did
at Purdue University which I titled
nuclear promise and nuclear peril and of
course what everyone had on their mind
with nuclear peril was fukken Fukushima
Daiichi in Japan but when I'm going to
focus on today is mostly the issue of
proliferation of nuclear weapons in
particularly North Korea in my
discussions with my colleagues here at
Google I have been telling him pieces of
the North Korea story and so they were
interested to sort of hear the whole
North Korea story I won't tell you the
whole North Korea story but I'm going to
try to give you my version of North
Korea the photo that you actually see on
here is in Beijing Airport of an
airplane it's actually an illusion a
Russian aircraft of my getting ready to
go into North Korea and to Pyongyang we
have to fly in through Beijing and then
also fly back out through Beijing and
what I'm going to talk about today is to
give you a sense of the whole program
and that is you know how did North Korea
get the bomb what does it actually have
and why did they get the bomb what is
the threat from the North Korean nuclear
program and then what do we do now and
then hopefully if I leave enough time I
will also try to give you sort of a
photo parade of North Korea because I've
been allowed to take a lot of photos and
it looks very differently than what you
see an American television so that's
what I will do so let me start with how
did North Korea get the bomb it began
with the Soviets Atoms for Peace program
the Atoms for Peace program was
initiated by President Eisenhower in the
United States in 1953 and the essence
was that at that time only the US the
Russians and the Brits had nuclear
weapons all of the technology was highly
classified and President Eisenhower said
we will share
nuclear technology with those countries
in the world who are willing to forswear
nuclear weapons in other words not to
pursue nuclear weapons but instead
developed atoms for peace for civilian
purposes the Soviets also followed suit
and so as you might imagine since the
world was divided into two sort of US
and Soviet bloc's the Soviets then
helped the countries in Eastern Europe
and many of the others including China
initially and including North Korea to
develop peaceful nuclear energy so the
North Koreans were trained in Soviet
universities they were trained in Soviet
nuclear centers the Soviets built the
first small research reactor in Yongbyon
which is still currently the nuclear
facility in North Korea it's about 90
kilometers north of Pyongyang and that
was the beginning but he was strictly
meant to help the North Koreans with
peaceful applications of atomic energy
however for those of you who know much
about Korea they eventually trust no one
they want to go their own path and they
did go their own path in the nuclear
arena and in the 1970s having learned
much having set up their own nuclear
engineering programs nuclear physics
programs at the University they decided
and laid out a very ambitious program
for nuclear reactors and at the same
time in my opinion they actually chose a
path to the North Korean nuclear reactor
program that would also allow them to
develop the option for nuclear weapons
and I will say more about that and then
for a number of very interesting but
very complex political reasons in the
early 1990s when the North Korean world
first came apart that was the first time
they actually worked directly with the
United States in order to take this
nuclear program that they were building
up and essentially freeze the bomb
component
that program the reason they reached
across the United States was that as you
remember in end of 1991 the Soviet Union
came apart when that happened here was a
very strong and supportive ally of North
Korea not only the Soviet Union but the
Soviet bloc and you find today strong
connections from Eastern Europe to North
Korea and the Russians essentially
deserted them overnight and so the
financial help the technical help
everything that was there beforehand
went away
the second major bloc that dealt with
North Korea was China
but this was also a time when China was
worried much more about its own economic
rise than it was about the ideology
around the world and the Chinese
actually hooked up with the South
Koreans because they felt that that was
a better way to go economically so North
Korea at that point felt it really had
no friends left and it actually reached
across the United States in order to try
to strike a deal well that was difficult
to do but eventually a deal was struck
in 1994 the essence of that deal was
that the North Koreans would freeze
their plutonium program and again I'll
tell you more about that in return the
US would actually make sure the North
Koreans get to light water reactors the
ones that are better for electricity
then for bombs and that we would
normalize relationships with them well
it turns out that was a rocky marriage
from 1994 to 2002 and in 2002 the
marriage came apart because that's the
first time the Bush administration
actually sent representatives to
Pyongyang and instead of sort of holding
out the peace branch they accused the
North Koreans of having cheated on this
Agreement North Koreans walked away and
in 2002 actually began bond production
and then that continued for the rest of
the Bush administration and indeed along
the way the North Koreans not only were
able to extract plutonium from their
reactor products but they actually
conducted a first test in 2006 and a
second test in
of 2009 so the North Korean nuclear
story is a story of 50 years in the
making it's not something that you do
overnight 50 years in the making and it
vacillated back and forth as to whether
it was more civilian or more defense and
I've written a paper on this subject
published in the journal Daedalus in
winter of 2010 which actually looks at
this interaction between technical
capability and between political intent
so let me just give you a little primer
on the bomb because in order for you to
appreciate what plutonium means what
highly enriched uranium means you need
at least to know these essentials and if
i insult you know some of your technical
sorry but thought i should give you that
his background they're essentially two
paths to the bomb and if you look at the
periodic table the two practical fissile
materials are uranium and actually only
one isotope of uranium that is 235 that
occurs only seven tenths of a percent of
natural uranium and the other one being
plutonium which is principally man made
from reactors and so the two paths are
let's look on the right-hand side first
and that is you take the natural fissile
material uranium-235 and you essentially
throw away all of the rest of what you
find in mother nature that is the 238
isotope of uranium you do that by a
process called enrichment essentially
just concentrating one isotope as you
might imagine that's somewhat difficult
to do because they're both uranium they
both have the same chemical properties
in essence so you have to take advantage
of one being just a little heavier than
the other and that's what you do in a
centrifuge so you turn the uranium in
tear gas you spin it very very fast the
light stuff stays on the inside the
heavy stuff goes to the outside and you
just keep doing this over and over and
over and that's where the term
centrifuges Cascades come from and so
that was what was done actually
the Manhattan Project days in the United
States we did it by a different
technique called gaseous diffusion but
today that technique of choice is the
the centrifuge in which you see on the
right-hand side are just rows of these
centrifuges the second path to the bomb
is you actually start with the natural
uranium we're slightly enriched uranium
and you put it in a reactor and you
start the neutron reaction and you
fission the the uranium-235 atoms that
makes a bunch of fission product and it
makes a bunch of neutrons 238 picks up a
neutron and through a few decays becomes
plutonium and it turns out that
plutonium is even better bomb material
than uranium-235 except now you not only
have to make it in a reactor which is
the top diagram on your left-hand side
but then you have to extract it from the
reactor products from the fission
product and that you do chemically and
that's what we call we processing you do
that in the reprocessing facility now it
turns out for the uranium-235 you can
make a rather simple bomb and that is
you just take two subcritical
Hemisphere's and you put them in a gun
and you shoot them together very rapidly
okay when you do that in essence if you
do it right
that was the hiroshima device around 13
or so kilotons 13,000 ton tnt equivalent
it destroyed a city one plane one bomb
destroyed a city that's because of this
nucleus stuff when you split the the
nucleus you get a factor of millions in
the energy gain compared to all the
other chemical techniques and so that's
why nuclear is so special and not only
do you get that in nuclear energy but
you also get it in a bomb if you do it
right or if you do it wrong depending on
your point of view so this gun assembly
works for you for highly enriched
uranium for a bomb that's typically 80
to 90 percent enriched
it doesn't work for plutonium for very
good nuclear physics reasons I won't get
into so for plutonium instead you have
to use what we call the implosion device
and that is you have a subcritical mass
of plutonium pack explosives around it
like a soccer ball you you put
detonators around and you try to implode
it all very symmetrically to drive it -
super criticality and then it blows up
that's Nagasaki takes about six
kilograms for the implosion device of
plutonium takes a few tens of kilograms
for in highly enriched uranium you can
also use the implosion device with
highly used highly enriched uranium in
the implosion device but a much simpler
way to go and this would be the nuclear
terrorism lecture would be to use this
gun assembly so most countries that have
nuclear weapons today actually pursued
both of these and in the United States
we did that in the Manhattan Project
okay so with that as the premier then
let me just say that North Korea has
mastered the entire plutonium fuel cycle
fuel cycle meaning everything from the
time you dig it out of the ground you
mine it and by the way they have
significant quantities of uranium ore in
North Korea none in South Korea but
quite a bit in North Korea so they know
how to mine it millet convert it and
then make fuel the type of reactors that
they chose the build that called gas
cooled graphite moderated reactors
they're patterned after ones that the
Brits build in the early 1950s the first
one of which was the Calder Hall reactor
turns out the benefits of this type of
reactor is you can feed in natural
uranium you don't have to enrich it a
little bit first as you do with light
water reactors so that means the North
Korean since they did this on their own
I mean they copied the call to Hall
reactor but they did it strictly on
their own with no more help at that time
from the Soviets from the Chinese from
nobody so they didn't need enrichment
they were able to make their own fuel
you use metallic fuel for these reactors
instead of
ramming fuels because you need higher
uranium density since all you have is
seven tenths of a percent of the fissile
isotope and so they know how to make
fuel second they build reactors they
finished one the small one five megawatt
electric that's very small doesn't
produce much electricity but it produces
one bombs worth of plutonium a year if
you can extract it and so that they've
had that reactor operating since 1986
off and on over the years they had a 50
megawatt within one or two years of
completion when they signed this
agreement with the Americans in nineteen
nineteen ninety four that was then
halted and I'll tell you later through
my visits I found out it's dead
it can't be resurrected they had a 200
megawatt electric reactor that actually
would have produced quite a bit of
electricity for North Korea that was
just in the beginning stages of
construction they halted that that's
also not salvageable today the back end
the reprocessing facility it's just a
complicated chemical engineering
facility will you deal with all of this
hot nucleus stuff that you've heard
about related to to Japan except in this
type of facility you handle it in hot
cells with remote handling where where
that radioactivity is essentially
separated from the workers they know how
to do that they patent that facility
after build after facility in Belgium
again they built it by themselves North
Koreans a terrific engineers they built
this whole complex then by themselves so
that's a young beyond nuclear complex so
what do they have mmm it's sort of the
bottom line slide on the basis of my
visits and my discussions with the North
Koreans and on the basis of looking with
Google Earth as to whether there's a
plume coming out of the cooling power of
the of the youngin reactor we pretty
much know how many days it's operated we
can estimate what power level they
operate at and we know what sort of
reactor they have what fuel they put in
and you can calculate how much plutonium
they've made so this is actually the
part we know the best and then some of
the holes they filled in in my personal
discussions with them so they have today
24 to 42 kilograms sort of four to eight
bombs worth so and they indeed do have
the bomb because they exploded to him
one didn't work so well the second one
as far as I'm concerned was successful
now my view is that that even that since
they've had let's say one-and-a-half
tests the bombs that they have are most
likely primitive bombs in other words
like our Nagasaki bomb which had to be
delivered you know is huge ten thousand
pounds had to be delivered by a plane
it's very difficult to miniaturize these
things and it takes nuclear testing
takes computational capability and I
just don't believe they've had the
opportunity to get there yet now they
have no plutonium in the pipeline even
though they could still run that reactor
they've chosen not to run the reactor
it's an interesting part of the North
Korean story they shut it down the last
time in July of 2007 they've not
restarted it however they could again
based on my visits it would take about
six months to get their reactor up and
operating and the reprocessing facility
it's in cold standby it's in standby but
they could operate it also now uranium
enrichment we've suspected them of doing
uranium enrichment over decades but we
never really had the smoking gun and
that was the story of my last visit in
November of 2010 they finally decided to
show me what they've done in uranium
enrichment quite frankly I was expecting
not much sort of a couple of dozen
centrifuges maybe in a garage somewhere
and instead I'll show you that they now
have a small industrial scale centrifuge
facility and I'll tell you what it's for
and then I'll also tell you what the
potential problems are I mentioned that
here is even though they've built this
current for civil
that I saw to make low-enriched uranium
that stuff that goes into light water
reactors sort of three to five percent
enriched in the isotope 235 instead of
eighty to ninety which is what you would
knew they use for bombs and so we don't
know about the highly enriched uranium
weapons because this is a new twist that
we simply didn't expect for them to have
come this far
I will there be another nuclear test
when we were just working in the
plutonium world I thought maybe one more
but as you can see with that much
plutonium it if they would do six tests
we'd be finished you know the problem
would be solved I thought they might do
one more now if they make highly
enriched uranium we may see a highly
enriched uranium test so we're not sure
so how do we know all this stuff if I
hope that shows up okay that you can
least see photos from my six first trips
to North Korea I've taken seven
altogether in 2005 and what's really
interesting in working with the North
Koreans as you might imagine they only
let me in if they feel that I can do
them some good I mean because otherwise
why let me into their nuclear facilities
so for each of these visits they've had
a very special message now you might
wonder how do I get to go to North Korea
well I don't go as a US government
official it's what we call track to
diplomacy non official non-governmental
now I worked for Los Alamos for 34 years
but one of the beauties of working for
Los Alamos I was actually an employee of
University of California because it ran
the laboratory for the government so I
was never a government employee but the
North Koreans now I have a good link to
the US government I mean that's what
they want to use so they sent me a
message with each of these visits the
first one and the last one were the most
fascinating ones the first one I
actually show a picture as you've heard
about spent fuel pools at Fukushima
Daiichi actually this is the spent fuel
pool and we're looking down into the
spent fuel pool in jung-hyun because
they were trying to tell me that the
fuel rods that used to be stored in
there that held the put down
that's been sitting there for eight
years is now gone and they've extracted
the plutonium it wasn't quite that easy
to figure out but the mana line was one
when they showed me their reprocessing
facility sat me down in the conference
room then they said well dr. Hecker
we've now shown you our deterrent and I
said wait a minute you know I mean you
showed me the reactor reprocessing
facility looks like the the fuel rods
are gone you know you have that but you
know I haven't seen anything they said
well how would you like to see our
product and I'm in the conference room
now right and I said you mean the
plutonium and they said well yes I said
well I've worked at Los Alamos for 34
years sure bring it in and so they did
into the conference room a metal box
about this big and I opened it up they
opened it up inside was a white wooden
box they slid off the top and there sat
two jars - marmalade jars believe it or
not screw on tops and inside was a
plutonium powder and the other one had
plutonium metal they said that's our
product so I finally wound up I I didn't
have any detectors I had nothing with me
because I figured I'd never get in if I
bring anything so I had my eyes and
finally I asked him if I could hold it
because plutonium is very heavy the
density of unalloyed petroleum is 20
grams per CC and it's also should be
slightly warm because it is radioactive
and when I tell my students that story
you know they all say oh my god you know
you held it Kryptonian how come he's
still alive well for those I'm sure you
know the petroleum is only alpha active
and so as long as you have it in a
plastic bag or in a jar or whatever it
doesn't get you you don't want to
breathe it or inhale it I'm inhale it or
I digest it and so the plutonium was
okay and it was plutonium and so each
one of these visits they had a certain
message that they wanted to get across
and over these seven years I've been
able to visit their nuclear facilities
four times talk to their nuclear people
especially in each of those visits and
get a reasonably good sense of what they
have in the
in the plutonium program that was the
story in 2004 in 2007 which you see here
is actually a glove box and I'm in the
middle of that crew on the lower left to
actually see where they made the
plutonium and that was fascinating I
learned a lot just from going through
the petroleum laboratory the one on the
right they actually showed that they had
disabled most of their plutonium
facilities in 2008 which they did and
then we come to visit number 7 which was
just this last November and when I
arrived there they said we will convert
this Center you know from a plutonium
facility to light water reactor and
pilot enrichment facility so that's what
we're doing and then they also reminded
me they said you know no we said that in
2009 after again they had an altercation
this time with the Obama administration
they walked away from everything again
from the six-party talks the four
neighbors North Korea in the US and they
said we're going to do our own light
water reactor and that of course means
we have to actually do uranium
enrichment because that's what you need
for light water reactor fuel and they
said nobody believed us including you
dr. Hecker and so we're gonna show you
so they did so they first took me on the
left-hand side the arrow points to where
they were just beginning the
construction of the light water reactor
on the right-hand side the building with
the blue roof which interestingly enough
no one had picked up until that time it
was only after I told people I was in
this building that then when they looked
down with DigitalGlobe and they saw this
blue roof I said yeah that's the one
that's why I was and that's where the
uranium enrichment was being done so
with the light water reactor
particularly in in light of what
happened now in Japan and I wrote this
all before Japan ever happened I've
published several papers on my visit to
North Korea what I found and what
concerns me and this was one of my
biggest concerns when I saw how they
were constructing that small it's a
small light water reactor experimental
light
a reactor it would not meet us Western
safety standards the day way the way
that they were constructing this
concrete containment shell with a small
concrete mixer you know in the winter
time is just not the way to construct a
reactor they also did it with a whole
new reactor design team it's tough to
Forge that stainless steel it's even
tougher to go ahead and weld it in place
they did well with their old reactor but
this is very different different
technology and what I used to say the
Western world learned in fact the whole
world learned from the examples of Three
Mile Island and then Chernobyl and
nuclear power operators around the world
got together and said look we have to
run these things safely because
otherwise we will have no nuclear power
and they did they had a fantastic safety
record for all those years
then of course Fukushima Daiichi
happened you know where a natural
catastrophe was much beyond anything
that the system was designed for and the
one thing at least that I've learned
from that and that lessons learned will
yet to be drawn because of course the
situation is not yet completely
stabilized but one of the lessons is for
sure you have to have technical
expertise in country you know both the
authorities and the technical people
have to know what they're doing in terms
of emergency response you have to have
the right equipment available you know
I'm sure you've followed that you know
with the fire trucks the hoses the sea
salt spraying and all of these things
well let me I'm gonna give you examples
of North Korean preparedness for natural
disasters and it doesn't give you a lot
of faith so I was mostly concerned about
the safety of the reactor and I made
this viewgraph long before Japan one
could also be concerned that this light
water reactor could make plutonium but
it turns out it wouldn't make any sense
to make plutonium that way because they
already have a reactor that makes good
bomb-grade plutonium like water reactors
make bad bomb-grade plutonium and of
course what what they
have is they can say look we have a
light water reactor we need to enrich
because that's what we need to do for
nuclear energy and so that's what they
say this is a photo I took in August of
2007 as we were leaving young beyond
after it rained torrential rains all day
long and if you look carefully what you
see is on the other side of the river
there's a whole parade of people from
children to adults that are carrying
rocks and sand in dish pans up to the
road
to throw it on the road so that we could
get back out of there and back to
Pyongyang that was their emergency
relief and disaster management and it
turns out they lost several hundred
people in North Korea during that flood
they had about 50 centimeters of rain in
various parts of the country they lost
10% of their crops in essence because
they don't have much in terms of
emergency relief and disaster management
okay now just to give you a little bit
of what was associated with this
uranium-enrichment since it was a big
surprise in the middle on the right hand
side is ambassador lee gun the second in
charge of the of the six-party talks and
he said dr. Hecker you will have very
big news when you go to young beyond i
still didn't know what it was the big
news was something like this and i had
to make this up because they wouldn't
let me take any photos this time this is
a slightly doctored photo from one of
the u.s. centrifuge plants but that's in
essence what this centrifuge facility
looked like it was truly mind-boggling
you know about 2,000 centrifuges I
looked up from the second floor of an
observation a window and it's just this
beautiful rows of centrifuges three of
them in pairs and not only that but the
whole facility looked totally different
than all the other facilities at
Yongbyon the other facilities looks sort
of Soviet 50s or 60s style and just to
give you an example on the lower right
is the reactor control room that I
visited several times sort of Soviet
style
and what you see on the upper left is
actually flying a computer's flat
screens this was in kim ill sung
university library and the control room
of the centrifuge facility looked like
that not like the old control so had
four computers flat panel monitors LED
displays it was just ultra-modern I had
never seen anything like that in North
Korea okay so the centrifuge facility
I'll just go through this very quickly
because I'm sure most of you are not
interested in the details but they did
have two thousand centrifuges and and it
looked like they have what we call p2
sort of the second generation of
centrifuges turns out the faster you
spin these centrifuges the more
separation that you get and so you have
to use very high strength material so
they don't come apart the first
generation was aluminum second
generation is what we call marriage in
steel the third generation would
actually be carbon carbon composites so
their throughput is 8,000 kilograms
separative work units per year what does
that mean well it would mean they have
enough capacity to make the low enriched
uranium fuel for that little reactor the
problem is as I'll point out in just a
minute it's also enough to make one
bombs worth of highly enriched uranium
if they plummet that way and they had
previously told me over and over they
don't have a uranium enrichment program
but they do so in American diplomatic
circles you know what you saw as soon as
I came back the word was see they lied
and my answer was well of course they
lied I mean they've lied many times you
know and many countries lie of course in
that whole messy diplomatic process but
those diplomats in the u.s. that
actually worked with them that had
specifically heard we don't have uranium
enrichment well they do
for those of us in the proliferation
business the most interesting aspect is
how did they get it because unlike for
the reactors where I told you they made
them indigenously essentially they had
all the materials that they needed for
the enrichment they do not
all the materials they do not have all
the components and we believe they still
cannot make those today so they had to
purchase them from somewhere and they
did but it turns out there were plenty
of greedy European businessmen who were
willing to sell them things and the
Germans tried to sell them aluminium
alloys the Russians did sell them
aluminium alloys we don't know where
they got the marriage and steel most
likely from from the Russians again not
through legal necessarily legal barter
but they got him where did they get the
frequency inverters where did they get
the bearings where did they get many of
the other components well the same place
that AQ Khan the father of the Pakistani
bomb got him from all over the world
through a very complicated procurement
ring it looks like the North Koreans
have run a very similar ring and in fact
AQ Khan himself actually helped out the
North Koreans we know that because
President Musharraf in his memoir
actually said he gave him a starter kit
it was that starter kit that I was
expecting to see but instead much like
the North Koreans have done with it
everything else they take whatever they
can get and then they build things
themselves and they do it quite well
there's also I used to be concerned
about possible cooperation with Iran but
from what I saw North Korea's ahead of
the Iranian centrifuges have played with
centrifuges since 1987 and they still
don't have the separative work capacity
that the North Koreans did that this is
just to show you that what the North
Koreans told me is that oh yes of course
we have uranium enrichment now we just
started this program last year and it
turns out that's just not possible you
know it takes years and years and years
and it most likely they've been added
for decades but the building that they
put it in and I've got this split photo
the one with the blue roof is up now and
it looked like where you see it before
where I show the fuel rod fab facility
that's the building I was in a couple of
years ago and it didn't look anything
like this so they got it it moved it in
but what it means is they had a
centrifuge facility operating someplace
else
and then they duplicated it and moved it
in here within the last year's time so
what's the threat from the centrifuge
program itself it's required for LWR so
they actually have a good story you know
we tried to get an LWR from you the
Americans you wouldn't give it to us we
decided to make our own and if we make
an L WR we now need to enrich and so we
did well but the problem is the same
technology also then can be used to make
highly enriched uranium and that's the
Iran problem that's in essence Iran has
justified its program since it was
discovered in 2002 that they need to do
it for their own light water reactor
program the problem is that we also
suspect them of being capable to go to
highly enriched uranium so those two
thousand centrifuges could make enough
reactor fuel or they could make 40
kilograms of 90% enriched now let's also
look for the most part you know we here
in the United States that all of our
diplomatic attempts with North Korea has
been totally unsuccessful it turns out I
don't agree with that because if we
would have left the North Koreans alone
in the early 1990s continue on their
path to build all three of those
reactors that I showed you they could
have a couple of hundred bombs today not
a handful that's a huge huge difference
so what did they not get they never
finished those bigger reactors they
could have a hundred plus weapons and
they've wanted electricity and they got
essentially nothing if you add up all
the electricity since 1986
today they produced by nuclear power
it's 23 days worth of an LWR equivalent
so you could say if you look at this
through North Korean glasses you know we
work with these Americans and we got
nothing now we did get a handful of
bombs and of course for the regime so
why did they get the bomb well why do
countries get the bomb it's usually
three reasons for security domestic
reasons and international reasons secure
it no question is the driving force you
know we're still at war technically with
North Korea
the war was only stopped by an armistice
in 1953 we have no peace treaty and
every visit that I've had you know I'm
reminded of the hostile policies the
United States through at North Korea and
so when they explained why we had to get
the bomb of course you know it's easy
for them to say it's your fault it's the
Americans fault your hostile policy we
feel threatened by you and of course
they have a few things that point to you
know like Saddam Hussein for example and
the lesson for them was you know he
didn't have the bomb and he's gone there
was a very interesting newspaper blurb
from the North Koreans referring to the
Gaddafi situation in Libya essentially
saying he shouldn't have given up this
nuclear stuff in 2003 look what's
happening to him now start any rate of
course they turn these things you know
in the direction that the regime wants
him to be the domestic reasons once they
got the bomb then of course for domestic
reasons you know these people in North
Korea if you compare them to South Korea
I mean they really are destitute and so
they have to sacrifice in their daily
lives they reminded daily they have to
sacrifice well if you have an enemy and
if you got to build a nuclear weapon to
keep that enemy out so that justifies
the sacrifice and then internationally
that bomb has bought them an enormous
that handful of bombs you know they're
not much of a nuclear arsenal but it has
kept the u.s. out and it does bring us
you know - and the rest of the
bargaining table so it's used as a
bargaining chip so now we know they have
the bomb we know they have some uranium
enrichment so what does it really mean I
personally don't lose a lot of sleep
over the fact that they have the bomb
they've had it at least since 2003 they
haven't done anything crazy with those
bombs from their standpoint it's a
deterrent to keep the United States out
so the threat from those handful of
bombs I think currently is low if they
use the bomb it's all over I mean the
one thing the regime warrants is regime
preservation and they know if they use
the bomb anywhere anytime it's the end
of the regime so why would they want to
use
now if they have a lot more bombs then I
start worrying more and particularly so
if they would be able to make a lot of
highly enriched uranium which I think
they're currently not able to do that
that is to make a lot so if they have a
hundred bombs I'm more concerned but
miscalculation or accidents can
certainly happen when you when you play
with bombs accidents can happen of
course as we find out in many areas
uranium enrichment I used to not be
worried about it now I worry about it if
they have the capacity to make a lot of
highly enriched uranium what I worry
mostly about from North Korea is export
in other words you know there's one
threat of having this nuclear stuff in
the hands of the government it's much
worse yet if it gets out of the hands of
the government into the hands of Iran
into the hands of terrorists and so we
know that the North Korean cell missile
technology all over the world
particularly the countries that we're
not terribly fond of we also have
examples where they have sold nuclear
technologies I'm gonna give you one
example of that but sort of difficult to
do plutonium export the build reactors
although they did one in Syria it would
be much easier to do highly enriched
uranium technology or perhaps the cell
highly enriched uranium because you
could use the justification use highly
enriched uranium and research reactors
and so it's actually a civilian export
not a bomb export so this this was the
situation of North Korea let me first
say of this concrete box appearing in
this in the Syrian desert doesn't look
like much although if I one of my one of
my Los Alamos colleagues uses Sketchup 6
and he does beautiful things with all of
these aerials and he reconstructs what
was actually in that building but the
Israeli suspected that to be a reactor
and they had good reasons to suspect it
they bomb the reactor and I'll show you
a picture of that one of the few you can
get an open source with Google Earth
and then it turns out the Syrians
cleaned it up case the Syrians of course
have denied that that was a reactor and
they cleaned it up so fast and they
still haven't allowed the international
inspectors full access but this thing
was a reactor the reactors on the left
that's the concrete box on the right is
actually what it looked like after the
Israelis bombed it and when you analyze
that closely it turns out all the
dimensions are just right it looks just
like the North Korean reactor the
Israelis also got a hold of somebody's
laptop and showed this reactor under
construction before it came the concrete
box and it's clearly a gas graphite
reactor pattern just like the North
Korean and so there's very little
questions that the North Korean built
this reactor for the Syrians we still
don't know why exactly the Syrians
wanted it who the customer was it's
another great proliferation puzzle what
I thought you'd get a kick out of and
again my colleague at Los Alamos does
these beautiful things a combination of
Google Earth wiki's blogs Facebook's
everything and he pulls photos from
every word together and then make
stories and one of the neat stories is
remember this concrete box that's the
box on the lower left the other three
pictures are three four three
photographs that tourists took of
Byzantine fortresses in the area and
even though the scale is somewhat
different you look at that similarity
and you say and now we understood why
they build something like that there was
no anti-aircraft around that reactor
there were no big fences there was
nothing it's just sad out there and they
specifically wanted to make sure it just
sort of blended into the countryside but
when they put the the pipes the water
pipes down the Euphrates River that's
when these Whaley said okay now we think
you know they're gonna pipe up water and
it was wiped out so we worried about the
North Koreans doing more in nuclear
technologies with other countries so
will they give up the bomb in my opinion
not in the near future because it's
their ticket for a regime survival and
unless we're willing to take military
action we
we're not we're not we can't force it to
give it up we've tried to squeeze North
Korea but it turns out China doesn't
want to squeeze North Korea they have a
very different relationship not that the
Chinese like the North Koreans having
bombs
you know they prefer the North Koreans
not to have bombs but they're not
willing to make the regime come to its
knees in order for them to give up the
bomb and that's where we stand today so
without the Chinese you can't force them
to give up the mam so what you have to
do is for the time being unfortunately
we have to live with it so we should
make sure that we reduce the risks and
then develop a comprehensive solution so
we have to deal with North Korea the way
it is not the way we'd like it to be we
got to work with China particularly but
also of course with South Korea because
in the end you know that's the same
people it's the same country but we've
got to contain the threat even though
eventually we'd like a denuclearized
Korean Peninsula so what I've been
trying to sort of market in Washington
is to me what makes the most sense it is
what I call three noes with one yes the
way to reduce the risk is no more bombs
no better bombs no export if we could
get the North Koreans to agree on that
and particularly get the Chinese to
agree to put the squeeze on the North
Koreans not at this point to give up the
bomb but at least to stop increasing the
threat that no better bombs means no
testing so again if you look with Google
Earth you know you can see that they're
preparing a third test site you know the
holes there we don't know exactly when
they're gonna do it or what they're
gonna do but we'd rather not have them
do that test and so no test no more
bombs they're already not producing more
plutonium now we'd have to make sure
they're not producing more highly
enriched uranium the one yes is you know
it's the insecurity that drives them and
so this whole issue of normalization of
relations what actually needs to be done
and there's no single piece of paper you
can sign with the North Korean this is a
process that's gonna take a number of
years so now Kris if I may maybe I'll
run through five minutes of
just a photo tour through North Korea of
course when we taught and it's not it's
important because we see such a
different view on US television today
but it's also important that if you're
gonna try to solve the nuclear issue
you know we techies always think the
solution is technical but the solution
here isn't technical the technology has
to inform the policy but you have to
understand the people you have to
understand the history you have to
understand the culture in order to
understand the politics to understand
whether there's any chance of coming to
a resolution so I focus on the people
and of course in North Korea the people
starts with the Kim family and
particularly here the third son Kim
jong-un and so everything that we see
revolves around the Kim family but on
the right hand side here's another
family just an ordinary Pyongyang family
not Pyongyang of course is much better
off than most of the rest of the country
but it's a mother taking her three
little kids probably to kindergarten so
they are real people Kim jong-un you
know is being prepared a lot of people
have said he's being moved into into the
leadership that's not true
he's being prepared for the leadership
of North Korea in a very clever fashion
I think by his father in the middle you
see the trio you know from Kim il-sung
to Kim jong-il the Kim jong-un before
last September of 2009 of that see
September of 2010 we essentially knew
nothing about Kim jong-un and of course
in terms of people and incidents we also
hear you know in March of 26 it turns
out 2010 when we thought we might be
able to reach some sort of
accommodations again with North Koreans
they apparently sank a South Korean ship
this Chonan things went back into a
crisis once again and then we were
emerging from that crisis when the North
Koreans again allowed a number of these
tract to visits including my own
November of last year and then two days
after
made my findings public then we had the
shelling of the young peon Island and
again trying to understand what exactly
was happening and what do these things
have to do with how the politics are
playing out internally within North
Korea and the politics between the North
and the South I won't spend any time on
those but just you know to remind you
that the threats are still there and
certainly the rhetoric is there of the
North Korean army saying that they are
ready to launch a sacred war of Korean
style based on the nuclear deterrent
that's what we must avoid so for that
let's look at the people this is what we
typically see and it's true
North Korea is a repressive state red
led by a repressive government they have
death camps forced labor camps torture
facilities those exist in North Korea
but what also exists are real people and
I go visit typically with the embassies
of different countries and by the way
North Korea you know it's called a
Hermit Kingdom the most isolated state
in the whole wide world
they have diplomatic relations with 144
countries around the world I've run into
a single German woman tourists in North
Korea you know just going there to be a
tourist I've run into Italian tourists I
stopped at the embassies of Sweden
Poland Czech Republic etc in North Korea
this is a letter that was sent to me by
one of the Swiss workers and I thought
it was interesting you know because she
says look life does remain difficult and
she says you know they that tight-lip
they sort of have three compartments in
their heads one for the party
one for survival strategy and one for
his her very own thoughts and she said
you know I often feel the certain
heaviness out in the countryside about
at the same time pride toughness in a
dose of nationalism that's there among
the people so in most part the people
have figured out how to live within that
system and how to get on with life in
spite of the fact that life isn't very
pretty especially compared to South
Korea so she says you know what a life
when will it get better
okay now for the photo to her you know
these are real people and it's important
to take a look at those young ladies you
know they are so cute they are real
people you know and they're gonna grow
up someday and they're gonna live in
North Korea and we hope they live in a
better place look at this young lady
their kiosks all over North Korea now
particularly in Pyongyang but I even saw
him out in the countryside where they
actually do have food the students it's
always a pleasure to go visit their
schools they're doing a physics
experiment here
and this young lady right here was
writing an essay on Thomas Alva Edison
okay this is North Korea yes she was
writing an essay on Thomas Alva Edison
Computers dance we're at the School of
Foreign Studies February it was colder
inside the building than outside the
building but nevertheless they were
studying studying English life goes on
in in Pyongyang of course particularly
people tell you you know there are no
people there are no cars there no
traffic but they are some there are
signs of market activity are all over
North Korea and the markets have gone up
and down over the years because as soon
as they become successful then the
government the government becomes scared
and tries to shut them down
soon as it shuts them down the people
try to figure out you know where they
can actually get something so they build
them back up and so it's sort of
oscillates over time the Chinese what
the Chinese would really like to do they
say look why don't you do what we did 30
years ago you know and sort of let it
let the strings out on the free market
but the North Korean regime is much too
scared of that so it's very careful
Arirang is this fantastic gymnastic
dance performance a hundred thousand
performers in what they call their
Mayday Stadium I already showed you this
of the unpreparedness for disaster this
last visit was kimchi time for those of
you who know Koreans you know kimchi is
very important it was cabbage everywhere
it was time to actually take care and
pickle the cabbage they're very
determined people again if you think
they can't do anything because of what
we see on television if they want to
build a university of music they'll
the University of Music and they did in
just a few years time and I was inside
it's just absolutely spectacular so
where the regime wants to put its money
you can get things done that's the
concert hall of a concert I attended
again North Korea being cut off I
celebrated the 92nd anniversary of the
independence of Poland in Pyongyang last
November and they had two polish artists
and then they had this young Korean lady
playing Chopin and it was absolutely
beautiful just beautiful their factories
you know we say they can't do anything
I'm a metallurgist by training this was
a great wire factory they have textile
factories and interestingly enough we
got there anyway
we thought we heard American rock music
you know which you didn't quite believe
our ears so when we asked our our guide
told us well we asked the women what
they wanted to hear and they said
American rock music so that's what they
were playing oops
they have very fancy textile machines
these are from Germany lots of activity
this is a tree farm
okay Kim Chuck Kim jong-il goes out and
he does these on the spot site visits
and they must have gone out they told me
that there were hills there and he said
let there be apple trees and indeed two
years later there are two million apple
trees from Italy they actually came and
helped them plant those and they were
already productive in their first year
very impressive sight swimming pools Kim
il-sung University it's as fancy an
Olympic sized swimming pool as I've ever
seen as you can tell I wasn't dressed
quite right but not only the pool but
water slides in the water slides aren't
good enough and he is massaging this is
Kim il-sung University you know very
prestigious university obviously for the
high end of the political spectrum for
North Korea but they tell me 10,000
students were trained here at Kim
il-sung University and take advantage of
their elibrary
oops and actually in this case
and my colleague John Lewis was the guy
who took me to North Korea in the first
place looked to say is that really an HP
soft touchscreen and it was and here
they were in foreign studies and they
actually had these students speak and
debate each other while we were there
and it was amazing every child in North
Korea has to take English from the third
grade on and by the time they got here
and in this university of foreign
studies they spoke very good American
English actually not not British English
so what does the future hold as I'm
drawing to an end you know that Seoul in
a market in Seoul and obviously to have
such an enormous disparity across you
know one line one political demarcation
can't hold out forever
oops people tell you there are no lights
you know one of the favorite Google
Earth's is Vice President Cheney used to
show it the darkness in North Korea and
the lit up in in South Korea there more
lights times are changing some of their
buildings are actually lit at night
there's also this this hotel that they
build some 20-some years ago it was a
concrete structure shown on the left
never finished 104 stories back two
years ago they started beginning putting
glass on there an Egyptian company was
finishing it up in this last November it
was actually done it is one impressive
impressive building so again if you look
at this from a North Korean standpoint
to look up in the city and see this
impressive thing actually you know some
progress seems to be happening in
addition they tell you there's no
traffic there's not only traffic there's
some taxi service and if you could see
this and look closely that taxi is a
Ford Focus taxi okay this is in
Pyongyang North Korea and then we
finally started seeing some phone booths
not the Clark Kent sort of phone booths
but at least some phone booths in 2009
and so we said you know things are
starting to change but the real coup de
Gras came on this visit and hopefully
you can see this on the diagram and it's
a young lady
talking on a cellphone and the same on
the lower right hand a person talking
and a cellphone it turns out since two
years ago they now three hundred fifty
thousand cell phones in North Korea they
have three separate services it's all
run by the Egyptians also Egyptians and
North Koreans are very good friends and
so eventually that will catch up with
them now I'll show you for the last and
begin because of the nature of the
lighting in here I'm not sure how well
it'll show up but every now and then you
catch a picture like that and here's one
I caught in Pyongyang subway I was
coming out and walking down was a young
man with a light based jacket it was
November had the red bandana for the
revolution everything looked normal
except until I looked at his head and
that ladies and gentlemen is a baseball
cap worn backwards with a Nike swoosh
this is Pyongyang when that kids gets to
be 21 years old they're gonna have a
hard time keeping him down on the farm
and so let me end with saying you know
if they are swoosh there has to be some
hope even for North Korea okay thank you
ladies and gentlemen
thank you sig can you come up and ask
the questions up here has a little bit
of a hearing problem when a Simmons
speakers yeah it turns out I have great
difficulty hearing especially in you
know I love you Google wide open
environments but they play havoc with
with my hearing okay so if you could
come up that would be great so I really
enjoyed the talk I have a question about
South Korea and Japan the closest
neighbors besides China so are the
experts in South Korea and Japan as
informed as you are or more informed and
what is the official position with
respect to the nuclear what should be
done with respect to the nuclear problem
in North Korea okay if I want to make
sure that I understand so first is what
did the experts think in South Korea and
Japan as far as a nuclear situation and
then what do the governments think in
terms of what should be done so as far
as the experts go it turns out they have
no access and that actually goes for the
Chinese I stop and talk to the Chinese
every time I go in and out of out of
North Korea and I talked to their
nuclear people and we compare notes and
for the most part the Chinese greatly
underestimated the North Korean
capabilities and continue to do so even
today the South Koreans and the Japanese
for the most part just also have very
little information and so as it turns
out I'm very popular in both countries
you know I've appeared on television
shows they read all the stuff because
it's one of the few independent things
that actually gets information there we
compare notes I go to South Korea I
haven't been to Japan for a while but
people have come in and seen me the
analysis one of the interesting aspects
of doing this sort of track to diplomacy
one of the things I like to accomplish
with it is to get the best possible
understanding of the nuclear situation
in the hands of the public not only in
the hands of the intelligence agencies
or the top politicians so that the
public actually has an understanding of
what we're dealing with and that you get
a better picture out
instead of having the politicians use it
you know they twisted in whatever their
own direction is and so since they have
let me in I think there's a much more
uniform appraisal on the highly enriched
uranium there was one very good analyst
in Washington that just published a
paper right before I went in said
suspecting that they had at least pilots
scaling R&amp;amp;D it turns out he was right
but generally we have a pretty good
common understanding and analysis that
includes Japan and South Korea the
Russians and the Chinese have
underestimated them but it's pretty
close as far as the governments are
concerned the the Japanese and I'm just
gonna you know tell it the way it is
have not been very helpful on this on
the North Korean situation and for the
most part is they have focused on what's
called the abductees issue you know Kim
jong-il and and and his honchos managed
to abduct the number of Japanese years
ago and he's not been willing to fully
resolve it and so every discussion with
the Japanese almost starts and ends with
the abductee issue and so it's been the
Japanese have been essentially the
toughest in the negotiations because the
North Koreans have not come clean on the
abductee issue by the way when I
discussed this with the North Koreans
they essentially say look we have no
sympathy for the Japanese after what
they did after what they did to us you
know in the 40 years of occupation who
were they to complain but so that's a
big gap in South Korea the the previous
governments practiced what they call the
sunshine policy and that is to reach out
to the North Koreans and try to figure
out a way to sort of move forward get
them to take some market measures they
helped them out a lot but I think they
also wound up paying off the North
Koreans a lot you know their reports
that for the one summit that was held
between North and South that the the
South actually paid the North Koreans a
lot of money and
the table for that the current
government is a very conservative
government and they said we're not
paying them under the table anymore and
so they've played it very tough and so
right now US policy to a large extent is
driven by the fact that we want to be in
lockstep with South Korea South Korea is
being very tough and saying we want
North Korea to take steps verifiable
steps to its denuclearization before we
rien
and so as a result actually US policy
now for the last two years it's been
term strategic patience it really hasn't
gotten us very far with the North
Koreans because we've refused to engage
them directly because they've not made
any moves so it's verifiable
denuclearization so I would say Japan
and South Korea both on the side of
playing it slow making sure that they
denuclearize first before we take
additional steps so with any other
technology I think nuclear weapons will
be available to everyone sooner or later
why are we so focused on
non-proliferation using all the
technologies that we had in this world
eight firearms it becomes available to
everyone
sooner or later so Korea will come up
with its own nuclear bomb and everyone
else will come up with its own nuclear
bomb sooner or later when they get
smarter or more technologically advanced
why are we so focused particularly on
non-proliferation and stopping them from
failing upon everyone else in the region
have it anyway okay well then it's
essentially asking why are we so focused
on nuclear proliferation as such right
because the technology
certainly the knowledge has spread all
over and so the issue then becomes is
the world less safe if more countries
have their finger on the nuclear trigger
as such if they have nuclear weapons and
have their finger on the nuclear trigger
the there there is disagreement there
are some people who say the world will
actually be safer because deterrence
works I personally think that that's not
the case
I personally think the more countries
you have with nuclear weapons even
though the governments themselves might
be more restrained the fact that you
then have both the nuclear weapons and
you had fissile materials let's say
reasonably ready for nuclear weapons
into more hands does make it a more
dangerous place and particularly to me
the single biggest threat is actually
not the threat of governments having
nuclear weapons or nuclear materials but
nuclear materials getting out of the
hands of governments into the hands of
terrorists where there will be little in
terms of deterrence of being able to
control that the terrorists so I
personally still think it's a good idea
to focus very hard on trying to limit
the number of governments having nuclear
weapons and having fissile materials
probably the best example to give now is
essentially the only place in the world
that I think there is the potential of a
nuclear exchange in the that's a
reasonably near future five to ten years
is India Pakistan we'd be much better
off if India and Pakistan did not have
nuclear weapons and you know I can paint
the scenario for you I'll just do it
quickly because you raised a very
important question
India has as substantially superior
conventional weapons and a much larger
army than Pakistan Pakistan has
supported over the years a number of
terrorist organization including one
that perpetrated the Mumbai bombing and
if such an episode would happen again
you know it's not clear that
wouldn't do with the United Stated with
Afghanistan is going in and saying okay
you Pakistan if you're not gonna take
care of your own terrorist organization
we're gonna do it and when we do that
the only way that Pakistan might be able
to push the Indians back is with nuclear
weapons Pakistan right now is building
plutonium reactors production reactors
in order to make smaller nuclear weapons
to repel an Indian attack and so and the
Indians are not helping matters either
by saying that they have to develop a
submarine
delivered weapon capability for nuclear
weapons so when you see that sort of
thing just between two countries and
then if you have you know a two-body
problem you change that to a three or
four body problem III just think the
world would be a much more dangerous
place with more nuclear weapons yes like
to come up by all means
he said nuclear weapons in government
hunt is a little safer than controllable
people's hands yeah right but do you
have any comment on when about what
would happen when eventually not regime
collapses yes yes so the question is you
know since I had talked about to be
nuclear weapons being in government and
and not in government hands what's the
danger if North Korea collapses so I I
agree that's a substantial danger and
that's also I think one of the reasons
why the Chinese I actually do not want
that government to collapse and so to me
when I talk about accidents and
miscalculations is one of the dangers
that's precisely what I'm talking about
and so I would be very concerned at that
time if the North Korean regime
collapses if that collapse isn't some
sort of an orderly process and most of
the time these collapses aren't is what
happens to the nuclear weapons and so
yes in North Korea right now that's
probably the single most important
danger of the nuclear weapons themselves
so I I have no good answer for that all
I can tell you that is
we can't risk I have two questions the
first one is when you meet North Koreans
do you see a difference of opinion
between scientists civilian scientists
and the military the second question is
where where are these people educated
these scientists are they educated in
North Korea are they educated by the
previous generation that was educated in
Soviet Union where are they educated so
the the first question related to the
scientists in in North Korea let's say
are they strictly military or as a
civilian military first of all I've had
very limited access to the scientists
and to the people of North Korea I've
traveled all over the world I've been to
Russia 42 times instead of seven times
in North Korea I've been in Russian
homes I've met their scientists I've
been in China I've been in India in
North Korea I meet no ordinary people
and the scientists that I've met are
always in the presence of a handler from
from the the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
so it's very difficult to draw a good
picture however in terms of putting the
pieces together the and I've asked him
this question you know and so I've had
interesting discussions in essence what
the North Koreans do it young beyond it
is the the scientists are trained at
their universities not another
universities Kim il-sung and Kim Chuck
and so forth they're trained at their
universities they then bring them in to
young Beyond and they have a Technical
Institute than Jung Byung where they
continue to train him further it's
actually a lot like the Indian model
where they bring in people into into the
Bhabha Atomic Research Center and so
forth and then continue to train them
there and then they stay there
essentially for a lifetime and and the
mission at Yongbyon has been a dual
purpose mission they were interested in
nuclear energy but the primary mission
all
has been the bomb and just if you look
at the way that they have dealt with the
nuclear complex for example in terms of
their health physics practices you know
everything around Jung Byung is just
contaminated as can be not one of the
lessons that one learns respect that
Japan you know you know how to measure
the most minor amounts of radioactivity
there's a lot of contamination around
young beyond hasn't bothered me going
there because it's not a health hazard
but it's a mess
they do that because they feel they're
at war so they're really pushing their
nuclear weapons program most but their
scientists look at both and so right now
they have their scientists designing a
light water reactor so they're doing
civilian stuff and then their weapons
designers I've not met any of their
specific weapons designers so it's not
that different from from an india from a
u.s. program where the civilian and the
military you know sort of merge together
in terms of their training it is all
in-house in North Korea so put the
pretty pictures that you showed how much
of it was did you really trust or how
much what was it would you suspect was
stage-managed
like children talking about Thomas Alva
Edison how much of the pretty pictures
that you showed were real or would you
suspect were staged managed by the
regime I'm so I'm sorry I couldn't quite
understand because my hearing um so what
you're asking so I showed all these
photos so how realistic are
representative are those right so in
Pyongyang is not representative of the
rest of North Korea it's like going to
Moscow and saying that you saw Russia
you know there's so much more to Russia
than just Moscow and it's the same here
so first of all everybody in Pyongyang
you know tends to be better off than out
in the countryside
so first of all it's biased in that
direction I show all of these photos in
order to actually show a contrast to
what you normally see on television
however I have also been out in the
countryside and when you go to a young
Byung you get out into the countryside I
have lots of those photos also I have
photos of people you know individuals
dragging carts with bricks and concrete
on them you know by hand of oxen going
through the fields because out in the
countryside you have much less equipment
but I've been out there in their
combines and I visited places I've seen
people I visited the city of sati one
which is down to its the border
considerable distance away from
Pyongyang and again you just look there
you watch and you see there's much more
activity there's much more industrial
activity than you would expect and so to
answer your question - slanted toward
showing the better side of North Korea
and the news media usually shows the
concentration camps and other things and
the real truth is in between I think the
main message is I grew up when I was a
child in Austria after the after the
Second World War and I grew up living in
barracks and we had nothing but my
parents sort of had figured out you know
how to live in that environment and I as
a kid was a happiest kid in the whole
world I see a lot of that actually in
North Korea I see the kids playing
soccer you know I out on the dirt field
that's what I used to do so they sort of
figure out now the problem is that for
the 1990s they had in addition to being
cut off from from from Russia
essentially not getting much help from
China they had devastating floods and
then also droughts and so in the 1990s
the North Korean economy was just
decimated and that was really a time
when they say you know perhaps up to a
million people starve situation is much
better today than it was then and just
in the seven years I've gone there
it's just improved each time and so one
of the messages if we're waiting for
this regime to fall by itself it isn't
gonna do it very soon that's one more
high dynastic regimes seem to be quite
difficult for the West to deal with I
think because the objectives of their
governments are very different from the
objectives of our governments but it
seems a part of the message of what
you've been saying is that dealing with
Western democracies and particularly
presidential democracies is very
difficult if you're a country taking a
long term view because there can be an
election and suddenly all policies
change things you were relying on an
hour false I wonder if you could comment
on this you know what things what the
situation situation is like from the
perspective of North Korea having to
deal with the United States so I agree
very much with with your comment of just
the difficulties of these different
systems you know not only the politics
but the culture in history so for
example just for the u.s. to deal with
China on the issue of North Korea it's
just so different you know the Chinese
have this very long-term view they're
not bothered by the next election and
the u.s. North Korea policy in my
opinion is mostly driven by domestic
politics there are certain things that
we could and in my opinion should do
which would have us take some risks with
the North Korean but we can't do it
because of domestic politics I actually
another version
of one of my North Korea talks I
actually show what happened in three
successive u.s. administrations in terms
of North Korea action and policy first
was clinton then george w bush and now
obama if you were sitting on the North
Korean side and you looked at that and
he said my god you know I don't know
what to do with these Americans and
that's actually what happened you know
in in the Clinton administration my
colleague bill Perry who was former
Secretary of Defense who might teach
with now at Stanford he believes we came
within three months of solving the North
Korea problem because the Clinton
administration sort of worked up through
this and Madeleine Albright actually
went to North Korea and met with Kim
jong-il President Clinton was scheduled
to go the North Korea but time ran out
the North Korean then were waiting for
us to continue that process instead you
know whether you like Bush
administration or not the fact of the
matter is they thought this agreed
framework was fatally flawed and tried
to do everything from the beginning to
kill it and so North Koreans hung around
for about two years trying to figure out
you know when when is this stuff gonna
continue and it didn't and so they
changed so then what's interesting Bush
administration came around the last two
years to reach back out to the North
Koreans but then the North Koreans were
playing it's sort of stand back and then
the most dramatic transition was when
the Obama administration came in I was
there right afterwards we were expecting
the North Koreans you know to reach out
and in fact as you remember President
Obama says I will reach out my hand if
you unclench your fists it turns out
they not only clench their fists but
they hit him right between the eyeballs
and they did a long-range missile test
and followed with a nuclear test and so
then they decided after the previous
switch of administration this time
they're not taking any chances and so
yeah you're absolutely right and you
know this is where the political
scientists and one of the beauties I
should have said
the Center for International Security
and Cooperation at Stanford is we bring
all of these folks together the nuclear
guys like myself and people who really
understand history politics and
everything at which you have to
understand in order to understand
nuclear so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
