thank you for having me here
my name is Michael : I work at the
University of Kent in Canterbury in
England in the southeast corner of
England pretty much opposite the channel
tunnels we can can look over to France
from there and I've only only arrived
here in the US last night so I'm still
out of my timezone but I think this this
time isn't too bad I if the if it hits
me in the middle of my talk that I
suddenly get tired I'll just drag on to
the end I want to talk to you today
about the topic that's on the screen
they're already teaching kids to code so
I want to talk a bit about what we do to
to teach programming to kids in this
case happens to be Java and that is
maybe one of the things to talk about as
well but it's a good or a bad thing I
will spend my time doing doing mostly
software demo so I I will show you a
system called greenfoot that we that we
use a teaching and first of all I'll
give you an introduction there are the
typical a few slides for the background
and then I do the demo and then I
thought I'll skip all that and I do
mostly demo and I sprinkle the what I
would have said in the introduction
somewhere in the middle and maybe that's
a little more interesting to see the
thing about software demos is they are
you've probably seen many of them and
there are very different kinds of demos
and I have recently seen a magic trick
that reminded me a lot of the way how
many software demos and I thought I'll I
want to show you today just do you
understand what I mean the trick is a
very classic trick classic metric so
it's they cut the rope trick so that you
probably have all seen that at some
stage you have a stone a bit of rope and
you know I'm going to cut it in half and
then I put a knot in it and then I'll do
my magic and then the notice conan's all
in one piece again so that that's you
know fairly standard bit of magic so
here's my bit of rope I'm going to cut
it now has anyone got a pair of scissors
woman
well if you don't doesn't matter because
I'm well-prepared I've got one that I
made earlier here so I've cut that
already and I'm gonna put my knot in it
now um which I'm not terribly good at
but well it doesn't matter because I've
got one that I prepared earlier and now
I'm going to make this knot disappear so
I'm just count to three and then it'll
go away and we have one bit of rope
again one two well it doesn't matter
because I've got one that I prepared
earlier and here we are and that is
pretty much how many software demos are
going that I've seen at many conferences
and then at the end you wonder you know
what what what you've just seen so I
hope that I that I'm not going to do
this and but really show you everything
from from start to finish so that you
get an impression of what the system
really is so the system itself is called
green foot green foot is a system it's
essentially a programming environment
that we have built for explicitly for
teaching programming to young beginners
we had another system before well still
have it still around we built another
environment for teaching previously that
was called blue jay that was aimed
essentially at entry-level university
students so we we had talked for for
some years already in the context of
blue jay about teaching programming to
beginners and in in our mind that was
always first semester university but the
truth is that first semester university
now is not the first contact of kids
with programming anymore and we thought
if we if we are we've said for a long
time that we want to do you know teach
programming in a sort of pedagogically
valuable way and a good way right from
the start and the start is just not
entry-level university anymore the start
in fact and where we lose them already
is at school level so we thought that if
you're serious about
you know doing it doing it in a good way
from the beginning we really have to go
a bit lower than that and there's one
big big difference between teaching at
university level and teaching at school
level and that is if you teach at
university which is my day job you have
a much easier time because you have a
captive audience you know they can't run
away they they have made a choice to be
there and oh I'm inclined to say they
want to be there that's not always
literally true but in some sense of the
of the word it is you know they no one
forced them to be there well maybe their
parents did but by and large you know
they are interested where if you are one
of the schoolteachers in order to people
having to stand there with the 15
year-olds 80% of the students before you
even start talking have already decided
that they're not interested and so that
is one of the main differences is that a
lot of what I'm going to show you is
about generating motivation will be
being being sort of fun being being
engaging so to draw them in so what
we're trying to do here is two things at
the same time you're trying to teach
them something valuable but at the same
time we're trying to do something that
they actually want to do to draw them in
I'll just go ahead and show you some
things and then I'll give you a bit more
background later so what I've got here
on my screen at the moment is green foot
and I'm just opening another project
here so here for example I have an
existing green foot scenario we call
them a scenario it's essentially one one
project where I have here on my right a
representation of the classes that are
involved in this project and here got
what we what we call the world so I have
already written some classes here so
these are Java classes that are
implemented and the first thing we
typically do is not to write code but to
start interacting with classes so when I
have a class here I can click on it and
I get a pop-up menu with a few
operations and
is to instantiate this clown so I can
create a new object here of this class
interactively and when I do this I can
place my object into the world and when
I have an object in the world I can
click on the object and I can see all
the public methods of this object and I
can now interactively invoke this method
these methods so I can tell this one bed
for example to move a wombat by the ways
in Australian animal I don't know
whether you've seen that funny-looking
you know looks something like this
you know modulo my drawing abilities so
I can now interactively invoke these
methods I can tell it to move I can tell
it to turn left I can make it move again
I can also invoke methods with
parameters for example here I've got a
set Direction methods method and and I
can type in some constant and and then
it will move in that direction
I can have method results so for example
him I can move method checks whether the
wombat can move forward at the moment so
if I invoke this it returns true and if
I move him here to the edge of the
screen and then ask can you move forward
now it says false so what's happening
here well and another one thing I should
show you maybe I can create more of them
so I can create now as many wombats as I
want so what is happening here is that I
can introduce valuable concepts of
object orientation in a very concrete
way so I can talk about the relationship
of classes to objects you know that in
class from a class you can create many
objects I can later get to the
relationship to the source code as well
I can so I can essentially tell the
story that we can communicate with
objects by invoking their method their
methods so every object has a set of
operations that you can perform on them
I can talk about parameters and return
values and so on so I can first of all
introduce the fundamental concepts of
object orientation before I have to talk
about where the curly brackets go into
we call other things so it's a it's a
sort of top-down pedagogical approach
where we don't start with all the little
you know tedious detail but we start
with a big picture I can then click the
X button which makes them all go forward
at the moment every actor class so
Greenfoot gives you a framework that
consists of a world and multiple actors
every actor by definition here has an X
method and if I click the X button that
act method of every actor in the world
gets called and so if I click the Run
button run is just a loop around act so
if I do this they all just run around I
can then put leaves into the world and
if I put some of those in and I put some
warm bets around if they run around they
go up they go around and eat the leaves
and I can then look at them and say okay
how many leaves have you eaten and I can
you know so I can discuss in this
context the concepts of state you know
that there's different objects and they
have a different state and one has so
many leaves and and I can interrogate
them about this I have here an example
that I may use at the beginning of
teaching so typically I've said just in
my remark about about demonstrations I
said I wouldn't hide anything so I'll
just show you briefly how to really
start from scratch
because here I've got an example already
where I've prepared something which is
the normal way the teacher would start
teaching but just for for you I'll also
show you how it works to create a
scenario from scratch although in a
teaching situation that wouldn't be the
first thing I would be doing you know in
a teaching situation that comes a little
later so I'm creating here a new I know
I've selected open instead of new
that won't work so I want to create a
new scenario and I can close this one so
this is what I get when I create a
scenario from scratch I always have the
world and the actor classes they are
part of the green green foot framework
and then I can create a subclass of the
world and I call it let's see I've got
some backgrounds here I've got a an
image of a brick so I just call it wall
I make a brick wall
and so in addition to the typical you
know name of a class that that Java
classes always have in green foot and
there's also an image associated with
every class you create and if I now
create this and compile it
there's my world and if I open the
source code it gets a skeleton
automatically and there's not much in
there this is really the interesting
thing this is the side a size and the
resolution so let's say I want a one
pixel resolution and I make it 400 by
200
oops 202 well that's good enough as well
so here's my world it's a bit big and
then I can create in subclass of an
actor and let's say I create a bug and
you see here it's a library of images
you can select any of the images that
come bundled with the system or here
with the Browse button you can use any
image that you have anywhere in your
file system so for students that means
that very quickly they now have pictures
of their teachers running around getting
eaten by monsters and that that goes
always really quickly so I can see
somewhere here there are some there
that's a good enough image so once I
compile this I can immediately
instantiate a bug and put it in here
because the the default skeleton that
every new class gets is syntactically
syntactically correct so it compiles
even though there's no real code here
and then I can do things such as set
location I've got a set location method
I also have a get X and a get y method
of course if I use X&amp;amp;Y as it is then it
doesn't change anything but if I now add
a little bit to my current X location x
coordinate and use that as my new
location if I put my bug in here again
and now it crawls across the screen so
very very quickly by writing essentially
two lines of code one here and one in
the world I can get animated graphics on
screen and that is very important that
is just the the motive a the multivator
you know that we used to draw kids in is
do to get graphics and animation and
then interaction very quickly on screen
I can now add something like set
location oh said rotation is what I
meant to write and get the current
rotation plus a little bit and if I sort
of change the location and the rotation
at the same time then it's rolling
across the screen so it gets it's it's
fairly easy to get that animation on
screen in a teaching situation as I said
typically you would prepare a little bit
and preparing means that you can choose
essentially the level of of abstraction
you want to expose to your student so
this this is an example that might be
typical example as the very first thing
that you do with students this is one
example that I've used a number of time
with 14 15 year-olds where I've got a
crab and you can start by telling them
about class as an object and we can
instantiate the crab and if I click run
nothing happens and then we open the
source code and check why nothing
happens and of course there's because
there's no code in here and then I can
just right move and if I write move into
this and instantiate it again it moves
across the screen and then I can write
things such as
turn five five degrees and if I do this
it runs in a circle and the move and
turn methods that I've just shown come
from the animal class which means as a
teacher by providing super classes of
the classes where the students actually
work
you can decide essentially the API the
complexity of the API you want to give
them and so if on the day I think
they're not ready to discuss parameters
then I write my method as I've done with
a move where it just moves the constant
bit forward I could have done the same
with the turn of course to just turn a
constant angle or if I want to discuss
parameters then I I right my turn method
so that I can discuss what a parameter
is so this gives the the teacher a good
level of control over what what level of
complexity you want to expose and for
students writing this stuff then fairly
quickly there's a question okay what are
the what are the methods I've got
available and we can look at the animal
class then by default here this one
opens in documentation view you can
switch the editor here between the
source code and the documentation and if
I prepare that as a teacher I just
switch just switch it to the
documentation so that is what it bill
and show me by a fault and I can see
I've got here my move and turn method
and there's some other ones to check
whether I'm at the edge of the world and
I can eat something so I can now write
code quite easily where I write if at
world edge then I turn something and
that means now if I if I run this now
I've got here oops
at the wrong class selected that means
that this will now run around and turn
around when it hits and then again of
course one of the nice thing is nice
things is that once you've written that
you can have many objects and can have
them running around and then you can
create new classes so I can say I want a
new animal
didn't mean to do that new subclass
that's what I meant to do we can put in
a room and I've got a picture prepared
already and if I compile this I can put
these worms into the world and the crabs
then like to eat worms and so at the
moment when they run over them nothing
happens at all but then I can write code
here that says if can see worm so I can
specify a class here that I'm looking
for and if I can see an object of that
then I want to eat it and if I do this
now and I have a number of worms here
and I put a crab in it's eating the
worms and fairly easily you can also put
sound in so if I don't then do a there's
a play sound method and I have a couple
of sound files prepared here and if I
know the name of the sound file it is
very easy to just play it so can do that
again put my worms here put a crab in
and up
okay you might get it now
not very loud it's a fairly soft sound
but still and and so on oh one last
thing I should show you we can add
keyboard control fairly easily I can ask
the environment whether a key is being
pressed and every key has a name so I
can just ask whether the left arrow key
is pressed then all the right one if the
left one let's say I want to turn
something a bit to the left and
otherwise a bit to the right and that's
that's for beginners these these aren't
sort of nice discussions you know if
you've shown them that you can turn and
then you point out well they always turn
right you know how do you make them turn
left and then they quite quickly get the
idea you know negative numbers and then
I usually when I do this in a teaching
situation I first get them to get the
crab to turn randomly sort of every with
a 10% chance or so it's return of it you
know and then we get a random number and
we say okay if you have a number how can
we now express a 10% chance and and you
can get into nice discussions about
about some programming principles but in
this example here now
whatever done
I don't remember the names of my methods
that's what I've done
well I can show you how to look this app
the Greenford API itself is a total of
five classes so we tried very hard to
keep it as small as possible so there
are only these five classes that is all
there is and we can actually print them
on three normal pages of paper and the
method is called is key down not key
down so
so you see this is an integrated
environment where documentation is
linked in you can get fairly easily to
the documentation of the class and so
now if I have the creb and I can run
around I can now control this with my
keys and can make it run around and you
can see this very quickly gets into sort
of game-like scenario so what we
typically do when I do sessions sort of
one-day sessions is I often do sessions
with school classes just single day
sessions where we take sort of 15
year-olds or so that have never
programmed before to write a game within
a day and so the next thing is we add
some some other lobsters or something
there that then chase the crabs which is
fairly easy because the code is almost
identical to the crab so you can native
to that very very easily and then you
can have to run away from the lobsters
and try to get all the all the worms
before the lobsters get you and all that
what what they typically do is they've
they very quickly come with their own
ideas so I have my sort of pre-prepared
storyline to build this game and at the
end just about I always have them in
working in pairs it works very well if
there's two of them together discussing
it almost every pair is doing something
different and that is one of the really
strong stories here of using sort of
graphical animations and games is they
come with their own ideas they
immediately get their own ideas you know
if you as a very first exercise get them
to print out the Fibonacci sequence or
something like this they might get there
and that's that's the end of the story
then you know it doesn't lend itself to
suddenly come up with oh I could also do
this other sequence you know that just
doesn't happen at that age with with
game-like scenarios you immediately get
the reaction that they have things they
want to do that they want to add and
that is very powerful because that
changes ownership it's suddenly not not
your program anymore it's days and
that's so it's a very powerful thing
what they all discover very quickly is
that you can just change the image so
just by you know setting the image here
to something then you can
look through there make it an elephant
and suddenly without changing any code
at all you have an elephant running
around of course that doesn't change
anything programmatically at all it's
just a different image but suddenly they
have killer sheep going around eating
babies and and and suddenly they get
really excited you know it's a very
small thing it is technically it doesn't
really add anything but suddenly because
they they see they can do things you
know and also things that you haven't
told them they get very much into this
the code you write because it's it's
then a Java of course it can become as
sophisticated as you like it's not only
games we often use games as of an early
example but here it's it's just a
simulation so this is an end simulation
there I'm sorry to end Hills here and
there's ants running around and there's
food sources and the the behavior of the
ants is actually very primitive they
just run around randomly until they
happen to run into some food and when
they find some food they run back to
their anthill and they leave drops of
pheromones that's these whitish clouds
you you see there and if they smell some
pheromones they just turn away from the
anthill and go in their direction and
that's all and so if you have enough of
them you get this path forming behavior
and there's no explicit code there to
form these paths this is emergent
behavior that comes just out of the
grouping so what green food does is it
gives you very a very easy entrance to
getting graphics on screen and to make
the move and so every program that has
as its output two-dimensional graphics
is very very easy to do so games is and
one obvious answer but simulations is
another class of programs that works
very well and as you've seen we don't
have to write any graphics code no in
when I just did this you actually when
you when you program in Greenfoot you
you program only the logical state of
the object so you just set its
x-coordinate oils Y or its rotation or
its image and the graphical animation is
automatically done by the environment so
there's there's no graphics code to
write
so that is educationally really really
nice because that allows you to talk
about the important programming
principles and not about details of
producing graphics for teaching in
schools this is this is really something
that at the moment is very hard to do
programming in schools is in the UK
probably worse than in the u.s. in the
UK there is a really dismal situation
where there is almost no real computing
left in the compulsory curriculum in in
schools at all in the u.s. I don't know
the details my impression is that it's a
little better on average but also not
everywhere in the only compulsory
computing subject in in the UK in high
schools is called ICT that's information
in communication technology and what
they do there is essentially learning to
use office no they teach them Excel and
they teach them PowerPoint and the
closest they come to programming is to
write some macros in Excel so they make
14 year olds do text income tax
calculations in Excel and and then they
they are surprised by their board you
know the it's it's called ICT but
colloquially the the school kids all
call it computing they think that that
is computing in fact they think then is
computer science and they come out of it
knowing for sure that they hate computer
science and they're well within their
rights to hate it because it is awful
it's just not computer science but they
don't know that you know that it's they
so a bit later in the sort of towards
the end of the high school in a part
that's in England it's called a levels
they can they can choose subjects and
one of the subjects I can choose is
computing where they actually do a bit
of real programming and a server has
just shown that the the reason why so
very few students choose that is the
experience with the ICT course because
they have seen that computing is boring
there was a survey about
attitudes to to IT and computing
recently and that has shown that there
is a real serious image problem
computing is seen as boring not
intellectually challenging there is a
stereotype of you know these geeks with
thick glasses sitting in basements with
a pizza next to the computer screen
never talking to anyone and large groups
of kids get get turned off before they
ever find out what programming really is
no and in programming in a in any
interesting sense isn't represented for
most kids in the school curriculum at
all and so what we are trying to do is
to open a way how programming can be
brought back into school and the the
problem of course is one problem is that
you know in modern programming systems
it's become more complicated than it was
in days when there was basic postulate
even you know there was a smaller entry
hurdle now there's a lot more
infrastructure and teachers in fact
aren't well educated to do this and
often have trouble doing this so we want
to bring tools back that make it as easy
to get started as it was with basic 20
years ago but then again you know when
we started printing out a triangle of
asterisks on the screen was really
exciting now that doesn't really excite
kids anymore
today so we try to do something that
that looks a little more interesting but
is as easy to to get into in your first
few steps I think teaching teaching
office automation automation tools to 14
year olds that borders on child abuse
know that is at that age they should
they should be creative they should do
things I should invent stuff they should
build things you know they should they
should have their ideas and make them
happen and and that is you know what we
need to bring back most people I know
who work in computer science have
started you know got in through
programming because programming was was
exciting and so I think programming is a
good way to get them interested in
computer science
most of the examples I've shown you so
far were these essentially Birds Eye
views of a world of actors that run
around it doesn't have to be like this
there are other things you can do I just
very briefly show you some examples so
he has a lift simulation for example so
that's a side-on view where you know you
have six floors and lifts going up and
down and now you can then you know right
lift control algorithm is something like
this or another example is just nothing
really very meaningful at all just
something to look at it's just a net of
dots and a bit of gravity and if I grab
one of those I can drag them around
knowing so you can just in examples like
this the nice thing is that you can
really concentrate on the logic of the
movement and don't really have to write
the graphics code there are some
applications because this is not really
not a toy language this is because this
is full Java you can make it as
complicated as you like and there are
uses of this of greenfoot in
universities as well I've got a
colleague who is using green foot n and
agent modeling calls for for writing
where they develop essentially AI
algorithms for behavior of agents
because you know you can you can put any
algorithm in there that you want and the
reason he is using this is just because
he's not interested in doing the
graphics and you get the graphics for
free essentially here you can then just
concentrate on the logic and and the
Greenfoot environment just does the
graphical animation for you another
colleague of mine at the moment is
working on developing examples where the
topic matter is is chemistry where you
have you know reactions of molecules on
screen where you don't learn only about
programming but you learn something
about chemistry as well so there's
another possible level of learning where
you can actually teach something about
the subject matter which then you can
manipulate through code as well
I got here
and when we have the animated graphics
and we have keyboard control then very
quickly of course we have game-like
scenarios so here I have to land this
okay there wasn't I have to land that
very very carefully I'll try once more
so you have to come down very slowly
okay I give it one last try I have to
concentrate now okay
you can try after this talk yourself or
you can do any better um when you
actually get it done there's a flag
coming up which is a great student of
mine wrote that who is obviously Danish
that's why it's this flag but the reason
I brought this up is just to show you
the sort of a possibility how you can do
and now that blew up as well how you can
do testing with this because you can
instantiate manually instantiate any
class and you can manually manually call
any method you can do very nice very
quick testing so as soon as you finish
writing one method you know you can
instantiate it and you can run it you
can see what happens in and debugging is
almost implicit because a lot of the
behaviors is visual you immediately see
if it goes wrong you know so in this
case for example I've got my explosion
here which I can put into the world and
then it does a bang but one thing I've
done is I've written it so that when the
explosion touches anything that thing
explodes so if I put any objects in here
let's say the flag let's say I put some
flags in here and then I put an
explosion somewhere on one side
I get this chain reaction I can just try
this out and this chain chain reaction
isn't explicitly program it's just the
behavior of the explosion and the code
for that is actually quite simple this
is this is the code that that does it
you know when when the explosion acts it
just goes bigger and smaller and then
disappears but here it just says you
know every time when it acted it gets
the the set of interact of overlapping
objects know it's there's a get
interacting objects and the null is the
field I can essentially filter here to a
certain class and I say without having a
filter it means I take any object that
comes along and then I just go through
the banner say if that object is not
itself an explosion then I just put an
explosion where that object was and
remove the object and that's it you know
and that you get this this nothing so
you can this interaction gives you a lot
or possibility of trying things out very
very quickly so if you're a student
developing something or if you're not a
student either because I try to do that
a lot it actually is quite good fun once
you get started you can you don't have
to complete a whole scenario before you
see the first effects you know you write
one method and you put it in and you
look at it now that it goes there is no
test drivers to write or no complete
application once you have a partial
thing going that partial thing will go
the quality of the animation you can
achieve is is good enough to actually
look these me so here for example
there's a a sort of you can there's a
lot of this is actually the the using
green foot the example where I've seen
most software we use actually happening
you might have noticed that that's the
same explosion as I don't had in the
previous one there is a lot of
possibility to just take classes from
existing things and put them over so
here this is done the the standard
asteroids so you see that there there is
a you know the animation certainly is
good enough that this looks like
something you can play and so students
can achieve something there that they
can actually show around that is we
wanted to achieve the same sort of
quality of code that you can do with
with all those flash games that are now
all on websites and from a motivational
point of view showing it to others then
is very important that's very very
powerful so one thing we have done here
is we've got an export possibility we
can explore it as an application which
is essentially just generating an
executable file file or we can make a
web page out of it let's say I put that
on my desktop and export it and then it
writes me a web page with an applet on
it
and here I have then this is what it
generated and so if I open this I get
this in a web browser
and there's my game and I can play it
here
and so of course you know from from
perspective of learning to program that
doesn't really add very much but as a
motivator that that changes a lot the
program the problem with with this is
generating a webpage of course is that
you still need a web server somewhere to
make it public if you do this you know
you have it now in a web browser on your
own machine but we still can't send the
URL to your grandmother so to to solve
that problem we are just at the moment
working on building a web server public
web server where anyone can just put
their stuff up there so if I here do my
export and there's a publish
functionality and that's at the moment
still experimental actually I should
reset this and then put that a bit
together so that I get a get an image
because if I do the export I have my
screen image here and I can use this as
my icon for my game and then I can give
it a title and if I put my user name and
password in and export this this now
builds the same thing though the applet
end and the web page but it puts it on a
public web server which via which I hope
is up at the moment because there's
people working on it right now so if I
go there this is now really live on on
the web and here's a page which I should
reload so I had that up earlier so oh
okay I was I just did that I didn't look
at my dialogue I reloaded it because I
noticed it isn't here because if it's
recently added it should be the first
one here
that is right that is right let's try
that again yeah that's that's one that's
essentially the same thing that I put on
there earlier so there is already
another version of this of this scenario
on there okay now it said complete so if
I go back to that page and I reload this
there should be now our version on here
so this is the one we've just put on
here so this is we think about this as
something like like YouTube for games
you know for programming game and so the
idea is first of all that through this
thing there's a strong motivational
thing because of course it has all the
all the sort of standard you know social
interaction stuff that they have
nowadays with ratings and leaving
comments and and all that kind of thing
and people can really show around the
work and we have sort of the hope that
through this people might get interested
in this through actually playing the
games so we'll have some games on the
sort of featured games at the top that I
actually sort of fairly nice-looking and
then links that then show people what
the source code looks like and how they
you know open it in Greenfoot and change
it that s droid thing that's the arrow
keys in the spacebar turn your sound
down okay um so over here the weather
thing I should maybe I'm I don't really
want to show you a lot more but but
maybe as a last thing and just to give
you one other idea one other nice thing
you can do of course is if you get live
data somewhere from those so here for
example if I click act it goes out to
some weather server and gets actually
real-time weather data and so there's a
whole number of things you can quite
easily do and there's a question of
course whether or not you know Java is
the best language to use for something
like this there are
well it's a it's a blessing and a curse
at the at the same time you know Java
clearly imposes a lower bound to how
young the kids can be doing this now
I've used Greenfoot with my own daughter
who is eight oh well this started when
she said she's ten now and that works
with sort of sitting with her one on one
and and helping her out you know I I
have to help her a lot with the syntax
you know just the question of forgetting
brackets and and and things like this is
at that age it is really still a big
hurdle so it's clear that at that age
for a classroom situation that wouldn't
work that that's too young for a sort of
one-on-one situation it works but it was
also interesting that all the problems
were syntax she got the concepts really
really easily and really quickly so with
a different language you could probably
go lower down in age we use this mostly
sort of with with kids 14 and upwards
but then of course there is the the good
thing because Java is a no it's it's not
a toy language it's a full language
where everything you want to do is
support it there is really no limit
about how sophisticated you can make it
and you can you can do really
interesting stuff it scales you know
because there is it's really just this
damaged Java compiler so you get all the
benefits of having a real language in
there rather than a toy language but
it's a trade-off
what we are trying to achieve here is to
create a situation where the first
contact with with programming can become
really engaging and interesting again
you know where we have sort of two goals
in mind we want to draw them into
program you want to show them that this
is something that you can enjoy there
can be that can be you know good and
satisfying and at the same time what we
don't say openly is we actually want to
teach them good programming principle so
we want to discuss things such as
classes and objects and separation of
concern and the visualization of the
classes and the object is important so
that they can see you know that there
are separate objects and they interact
and they can get references to another
and they communicate by invoking into
this methods and parameter passing and
although all the the important concepts
in object under programming get
automatically discussed the other thing
that we're trying to do is we are trying
to see the the kids and the teachers
both as target groups now it teaches in
at school level are often overwhelmed
with some of the complexity and they
don't really know how to teach well
either so what we're trying with
Greenford is to give a very clear
guidance about you know what the
concepts are that you should be
discussing because we try to expose them
explicitly an interface you know there
are classes there are objects there are
methods and all the things we think you
should talk about you know are
explicitly there in your face so that
that gives a structure about about what
you what you should cover
we're getting closer to the end of the
time so I think I'll stop here and just
leave another few minutes for questions
in case there are questions but I'll
I'll stop my talking here that pointed
yeah I think you were first I don't know
what do you think of Flash MX is a
teaching tool for writing games like
this for kids I think from a from a
language point of view
no from from a teaching point of view
java's nicer than flesh i rather teach
java because it represents some of the
concepts that are important to me much
nicer than flesh does from an just
performance of the technology flesh is
clearly winning at the moment you know
the one of well if you compare
performance in start-up time for example
between applets and flesh of course
applets really has has some ketchup to
do luckily at the moment the story we
are hearing out of Sun is that they were
working on this you know improving the
sort of user experience for using
applets and that would be nice
there there still is no applets are
still a pain point where you know you
get different errors in different
browsers and all the you know you all
known some of the problems and so from
technology point of view flesh actually
works better at the moment from a
pedagogical point of view Java is my
clear preference there was a question
there as well and Josh I don't know do
you want to go to the microphone mine is
really so I'll ask ya my brother comes
up um so how many lines of code roughly
speaking in the asteroids program that's
about 200 lines of code so that is
something the asteroids program that
that is something that a total beginner
can achieve after two or three months or
so so it's it's not very far out there
as a teacher I can write that in an hour
and a half or so you know so that is
that's the other thing as a as a teacher
the the scale and complexity of
of supplying these examples is
manageable you know for for in
acceptable preparation time and students
after a reasonable time of study can get
there for that teachers can write that
it's important because often the way you
start teaching the early examples is
sort of with fill in the blanks exercise
you might give them the astroid scenario
almost done but the rocket doesn't move
you know and then the early examples can
be to it could be to just you know do
the rocket movement and everything else
already there yes I have a few questions
I'll see start with could you go back to
the crab world still have that so I'm
wondering I'm sure students try this
very quickly and I could download and
try myself but I'm just dying to know
what happens if you try to eat a worm
and there's no worm there it well we can
look at the all that is so if I do this
you know say if I do this here which
means it would eat a worm at every step
yes right and I compile this I put my
crab in its elephant costume in here
nothing happens at all and the real
answer of course is whatever the
implementer of the animal class has
written there is what will happen okay
what I happen to have written here is
that I just ignore the fact so here in
my each method where's my implementation
of my eat method is here I just see
whether there is an object at you know
offset zero zero from where I am which
means whether there is another object of
the given class of the worm class at my
location and if there isn't I just don't
do anything so what is really wondering
is there an exception mechanism visible
to the user it could be so if I now
decide to throw an exception here yeah
or if I call one of the API methods that
throws an exception that is is visible
so
you know if I do this now if I don't
don't ignore vents now but I actually
try to remove now I would expect this to
give me an exception and if I do this
immediately this stuff pops up here okay
and I get my exception um so my other
questions are at a higher level so you
can save applications and run them as
applets very cool
can you run Greenfoot itself as an
applet no currently we can't and I
thought about it we thought about it it
is technically not easy and we decided
at some stage that is not worth the
trouble I mean it that it's sort of more
more trouble than it's worth
part of that is that you know Greenfoot
runs internally two virtual machines one
to run the user code essentially and one
run to run the environment itself and
there's communication going on and all
that actually doing that in an applet
you run into all sorts of problems with
the security and so there would be so
much fiddling necessary to make that
work that I think and I don't see is
strong enough benefit to actually
justify that so downloading it running
it locally is it was our judgment is is
probably the preference for most people
anyway
so that I don't think it's a because of
cost-benefit payoff I don't think it
comes out fair enough it's another thing
I was wondering about so this is your
turning off introducing and gets to
programming for the first time and it's
an object-oriented language which is
isn't how I'm going to program so I'm
just wondering you have enough data of
what happens how do they deal when they
encounter a procedural language for the
first time where they puzzled we have
data from that not from from Greenfoot
and and school-age kids but we have done
that there is data that that was done at
the university level where something
like like five to ten years ago there
was in the computing education community
big discussion about optic
in how to teach object orientation in
rent to teacher object orientation and
and whether it should be taught first
and many people have heard probably
about the the problem of the paradigm
shift going from a procedural to an
object on your language there are
studies that there is really there
really is a problem that way you know
going from a from a procedural to an
object and in language and so studies
show that the other way around there
doesn't seem to be this problem you know
going to procedural language from an
object wanted one seems to be a lot
easier than then the other way around
so we haven't done any studies where
where people started at school age but I
don't expect there to be a real problem
thanks a lot
so I guess these questions I wanted to
ask was the first one I see you doing a
lot of things involving sub-classing
actor but it seems like you just set up
the background with an image and the
size and the granulation and that's all
you're doing with it is there kind of
any functionality say to change the
background yes yes that can all be done
programmatically as well so the
background can change the image of the
the well if I if I open the the end
scenario again and just show you with
the the it's maybe clearer to see here
with the actors but the same is true for
the world so here for example the
pheromones here our actors as well right
and the image of the pheromone is not
loaded from an image file but drawn
dynamically at runtime so that it
actually just draws a circle with a
certain size and alpha value and the
image dynamically changes you know so
the image of an actor has an image but
that can be loaded either from a file or
you can draw it programmatically and for
example the the count here is also an
actor you know there is the summer here
is the counter and that is just a
transparent image where I'm writing some
text onto a transparent bit of image and
and that updates itself automatically
okay so then you can do the same with
the background of the world okay um
let's see what kinds of requirements are
there to run this like you obviously
need a compiler which means having the
JDK yeah it requires JDK the Java 5 or
all later ok ok we have sorry we're
running out of time so last question or
is that
yeah the question was whether we're also
working on material lesson plans to go
with this and the answer's yes that is
in fact at the moment that is our main
focus the software at the moment it says
a stage where it's working and stable
and that's all well and we are extending
it a little bit but the that is in fact
the main thing that is needed next there
is a little bit already there not very
much but we're working on this at the
moment and there will be more available
very soon okay we are out of time thank
you for coming
