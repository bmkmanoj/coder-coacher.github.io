of work in my life just about 30 40
years ago this spring of nineteen
seventy five created something called
public key cryptography and I've been
making a living off of it ever since
some other people have made an even
better living off of it ever since I'm
happy to say and I I look I get
presented with my panel I find two of
them I've known for quite some time and
two of them I haven't so let me just
introduce them as best I can Steve
Crocker is somebody have actually known
even longer than Vint Cerf I met him
when he was at MIT 67 something like
that before I went to Stanford and he I
think he's had this you know sort of
fingers on the pulse of ARPANET ever
since then and been working in security
for a quite a number of years one of a
couple of people i'm going to introduce
who whose activities move too fast for
me to keep track of them so i'll let you
all say how i misrepresented you when
you get the floor as yourself the next
to our internal here and probably better
known to many of you than the artemy
christa Bono's described as browser
security which i assume means chrome and
i'm told that chrome goes a long way out
of its way to get isolation among
various things that need to be isolated
eric gross seems to be bipartite
described as application and network
security as a practical developmental
matter i see those as two different
things and maybe they should be
harmonized but i'm curious as to how
they get unified in one person but here
it comes from Bell Labs and so you know
universe of my youth that means he can
do no wrong and finally Howard Schmidt I
can't keep track of him either but he's
been at Microsoft
White House at ebay but then he based
sold him but I forgotten the who they
sold him two and the on yo that's
exactly what I was thinking I mean you
know it's like Jay Leno quoted
Schwarzenegger saying about the budget
crisis you know we have no choice now we
are going to have to sell Senate seats
right here in California so selling
office personnel as the last resort of
the unscrupulous corporation and even
once you all come up two out of four of
us have slides two and a half out of
five of us have ties I have mine in my
pocket and I was told i guess that first
of all those slides come toward Eric
grossest is the only guide to what you
want to be here so let me hit you up in
alphabetical order Steve why don't you
go ahead and I got carried away by
introductions so I think I'll also take
a second to make an opening statement
since after I let other people loose I
may not get a chance i think that the
internet is unique in a combination of
things first if you compare it i think
what's about you know important things
to learn from history but you can also
learn a lot that's misleading from
history and I think in security we've
absorbed a lot that is very misleading
and the critical one critical thing
about the Internet is that it's a
network intended for friends to talk to
foes if you look at a traditional
military command and control network
which is where traditional security work
was done you have a network meant for
friends to talk to friends and when you
add the technology that we've developed
which was indeed intended for a diverse
community to the easier problem of a
less diverse community you can get quite
good result
but we still aren't ready for prime time
in a truly diverse community now you
might answer that by saying but wait a
month abit networks before that didn't
just connect friends look at the
telephone system that matter look at the
mail and that much is true but the key
point about the internet in my mind is
how much it is its own housekeeper so
the internet is a matter of a lot of
code running from microcode to
applications and that code is developed
and updated and maintained over the
network itself and that makes it that
raises the security standard required in
an environment that makes it harder to
achieve that security standard so with
that I will let my palettes event alee
I'm talking this way because I was at a
two-day celebration of hundred years of
British intelligence in the conference
facility in which the common room have
ceiling about this high and you were
shouting at each other you know you
spies get together and conspire but you
have to shout to do it so I apologize at
any event I let loose the rest of the
panel who can correct me I guess this is
this is life thank you very much you
caused me to flashback with so we met my
recollection is when you came into my
office and asked if you could borrow one
of my math books when we were grad
students at MIT and I remember being
pleasantly surprised that I had anything
that would interest anybody who was
already at MIT since I felt overwhelmed
by the environment the other thing you
mentioned was having a how do you put it
fingers on the neck of ARPA they can
that's the pulse not yeah yeah so that
was the question as this is the fingers
around the neck or just finding out
whether DARPA still alive which is some
respects an open question so I'm here in
a very narrow capacity with respective
security I've been working on a what
looked like an easy straightforward
problem actually in my life originated
when Vint called up one day and said we
got a serious problem there's
well you describe the basic issuance of
cache poisoning it had been demonstrated
it had been demonstrated in a way that
rocketed up through the higher levels of
the government presidential science
advisor and we started an urgent project
right away to fix the problem it was
obvious what to do add cryptographic
signatures to the dnf system early 1990s
and it's a little sad and embarrassing
as to what the long path has been for
that good news is that the specs are
pretty much done and we're now in the
deployment process which is long and
equally painful so I want to give you a
very brief walkthrough of this I've been
cautioned that I have far too many
slides but I intend to move along real
fast so a recap status and current
issues here's a picture of what dns
looks like and there are two sides to
this to the left of the cloud is the
provisioning side putting the
information together make it available
and on the right side is the active part
the reason why it's they are asking the
questions and getting the answers back
and here is what we'll call the google
effect perhaps or the web effect there's
a rather surprisingly large number of
queries for dns just in looking at a
single page these days this is you know
you think you look up something get an
answer back and then you go and get that
information so that's the reference for
a single page off of CNN com those are
dns lookups not the content lookups
here's where things can go wrong the
arrows all point to places where it's
possible to tinker with and subvert the
information the black arrows are places
where you need insider access the red
arrows unfortunately are the places
where the attacks can come from the
outside and that's the area that we want
to fix so in ultra brief this is not the
place for a tutorial and I suspect you
know ninety-five percent of the people
in this room can build this stuff so you
have zone administrator sign records and
systems have to check them and if the
bag
I just want to insert false answers in
the middle in one fashion another either
on the fly or by poisoning cash or
whatever that gets detected and in
principle discarded so one of the big
questions that comes up not in the inner
circles but if the next layer is out of
how do why should I adopt this is this
going to solve all my problems and the
answer is the usual it does part of what
you need and it won't do everything is
that necessary yes is it sufficient no
it won't solve the DDoS attacks it won't
solve for identity theft it won't solve
a bunch of other things but it is a base
layer that a lot of things are going to
be built on top of and it's important to
implement it so getting down a little
bit there's a couple of chicken and egg
problems one is that in order to work
you have to have sewn signed and you
have to have validating resolvers check
those signatures why should I put it
into my resolver if there's nothing
signed why should I sign anything if
there's nobody checking it and until you
get on the right side of that cycle it's
not virtuous so we have to get zone
signed we have to get signatures checked
as it turns out it is easier to put the
pressure on getting things signed and so
in fact the place we are is that we have
more things signed and we are in a
earlier but not zero stage of getting
signatures checked there's the status
there are a handful of a growing handful
i should say of top-level domains that
are signed in in operation if you're not
familiar with all those two letter
acronyms that sweden brazil bulgaria
puerto rico the czech republic and
thailand for country code top-level
domains and museum and gov which is the
US government internal one of the US
government's internal ones not mill as
the other coming soon Canada UK Portugal
US Australia India Malaysia Switzerland
all testing or GD UL net and com all
have announced various degrees of
development and likely to come and the
route is very much
under discussion and I was just a huge
amount going on there and I'll say a bit
more at the tail end dank Kaminski's
work last year it's probably the
strongest and best thing that ever
happened with respect to DNF sec despite
all of the years of effort that we've
put into it we have to raise him as the
poster child for DNS deck the US
government has purview over gov and mil
of course under US and edu under various
contracts and it has a talk about
fingers on the neck fingers around the
neck of the root there are government
regulations in-depth saying that gov has
to be signed and below gov all of the
subordinate zones by the end of this
year dot mil is coming there's federal
standards that are not only forcing the
adoption inside the US government but
will have a cascading impact on vendors
and that is one would have thought that
the power of the purse of the US federal
government would have waned in the IT
area and could it not control anything
but it still has a quite powerful effect
on the validation side on the sake of
checking of signatures ISPs are
beginning to operate validating
resolvers telia in Sweden rolled out in
parallel with the Swedish registry and
when they rolled out the first full up
operating top-level domain that was
signed comcast in the US has been a
leader a university California Berkeley
and I think there are a bunch of other
places that are beginning to run and
validating recursive resolvers the list
will grow what are the issues well are
there performance problems and the
answer is not really yes it is true that
sign answers are longer than unsigned
answers yes it takes longer to check
what you have to spend time checking the
signatures computationally and bandwidth
utilization and so forth these are small
potatoes one can make them look very
large by saying oh look they find
answers are three times a bigger than
unsigned answer that's out of a
a single-digit percentage of the total
bandwidth that gets consumed perhaps at
best we did discover that some of these
small routers and firewalls have trouble
processing signed answers and there's a
report reference there we did some
careful experiments documented the tests
comcast redid those and had a summit
meeting several months ago impressed
vendors and I think that over time we
will get that problem fixed up all right
so what isn't in good shape we need a
rather complete predictable response
model what happens if a signature
doesn't check what happens if you ask
for a signature and it isn't supplied
those two questions don't have crisp
clean fully implemented answers
throughout all of the end user software
even Microsoft is fully on board nobody
wants pop up saying a problem then
discovered okay not really um and I
don't appreciate you asking at this
particular moment because I can't do
anything with the question right it's
it's just completely the wrong thing we
need products and services that make
this easy on the product side secure 64
and other companies are producing
appliances on the service asada filius
is brought out a managed DNS ex-service
I expect that all Trudy announced run by
new Tsar will be a long momentarily and
I think this will move along nicely so
that it is not going to be necessary
that you have to become an expert at all
the different aspects of generating keys
and managing the key rollovers and and
all of that if you want to outsource it
if you want to do it that's fine it's
all well documented on the signing side
we have to have tools and
other mechanisms available to make it
easy one of the chicken and egg problems
that we're dealing with is not only the
checking versus signing but within the
signing community you have the route you
have top-level domains you have
enterprises below that what happens if
an enterprise is so so a point that I
should have mentioned is that DNS SEC
depends upon a chain of signatures from
the bottom up so that if an enterprise
has signed its own the its signature is
vouched for by the top-level domain that
it's registered under and the top-level
domain signature is vouched for by the
root signature and the root key is then
made available in broadly would that it
will all be done that would be great
we're in a state where the tree is full
of holes or less charitably there's only
a few places that are filled in on the
tree and it's mostly holes how do you
operate in this incomplete state which
is we're going to be in in some degree
for a very long time you have to have a
way of tying together the loose ends
trust anchor repositories is the term of
art a bunch of things that are not
perfectly worked out about all of that
and then you have some big players like
Google and Akamai and others that play
very very fancy games with DNS and that
when you bring those fancy games
together with the design of DNS SEC
there's some technical challenges there
and I have been hoping and having
discussions on the side that Google
Akamai and others will take a forward
posture in this and and the results are
encouraging but leave it to to them to
make their own announcements
applications what do you do with all its
besides take comfort in the fact you've
got the right that the domain name
translates to the right address well the
interesting thing is that once you do
all of this you actually have a platform
that other things can be built on top of
should we mention that would that scare
people or shall we mention that and
excite people an open question meanwhile
often another part of the space the
email people are working on D Kim
domainkeys for checking email origin and
those comes restored in DNS but not tied
to the DNS signature process yet well
it looks like it's obvious that they
should do so and there are plenty of
other public key infrastructure apps
that could and will exist I want to
mention a thing that is quite new the
last few days we've put together a
symposium looking at the specific
technical issues of what it's going to
mean to roll out a signed route the
email address there is for submitting an
application or requesting information
here are some topics that we'll be
looking at it'll be a small symposium
about maybe the size of this or smaller
and the results will be made public and
that's it I have in the slide deck if
it's distributed some backup slides on
other things and but thank you 20 out of
36 read Magister ludi I suddenly ends in
the middle of something he tricks you
that's a long series of appendices so
you still think you're in the middle um
how should we handle this i don't know
how it has been handled questions in the
middle sure yep one of the obvious
questions and it sort of goes to the
discussion with eric one of the next
steps after you get to what you think is
the right site is actually doing using
certs to verify that you're there and
setting up a encrypted pipe google along
with a bunch of other players have done
a marvelous job in the last 18 24 months
at the ca browser forum and coming up
with that solution and there's no reason
in the world why basically EV suits
shouldn't be rolled out worldwide to
attack the cyber security problem in
fact what's terribly embarrassing is
even within the United
government I'd love to see Eric do this
next time you in Washington try going to
a US government agency website and see
what you get in terms of assert see how
many are using EV certs bad news is most
of them are broken does the government
agencies themselves are not even using
the technology so one of the obvious
next step is to capitalize and what
Google the browser vendors the ca
vendors have done in this producing this
marvelous specification and is getting
it rolled out worldwide each a
microphone I I have nothing to add to
that so I'm just passes I'm Andre broida
the problem that we have with Eve
asserts that they have much worse
latencies so it takes more time picture
to check a desert
and their dim ok so then to ask me to
speak broadly about browsers and I asked
him if he would mind specifically if I
sort of told the story of security
behind the Android handset um and and
there's a fellow here from chrome if you
want to deep dive into sort of sandbox
design and the rest it so if you've any
questions I'm sure you can answer this
isn't it great how I can volunteer
people in the audience so yeah I'm Chris
for the purposes of this discussion i
guess the background that matters is my
time at the State Department is a
cryptographer and after that working on
the entrust CA when tandem used the
entrust CA for the Singaporean
government so as you know Android is a
linux-based device and there are a
couple of cell phones that have been out
to actually for very many years they use
linux as the base for the for the device
and there's some really interesting sort
of things that you get for free with
linux that's pretty awesome on a cell
phone the linux security model is the
bog standard UNIX users and groups and
user IDs and in the concept of root and
and it's something that we're all very
very comfortable with but it's also
pretty solid it's pretty well thought
out in a lot of ways Linux distinguishes
itself by trying not to innovate too
much insecurity and thus make things
insecure and we understand it so it's
it's sort of easy enough to lock down
linux in general has a problem in that
people are aggressively advancing
subsystems and so sometimes you'll have
security problems in an hour s arteries
and satins and our production network
planners here at Google are constantly
trying to ensure the security of the
Google Network and and you see this
across the internet as a whole and it's
both been a pretty good business for red
hat to help people keep up to date on
these things but also it's been a very
big challenge considering i think that
30 plus percent of the internet is
running on top of linux servers but it's
not significantly broken and that's
great and and i think the problem
for some of the people who have tried to
fix security with regards to large scale
and fairly complex role based systems
where for instance Netscape can talk to
Netscape and just Netscape and it's file
space but not go outside it like you
would maybe program with a security
enhanced Linux model which came out of
the NSA is that it's very complex to
manage for for large installations and
and it's had other other issues and
specifically if you look at Linux in an
environment where the batteries is is
actually quite precious when you start
adding these things you can actually
destroy the battery profile for instance
the new update of Android that's coming
out cupcake if you we had to take off
the net filter and iptables layer of of
the operating system now a lot of people
say we're doing this because we want to
break tethering because that makes
certain partners happier I think but in
reality it was destroying about
twenty-five percent of the Wi-Fi
networks tax efficiency and it was also
hurting battery life and I wouldn't say
significantly but it was single
percentage points so you have all these
really interesting trade-offs that
actually affect more than just what
people think so that's pretty
interesting now cellular phones are
really interesting as a as a threat
space you know you can we've seen
actually already not on not an artifice
thankfully but on other devices tricks
to make people call you know 976 babe
and and and things like that that are
you know a penny you know or a dollar
per minute extra than the normal charges
to actually make money directly and and
that was fairly popular about three or
four years ago those kinds of exploits
against Symbian devices and others
there's also social engineering
techniques where you would SMS somebody
with a number or they go I have to call
back my mother and they're actually not
calling me back their mother so those
for social engineering you can't really
fix that in my opinion but there are
other things that in a lot of ways has
phones become more like computers they
have the same problems they have a lot
of our contact information they can be
used as platforms to send spam and
there are other things or that you can
break your phone and you can break other
people's phones and that's no good so
another thing that's very very to cell
phone networks and and even to a degree
a certain cell phone towers is that
unfortunately the cell phone towers are
way more brittle than you might expect
sometimes when we were developing the
android phone we we had a bad habit of
sending malformed packets because we
were really bringing up the phone we
were sending unexpected packets and this
was actually bringing down the local
cell phone towers data model which is
kind of shocking if you think about it
SMS invoice we're still very very
reliable but you could destroy the
network stack on the tower if you send
the wrong kind of packet you say we'll
wait a second how can you create an open
operating system that can do that you
know is that loud and it's allowed it's
just tricky right but then a lot of
people were worried about people getting
route to their devices and thus causing
those kinds of problems before the
manufacturers of the cell phone towers
could put it up push up pat patches that
would keep it from happening and and
another thing that people were really
worried about and have been worried
about historically when you give users
too much access to the internals of a
machine like this is that the manipulate
radio power and thus destroy the local
Spectras picture of itself and that's
been pretty interesting to and how the
industry is moved around that so so we
try to address this in a lot of levels
we address this at the hardware the OS
level as well as the application layer
so at the hardware we have a reserved
partition which is where the operating
system exists and we signed the binaries
for the phones that ship as part of a
carrier so for instance the tmobile
phone has signed binaries reserved
partitions and user / developers cannot
access that area and and and I'll say
that I say can't but I'm also very
familiar with the rude exploits that are
out there we also send over-the-air
updates and we have to ensure that those
over-the-air updates are trusted so that
when they're installed they actually
work and they actually think they are
they're complete they are what we think
they are and they do the right kinds of
things with the phone and then another
thing that's really interesting about
modern
smartphones is if you look at the
system-on-chips that these are based on
there are really two computers in there
there's two armed ships one runs that
what we consider to be the cell phone
the operating system and the other part
runs and I mentioned this earlier runs
the radio right and the radio deals with
all the issues around cell tower handoff
intercompany inter-country handoff and
radio power levels and it's actually
very very difficult to access that part
of the of the chip and that's very
lockdown in the case of the g1 by the
manufacturer Qualcomm so it's and it's
actually more complex than the main
operating system and they communicate
with each other as i mentioned to dat
command set but there's a price you pay
for that one of the things that a lot of
people talk about is like well what I
really want to write is a program that
listens to the PCM stream that goes
through a year and if somebody says
let's meet tomorrow it'll automatic but
something your calendar it's like yeah
we would like that too it's actually
impossible for us to that PCM stream
though and and and we're working with
Qualcomm and figure out ways of doing
that and they're like but we did on this
one phone we got from trying to back in
1992 macam that was in 1992 and things
have changed so what's that oh yeah well
it's this is the funny thing they're
like you know but before we would just
unplug the cable then we plug it into
the other exchange and we could listen
that's like well we don't have party
lines anymore so um so yeah it's funny
because there is a phone app that
actually ships using the selinux
security model and it's like boggles my
mind this we would want to cram that
into this device but not this device but
it so one was based away it's funny too
I know we're not going to do a
collection of anecdotes here but linux
one's been tripping in China for I think
over six years now and and it's been
kind of stagnant since we brought out
Android anyway so another thing we
wanted to do is we wanted to create an
environment where you can run
applications are written by third
parties and they could talk to each
other insane ways and not actually break
the phone and so we had to make a
decision to give the users enough rope
to hang themselves with so if you have a
g1 and we can actually talk about
providing one for everyone I could bring
over a pallet or whatever you can
install software and it'll say do you
want them to be able to access your
contact list the network these different
parts of the phone then the user will
say
sure and then it installs but that
actually allows a user can Hannah screw
up and to brick their own phone if they
download the wrong package that does the
wrong thing so so we tried to think of
ways of minimizing that danger so the
virtual machine that exists on the phone
for running the applications has a very
specific sort of model whenever you
start an application actually starts
with a new unique user ID so it helps to
keep these things sort of in their own
little holes and then even if they call
native methods and they have native code
if that's being run within that that
user ID context and then they talk to
each other through known interfaces
through the virtual machine where we
could ostensibly protect the user and
that's been pretty successful to date
we've had about you know 15th out 15,000
maybe a bit more applications written
and submitted and/or released in the
wild you can install applications from
the web you can install applications
pretty much from anywhere if you click
the unknown sources button and that's
even true on the carrier-based advice so
and we're actually pretty proud of the
model it's working pretty well so far
and then you've got the the app level in
the browser level now browsers on phones
are really really interesting because
when you when you think of a browser on
a phone it actually identifies itself as
Chrome mobile and they share a number of
components but it's actually a different
team although we're merging them now the
browsers can't really take over the
phone they can cause problems inside the
rendering engine that take too long to
render can reduce the efficiency of the
foam maybe burn up a bit of battery but
the way that they're created now is they
really are just applications on top of
the phone so even in some of the cases
where we had a WebKit bug where a person
could sort of jump out of the browser it
would really just crash your browser and
that's not the end of the world so by
sort of Fanbox in these applications and
keeping them out of the rest of the
phone it works pretty well and yet we
want to give them access the services of
the phone so they can actually be useful
so that's sort of something we have to
deal with not for long one of the things
we're doing as a company we've released
a package called Native Client and what
Native Client allows you to do is
basically to ship x86 code as part of a
web page
a lot of you will be thing right now
about activex in the disaster that was
from the security perspective you're
right it's something we're obviously
very sensitive to and we have a contest
to see if we've done it right they're
doing basically subsetting of the x86
command structure so it's all pretty
interesting despite the fact that till
he breaks ad of HTML but the funny thing
is is though for all of our good
intentions we're still screwing up this
is natural and so don't take it as I'm
saying we're all images groups so like
for instance when we first shipped it
one of the things we had as we were
developing is while it was booting you
could punch in a command and hit return
and it would execute that command as
rude which isn't so secure on a
commercial device when you ship millions
of them so after we tripped about a
hundred fifty thousand somebody
basically found out if they typed in
reboot while it would reboot like hey
how about that so they typed an RM VAR f
star and it perked their phone they're
like i bricked my phone woohoo oh shit
but you know the people who are familiar
with linux were like oh that's no good
and so it became like a haha look at
google haha and we're like you know so
so we've made those mistakes we've made
other mistakes we had a telnet Damon
running as user 0 hmm that's no good and
then you know so we fix those input shut
those fixes very fairly quickly in my
opinion so in a lot of things like
security always is it's how humans react
when they screw up because we always
always screw up and then you have the
issues that are brought about by people
who want to have market uniqueness or
want to modify how the phone works so
that worked within their business model
and that's caused interesting question
that's around security and well you know
we don't know that we want them to be
like download ringtones and for us
ringtones are really a file know how do
you really want to make that some files
can exist in some can't how do you
approach that and and the reality is we
all know as technologists that these are
kind of artificial distinctions and thus
are often so convenable so yeah the
other thing that i like to point out is
for all the worry about radios being
exploited and all the rest for the
advice is where the radios were action
available for instance in the linksys
wrt routers on the number of people who
actually change the powers was socialite
us to be unnoticeable and it never
became a problem beyond the theoretical
so and we haven't seen it yet with the
phone we've shipped a little over a
million phones so that's the story and
I'm happy to answer any questions about
that if it was that kind of thing you
were looking for from me on also yeah
okay yes no no good good you know your
gamma we need a microphone you just keep
it yes yeah really I'm playing a vamp in
the VIP room it one of the obvious ones
is are you doing anything or playing you
do anything with respect to sim chips
what do you mean with respect to
symmetry well interaction with
leveraging them yeah I mean you can
obviously pop them out of line again so
so this is the funny thing so when a
carrier ships a phone they have a
concept of which sims they want to lock
you into so we ship a regular dev phone
where you can pick whatever you want you
put in the AP the network information
that you want and that's fine one of the
the battle we chose to fight with
Android was to have an open source cell
phone operating system we knew that we
know that actually the best cell phone
for the world in our opinion is one that
allows for a free and fair internet
right now free and fair or cell phone
marketplace we also know that if you
look at a lot of the marketplaces
especially the United States that's
going to be slow going so we decided
let's let's start with an open
marketplace if we can get there and
certainly an open source phone operating
system and sort of raise the bar what
people can at least expect from a
quality perspective on a cell phone and
then let's fight those battles as we
come to them over the years it's
certainly not going to happen overnight
i mean if if you look at the like
t-mobile for instance they have a policy
a lot of people to know this but if
you've had a tmobile phone for six
months in the tmobile account with a
two-year contract for instance you can
call them up and they'll give you the
unlock code for the sim I mean they've
got you they are there you know they've
got you've been there for nine
to your past the part where you can
return it in California or whatever
they're happy to give you the unlock
codes so there's a lot of reasons why
tmobile is sort of a good first partner
with us so but yeah I mean we're not
gonna win every battle right out of the
gate and so to a degree we've self
defeated ourselves hi hi so I know you
just said you were trying to build a
cell phone operating system not a PDA
operating system but it is let me ask
let me ask the sort of you know next
generation PDA questions there are a
number of people who are interested in
making their PDA smarter and actually
having their PDAs I mean the cognitive
radios only one example of cases where
you would imagine there's an app on the
phone generating new code that it wishes
to load into the execution stream of at
least some of the communications
behavior of the phone or some of the
applications behavior it's customizing
to it's User reclaiming yeah damn thing
how do you envision that in this world
in what you're trying to you've got an
app which you've secured but it's
generating new code which right or do
you we just say hopeless or I'm a fruit
people no no I actually I think it's
quite helpful you know I mean you know
so for instance there are certain apps
right now that have come out where
you're dialing a number but what it's
really doing is calling your skype
account and having it dial your number
and you know so we have apps like that
right now which you're in my mind fairly
innovative choices and there's a sip
client now where if you dial a number
you're really dialing a sip server and
that was something we knew could work
and we made it we made certain
accommodations but they had to write
some native code and sort of work their
way through the system to make it work
the thing is we try to make these things
available and to say here's the phone
here's access to the different parts and
we know that people are going to do
things that will consider fairly
specious and our only real leverage
there's will say we'll listen we can't
put that in the marketplace we can't you
know ship that out officially but if
they won't install it if people want to
install this they're going to do it so
how much are we really going to fight
that how much is that really a problem
so
well so i think we enable it an awful
lot but basically having an environment
people can create general-purpose
programs they can exist in the
background then not super sandbox the
way that Apple does and so people will
certainly abuse that for evil but who
cares you know I mean we feel that it's
better to for the sophisticated users
right who are going to click that
unknown sources box that's a significant
event if you think about it I mean how
many people of the million-plus phones
we ship actually will want to hit
unknown sources and allow that to happen
right yeah these two guys over here but
they're obviously UNIX people so but
yeah so so we've enabled it to a great
degree I mean you can do an awful lot
with native calls so I mean it's it's
linux right so at that point so it's
pretty pretty cool but we have another
speaker too i don't wanna you know yeah
okay I've been asked me to speak for
five minutes or maybe a little more
about what kind of attacks we see at
Google you know network and application
layer attacks I guess that's the context
of course that's a bit of a challenge
right we do see a lot of attacks all day
long so covering everything in five
minutes is challenging I wish like the
earlier session we had more numbers in
this panel but security and attacks in
particular really murky topic if you go
to the RSA proceedings you can see our
team Steve Weiss and John for Flynn gave
our best view of metrics on security
attacks that are seen both on the
outside and and within Google but that's
pretty hard to calibrate against my
anecdotal gut feeling for what the bad
guys are trying to do to us so let me
just go over my perception of what the
main attacks are the we face I would
categorize those into
kinds there are the attacks that are in
some sense not really our fault they may
be there are problem because our if our
users are attacked we care but they're
the classic kinds of attacks that happen
all over the place and they're somewhat
outside of our control that's the kind
of thing that we still care about but
there's another kind of attack that
squarely ours to control you know some
place where we've made a bug and those
are the ones of course we have to spend
more time on it's interesting though
that the actual data breaches you know
the actual loss of user information
which is my pet you know my obsession on
trying to make sure that never ever
happens tends to happen more in the
first category of text and second
counter attacks so we don't actually put
our energies mostly where the main
problem is it's sort of an interesting
you know why is that I think that's
pretty true and risk analysis known
through the whole world there are people
perceive the risk as much more
disturbing when it's outside of their
control so so in the first category of
attacks you know what are one of the
things that really do wind up losing
people's data the the Prime one by far
that we observe is malware it's just
rampant out there it's really a problem
it's a problem for us even as a
corporation but it's especially a
problem for our users when we look at
why someone's mail got leaked to the
internet or something in every case
we've investigated through our logs it's
turned out that it's because a bad guy
was able to somehow steal their password
and just logged in from some distant
address that that individual had ever
been at and there was no password
guessing involved or anything that
sorted they just had used a password to
login so that's the number one problem
if you're looking for you know what's
the main security issue to work on
that's that's absolutely it we try to
address that in various ways we have a
fair chunk of my team that that looks at
anti-malware and anti-phishing
approaches as we crawl the web we're
looking using various
needs try to guess at which content
we've downloaded might be malware and
then run that in some virtual
environment to see what it does when you
execute it and and if it clearly is
installing software and changing
registry entries and clearly is bad then
we'll flag those as malware right so if
you do a search actually a fair fraction
of the time you'll get back a result
that says you don't really want to go
there because it'll down you know it'll
install bad things in your machine so so
that's sort of our first issue this
malware is still in credentials off your
disk it's modifying files it's executing
code which may be running a course
inside an intranet and with your
permission so it's really nasty and we
do what we can to protect you from it
but it's fundamentally your machine not
ours so there are limits to what we can
do we can't even denounce everything
that we find because it would be
terrible if we ever were falsely
denouncing somebody so we try to err on
the side of being cautious we've made
mistakes in January I hear a chuckle
over here in January you may recall a
period of about half an hour when we
decided that everything on the internet
was malware no maybe that's not far
wrong but that was a little excessive so
you know so we learned some good lessons
about how many layers of checking when
needs you know fortunately had multiple
layers of checking and some of them
caught it but when in one place it
slipped through so so Miller's one
it's the only time it was true yeah the
other thing and this won't surprise you
either is spam all right there's email
spam coming in you know I I switch to
gmail before I came to Google because it
just was doing good spam filming for me
and I was having a hard time even hiring
that service from anyone else so
filtering spam on the way in is is a
tough problem but when you've got lots
of data to work from it it gets a little
easier we also try to work hard to make
sure we don't get used to spam others
we've got a lot of mail infrastructure
so so there's that there's other kinds
of spam blogs and people trying to play
games with web page ranking and so forth
so those are all classic kinds of
problems at the network level so when we
talk about the NSX that now we get into
sort of more technical tax right and we
absolutely are seeing those this is a
very live problem as recently as a
couple weekends ago you know we saw that
PR was up there as having assigned but
actually dot PR had gotten compromised
so if you tried to go to google.com dot
PR you got sent to a malicious site off
in Germany somewhere that was definitely
not Google you know they were pretending
to have defaced the google page no
actually they compromised dot PR so yes
dns is a problem we see poisoning
attacks around the world if you're
sending mail to somebody at Google you
know you have to think about well did
somebody along the chain that smtp
store-and-forward compromised a dns then
the mail will get routed somewhere else
right so DNS is very important we would
love to see security there and in a sec
has a way to distribute search with
terrific so that's good we see
occasionally bgp attacks that that
affect us you remember an incident with
pakistan forth we see network layer
attacks even in a place like this be a
conference and
somebody will hijack dhcp and you you
know you pop open a browser session and
try to go someplace and if you click
through a certificate warning bingo
they've got you right so definitely be
worried about the network it's a hostile
environment and then finally there's at
the network layer there's dental service
attacks but we have constantly here I
think that are we are reasonably
effective at fending those off but it's
never it's it's a never-ending game
against these denial of service I'm
sorry did denial of service distributed
denial of service like pulling teeth
yeah so are the main issue really with
defense areas minimizing the collateral
damage and minimizing the chance that
someone can take Google's vast array of
servers and network capacity and so
forth and turning it against either
ourselves or even worse against other
people so that's there's a lot to be
done on das and and that's another I
would say like malware is another very
fertile area for research love to talk
with people about that surprisingly
insider attacks are not high on this
list we tend not to see that very much
and we're looking constantly for that
around here I don't know where the
eighty percent of all attacks or insider
attacks comes from that I certainly does
not consistent with what I see but
malware looks a lot like an insider
attack so from a from the point of view
of detection it may as well be the same
thing so I said those are there were two
categories so let's get to the second
category the things where our team
spends all its time there are a lot of
things one can do wrong when you're
writing web applications right there's
there's of course all the classic things
we have to worry about just like any
Enterprise making sure the perimeter is
secure making sure that we evolve
towards not just network segmentation
defense but defenses that are much more
focused on on access controls right
close to the data so we were hearing
this morning I completely into of that
but
from a company like Google's perspective
most of our energy goes into trying to
make sure that the engineers writing
software and innovating at a high rate
have the right tools and education and
backup from security reviews and various
external audits and responses to outside
reports against things like cross-site
scripting so yesterday I think it was
the New York Times there was an article
talking about you know what is cross
site scripting and giving an example in
line which turned into a cross-site
scripting attack so it's ironic it's the
stuff is very very tricky essentially
you have to make sure that you every
time you're going to put out a page that
you're sending back to the user's
browser you know the context that the
bites are in so you know whether it's
JavaScript ratio over what and you do
the proper kind of escaping for that
context and never ever screw up keep
track of what's coming from the user and
make sure its escape so we're getting
better as time goes by at using template
systems with Auto escaping built-in but
that's still a major source of attacks
we don't actually see any cases where
actual user data has been lost that way
but it would be very easy for that to
happen so we focus a lot of attention on
that cross site request forgery another
good example right where the bad guys
can can send something to you that
causes your browser to make a request
back to the server with all of your
credentials cookies or whatever whatever
the mechanism is by which your
authorized and trick your browser into
making some change stay on the server in
our case changing setting up a special
custom filter on your account right that
was a kind of thing that one could do
for a short period of time we found out
about it and fix that instantly of
course we care about these things a lot
so those are the nature of we have
application vulnerabilities that were
constantly fighting it feels like
there's some progress ten years ago we
would have been talking about buffer
overflow attacks or format string
vulnerabilities and those don't come up
so often anymore so we're making some
progress but it doesn't feel like we're
getting close to
it just feels like we're we're pushing
the ball along and we've got different
set of things to worry about other
things that you have to worry about if
you're a company like Google is
understanding so much about the browser
that you know what subtle things that
browser may do to try to interpret you
right so the browser's the web grew up
in this world where you would be very
relaxed about what kind of errors could
be in the input the browser would just
do its best job to render it anyway no
matter you know what kind of errors were
there as security people we're trying to
reverse engineer that process we we
publish a browser security handbook that
details for every of the major browsers
and every one of the different weird
features you know character set and
content sniffing and how they handle
cookies and you know all these different
features how this works so that our
engineers can look through and come up
with a scheme that will work on all
these browsers without holes that's very
challenging there's another comparable
sets it's an easier task but there's a
comparable set of things about proxies
if you don't get exactly the right cash
header controls some proxy out in the
Middle's nowhere will save up some
content that was intended for just a
specific user so that's tricky so you
have to know your your application
environment and I guess finally I'd say
there are another part of network
technology that's really important it
comes to the EV certs is SSL I mean I
just don't understand why SSL is not
more widely used sure we should worry
about the certs but first before
everything else L they switched to SSL
so you know in Gmail you if you care
about security you should reach into the
settings and say only use SSL because
there are people out there taking these
hijack networks and trying to trick your
browser into using HTTP even though you
started out with ssl they'll try to
suddenly come in on the side so yes we
want it so we've ramped up quite a lot
of capacity here at Google and the the
next step on that front is really to
work more closely with the browsers of
course the fact we have a browser helps
but it doesn't give us
monopoly control or something this has
to be a collaborative effort with with
all the people out there to find ways to
reduce the number of round trips when
we're starting up ssl that's really
essential because latency does really
matter to people that's probably the
main thing today that would prevent us
just from saying let's just use s to
sell all the time for everything right
it's it does actually have an impact on
people so okay III just about stopped
there I you have a very nice paper out
there by Tom Leighton on how the
network's evolving to push more content
out close to the edge and we completely
agree with that the one security
provides all I have is that we have a
pretty strong physical security around
our data centers I'm pretty comfortable
with that we also are going down the
same path of putting cashes out close to
the user because that's that's again the
way you're going to get speed and that's
perfectly sensible and easy for public
content let's say YouTube videos perfect
fit for your gmail content not so sure
providing the physical security that
sort of our guarantees that no one's
going to get to your data I'm not
comfortable with so if the world's
switching all to SSL we have a bit of a
problem about how we're going to do
cashing out close to the edge so leave
you with that thanks one obvious one is
as you're seeing these incidents are you
capturing them in iodophor the miter CVE
sweet and are you reporting
vulnerabilities to anybody or is it
basically an in-house exercising so um
that's an interesting question
traditionally Google was focused
completely on a server based thing where
the attitude was as soon as there's a
problem we'll just patch on our server
and no user even knows or her needs to
care about that so it wasn't as
essential to have all of those things
reported in it with a CVE number so that
enterprise security officers could know
whether they checked off that that
vulnerability paanch as we get more
client software out there chrome say it
does make more sense to report those
things even though with chrome
we're taking a very aggressive we patch
everybody we're not giving you choices
right which is maybe a bit controversial
but we are convinced this is the only
way forward in security i mean the the
time scale for the bad guys to look at a
patch reverse-engineer it start and
exploit and actually put users at risk
means we can't afford this let the
enterprise cogitate on it for a month
that just doesn't work anymore so i just
wanted to ask about d dos and you
mentioned it but can you just say a
little bit more about the the frequency
the scale i mean it's it's part that
it's a it's a problem that is a
consequence of you know the architecture
or the infrastructure yes right and and
so it would be really useful that they
understand a little bit more about you
know healthy Billy how big what you
would like to see happen to mitigate
this fact but so we get all kinds of
attacks right there's both UDP and TCP
enough rtcp that lots of the classic
problems about trying to figure out who
it is you know which IP address is
really coming from is not such a problem
but you can't say anything absolutely
yes there are still UDP attacks that we
care about and and so yeah we're
interested in that as well but what what
I would really like to see is the
following we currently do all our dose
defense within our own environment and
that fundamentally is the wrong approach
i believe the right approach i believe
is to detect the attack here and to push
the filters as close to the source as
possible so one of the things I was
doing at bell labs before I came here
was to build a little box that could go
into the carrier's network ideally close
to those dsl lines and a protocol that
allowed even during the network
congestion times that occur when there's
a Doss attack allowed some upstream
control
an enterprise like Google to the
carrier's filtering box saying if
there's any packet coming from that IP
address to me throw it away because I
promise you I will throw it away you may
as well save your network bandwidth over
there and there are other you know other
approaches that have suggested pushing
that upstream through bgp and so forth
but you know it's a bit challenging to
make that work in in network congestion
chimes so that's what I'd really like to
see the trouble is it needs cooperation
between a lot of different players and
so it's hard to bring that to market
we've heard from for geeks and I think
it's time we should hear Mary Schmidt
how it'll be hard and I'll be around for
so hold your you know come catch me
during a break if you have more
questions I just want to add three
letters and two numbers to the answer
that he just gave that's bc p38 please
thanks for the promotion appreciated
that yeah we all get sent to the Schmidt
house one time or another anyway thanks
for the opportunity that the good thing
about being last is all the really
important stuff was said but I get this
sort of a pine on it and and have a few
pieces of it I want to start out by the
comment about Android specifically and
there was I mean the question about EV
certs and expenses and stuff there was a
really neat quote i found one time it
says there is scarcely anything in the
world that some man cannot make a little
worse and sell a little bit more cheaply
the person who buys that on price alone
is this man's lawful prey and if we ever
see anything going on the internet today
that they're in is one of those things
that we see on a regular basis the other
thing i want to touch on briefly it was
a comment that Eric had made the real
Eric when he was here about criminality
on the network
and stuff my first movement in this area
was back in the days of bulletin board
systems are be long live our BBS but
when we I was running a combination CPM
users group ham radio and a packet radio
bulletin board systems and I think
Commodore 64's or something at the time
and started to get notifications about
these bulletin board systems used for
distribution of child pornography which
is generally pretty much unacceptable
and having been as they refer to as as a
time of geek with a gun of being law
enforcement it started sort of down this
path of where I am today but but
basically listening to the previous
speakers and a lot of things that are
going on I want to touch on a few things
one of the things particularly when we
start looking into development world
misses this has been a bone of
contention for a long long time my first
recollection of a buffer overrun
incident was long before we've ever seen
anything around the Mars for him or
anything else about around that it was
basically a system operator their system
manager that was trying to get access to
a system that couldn't found out how I
could break out of a routine once an
arbitrary code and get the access they
need so wasn't even malicious but yet
today we see a nerd convention about you
know buffer overruns and these sort of
things even though they may not be
relevant to getting attacked they still
seem to be an attack vector that are
being inadvertently built in to code
that we're writing today and from an
international perspective which what has
been asked me to sort of focus on the
best I can is what we're seeing now
particularly in some developing nations
the hand-me-downs that we have are
winding up in these environments and I
think of some of the developing
countries were some of the old banking
systems that we have gotten rid of years
ago are now those systems that are the
core basis of what they're using to do
their financial tracks transactions so
the ability that we have today to
withstand some of the threats by the
modern systems are being irrelevant to
them because they don't even have the
there but yet they're a part of that
global financial system that we're in
the day so the in one of the things that
I think is really interesting from a DoD
perspective and I've seen this with mo d
in the UK seen it with some of the NATO
countries as well and numbers pretty
consistent that the successful
intrusions into their systems whether
it's for exfiltration of data whether
it's to instance lace the malware or
whatever the motivation may be and it
varies from one end of the spectrum to
the other is running at about 75% plus
based on known vulnerabilities and
software that have not been mitigated
for 90 days or further that continue to
allow someone have access that could
have been patched should have been
patched but for a multitude of reasons
we're not patched which gave that that
foothold getting into the system and so
when you know once again Eric talking
about some of the things that are going
on that we have been fixing there's one
fundamental thing that we have not fixed
and that's the whole issue of the
software development lifecycle we're
getting better at it we're seeing
reductions but invariably will still see
the same issue the other thing which
touches directly to this subject as well
as looking at the mobile community now a
number of us have been concerned about
this for quite a while and I realize the
work with Zoe left on the Android but
yeah Chris hilarious I'm sorry Chris you
you're off your blue ball and I didn't
recognize you sorry but you know when
you talk about you know the code signing
of the things to go into it especially
when the spectrum has opened up the
third party applications that basically
run into the context of Astra of a route
basis that now are trusted environments
that then spawn some child process those
are the issues that we have little
control over and I think of you know app
world on the blackberry iphone and and
all the App Store going on there all
these things going out there and the
progression that we've had and I'll give
you a personal illustration here RSA
last year infosecurity last year were
the first two years and I
since I can remember lugging a lug of
our lug about around to some sort of a
show because wireless may have been
available somewhere I did not take a
laptop to the show floor with me
everything I wanted to do could do I
could do a one on two mobiles that I had
whether it was booking hotels changing
flights doing online banking finding
what the bid was for me when ebay got
rid of me or whatever the case may be I
could do it on a mobile device and every
time I turn around I'm looking to yet
install another application it gives me
the ability to do something else that
presumably assigned that presumably is
in many cases from a valid source
doesn't have to be a third-party
malicious malware generating system that
basically can still have that same
vulnerability that can still be
exploited that still gives us access now
from an international perspective that's
magnified much greater than what we have
here because this has been a way of life
in Asian countries in particular and
growing increasingly in Europe where
rarely do you see someone walking around
without a mobile device hanging around
their neck and doing everything they
need to do with it so if you start
looking at that natural progression and
the thing that many of us have been
championing for a couple years now is as
we evolve here there's always a
complaint about fighting last the last
battle and we've learned an awful lot
from the finding those battles and we
move from the browsers and Internet male
connectors and the servers to the
desktops and then adapt desktops the
laptops and now we're moving this entire
environment to the mobile environment
and we have to start anticipating these
things the other thing that that I think
is really relevant and its really
interesting how we in industry and my
first really really insight into this is
when I left the white house and went to
ebay and looking at the broad spectrum
of things looking at you know the whole
issue about protecting our assets our
customer data HR data all financial data
everything we need to look at and when
it came down the discussion but what
about the hunt nothing at that time is
bike 114 million end users but
Security's their problem it's not our
problem and I can guarantee every time
somebody became a victim of a phishing
email or had some money lost out of the
bank that went to the local congressman
it starts to become our problem and so
the concept of not only taking care of
our resources our assets to protect them
for whatever reason and generally good
reasons you know to protect our
intellectual property our shareholder
value you name it but we also have to
remember that the end user now becomes
our responsibility because they have no
one else to blame but you know the the
browser issue that I'm dealing with now
that allows someone they get access to
my computer because I didn't update and
therein lies one of the issues and
speaking of that when we when we get in
that issue as well talking briefly about
the browser issues and the browser its
ability to do things a few years ago as
we start to roll out EV search which I'm
a tremendous fan of so you want to make
that very very clear a matter of fact we
just did a paper from the online trust
alliance on EV search and
notwithstanding some of the technical
issues where longer to resolve longer to
you know get the verification
information back etc etc it's still much
better than standing out there in a
snowstorm naked I mean having a little
bit of extra protection is there so but
but with this concept one of the issues
was that there was a vulnerability and
if I remember correctly was I e6 and
below that allowed you to actually embed
a graphic image over anywhere on the
page for specifically the URL bar so
what happens you can actually go out
there go to a malicious site and the
overlay would be a green extended
verification validation that you're with
is the limit legitimate site those are
the sort of things that once again we
have to anticipate and as we build the
next generation of things we're doing we
have to take those things into
consideration and once again that was
related back to a vulnerability in the
browser itself that should not have been
there that we knew how not to do that
but nonetheless it took place
are we doing on time with a couple more
minutes here yeah time for questions I
mean let me hit on a couple other things
in real quick and once again another one
of my soapbox issues ipv6 which I'm once
again when I was at the White House we
put specifically in the national
strategy to secure cyberspace
immediately implementation of ipv6 and
of course I was challenged by many
people saying yeah but ipv6 is not a
security fix and absolutely true it's
not but when you start looking at the
the wii architecture and implementation
of ipv6 that include such things as DNS
SEC secure bgp ipsec is being sort of
the normal state as opposed to a change
state well clearly that goes a long way
to doing what we're doing and now we're
standing the fact of running out piya IP
addresses in the next year or two which
is our own self and self inflicted deed
us if we wind up letting that happen and
let's see I did have a couple other
notes you want to make sure I don't
overlook here trusted oh the interesting
comment you made on the the data set the
data centers and then the physical
security of that one of the things we've
seen particularly as we start to evolve
into the centralized data facility
colocation etc one of the one of the
concerns we've had which is not a
technology issue but it's just a human
factor issue and that's access to these
things I think back where I have my my
various domains three hosted places that
I can then go access there and I want to
I want to change the maps want to change
out a hard drive i want to change out a
server i can get physical access to that
facility although there may be other
applications and other servers running
in there that have nothing to do with me
so the whole issue of getting access
that sort of thing just by a physical
issue is something else we worry about
and once again we start looking
internationally where they don't have
the resources that we have here in the
united states and that become
a big problem where you can go in there
and so as we get better about making
things more secure physical access is
going to be more important because
people can actually go in and start you
know dropping some rogue dll's on
systems that you wouldn't wouldn't have
a clue that they were even done so in
clothing and closing I just want to make
one quick perspective on how much better
we're doing and if you think back to
just the past few years and phishing
emails the first email the first
phishing email I got was in 1996 it was
an AOL account that basically one of my
user ID and password specifically for
the reasons that they were looking to
hijack my account so they didn't have to
pay for the access that was back there
was like six dollars an hour and six
cents a minute over that and that's what
it was designed for today we call it a
phishing email where we have evolved to
from a technology perspective think of
what if you were a phishing email what
it would take to get you to be a
successful executor of the criminal
activity you have to get through and I
love it i'm whoever said it was my first
account on gmail or specifically that to
beat all the spam that was going out
there and so it has to get past the
server level the internet male connector
layer first gets into the server then
it's cali go through some internal
enterprise or individual spam filtering
regime then it gets into the client side
whether it's Eudora outlook whatever
you're using in there it's got to get
past that layer then if it makes it into
the inbox which it made at some point
too and then most new email clients have
the ability to turn off links by default
so you can't even click the link unless
you do something proactively then once
you do that then you hit the browser
side and whether it's chrome whether
it's Safari whatever it may be all have
anti-phishing technology built into it
so if you become a victim of phishing
email today you really really have to
work at it and that's the thing that we
need to do is we move forward on the
mobile devices and everything else we
have to put make it more difficult for
the criminal to get to the end layer
from the security perspective than it is
for us to get where we want to be
make it much more difficult for them
than it is for us anyway that's it
thanks thank you I have just a couple
I'm going to take the same for Robin if
the comment on things played before to
say a couple of quick things you will
mention the general problem with
passwords and tangential to that let me
just note that there are two people in
the security for freshen father and son
both named Robert Morris and the Sun is
very well known as the author of the
Morris worm the father slightly less
well known but he was the chief
scientist of the national computer
security center he was also the author
of the UNIX password encryption
algorithm so I have an exam question
which of these people did more damage to
network security and just Erica went
remark on this I like this you know how
what's what's the first buffer overrun
timeshare had one in its password a
verification the password the bit that
said you were logged in was up beyond
the end of the password if you type
longer the password you got logged in
okay and sounds a question already
queued you're on yeah I guess so so I
had a question for maybe the whole panel
which I guess they could they'll be
assembled Charlie okay so so we have a
some security that goes for our channel
our channel security we also have
concerns about denial of service attacks
which is kind of access to the network
versus the legitimacy of the data that's
carried over that in the thing when I
was up there talking earlier it seems to
me that for somebody who's in the kind
of the research side where I don't have
to be as attached to all the things that
are there now a model in which data at
rest and data in motion carried over
networks is really using the same kind
of encryption key management and all
that would allow us to deposit objects
if you will you know messages and so on
in places and the author has some say
about the
status of that thing in the use controls
and it seems to me that right now the
way things are we're kind of far away
from that and so from you know what
would you do in research point of view
is this a worthy path to go down
basically securing the data separately
so the data can be secured outside of
the servers that sits in which relates
to the access to in cash data that's
outside of the data centers or is this
already been done and not worth doing I
think my own view is it hasn't been done
it's it's if I understood you very worth
doing because there are three three ways
in which you find data in motion at rest
and in execution and if you look at a
cloud computing model there are
different degrees of control that you
can exercise over data in these
different modes particularly low in
execution and so also particularly given
the key management for communications
data and key management for data at rest
differ substantially in what you have to
do because in the case of data at rest
key recovery dominates all the other
concerns I think that this is something
that has not been done uniformly and in
one of the foremost you know solvable
child immediate challenges in particular
of a cloud viewpoint but yeah probably
somebody yeah I could not agree more i
mean we've been sir we miss in doing
things like that you look at the entire
spectrum where we start why are why is
date is so valuable of people because
they can do something with it if you
rendered unusable to them well there
goes the incentive to do some of the
things unless we can become a hundred
percent reliable and writing code that
doesn't have any vulnerabilities that
give somebody the ability to get access
to it well then we wouldn't need to
worry about it but we do so you look at
that entire spectrum and you need to
have that ability to use the pki to
actually make this entire thing work
which and i didn't get a chance to
comment i had to note here about
government stuff if there's anything the
government could ever do for me and a
technology perspective as passed a law
making it illegal to use a user ID and
password right away just post everybody
saw
security number on the internet make it
available to everybody and declare it
unveil bull for use as well you do those
two things and then we'll be put in a
place where those solutions you're
referring to would be on the road map
and roadmap very quickly yes so I have
one more response to that that question
if I could just get a word in there we
see some interesting opportunities if
indeed it's protect the way you were
saying so I was really intrigued by your
comment that not only is it pushing the
protection close to the data when it's
on the server but to such an extent that
you can even pick up that piece of data
presumably encrypted and copy to USB
Drive and it's still just as well
protected there's some key management
I'd I want to ask you about afterwards
but but the but the but the issue fur
for Google is if it's completely
encrypted and the key is held only by
the distant user there are a lot of bulk
processing operations that we can't do
on your behalf so we can't speculative
try translating all your mail from
English to German so we can there are a
lot of interesting things that that then
are precluded and so that's a tension
that we're we're struggling with it so
the more subtle way of describing what i
was after is not that it would be a
single envelope but rather a
hierarchical or a separable role-based
envelope where I would say I'm
delegating this chunk of this data to be
processed by cloud the rest of it has
the following use controls associated
with it and I control that so I can
index it maybe or maybe you can index it
or some subset of you could index it and
I get those kind of controls but the key
management problem for that is really
hard I think there is a key issue here
bruh however 1904 we were confronted
with radio it was so valuable nobody can
ignore it but it had the problem that
bypassed all existing information
security controls cryptography rescued
us from that this time we have the cloud
potentially so valuable nobody can stay
in business without making use of other
people's offers to do their computing
for them but it is not clear at least to
me how you
can give somebody your data to compute
with and still protect them to your own
use and that confrontation is going to
take somebody younger and smarter than I
am to figure out if there is a magic
solution but there are lots of ways in
which the technicalities we now know can
be a can be applied to make the network
more secure from many viewpoints not
from all of them well you know it's it's
also interesting you know we talked
about putting these fairly high ceremony
systems around data and around user
submitted content even run copyright and
in I know someone is going to say this
one might as well be me sometimes
they're too hard for people to do and
and and not just hard from a technical
perspective then would be easy they
might be hard from a well I just wanted
to I just wanted to push her at this
website forget about it kind of
perspective I mean one of the things
that that HTML and HTTP and the internet
sort of taught me personally was that it
was so easy to anyone could do it so
everyone did and and and this is why i
feel like the semantic approaches have
been failing is because they should
require one degree on the semantics
thereof right so when you create these
systems that require a lot of things
that the user really never cease except
in that it doesn't prey on them in some
way but the thing they actually get out
of it is is the heart is now what's left
after this pile of hard thing it just
doesn't get done you know otherwise we
would be using PGP we should be using
all this stuff and I think this is also
part of why we see so much resistance to
DNS sack right people end up giving up
the power to just create unfettered
without having to talk to somebody else
about him so okay we had a 97 goes a lot
of things into one paragraph there but
yeah you choose hi I was first so we
have we perhaps remember the poor
teacher who as the verdict seem to say
showed to her children pornography and
it was because her machine was infected
with malware so we here seem to be
focusing on preventing this from
happening at all well I'm sort of
surprised about the repudiation or
non-repudiation of this like after the
fact why don't we have any mechanism in
place to
have this teacher or have us a here I
can prove now afterwards that I didn't
do it well I can tell you and you know
some of the laws that I know on the
subject quite prior to computers
evidence that you wasn't voluntary isn't
a defense well having done the computer
forensics from the very beginning there
are ways to do that and do the non
attribution it's it's a typical rubriz
used by criminals to say see I didn't
know it was on there but it was out
there hacking machines all by itself or
whatever so but there are ways to do it
from a technical perspective the issue
is we should never let it be happening
to begin with and a lot of our
discussions turn around that we have
discussions about those of us in
technology that they would not have a
problem doing these things we have to
consider the rest of the world a billion
users now probably two billion within
the next three years how do we wind up
making this easy for them and not to
become in that position so it's funny we
had this discussion around I don't
remember the exact option but there's an
option and internet explorer 6 on where
basically you can tighten up the
security but if you do that you break
the ability to create Ajax web
applications for all intents purposes so
none of the browser's adopted this
security posture and in fact you know
Mike Rizzo says don't adopt this because
if you do everything you want to use on
the internet won't really work but in
fact we'd actually solve a lot of the
problems like turning off JavaScript who
solves many problems yeah it's more yeah
and so we talked about like no will if
you just do right in the first place and
I agree with you if we do right in the
first place that's great but get doing
rain the first place actually keeps
people from doing something you know
then it won't matter all right so so so
it's that problem there I'm sorry so I
wanted to ask anyone in the know there's
a newly formulated alternative to tcp
called the sctp stream control transfer
protocol which has a number of built-in
security features like for a handshake
verification tags different from
sequence number
and so on so what is the you are take
whether it is more secure than TCP or
whether it is fighting the best battle
essentially sounds like your alley boy
in league with the broad title figures
there's lots of solutions and in
networking we have to get everybody to
agree on something and it's that so hard
that okay these fees already out there
and it's a lot of people using its fine
and we can build ssl on top of that and
get a secure connection so it's not like
SSL over TCP is the only possible way to
go but it's already so widely deployed
you need a major increment to displace
it so thank you all very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
