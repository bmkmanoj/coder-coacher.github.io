pleased to introduce professor Raja
gulab micarta he's a professor of
astronomy at UC Santa Cruz and he's an
expert on galaxy formation and under
andromeda and he's gonna give us a talk
about our place in the cosmos
today he's also started a innovative
program for high school students to do
research at UC Santa Cruz in the summer
and he's gonna talk a little bit about
that towards the end of the talk so I am
thrilled to introduce Roger thanks a lot
Jeff and thanks Boris can you hear me
okay at the at the back there okay great
and thank you both for setting this up
in fact the high school program that
Jeff mentioned is the exact reason for
my connection to Jeff his daughter's in
in this program so I'm going to talk
about that at the very end and I see a
bunch of high school students I see a
bunch of middle school students here at
middle lower elementary elementary even
better good to start early so I'm gonna
talk about galaxies today but I want to
explain why it's important to talk about
galaxies I'm going to explain why I
study galaxies and so the title of
today's talk is our place in the cosmos
and what I want to do is explain why you
know why galaxies have any connection at
all to you you and me by way of you know
giving credit where it's due
these many of the slides you'll see
today most of the narrative you'll see
today was put together with with the
help of one of my colleagues at the UC
Santa Cruz astronomy department her name
is Sandra Faber sandy has been studying
galaxies for 30 years she's one of the
world's experts study of galaxy
formation and evolutions I've had the
privilege of working with her we've
worked together to keep this narrative
current as as the years have gone by
we've adapted our story to new findings
we've adapted the images and animations
to new findings so I hope to give you a
little bit of us a tiny flavor of the
kind of galaxy research that goes on at
Santa Cruz and and around
the world so I wanted to put it a little
bit of a disclaimer also that astronomy
and cosmology are often confused with
astrology gastronomy and cosmetology and
I just want to set those three topics
aside they actually rear their ugly head
more often than I care in in my study
especially when people find out I'm from
India and I study astronomy I always get
asked about palmistry and telling the
future I know absolutely nothing about
astrology I know a little bit about
gastronomy it keeps me alive and I know
really as you can tell looking at me i
know nothing about cosmetology at all so
but uh where they do really ugly hair
i'll mention them but i you know this is
a good example of cosmetology rearing
its ugly head
no pun intended so let me let me
actually give you a little bit of a
roadmap of where we're going to go with
this with this narrative today so i'll
start with our place in the universe and
the cosmos and it turns out our place in
the cosmos is directly linked to a
concept that's best thought of as
recycling recycling of chemicals
recycling of the elements in the
periodic table but done by the cosmos
not done by West value recycling is done
by on a much larger scale in the cosmos
and it's done inside galaxies galaxies
are cost the cosmos as recycling plants
now galaxies do a whole bunch of things
in addition to cosmic recycling they are
also cannibals they like to eat their
own they like to eat their children in
particular so nothing to be scared about
your kids your parents are not at all
like that but but galaxies in fact do
this all the time and I'll talk about
how cannibalism plays an important role
in in galaxies so you can see gastronomy
is already rearing its ugly head here
the formation of galaxies involves
cannibalism but only in the late stages
of galaxy evolution today there's a lot
of cannibalism going on in the Milky Way
in Andromeda but in the early stages you
don't have cannibalism because there's
nothing to cannibalize you need to have
galaxies in place for them to
cannibalize one another so the early
stages of galaxy formation actually
involve other
and I'll talk a little bit about that
the early formation of galaxies involves
ripples in the fabric of the cosmos I'll
talk a little bit about the processes
that give rise to those ripples it has
to do with quantum mechanics has to do
with a phenomenon called inflation not
the economic kind but the kind the
universe does and it has to do with
gravity so I'll talk about those things
and at the at near the end of the the
science part of the presentation what I
want to emphasize is that astronomy is a
physical science so like like everything
in there in the sciences it's
evidence-based so if I tell you a story
I have to also tell you the basis behind
the story why you know why do we believe
the story why do we believe what we
believe not just what we believe so I'll
tell you a little bit about this
evidence and that really has to do with
using telescopes as time machines to
test theoretical predictions okay so
I'll start with our place in the cosmos
and if I could have the lights down a
little bit in the front of the room if
possible because many of my slides have
a dark background I don't know if that's
easy to do if not it's things are pretty
visible on this on the screen anywhere I
just realized that many of my you know
the night sky is dark so when I take
pictures the night sky the background is
dark it's all my fault it really is that
way but Jeff this is already helping a
lot yeah this is this is good so oh this
is even better yeah thank you thank you
so when I think of our place in the
cosmos I think of my you know my
favorite people up there you might think
of your favorite people up there I so
I'm gonna put up an example of who I
think of when I think of our place in
the cosmos you know on the right is my
and my is my daughter she was seven
years old at that time and on the left
is my newly adopted son at that time if
he he was he hadn't been groomed in a
while so I apologize for his appearance
there but what is common to those two
entities they know this form of canine
life and human life is our protein
molecules so my biochemist friends tell
me that protein molecules are the basic
building blocks of life now if I were
being absolutely precise with my
language I should say protein molecules
are the basic building blocks of life
as we know it now we know of many forms
of life here on earth from the simplest
viruses I made of RNA to the most
complex mammals DNA and RNA are examples
of protein molecules enzymes hormones
these are all neurotransmitters these
are all important aspects of life and
it's fair to say protein molecules are
the basic building blocks of life as we
know it
protein molecules are very complex as
this picture shows but if we would
extend our definition of life a little
bit another way to write that phrase
would be to say complex molecules are
almost certainly the basic building
blocks of any kind of interesting life
so if there's life outside the solar
system and you know there might be we
haven't discovered it we can only
speculate about it at this point but if
there's life beyond the solar system the
kinds of life we'd be most interested in
better be rich where every diverse like
the kinds of life we see here on earth
those are the kinds we'd be interested
in and to have any kind of rich and
diverse life you can bet they would have
to have at it at its basis some kind of
complex molecule because complex
molecules have lots of chemical bonds
they're capable of multiple there are
many degrees of freedom they're capable
of taking on many forms those are the
kinds of life forms that we'd be
interested in now so the form protein
molecules that form complex molecules of
any kind you need atoms with lots of
electrons and protons in them you need
things that are not right at the
beginning of the periodic table but
somewhat into the periodic table in the
case of protein molecules those atoms
I'm highlighting carbon nitrogen and
oxygen I'm leaving out hydrogen
deliberately hydrogen is actually formed
in copious quantities early in the
universe's history electrons and protons
are initially moving around too rapidly
for them to be bound by each other's
electro static forces because the
universe is very hot in its early phases
hot means high temperature high
temperature means rapid motion when
electrons and protons have too high an
energy they can't bind stabili because
the collisions are too energetic for
them to be to remain bound so when the
universe cools down to a certain point
about 300,000 years after the Big Bang
the first hydrogen atoms form and
protons and electrons mate for life they
stayed together for 14 billion years now
it's a little more difficult to produce
more complex elements like carbon
nitrogen oxygen actually hydrogen and
helium traces of lithium and beryllium
form early in the universe's history
just through this natural collisions of
particles but carbon nitrogen oxygen
don't form that easily they are actually
cooked inside stars they're cooked
when I say cooked I mean through nuclear
fusion reactions they're produced inside
stars so you might look at this and say
okay
all's well you know we know where the
carbon nitrogen oxygen came from because
we live around such a star we live
around the star that's undergoing fusion
reactions and it's called that's what
you see on the right there it turns out
the sun's atmosphere contains carbon
nitrogen oxygen you know very well that
the earth certainly contains Sienna no
you know if you've been to a barbecue
recently or if you're wearing a diamond
ring or if you're breathing which you
certainly are you're taking a nitrogen
oxygen so these elements are present in
abundance on the earth in the oceans and
on the Earth's crust as these elements
are present in abundance but there's a
little bit of a mystery here the Sun
even though it contains carbon nitrogen
oxygen actually has no business to
contain them because the Sun has not yet
produced these elements through nuclear
fusion reactions the Sun is merely
converting hydrogen to helium in its
core that's what gives the Sun you know
that that's what gives helium its name
helium comes from the Greek word for
Helios the Sun is merely converting
hydrogen to helium near the end of its
life about five billion years from now
five billion years from now the Sun is
going to cook helium into lithium
beryllium boron it'll get up to carbon
nitrogen oxygen and then die die in the
sense it will stop nuclear fusion
reactions so about five billion years
from now the Sun will have some
legitimate claim to some carbon nitrogen
oxygen because it would have cooked it
within its interior so what business
does it have containing you know having
some of this element today well it's
business is it is a descendant of other
stars and what I mean by that is there
are other stars this is a picture of a
star field there are other stars that
lived and died before the Sun came into
being and what I mean by I died is these
stars wrap
cooked these elements nuclear they went
through nuclear fusion reactions they
cooked all the elements up to iron in
fact within their interiors to nuclear
fusion reactions turns out iron has the
is the most stable of the elements in
terms of binding energy per nucleon so
fusion is favorable energetically as
long as you go up to iron beyond that
you don't produce elements through
fusion you actually produce them in
stellar explosions through Neutron
bombardment in supernova explosions so
but the point is the Sun is not a first
generation star the Sun was born well
after some of its ancestors rapidly
cooked these elements in their interiors
carbon nitrogen oxygen we need many
other elements and these these ancestral
stars their ancestors in the same way we
have ancestors these stars died before
the Sun was born there were very
efficient cooks they cook all these
elements within their interior but
they're also very generous cooks they
die in a spectacular way these stars
explode when they die and you what
you're seeing here is a real picture of
an exploded star as it looks a thousand
years after the explosion
about a thousand-year-old explosion what
you see over there so the stuff that
that was once inside the star was once
cooked inside the star gets generously
dispersed into surrounding space so the
Sun was born out of the the dust the
star dust exploded ashes of many many
many stars so in the words of Crosby
Stills Nash and young we have star dust
and for the young ones among you you
don't know who Crosby Stills Nash and
young are they are not a law firm they
are a rock group and they must have
known some astronomy because they knew
exactly what they were talking about
when they said we are Stardust so indeed
if you look around you your neighbor the
chair you're sitting on the stuff that
makes up this beautiful building all of
this was once cooked inside a star not
the Sun but some other star but that
enriched the cloud of gas and dust from
which the Sun and Earth and the other
planets formed so that's a remarkable
that's that that is actually a
remarkable thing to think that our
origins
spatially quite large that is are the
elements that make up our bodies come
from a large region within within a
collection of stars now a collection of
stars is what we had to be part of and a
collection of stars is what we call a
galaxy because if we weren't part of a
collection of stars the Sun were alone
the nebula from which the Sun form were
alone with no other stars around it
there's a pretty good bet that we would
be made of hydrogen and helium today not
not any of these other elements and
believe me a speaker who's made of only
hydrogen and helium it's far less
interesting and you know then then I
hope to be okay and indeed audience made
of hydrogen helium is far less
interesting than you are so this
particular picture is a picture of a
galaxy but some of you have already
guessed that this is not a picture of
the Milky Way galaxy because we live
inside the Milky Way galaxy we can't
take pictures like this in the Milky Way
galaxy what we do instead is we take
pictures of our siblings this is our
sister galaxy which is our older sister
well at least a bigger sister I don't
know we're older but this is the
Andromeda galaxy this is my favorite
galaxy in the whole world has just
mentioned and I'll talk about it in some
more detail now it's worth pausing here
for a little bit to reflect on what
we're doing here we live in a world
without mirrors we can't see ourselves
we can't see our Milky Way galaxy
imagine if you lived in a imagine you
kids living in a world without mirrors
it will take you much less time in the
morning to get ready and go to school
but that would be a benefit but the
downside is you wouldn't know what you
look like you would have no idea you'd
have to look at your siblings you'd have
to look at your neighbors to figure out
what you look like from the outside
that's what we do here another analogy
might be living in a house that you can
never leave you wouldn't know what
buildings look like till you looked out
your window and looked at your neighbors
buildings and that's what we're doing
here this is our neighbor the Andromeda
galaxy to give you a sense of scale
light would take a hundred thousand
years to get across this rectangle a
hundred thousand years light takes one
second to get to the moon eight minutes
to get to the Sun four hours to get to
Pluto four years to get to the nearest
star but we're talking about a hundred
thousand years to get across this
picture now we live in a very average
part of the Milky Way galaxy in fact
astronomy
it's a very humbling subject because it
tells you over and over and over again
that you're completely mediocre you know
our planet is completely mediocre a star
is completely mediocre our galaxy's
mediocre and people speculate our
universe may even be mediocre because
people talk about multi versus not
unique but multi versus ours may be one
of many
so mediocrity is the theme of astronomy
but it's a good kind of mediocrity in
this case okay so we live in an average
part of the galaxy we don't live on
Castro Street and downtown Mountain View
where there's lots of you know lots of
people lots of stars close together
we don't live often in the hills of Los
Altos we live in somewhere near the
Google campus perhaps you know a pretty
representative part of part of town we
are about 25,000 light-years from the
center of the Milky Way galaxy now one
of the things our group has discovered
our research group has discovered over
the years is the Andromeda galaxy is
five times bigger than this picture
would suggest you know when we started
our work conventional wisdom was the
Andromeda galaxy went out about as far
as you see in this picture but we've
been studying stars far away from this
from the center of this picture
literally five times further out than
this picture shows and we've been
continuing to find stars that are
plausibly associated with the andromeda
galaxy in the sense that the right kind
of stars they have the right chemical
mix they have the right velocities
they're moving with the rest of the
andromeda galaxy and so on okay so let
me talk a little bit about that I love
this picture this is a Robert Gendler
photograph of Andromeda and I was
talking about how it's eating its
children well here is one of its
children m32 those are snacks only those
two there's breakfast and lunch up there
lunch is at noon you know at 12 o'clock
right right above it and if you look
closely you've seen as a bridge of stars
that this that's been stretched out from
that galaxy that's immediately above
Andromeda the process is very simple if
you know if I were the andromeda galaxy
and you guys were a satellite or
vice-versa what happens is gravity is an
inverse square law of force gravity
pulls hardest on something that's
closest to you so I would pull very hard
on the on the front row I would pull
less hard on the back row
and the people sitting in between would
feel a force that somewhat intermediate
between between these two extremes what
that would do is it would stretch out
this galaxy by virtue of this
differential gravitational force that's
what Andromeda is doing to that galaxy
up there it really is this this effect
is called tidal effects this is exactly
what we experienced here on earth the
when the moon pulls on the near side of
the earth it pulls harder than the far
side so the earth tries to stretch out
into a cigar shape the earth is made of
rocks it can't do that but the oceans
the water on the earth that can respond
stretches out into a cigar shape so we
have high tides at two ends and have low
tides everywhere else
okay so tidal forces are very common in
nature so I started the Andromeda galaxy
and one of the benefits is not only is
it our neighbor its close enough that we
can see individuals within our
neighbor's house we can see individual
stars within Andromeda and I'll show you
some examples of that in just a minute
to see individual stars in Andromeda you
need powerful telescopes we use the
Hubble Space Telescope a lot but we also
use the tech telescopes and Jeff and I
visited in August here's a picture of
the Keck telescopes there you go through
there - Keck telescopes they are their
world's biggest optical telescopes if
you were to put the mirror of the Keck
telescope in this room it would occupy
about the space occupied by the seats
here it's about 10 meters across ten big
steps across in diameter so they're very
very expensive and of course we've done
the right thing and we put them right on
top of a volcano in Mauna Kea and we've
keeping our fingers crossed that the
volcano is dormant for a long time or
hopefully even extinct so I use one of
these two telescopes a lot to study the
Andromeda galaxy and I'm gonna show you
some more details of these telescopes
but it's a little difficult to get a
sense of the scale of these telescopes
just looking at these pictures because
the top of Mauna Kea looks like it has a
lunar landscape they're no trees the no
rocks I mean there are there are rocks
but there's no sense of how big those
rocks are so just to give you a sense of
scale somebody has conveniently parked
an SUV right there that's an SUV that
that
that's a bigger than average car that
building my guess is it's about 15
stories high that that's how but it just
looks like a tiny little looks like a
little football helmet that somebody's
placed on the field but it's a it's it's
really large let's look inside it and
I'll show you a couple of views in this
particular view you see the telescope
which is sort of pointed horizontally in
this view the telescope the piece of
glass is actually made up of 36 segments
the segments are hexagonal in shape you
can probably make out these hexagonal
shape each hexagonal element is about 6
feet or 1.8 meters in it was the size of
a human being good sized human being so
again nothing to reference anything by
so it's very difficult to get that sense
in this picture you do get a sense of
scale these are not plastic models these
are real human beings they are standing
next to the silver cylinder which is the
camera portion of the telescope the
Deimos spectrograph that that I use a
lot was built in Santa Cruz I've walked
inside the spectrograph or you can walk
inside this camera because as telescopes
scale ups so have the instruments got to
scale up proportionately in the same way
that we now have tiny little cameras
that are embedded within cellphones
technology is also obviously pushed in
this direction the size of making things
bigger
so with this spectrograph you can take
spectra of individual stars in the
Andromeda galaxy that's what this is
this is a raw spectrogram it's a very
unusual view of the andromeda galaxy
it's one that spectroscopy say used to
but this is the Keck telescopes are are
used for this one of the two Keck
telescopes Deimos is the name of a
spectrograph it stands for deep
extragalactic imaging multi-object
spectrograph it's probably the most
powerful spectrograph in the world built
at Santa Cruz by Sandy Faber and we can
get spectra of something like 250 to 300
stars at once so I'm going to zoom in a
couple of times and you zoom in you know
you can now see that there are vertical
bands running through this picture
there's about 250 vertical bands across
the whole thing but you see a subset of
them here
the first thing you learn is textbooks
are wrong textbooks always show spectra
running horizontally well in the demo
spectrograph they run vertically this is
a real spectrograph in my mind spectra
now run vertically so each band is a
spectrum taken through a cut in a piece
of metal called a slit you've got a slit
at the right location of a piece of
metal so when you point your telescope
right there's a star shining through it
in fact if you look closely every one of
these bands has a streak going
vertically through it that's the light
of an individual star in the Andromeda
galaxy I'm not kidding you that's what
that is what is even more prominent than
that those vertical streaks are these
horizontal lines here they look like
barcodes in fact you can see this chord
over here you see the code repeated here
you see it shifted a little bit and
repeated there you see it shifted even
further up there and this one it shifted
way up in these two and shifted way up
there and this one may be shifted off
the off the screen this barcode this
repeating barcode is a signature of the
Earth's atmosphere so the Earth's
atmosphere even at the darkest site in
Mauna Kea is a very dark site but if you
if you go to a door even to a very dark
site the Earth's atmosphere actually
glows there's oxygen and OAH in the
Earth's atmosphere it glows it puts out
things called emission lines light of
very specific wavelengths of frequencies
those create this pattern since all of
these slits are looking at the Earth's
atmosphere even the stars beyond the
atmosphere it can't help but get light
from the atmosphere since all of them
are looking at the same atmosphere they
all have exactly the same barcode the
shift from one slit to another is has to
do with the physical placement of the
slit within the focal plane because
different stars the stars are not
aligned in a convenient line like that's
there in different parts of the field of
view so because the slits are positioned
according to the locations of stars the
barcode shifts up or down accordingly so
this is in fact the Earth's glow is in
fact the reason why you cut a slit to
look at a star a star looks like a blob
why not cut a circle in a piece of metal
the difficulty with cutting a circle is
the light that would come in through the
circle would be the light of the star
and the light from the Earth's
atmosphere and you would have no way of
telling those two apart so by cutting a
slit you can look on the star and off
the star and you can use the part that's
off the star to subtract off the effect
of the earth atmosphere this is a
process called sky subtraction you
subtract the sky but I don't mean the
sky the blue sky above you you don't you
never subtract that but you see you
subtract the glow of the night sky in
this way the signature of the night sky
so with the help of spectra like these
we can measure how fast each star is
moving you can measure its velocity we
can measure what chemical composition it
has now that's important you know
feasibly the discussion we just had
earlier about chemical evolution and in
fact one of the lines I study a set of
three absorption lines in stars quite a
lot and they are produced by calcium
ions in the atmospheres of these stars
so so I'd remarkable to me that you can
take a galaxy that's you know Andromeda
is about 2.3 million light years away
you can take individual stars in that
galaxy and you can figure out just by
understanding the properties of light
you can figure out what its chemical
composition is how fast it's moving and
and how fast it's moving actually tells
you about what gravitational field these
stars are experiencing which in turn
tells you how much dark matter is
contained within the andromeda galaxy so
this is remote sensing at its best
astronomy is mostly about remote sensing
because you're only getting light from a
distance that's all you get
all right so I've talked about the
Andromeda galaxy a fair bit and it's a
good sibling of the Milky Way galaxy but
galaxies come in many shapes and sizes
some strange and some not this one has
this lovely little twist going through
the going through this hula-hoop that's
around this central ball of stars this
is a view of another galaxy probably as
similar to the last one but happens to
be viewed from a pole on so you're
looking at it from top-down or bottom-up
as you like and these colors actually
mean something so these pictures are
taken with real telescopes these colors
mean something when you see yellowish
white of the center you're seeing all
stars sun-like stars
you see bluish-white as you do in the
ring you're seeing young stars massive
stars typically those are the ones that
are capable of rapid nuclear fusion
reactions those are the ones that
produce many of the elements that are we
see in the sun and earth today
you see really bad looking galaxies this
one's having a terrible day and you know
these these blemishes that you see these
so-called blemishes that you see are
extremely important and I'll I'll talk
about those these dark clouds that you
see against the face of the galaxy are
actually birthplaces of new stars so
they're dark not because they're no
stars they're they're dark because
they're blocking the light of stars in
the galaxy in the same way that our
cloud on a cloudy day can block the
light of the Sun that's what these
clouds are doing these are giant clouds
they're much bigger than clubs in the in
our atmosphere here are two galaxies
that are going through some kind of
collision I just want to give you a
flavor of different kinds of galaxies
here's another one where you can see a
collection of these clouds of gas and
dust this is actually the near end near
edge of the frisbee the first piece
oriented like this and these clouds of
gas and dust are blocking you can see
them in silhouette here's another one
that is again seen at a jaunty angle you
were worried about circles looking over
well this is what I meant by most of my
pictures are already oval just to give
you a quick just a very quick primer on
why galaxies look the way they do so
this is a spiral galaxy you can see why
it's called a spiral galaxy right away
it has this these spiral arms galaxies
spin in a very unusual way when you
think of a frisbee spinning every part
of the frisbee completes the circle in
the same amount of time that's not how
galaxies spin galaxies by contrast most
stars move at the same speed they move
at the same speed if you know if you're
running in a circular track and you're
moving at the same speed the person in
the inside track has an advantage so
stars in this part of the galaxy have an
advantage they can complete many circles
in the time that a star in the outer
part completes one Circle so this is
what gives galaxies they're sort of
twisted up appearance like this and the
best analogy I can think of is if you
take dark coffee and spin your cup of
dark coffee the coffee that's against
the walls of the mug because of friction
that coffee is
not spinning very rapidly the part in
the center is spinning rapidly got a
coffee
exhibits differential rotation like
galaxies if you put a little bit of
cream into that it gets an appearance
like this the cream in the case of
galaxies is the birth of new stars where
new stars are born the bright patch gets
sheared out into the spiral pattern by
the differential rotation of galaxies
there's actually a very well-developed
theory spiral density wave theory that
explains the appearance of spiral
galaxies here's a spiral galaxy that
same one that you saw in the last
picture different one from the previous
picture naturally we can't take
different perspective images of the same
galaxies that's our that's one of the
Bane's of astronomy we're stuck with the
perspective we have you know for the
foreseeable future and here's another
one here's another galaxy that we happen
to see perfectly along its edge people
have taken this galaxy and they've said
this one is just like the Milky Way in
fact our review of this galaxy if you
look at this rectangle our view of this
galaxy you know it we are not at the
center we're not right on the edge we're
somewhere here so our view of the galaxy
is sort of like the view of this our
view of this galaxy so you don't need to
take my word for it here's a picture of
the Milky Way taken from the southern
hemisphere this is true a telescope in
Chile fisheye lens looking at a large
patch of the sky the horizon looks
curved like this because of the
distortion in the camera but you can see
the Milky Way beautifully going across
the sky it's a Milky Way it's a band of
light and if I go back and forth between
this picture and this one you can see
the similarity now just a pause here to
talk about the word galaxy the word
galaxy actually comes from from the
Greeks astronomy is a very very old
science astronomy has been around as
long as civilizations have been around
this is one of the beautiful things
about astronomy it's also very new
science because it's technology driven
and every time this new telescopes new
detectors we make advances so the
ancient Greeks or maybe not all of the
ancient Greeks but the ancient geeks
among the ancient Greeks decided that
this looked like a band of milk across
the sky and the word got galacto and the
word lactose have you know are all
rooted in the word for milk so what
we've done is we've taken the appearance
of our own galaxy and we've
every galaxy the same thing we call
every galaxy abandoned milk so that's
what the word galaxy means so its
pictures of this that give us confidence
that we live in a spiral galaxy and we
live among these clouds of gas and dust
that you see cutting a dark band across
the Milky Way what I'm going to do in
the next few slides is focus on the
these particular clouds of gas and dust
I said they were important because their
birthplaces well here's a detailed view
of one of these astronomers have lovely
romantic names for this thing this one
is called NGC 63-57 this is a picture
taken with the Hubble telescope and the
colors are something that's worth paying
attention to because this is what the
eye would see if it was sensitive enough
so the red hue is actually the glow of
hydrogen-alpha this is electrons
cascading down from level three and the
hydrogen atom to level two produces this
intense red color you see a piece of a
cloud of gas and dust you see a young
star that's been born it has carved out
a little cavity it's created a little
cave for itself
it's peering out it's in time it'll
actually blow away the material that was
formed from stars committe fratricide
they once they're born they prevent
other stars from being born around them
you can see that they're also born in
groups there's a litter of stars just
like puppies they're born in born in
groups okay so you see a group of stars
in the upper part of this picture those
stars are freshly formed stars from this
cloud but they've eaten away at the
cloud they were in there in their
immediate vicinity the intense radiation
actually exerts a pressure ionizes and
blows away the cloud around it so let's
look at this process in a bit more
detail this is the Orion constellation
you might recognize the the shoulders
the belt the sword of Orion turns out
the sword of Orion the bright spot there
is not a single star but it's a nebula
in fact this is a wonderful picture
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope of
the Orion Nebula and we'll zoom in a few
times Hubble has amazing detail and with
pictures like this Hubble also has this
great benefit that when you take
pictures they come with circle
marking interesting things no just
kidding that that doesn't happen
someone's gone in there and mark these
circles to mark interesting objects here
and what are these interesting objects
let's let's zoom in a little more so the
interesting objects here these four
objects are young stars that are in the
process of being born so every one of
these four is a star you can see this
star quite clearly but it's got a plume
of gas and dust around it this one the
star is actually hidden from view you
see a sort of silhouette of a dust cloud
and in the other two there these stars
are trying to make their presence felt
they're trying to break free from the
little piece of cloud they form from
these four on the other hand have more
or less broken free you can now see
through to the Stars but they have a
little band of dark band around them
they're actually surrounded by a disk of
material these stars and these are real
stars these are they called protostars
they're on their way to becoming real
stars they haven't quite started their
fusion reactions yet here's one that
particularly advantageous view this is
one that's seen along its edge and you
can see the star peeking out from the
top but you can see this edge of this
edge on view of a dust disc 17 times the
size of Pluto's orbit so only slightly
bigger than our solar system and these
are called proplyds they're in Orion Pro
stands for proto so they're protostars
well the proto
planetary discs protoplanetary discs
days are discs of material that will
give rise to planets so they're
protoplanetary discs and in so far I've
been showing you pictures taken with
telescopes I'm going to give you an
artist's view of a simulation of what
these does this might look like if you
had enough detail if we had enough
detail we don't have this kind of detail
yet but this is a little movie showing
how these debris discs of dust and rocks
might evolve you can see a channel
opening up here probably because there's
a planet forming there sweeping things
in a sweeping accreting material so
planets grow at
by sweeping up this Dustin and gas and
overtime the giant planets clear out
sorry clear out everything in the in the
in disgust is can you just left with
these coagulated elements which are the
planets okay so this is a an artist view
I say but with based on some pretty
detailed physics calculations formation
of a system of planets alright so just
to wrap up this cosmic evolution idea
this cosmic chemical evolution idea a
chemical recycling idea here's a picture
of a galaxy with a spot in it now this
picture of a galaxy comes from a really
boring project there's a group in
Berkeley it does an extremely boring
project they go to the telescope every
night and they take pictures of the same
galaxies night after night after night
they have a list of galaxies and they
just take pictures of the same darn
things every night but once in a while
they get lucky and they see a spot in
the galaxy where there wasn't one the
night before where there wasn't one of
the week before that's an example of one
such thing that spot that you see marked
supernovae wasn't there the previous
night or two nights back whenever the
previous picture was taken that's an
example of a star that's in the process
of exploding and it's probably a young
massive star that's exploding you can
see it's relatively close to this disk
of dust and gas at its brightest a
supernova a stellar explosion can
outshine the rest of the galaxy
depending on the size of the galaxy a
single star can outshine the rest of the
galaxy this is not too far from it in
fact it's hard to see the star's light
is saturated in that spot there but
there's a lot of light in that spot if
you give it a thousand years it expands
into the ejecta the stuff ejected from
the explosion spreads out and enriches
surrounding clouds of gas and dust
interstellar gas and dust out of which
young stars have formed a new star form
which then goes through their own fusion
reactions so this is this is the cosmic
chemical cycling we've been talking
about now sandy found this amazing
picture taken by an astro photographer I
wanted to show this and Sandy and I saw
some real poetry in this picture Wally
which I'll comment may have seen the
same poetry in the picture when he took
it this is a
a photographer's photograph of a cave in
the southwestern United States okay this
is looking out of a cave I believe in
New Mexico looking out you see a bunch
of rocks here you see an arrangement of
these rocks or suggesting that this was
family's home but perhaps even a
community's home in ancient times but if
you think about these rocks these rocks
are made of iron silicon magnesium
oxygen it's made up of a bunch of
elements in the periodic table these
elements in the periodic table wouldn't
exist if it hadn't been for the fact
that our planet and our solar system and
our Sun are part of a family that's you
know part of a grander home and you're
seeing that grander home through the
opening of this cave so this immediate
home belonging to some family or
community is embedded within a much
larger home and that's what gives gave
these rocks their existence so there's a
there's a beautiful symmetry to this
picture all right so we've been talking
about galaxies and why galaxies are
important and I hope I've convinced you
galaxies are important but I haven't
quite told you where galaxies come from
and so I want to spend the next few
minutes talking about that and taking
you so further back in time in fact
taking you back to some of the earliest
imaginable moments in the universe's
history so to do this I want to give you
a sense of what our environment looks
like so I'm going to play this movie and
I'll talk while this movie's being
played this is a movie where you can see
the Orion constellation but very quickly
you'll see the Orion constellation break
up into sort of funny shapes because
this movie has realistic distances
attached to everything so this is really
a series of astronomical pictures that
have been stitched together in a clever
way by Brent Tully one of the
astronomers who studies the structure of
the Milky Way and things in it and we're
flying at an unrealistic speed here just
just to be sure
no don't kids don't expect to to be
actually able to take this journey this
is a virtual tour off most of the solar
must of the solar system most of the
galactic system and in fact we'll go
beyond the galaxy in a bit
this is a very unusual journey this
cosmic pilot has this real sense of
bravado takes us through the most
dangerous parts of our galaxy so this is
it we just went through an exploded star
but what is remarkable about this
picture is it really it is based of
actual astronomical images yeah I like
to think of it as a documentary because
it's a series of real images that have
just been stitched together in in a
meaningful way there is a small bit here
though where it goes from being a
documentary to a docudrama in in
Hollywood terms so Brent goes Hollywood
for just a little bit and it's not by
choice he has to go Hollywood in in this
segment because we've never taken
pictures like this of the Milky Way from
the outside so in this case there's an
actor playing the role of the Milky Way
there's a different galaxy that's being
used to portray the Milky Way just for
this segment and then we go back to
documentary mode because these are two
real pictures of satellites of the Milky
Way the large and small Magellanic
Clouds you'd see the Andromeda galaxy
coming in from the from the upper right
with its companions there she is
okay Andromeda with one of its
companions and here's another one of
Andromeda companions and you'll see as
we fly through that galaxy that's m33
over here this this galaxy we're about
to fly through that has exploded stars
within it we're going to fly through one
of those and you know what you see very
quickly each of these galaxies is you
know tens to hundreds of thousands of
light-years across they look they look
like tiny blobs but each of these things
is a galaxy that's some the size of the
Milky Way some bigger some smaller and
in fact there's this lovely
concentration of galaxies over here this
is called the Virgo cluster in the
constellation of Virgo there's a lovely
cluster of galaxies in in Virgo that
it's our nearest big concentration but
it gives you a sense that we're not
alone you know we're not alone as
planets in the solar system you're not
alone as stars in the Milky Way know the
Sun is one of a hundred billion stars in
the Milky Way and indeed the Milky Way
galaxy isn't alone it's part of a family
we're part of a group of galaxies called
the local group but we are not too far
away from an even bigger collection of
galaxies called the Virgo cluster in
fact the biggest galaxy in the Virgo
cluster m87
one has a supermassive black hole at its
center we now know that every galaxy
worth its salt has a black hole at its
center so in true true to her form we're
going to this pilot is going to
crash-land us right at the center of
this black hole at the center of m87
okay so so the idea behind this this
movie is to give you a sense of where we
live our neighborhood our galactic
neighborhood and you might have noticed
that galaxies are not distributed
uniformly they're distributed in
clusters and clumps and one of the great
advances of the last decade has been
high-powered computer simulations in
fact the first of these was published in
2000 was called the millennium
simulation we made a lot of progress
since then and you I'm going to show you
the results of the millennium simulation
where you start out with a universe
that's more or less smooth but over time
gravity takes over and takes tiny little
ripples that you saw early on polarizes
that makes their amplitude greater if
it's a tiny trough if it was slightly
less dense than average then that region
completely empties out and you see the
formation over time you see time
counting up in the upper right Giga yes
is the unit billions of years so we are
at a quarter or a third of a billion
years there but it's going to go all the
way to 14 billion years but given enough
time gravity can act and it can turn
even tiny ripples in the fabric of the
cosmos into these amazing structures
this particular structure you're all
familiar with the world wide web this
particular structure is called the
cosmic web and it's somewhat larger than
the world wide web this is you know just
to give you a sense a Milky Way galaxy
might be something like that blob moving
up there so the Milky Way galaxy is
really very very ordinary in this in
this yes please this-this-this wrote
this video is a bit confusing because
our perspective is changing this is not
real rotation it's merely perspective
that's changing so we're both moving and
it's collapsing under its gravity it's a
good question we don't expect nearly
this much rotation we expect some
rotation and systems and you you'll
occasionally see that but most of this
most of this swirling motion that you
see here is real because that's going on
but our past
- this is changing we're also zooming in
somewhat because you can see this bar
was much smaller before a kiloparsec by
the way it's about three thousand light
years so this is five hundred
kiloparsecs so much bigger scale than
individual galaxies I should have
emphasized also this picture is a
picture as a map of how the dark matter
in the universe would evolve not stars
but how Dark Matter would evolve so it's
a detailed calculation of the gravity
that every particle feels relative to
every other particle and I just want to
explain this very very simply if you
have a sea of particles if it's a
perfectly uniform sea of particles you a
particle in that uniform sea would feel
an equal pull in all directions so
there'd be no net motion that just be
the expansion the universe would be no
net motion relative to other particles
the patterns would stay fixed if on the
other hand you live right next to a
slightly dense region you've got
particles pulling you in all possible
directions but you've got a slightly
extra number of particles like the
higher number of particles pulling you
in one possible direction where that
ripple is where the where the over
density is so you tend to migrate
towards that so something that's likely
richer than average gets even richer
over time the rich get richer the poor
get poorer thanks to gravity gravity is
a great polarizing agent in that that
sense okay so this was a dark matter
simulation you see it stopped at about
13 points some billion years that's how
old we believe our universe to be that's
how much time we think has elapsed since
the Big Bang
this next simulation is a zoom in on one
of these filaments in the cosmic web and
this time not only is Dark Matters
gravity being modeled properly but Dark
Matter isn't even being shown here it's
hidden in the simulation it's gravity is
being modeled properly well what is
being shown is the response of gas and
dust to the gravity of dark matter and
now you'll see if things forming that
look more like galaxies they don't look
like blobs the Dark Matter is much more
blobby gas and dust tends to form along
these filaments tend to congeal along
these filaments you can see these two
galaxies about to collide and you know
while this cosmic wreck is going on you
see that other galaxies you know like
these two galaxies are in the process of
colliding is
some rubberneckers going by on the
cosmic freeway but these two galaxies
are colliding and you know you might
look at this and say these don't really
look like galaxies they look like
complete they look like a complete mess
in fact galaxies we think look like
complete messes early on over time as
the cannibalism has occurs the
cannibalism is actually a very strange
kind of cannibalism it's more like a
corporate merger when stars when
galaxies smash into each other stars
don't smash into each other they they
merely switch loyalties when you have
two galaxies you've got two centres of
loyalty you've got a bunch of stars
going around one Center you've got
another set of stars going around
another Center when they collide they're
going around a common center and now you
can begin to see that this this entity
that look like a complete mess before
starting to look like some of the images
you've seen of spiral galaxies so these
simulations these sort of computer
simulations that show the cosmic web and
now we are changing our perspective
nothing is happening after the
simulation we are just moving from the
lower part to the upper part of the
simulation you can see there's a swarm
of stars in the center the spiral arms I
think this represents one of the
triumphs of modern day computing as it
pertains to to astronomy and cosmology
you produce realistic little galaxies
this particular one was done in in Japan
alright so so far still going on with
this story we need everything galaxies
formed because of gravity but gravity
needs something to latch onto you need
these ripples to be present in the
fabric of the universe so you have to
ask the natural question why didn't the
universe start out perfectly smooth why
were there these little bumps and
Wiggles in the universe and the answer
to that the two words to answer that and
that's quantum mechanics quantum
mechanics is the reason why the universe
didn't start out perfectly smooth now
instead of trying to explain quantum
mechanics I'm gonna put up a little
cartoon here where there are two quantum
physicists a one says to the other Oh
Alice you're the one for me and Alice
being a really smart quantum physicist
says to Bob in a quantum world how can
we be sure there's no there's a lot of
uncertainty that quantum mechanics
teaches was about okay so I can't resist
this you know professor Heisenberg is
the person who's responsible for coming
up with the uncertainty principle there
was a
a lot of opposition to quantum mechanics
when it was first proposed on Stein was
one of the great opponents of quantum
mechanics he said how can something as
beautiful as the universe be governed by
chance
Einstein had a famous quote he said God
does not play dice that was his famous
objection to quantum mechanics Einstein
was wrong as it turns out because he
came around later to to try to
incorporate quantum mechanics into his
theories but Einstein was scolded
appropriately in those times by Niels
Bohr Niels Bohr someone who was a
quantum physicist studied the structure
of atoms when Einstein said God does not
play dice Niels Bohr said to Einstein
how dare you tell god what to do you
know this was this was a very very deep
debate going on about 100 years ago
and quantum mechanics it's fair to say
even today is not very well understood
you know the joke goes about Heisenberg
you know the you know momentum and and
position can't be predicted absolutely
precisely so if you can measure X in the
position if there's a certain
uncertainty in that Delta X momentum P
Delta P the product of those two is
finite it can't be zero so if you know
your position you don't know your
momentum very well if you know your
momentum precisely you don't know your
position very well so Eisenberg's
driving along the autobahn one day he's
speeding as usual the cop pulls him over
the german cop does the same thing that
cops all over the world do they ask you
this question do you know how fast you
were going and Heisenberg you know quips
no but I know exactly where I was
because you know the uncertainty
momentum and position if you if you
don't know your speed you know your
position very well okay um jobs aside
another way of setting the uncertainty
principle is to say that delta e times
delta t delta energy times delta time is
a constant so you know dimensionally in
terms of units the if you take the units
of position and momentum and multiply
them together they're the same as the
units of energy and time multiplied
together so if you can if you know
exactly which instant you're talking
about in the universe's history then you
can't predict the energy of that parcel
of the universe with arbitrary precision
so quantum mechanics imposes on us these
fluctuations just because of the
uncertainty principle so delta e delta t
being the product of those two being
constant means in early times you have
to know the time precisely there were
fluctuations at the level of one part
and a hundred thousand so the part at
the level of ten to the minus five there
were fluctuations now normally you think
okay these are fluctuations in the
quantum domain microscopic they don't
really affect us but the it turns out
they do affect us and the person who
convinced us that that quantum
fluctuations affect us is Schrodinger
Schrodinger came up with this experiment
called the Schrodinger cat experiment
and in which he said let's device an
experiment or get dunked an experiment a
thought experiment you didn't actually
carry this out no animals were harmed in
the making of this experiment okay as
they say in the movies
so you start out with a radioactive
particle and or a group of radioactive
particles and you put them in a box you
close the box you come back after an
hour there's a 50% chance that the
radioactive particle would have decayed
to produce an alpha particle that's a
helium nucleus two protons and two
neutrons the alpha particle has a
certain probability of existing an hour
after you've started the experiment
certain probabilities let's say 50%
probability it exists exists 50%
probability it hasn't this hasn't
decayed in which case the alpha particle
doesn't exist if the alpha particle was
created then there's a Geiger counter
normal Geiger counters beep so since
this is a Gedanken experiment showing
that says let's set up a Geiger counter
so that it doesn't beep but instead has
a hammer fall and you get the sound of
breaking glass as that hammer falls on a
bottle on a glass bottle that contains
poison that stuff is lethal to cats so
that's why there are two states of this
cat the cat can either come out like
this all happy or like that where it is
unhappy in you're unhappy if you're its
owner so those are the two possible
states of the cat and the schrÃ¶dinger's
cat experiment 50% chance it comes out
from the upper state 50% chance that
comes out in the lower state now
Schrodinger didn't carry out this
experiment but there's an uncertainty in
this experiment if you set up a thousand
of these boxes you can't predict
beforehand which of these cats is going
to end up in the upper state which one's
gonna end up in the lower state that's
the uncertainty you cannot predict the
fate of an
your entity in this in this scenario
shorting I didn't carry out this
experiment but the universe went ahead
and did it the universe went ahead it
did its version of the Schrodinger cat
experiment this is a timeline in the
universe where you have the Big Bang on
the left the present day on the right
fourteen billion years after the Big
Bang
you've got shortly after the Big Bang
there were quantum fluctuations and just
like the Geiger counter takes these tiny
microscopic phenomena moves them into
the macroscopic domain in this case
inflation this very rapid expansion in
the universe's history there's a very
rapid phase of expansion in the
universe's history it lost for 10 to the
minus 23 seconds and the universe
expands by a factor of not by 2 or 4 of
10 it expands by a factor of 10 to the
power of 50 during that time inflation
is here to stay it's even though it
sounds crazy it's here to stay it's
something that explains a lot of things
in the observable universe and it is the
thing that takes these quantum
fluctuations blows them up freezes them
into the fabric of the universe so in a
real sense if something was slightly
lower than less than average it becomes
a void if something was higher than
average becomes a galaxy a galaxy is a
live cat in the Schrodinger cat
experiment void between galaxies is a
dead cat in the Schrodinger cat
experiment in the universe's version of
the Schrodinger cat experiment okay
finally three predictions galaxy
collisions should be common galaxy
collisions unfortunately take a long
time they take a billion years to unfold
and no astronomer has had that kind of
time to watch them so we have a computer
simulation instead and what we're going
to do is watch what happens to these two
galaxies as they get closer together
we're going to stop the simulation and
you see two pictures of real galaxies
that are about to collide then we'll go
back to the computer simulation let
gravity do its thing over time and you
could start to see the distortions
happen in this galaxy if the near-end is
being pulled harder than the far end
again we'll stop and rotate our change
our perspective so you can see a pair of
real galaxies that are going through
this process here are two real galaxies
that are in early phases of the
collision now we wait a little bit
longer you can start to see the
distortion very clearly now in these two
galaxies they're stretching each other
out
and let's stop and here are two real
galaxies going through this process the
galaxy collisions are very common around
us they last a long time but the
advantages we have many of these so we
can see snapshots of different phases of
a galaxy collision infant galaxies
should look ragged you know you saw in
those simulations the early galaxies
look terrible they don't look like you
know nice symmetric things so here's a
picture taken with the Hubble telescope
that lets us look at the different
galaxies the way you look at the
different galaxies is very simple when
you're starting influencing in on earth
you just have to gather up kids and you
can see you know children and adults
very easy to do that in the universe is
just as easy all you have to do is look
around us and you're going to see near
near us at things that have been around
for a long time far away from us are
things that haven't been around for a
very long time the reason is simple
let's zoom in I'll explain what I mean
if you look at a galaxy like this this
is three billion light years away from
us the universe is 14 billion years old
if that galaxy is 3 billion light years
away light has taken 3 billion years to
travel from that galaxy to us so the
universe was 11 billion years old when
light left that galaxy the information
is always back dated and it's back dated
by an amount that depends on how long
that informations been been transmitting
how long that light has been traveling
so here's another galaxy that's seven
billion light years away it left the
universe when the universe was middle
age when the universe was seven billion
years old it's been traveling for seven
light has been traveling for seven
billion years and you can see that that
galaxy is not nearly as symmetric and
organized as this one and in fact if you
look ten billion light years away at yet
another galaxy you can see that this is
like a teenage galaxy it's still trouble
it's trying to find itself it's trying
to get itself together you can see that
the different pieces of the galaxy are
in the process of organizing now these
sorts of pictures were taken with the
Hubble telescope but there's a lovely
technique that astronomers have adapted
from SDI from Strategic Defense
Initiative Star Wars those of you who
remember Star Wars from the Reagan years
we had these satellites looking down at
the Russian missile silos and we
couldn't get detailed pictures of them
because the earth has
atmosphere that's moving around so we
get distorted images it's like looking
down into a swimming pool and trying to
read some writing at the bottom of the
pool you can't because the water is
moving around so if you have an adaptive
system that corrects in real-time for
the distortion then you can fix this and
astronomers of course use this technique
but they look in the other direction to
the atmosphere they look from the bottom
up and as you see these light waves come
in you'll see that when light comes in
they should come in as plane waves but
they don't and that's why stars twinkle
so you'll see these waves coming in they
look like potato chips they don't look
they don't look flat in fact they don't
even look like they look like they don't
look like windows potato chips Pringles
potato chips all of them have the same
shape here you see the shape is changing
all the time so that mirror dance is
equal and opposite to the change in
shape and that causes the star to stop
twinkling so this is the technique
called adaptive optics and it is simple
way to remember it is on twinkle on
twinkle little star is a good way to
remember adaptive optics so it's a
amazing technique I used to take sharp
pictures now this is just just to
reinforce the idea of looking back in
time if you look close to us you see old
things if you look a little bit further
away you see slightly less old things
and you look even further away you see
things that are half way through
you see younger entities and one of the
amazing things about astronomy is you
can see unborn entities you can see
unborn galaxies astronomers love doctors
you know they keep us alive but they
also medicine makes astronomy look like
an exact science I don't know how this
doctor decided that that was afoot but
we'll go with it and you know what you
what it's pointing to over there are the
ripples that give rise to galaxies so I
want to talk about that next the last of
these predictions instead I'll talk a
little bit about these predictions of
the story is you can actually see the
ripples in the cosmic ocean that give
rise to galaxies here's a picture taken
with radio telescopes off the sky all
around us that's what's projected onto a
globe oops it's projected onto a globe
let me see if I can play this movie here
what you're seeing is the afterglow
from the Big Bang the Big Bang was a
very hot phase in the universe's history
you know just like you can turn off your
barbeque oven but it takes a long time
for the embers to cool the embers of the
universe are still cooling but you can
see that the afterglow from the Big Bang
was not perfectly uniform it has ripples
at the level of one part in a hundred
thousand these are the tiny fluctuations
that gave rise to galaxies okay so I
hope I've convinced you that
biologically and chemically our history
links us to galaxies to Milky Way and
Andromeda galaxies grow through
cannibalism they grow from tiny seeds in
the universe's fabric so really our true
ancestors are quantum mechanics blown up
by inflation and then gravity amplifies
them over time so you start out with
these ripples in the cosmic ocean you
take a little hotspot there and that
grows into an infant galaxy where the
pieces come together to form a nice
symmetric galaxy in which stars undergo
chemical fusion reactions enrich the
space around them through explosions out
of that out of this material our planet
and star were formed complex molecules
and wonderful entities like these okay
so that's the end of our cycle and I
thought I would spend just one slide
talking about the science internship
program that Jeff referred to early on
we have high school students doing
research at Santa Cruz and in fact they
are we we have freshmen coming in for
high school freshmen coming in high
school seniors and I want to emphasize
that these are real research projects
they're doing they're not just doing
something where you know they're given a
problem where the answer lies on a
certain page in the book
no these are problems for which nobody
knows the answer not the person
assigning them the problem and certainly
not the student who's doing the problem
they're real real research projects
they'll that's how projects are in the
real world they're not they don't have
answers written somewhere they were they
wouldn't be problems anymore and the
topics in which these students are doing
research include astronomy physics
chemistry biomedical engineering marine
biology I think we're gonna add computer
science we're going to add a few other
topics this this coming summer it's been
going on for three years the high school
students project
are part of bigger projects that are
being worked on by PhD students postdocs
faculty undergraduates so they're part
of a community they get to see how
science actually works the process not
just the results and the students have
been amazingly successful in national
science competitions so it's been an
extremely extremely rewarding experience
for me my work gets amplified tenfold
every summer the productivity of my
research group gets amplified every
summer and in fact so much so that we're
continuing this project during the
school year in there in the spare time
between the school work duties the
students are continuing their projects
so that's where I'll stop thank you for
your thank you for your attention
ah that's a very good question so the
question is how do you square inflation
with the speed of light so yes if you're
going to expand by a factor of 10 to the
50 in 10 to the minus 23 seconds
it means particles move apart from each
other faster than the speed of light
this is one of these well hidden secrets
in relativity special relativity tells
us that nothing can travel faster than
the speed of light general relativity
happily allows that allows that if the
gravitational fields are strong enough
if this if space-time is curved not flat
in in topology terms in general
relativity terms then it does allow
travel faster than the speed of light
inflation was designed to satisfy iron
Stein's field equations of general
relativity so yes it does involve travel
fast in the speed of light and yes
relativity allows it general relativity
allows it well but if you take any given
pair of particles their relative speed
is the relative speed is faster than the
speed of light and that is allowed that
is allowed in curved space-time sorry in
what manifold but in this particular
case they're talking about a
four-dimensional space-time it talking
about three dimensions of space one
dimension at time so nothing exotic in
this particular case I have to take this
question please there is such a thing as
neutral matter of course there is
electrons and protons are negatively and
positively charged respectively but
there's a particle called a neutron for
example that is that has no charge at
all and you may have heard there are
also particles called neutrinos there's
been a lot of flap recently about some
people think neutrinos might be
traveling fast in the speed of light and
that hasn't been confirmed yet there's a
joke about this that's going around it
says the bartender says we don't serve
neutrinos here a neutrino walks into a
bar
because you know causality is reversed
okay yes go ahead please yes well if we
don't know outfit I wouldn't be able to
talk about it right so so you I think I
think I understand what you're asking I
think what you're the way you know when
people talk about dark matter why even
talk about it if it's dark there might
be a question dark matter is known to
exist I want to emphasize that dark
matter is known to exist because even
though we don't see any light from it we
can sense its gravity so the reason
people talk about dark matter is because
galaxies are spinning much faster than
they should galaxies are spinning much
faster than they should if the only
gravity they were feeling
were the gravity of all the stars in the
galaxy there's the speeds are way too
high by a factor of 10 way too high
compared to how to the gravity the Stars
should be feeling if stars were the only
thing present in the galaxy so that's
how we know dark matter is present it's
true we can sense its presence through
its gravity even though we can't see its
light I don't know if that that answers
your question at all yes please
that is a tremendously good question the
question is is there any evidence that
other universes exist people speculate
about it they think about it they make
theories about it I think it's unlikely
that we'll ever be able to confirm
whether other universes exist because by
definition our universe is is everything
we can sense everything that can send
our signals when we're talking about
another universe it means we can't make
any measurements of it we can speculate
about it and in fact it's nice to
speculate about it to say that you know
our universe is ordinary it's not a
universe it's part of a multiverse we
can speculate about it and it's nice
philosophically but it when it comes to
the language of physics of getting hard
evidence I think it's gonna be very hard
to prove one way or the other okay let
me take those two questions Matt I'll
come back to you okay let's not with you
that's that's a very good question would
we know about a multiverse by definition
if we're talking about another universe
not as at least as as I understand it as
physics portrays earth today it would
have to be a piece that we're not able
to communicate with adult we're not able
to see we're not able to get any
information from so it doesn't
necessarily mean that galaxies would
collide because of that galaxies collide
any way galaxies collide because gravity
makes them collide even though the
universe is expanding that universe has
stopped expanding in certain pockets
let's say between us and Andromeda the
universe is not expanding there are
certain pockets of space where gravity
has stopped the expansion and in fact
things have reversed and things are
colliding okay
yeah so it's not clear when people talk
about multiple universes it's not clear
that those are going to collide it's not
clear what separates them you know they
talk there's talk of domain walls that
separate them they don't necessarily
communicate with each other no there
wouldn't be collisions between galaxies
and parallel universes that would defeat
calling them parallel universes because
they really have to be out of
communication with each other so I hand
up here yes that's correct
right no so there are two different
things here one is called Dark Matter
one's called dark energy so they're both
dark in the sense we're in the dark
about them so there are some Nobel
prizes to be won there in the future but
so we don't know the exact composition
of dark matter we know its demographics
though we know how much is present in
galaxies and dark might actually even
plays a role in this expansion people
thought early on that if there's dark
matter present then the expansion rate
of the universe should be slowing down
over time and in fact if you look back
at the history of the universe expansion
just by looking out in in space you can
look back in time the universe in fact
was expanding faster then started
slowing down but one of the remarkable
discoveries in the last you know five or
ten years is that that's been speeding
up again so that requires something
exactly as you said has to behave
opposite to dark matter has to have a
pushing out or pressure and that that'd
be really ignorant about and we call
that dark energy and I used to joke to
say that gravity sucks but dark energy
is truly repulsive but both of those
things are here to stay I mean the
evidence is very clear that in fact was
a recent Nobel Prize given out for that
the discovery of dark energy okay let me
take a question over then I'll come back
to you
many of them are optical pictures but
one can take pictures in radio waves and
gamma rays such pixie pictures do exist
in fact slipped in among my pictures
there were some x-ray pictures there
were some infrared pictures there was
many of them were optical or ultraviolet
pictures absolutely right we don't know
if they exist now in fact we have no
choice but to look into the past in fact
when you when you're seeing me and I'm
seeing you I'm seeing you in the past
it's just it so happens that that fast
is only a fraction of a second in the
past which is a small fraction of human
lifetime in this case the distances are
big enough that it's much larger than
human lifetime much larger than our
civilizations lifetime so looking into
the past is nothing new and that's
imposed on us by the finite speed of
light there is no there is no such thing
as the present in some sense you can
only sense the past and how far in the
past depends on how far away so those
two things are couples spaced sometime a
couple along something called a light
cone so as you look out in space you're
looking back in time proportional to the
distance you're looking out to yes I've
heard a question from you please
this sort of question is as the universe
expands them you said the pattern
expands and then shrinks and then
expands again it doesn't shrink the rate
of expansion slows down a little bit
it's still expanding but just not as
rapidly as before and now it's speeding
up again yes to answer your question you
ask does the pattern of galaxies stay
the same on large scales yes it does on
very large scales it does on small
scales it doesn't galaxies there are
pockets of the universe where the
expansion has stopped gravity has taken
over
there's reorganization going on there
those patterns are indeed changing so on
very large scales the overall
distribution pattern of galaxies is
staying the same okay we have the back
there and I'll come back to you okay so
I if you'd ask me this question a few
years ago where the universe is finite
or infinite I would have said it's
infinite but now this talk of
multiverses so that automatically means
there has to be some limit to our
universe so you might ask how far away
is that limit how far away is the
nearest domain wall I can only give you
a guess of that we can see out to 14
billion light years you multiply that by
10 to the power 50 that might give give
us a rough sense of where the nearest
domain wallets oh yes there are
if their domain was there very far away
very likely and your second question
that is a very good question the
question is is there conservation of
mass and energy or is the Sun zero on
non zero the Sun is almost certainly non
zero the you know in fact the universe
is infinite that sum is infinite but how
dark energy behaves as the universe
expands the the so-called equation of
state of dark energy we know how an
ideal gas behaves as you expand or
contracted how dark energy behaves as we
expand as the universe expands is one of
those big burning questions about trying
to characterize dark energy it's
something called the equation of state
of dark energy and there's a there's a
so called quintessence theory of dark
energy that tries to address this
question but it has some variables that
one can try to pin down I see absolutely
burning questions in the okay all right
if we can carry on this discussion of a
lunch if people are coming to lunch that
would be great all right so let's thank
