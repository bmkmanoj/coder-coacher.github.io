I'm from of the United States I went to
university in Boston at MIT then went to
England and then about 23 years ago we
visited India trying to see if we could
do anything to help and about end of 87
my wife and I moved there and we we
started doing work for the poor and
we've been there most of the time since
then we had a few years in England but
even then we were involved in
fundraising and coming back regularly so
we've tried to do a lot there we have a
lot to learn and we've learned a lot and
we hope that we can learn something here
today and make connections we find that
what Google does is as a company where
you bring people together that's
actually extremely valuable in our work
because we're often unaware of great
things that are happening or great
connections that we could make um what
we'll do today that hopefully will
inspire and encourage you and give you
some knowledge as well is will show will
show a brief video we made for USAID we
do a child survival program the video
kind of shows the contrast between the
two India's which you're probably aware
of there is an extremely successful
booming India as well as an India that
is still struggling with with some
really huge developmental issues
especially with health and so this kind
of shows the contrast and then we'll do
a sort of a PowerPoint that goes over a
little bit of what we're doing and that
will provide some talking points and
we'll have some Q&amp;amp;A as well if we have
time so thank you for coming and let's
see if we can get this to work
questions in my mind is something
to be gone
he said pray for me brother
great
that's how you define the robbery line
some say it's half a billion under the
puppy
in my life by my side this is something
show me
beep
to be
he said pray for me rub
do all the questions in my life did you
by my side this is something
to be gone
he said great for me bro
wait for me brother
I'll I'll go ahead and try to get our
PowerPoint up sorry for some of the
technical difficulties but we find
working to help the the poor and India
to be tremendously inspiring and
encouraging because the hearts of the
people are so eager they're one of the
things in doing development work is is
that we found that people really want a
better life all over the world and if
you give them a chance they they really
respond to it this is a bit more about
our work hopefully it'll go
to learn the earlier video the issue we
seein in India is that globalization has
really contributed leannan economy
rapidly developing night since we're
able in India to deliver high-quality
services and support to the world
economy now that we're all connected
better partially by Google that has
really boosted India and yet India has
tremendous needs still with a huge
number of poor people living in the
villages and these people are now
streaming into the city looking for
employment and the country still has
tremendous challenges in the area of
health education and many other areas
there's worse malnutrition in India than
in sub-saharan Africa you know the work
most malnourished nation in the world is
actually India which is a shocking thing
because of the fact that India has a
strong history of producing food but
distribution is weak
it's the same tune as the other one
we're a grassroots NGO there are many
good NGOs working in all over the world
that we are one of where we hope we are
one of them and we don't give money to
other NGOs we tried it directly we try
to directly intervene so we're working
mainly in urban areas we started in 1991
officially though earlier we had already
been working unofficially these are the
cities and towns we work in around India
you can see a number on the coast
because of tsunami we have got a hundred
programs now we do a lot of work through
volunteers our goal is to make a big
difference in the communities we work in
our goal is not to help as many people
as we can in the sense let's help a
billion people we'd rather help a
million people well then try to help a
billion people and not succeed because
the job is so huge and we we try to
offer services scope I'm Singh all
the needs of communities we work in
beginning with whatever we can start
with depending on our partners and the
local area this is a bit of the
indication of our impact before we
actually educating five thousand kids
now and training five thousand people a
year this a little outdated our slides
we run six care homes to take care of
abandoned children and women some of
them are for hiv-positive kids who have
nowhere to go and we take care of them
until their death and then we also have
a couple of orphanages one in trichy and
one in New Delhi that that also do
adoptions we work with the mentally
handicapped in Delhi with a government
center that was really having a lot of
problems but we've come in to try and
strengthen them as an institution and
help them taking care of orphans is is
sort of the most expensive kind of thing
that an NGO can do but it's very
meaningful for those of us involvement
and my wife and I've had the blessing of
adopting one Indian daughter who's now
15 and a half she's a fantastic young
lady this is our orphanage in trichy
which doug has also contributed Doug
banks the Google employees also
contributed to help run this orphanage
we find money goes a long way in the
third world
we work around India the government has
a good program called sarva shiksha
abhiyan um it doesn't reach all the kids
and sarva shiksha john means education
for all kind of like No Child Left
Behind we're currently as of now with
corporate partners and others teaching
5,000 kids in full-time education this
is a school we built in Gujarat after
the earthquake though disasters
unfortunately her people but they also
provide the opportunity to rehabilitate
communities since the world attention is
on them we work with a number of
corporate sponsors to do education when
a child goes to our schools for for
their whole primary education by the end
they know english and they're equipped
to become part of the new indian economy
and we have we have lots of different
schools around the country totaling
about 5,000 kids we're using computer
based education now and many of them
this is one we built in a tsunami
affected area thanks to a german company
one of the reasons the successful India
doesn't always reach down to the lowest
levels is that in the Indian schooling
system often schools educate only in the
local language which for the poor means
that they're not able to connect to the
new economy through English the other
challenge that occurs is that sometimes
schools catering to slum children are
not very well funded ortotzo you'll have
50 60 kids in a school in a room you you
won't have very high dedication level by
the teachers and so on and so and often
there's not enough government schools to
actually cater to all the kids and
there's a lot of child labor so we try
to combat child labor by providing
education with school meals and so on we
do a variety of health interventions for
a while we did a lot of direct primary
health care programs we found those were
very expensive and so we shifted towards
health education though we still do some
primary health programs directly giving
people medical care our largest health
program right now is in Delhi we run
what's called a child survival program
where we work with a large slum where
there's no government health care and we
are that's a TB docs program this is a
very successful thing all over India we
we help about 500 people a year to avoid
death by making sure they get
tuberculosis direct observation and
treatment young but so that that's one
program we're in with the large health
program I was describing is in sanya
bihar in delhi this is a typical urban
slum there's no health care there about
200,000 people live there we work
educating the slum about proper health
as well as trying to get the government
to deliver health care in this
particular community and we're trying to
create a replicable model so that the
government can do this in other urban
areas that don't have enough health care
we've done a good amount of work with
hiv/aids India's well ahead of some some
parts of the world with HIV in the sense
that because we've learned from bad
experiences in certain
trees the world knows better now how to
stop aids from going out of control and
so the Indian government has made a
serious effort at trying to educate
people about HIV the problem is still
real and significant but it's not as bad
as it could be we work our first
programs with leprosy patients we
bandaged them we've helped to
rehabilitate them one of our most
successful programs is in Delhi with the
village of Hope where we had a community
of about 5,000 people ninety percent
we're begging and fifteen years later
almost all of them are working it's a
small program but very significant in
that we've rehabilitated leprosy
patients their families to work this is
our one home for the elderly which again
there are so many needs in America with
the elderly as well but we do what we
can m for a group in Kerala of elderly
persons one of our biggest things we aim
at to connect the two India's together
is training young people we found that
there's a lot of extremely intelligent
and eager people living in India slums
but they can't get an entry level job
that pays well because they lack the
social skills or the computer skills or
the language skills to to even get their
foot in the door at the bottom level of
the of corporate India which just leads
to a better life for them and so we we
work with a number of corporates to do
vocational training a lot of is with
computers we also do English soft skills
financial literacy we teach masonry
sewing Beauty skills cellphone repair
just just anything that we feel that
there will be locally available jobs
that the the people can connect to and
this is one of the most effective things
we feel like you can do for the poor is
training them we also provide a
microcredit for four people as part of
an integrated package we need to do more
in the area of microcredit we've not
done what some of the the big micro
credit institutions do where they all do
millions of loans we tend to work with
communities so we'll do clones in the
communities
we work in but we're trying to do more
with that and I know Google's getting
involved with that through google.org
this electrical repairs it's a very good
skill to have these days since India's
electrifying as a country these are
women with dried fish so gamma or
handicrafts that they're making is part
of small businesses we help them to
create we're working with Walmart in
India to run industrial centres of hope
these are in these are in some of the
big industrial areas of India and in
each area we educate and we train people
so you can see just in the Walmart
program we're teaching about 3,000 kids
and training 1500 years so that's why
our numbers are bit higher overall than
some of our summary slides indicate
there still is a lot of child labour in
India unfortunately um companies are
getting increasingly sophisticated at
avoiding it Walmart's doing a good job
trying to prevent it but Walmart's not
the only buyer in India and there's
there's a lot of child labor that goes
undetected because people now have moved
the kids to work at night so that
inspectors won't find them inspectors
come in the day so if kids work at night
the inspectors won't see them so that's
the which you find out if you're working
in the community but not if you just
occasionally visit um we're we're
excited that in the program we're
involved with obviously we've we don't
see child labor this is a bit of our
financial turnover that means the number
at the right means about two and a half
million dollars a year so we've we've
been growing but there's a lot more a
lot more to do and that's it thank you
so that's a little bit of a summary I'll
talk a little bit more and then we'll
open it up for interactive discussion um
if that's if that's okay with you so for
for me personally I I wanted to make a
difference with my life at once
University of that at MIT and as a young
person I had the opportunity to go to
India and I think we all have to seek
the opportunities were given and and at
the age i was at i was able to move
there and to do something personally
there which not everyone gets a chance
to do but my connections and situation
gave me that opportunity and we we saw a
lot of grassroots needs and it it was
very upsetting to me to visit calcutta
in 1985 and to see people who were very
kind but who were sitting on the
roadside and they were selling small
sticks you know the neem sticks sticks
to clean your teeth with or they were
repairing shoes or pulling rickshaws and
really struggling to make very little
money and I was really troubled that I
couldn't even speak the language to
communicate with them much less try to
help them and handing them a little
money is not really what's going to help
someone it's really helping them to help
themselves and so we decided we
live in India and try to engage and
figure out what we can do to help people
people in India have been extremely
hospitable and kind to us they're
wonderful I've had the blessing of
sitting in many poor people's homes and
they will feed you not because you're a
foreigner but because you're a guess
they'll feed you and the rest of the
week they may only eat rice but they'll
make sure that you eat well in their
house and that's a that's a real
testimony to the people there we've seen
that if you give people training and
education they're really able to come up
in life and we have graduates from our
some of our programs who are now making
who are now working at places like
Google in India or ordell or other
places who were you know living in the
most wretched of conditions in slums we
see one of the big challenges in India
right now is urban ization most of india
lives in villages and because now the
cities have great opportunity incredible
numbers of people are moving in and the
cities don't stop you move from moving
in so cities like Delhi have 600,000
people moving there every year and they
just move into existing slums that have
very little water medical care or
education and so the slums of india the
conditions are incredibly bad in places
where even ten years ago they might have
been okay but people are just jamming in
and the reason they jam in is if you
live in New Delhi you can make enough
money to send money home to your family
and really help them and so you as a
young man or even a young family who
want to help your family in impoverished
Bihar or utter pradesh you can make so
much more money in Delhi or Mumbai or
ahmedabad or Bangalore than you could in
your village that it's worth moving into
so there's a whole range of problems in
urban India now that are worse today
than there were ten years ago and the
villages of India are rapidly changing
they're getting electrified and there's
more and more water and roads connecting
the villages but there's still
tremendous inequality in the country and
the economy is booming but we see a real
danger of social unrest because what
used to happen is most people were poor
now there
many people who know people from their
same caste and background who have
become way wealthier than them and so
there's increasing unrest and
unhappiness among the poor why are we
not included in this booming economy and
our goal is as an NGO is to do what we
can in as many places we can to to
deliver compassion and compassion not as
a handout but the idea is that we want
to help people help themselves and we
don't want to do it for the sake of
let's see how what's the biggest number
that we can claim we're not out to
become the biggest NGO we we want to
retain our quality or our connection and
i noticed this i visited google a few
times and walked around even though
you're a fairly large company you still
seem to have whatever qualities made you
this company you know there's a sense of
joy on the campus a lot of a lot of
positive things that are there we hope
is an organization as we grow that we
can retain our values and not just
become sort of a corporate NGO that does
a lot of stuff but at the grassroots is
unresponsive so that's a little bit
about about us and I have a wife and
four kids and I'm very glad I could be
here I'm here on to get my visa renewed
every five years I have to come back to
the United States or somewhere to apply
for a visa so I'm trying to get back
into India to continue our work i need
to i left one of my kids behind my
indian daughter didn't need a visa so
there you go so i'll go ahead and open
it up now for a few minutes of questions
we have a little bit of time and i'm
really thankful that you could come and
also grateful for the work you do at
Google I use your product every day many
times as do most people who have
computers so thank you so as Doug
mentioned what can employees or people
who work in this industry like Google
what can we do to help in any way or
address any challenges other than
sending money I think that's a great
question on what what
what and your name again is a jewel what
rajul vota was asking is what can we as
employees other than giving money or do
to help to help people and I think that
that's a that's a great question i think
there is there's a few things that to
consider one one thing to be aware of is
creating connections is very valuable
often we as charities are completely
ignorant of resources or people who
would want to help us but we just don't
know where to go like I'm still making
the effort of connecting with the right
people in Google org even though I'm
right here in Google today I am I
haven't SAT with the right people in
Google org to see what overlap our
organization has with what Google is
already doing that is very good and you
earlier before the talk pointed me to
the idea that NGOs and charities can get
on to Google Grants and get themselves
properly listed so search engines can
find them you may be aware of entities
that could be of interest to us and
we're a meeting would help us and not
I'm not just talking about us any other
charity connecting people together which
is what your company does is actually
very valuable and as an NGO I have very
little time to actually meet people
because where there's so many demands on
my time so if I'm able to have an
intelligent search so to speak where I
get introduced to the right person who
might be interested in what I'm doing or
we may be able to team up together
that's a that's a that's one really
useful thing I think a second thing is
that if you're able to visit a charity
and it could be ours or it could be
another one that's doing good work and
personally connect to a local program
you can become someone who helps promote
that particular program because you'll
have your own ability to speak about it
you won't just be here something on the
net that you can look at I was there
like I know Doug and Nathan visited our
programs they know that we really are
doing something and you know our
powerpoints don't always even accurately
reflect Fleck things because we don't we
don't employ that many people to do the
powerpoint most of our people
we're actually delivering the work the
care on the ground so when we get
volunteers who can speak about what
we're doing that helps us but it also it
changes your life you know when you go
and you interact with the poor or serve
the poor anywhere you go it just it
makes something inside of you different
I know for my kids having my kids are
live in India is really great for them
because instead of just being worried
about the latest BMX trends which my
son's into BMX biking he knows there's a
world of people out there who can't
afford a bicycle much less a BMX bike
and and you know they can do the proper
stunts you know and so bringing your
kids over if you have kids is very
encouraging we had a friends from San
Francisco do that recently which was
really great the O'Hara's I'm staying
with them and and i think the the third
thing is that you can give and giving if
you're able to make a personal
connection through visiting is more even
more meaningful now i don't think it's
bad to give i think it's good to give
just because charities whether they're
grameen bank or ours or any other there
are many good charities that do good
work who appreciate funds but that's
that's sort of my three-part answer of
what what you can do and i know time is
limited for you and so you know you have
to figure out what can I do while
supporting my family that's a follow up
question one problem i have is
connecting with some of these charities
that are doing good work when I go to
India on vacation I feel like yeah if
there was some place where I can just
plug in and say hey I'm a NRI I would
like to you know spend a week of my
vacation doing some good work but I have
no idea who to plug into well not now
you now yes yes I have your business
card and i'll send you an email but you
know there is a large body of indians
living outside the US who have gone
through that realization that well they
can afford all these things but lots of
people who cannot
they want to do something for them other
than just sending money but there isn't
a very sort of organized way to tap into
that energy see even what you just
shared if we'd welcome you to volunteer
and to come even if it's for a week and
we'd welcome you if you create some kind
of way to let Indians know that we
welcome volunteers we find volunteers
very useful because the if they come
over we expect them to pay for
themselves but then we we ask them go
back to where you're from and tell
people what you saw that we do and and
that's a very credible explanation there
is a tremendous amount of fraud in the
NGO world which certainly in India but
all over the world there's there's two
kinds of frauds in the NGO world one
kind of fraud CNN had on recently that
forty percent of aid to Afghanistan goes
into expat salaries and and you know the
the you have all these experts are and
Joe has an expat me and I when I started
out I was very cheap I lived on very
little money now I cost more my kids are
in the American School I'm our one expat
for you know Asia and and and I'm
expensive now hopefully I'm generating
enough value and we're not we try not to
hire expats because they're too
expensive we want to hire local people
who are more bang for the buck but
that's an issue in the charity world as
many charities have huge buildings full
of expats and you're paying for the
expats and that's not administration
they'll call that programming second
issue is there's a lot of financial
scandals that occur in the third world
because accounting laws are are loose we
as an NGO are approached on a weekly
basis with offers of between 10 to 50
million dollars if will participate in
money laundering and of course we have
to say no because we don't do such
things but the fact that we're offered
on a weekly basis this kind of a deal
tells us that there might be some that
are taking this kind of deal and and
it's there it's very sophisticated now
the the money laundering that goes on
through
in the third world and it's that they
create shell companies and so on it's
very lucrative and it's one of the ways
that the people are turning black money
into white and so it's really good if
you visit because then you see a real
charity during real work and you know
you avoid all those kind of pitfalls and
there are many good charities doing real
work and there's also a lot of bogus
stuff that goes on as well so that's a
that's another good question though is
what what can can Indians do and we what
we love the connection because we know
people want to help but time is limited
so you know spread the word if you can
about us and we also link people up with
other charities if we're not the right
one for them because we're not working
everywhere okay great any other other
questions I have so following up on the
how we can help and your name my name is
nila for nila fardale hi Nell effort
nice nice to meet you so be we have an
engineering office and head to bother
you have an entering office in bangalore
and a lot of Googlers who visit and i'm
visiting in May and I'm okay I'm gonna
be there for for two weeks I'm not it's
not time off but during the evenings or
something I'd like to go and figure out
if I can help and this is like I'd like
to take it on right now like what is it
is it a possibility for me to go there
part time a few hours a day or a number
of days of a week and then this could
actually be put on our website that if
you're there you can do this and it's
not a well yeah what I would say is this
the answer to that is yes and we run
programs with Dell and computer so
shi'ites in Hyderabad at night they
usually don't run but because your
office's tend to be flexible there's
probably a way if you get in touch with
us for you to structure your schedule
where you could be at our program and
help out for a few hours you know and we
we again we welcome volunteers if we
start to get a regular stream we would
hope that we'd get money somehow because
it costs a staff time to host lots of
volunteers but we figure we would
because the the volunteers themselves
might raise small donations you know and
that makes it when you know when a local
program gets a volunteer who then gives
the local program that's in their
interest it's worth their time to hold
to you because they know they get more
money to help to help their their people
locally so you know if you email me your
dates of when you're coming and where
what I need is very simple date and
location then I forward it to someone
and say please handle it and if you
don't hear from them you can bother me
and say hey they don't answer emails and
then I'll try to ensure that the you get
an answer but yes and we do have one
employee of Google who I know a friend
of ours who works in the the Hyderabad
campus her name is romita and we we
welcome volunteers and we often get
corporate volunteers sometimes companies
will send even groups of people and we
host them which we find very enriching
for both the company and and and our
team our teams love getting volunteers
because when someone comes and you can
show them what you do it really yeah you
we can shut this down if you want it
really inspires them you know like like
we've got people who work very hard in
the field eight hours a day five days a
week they rarely get someone who
encourages them maybe I'll visit them
once in 18 months maybe one of my
colleagues visits every six months but
to have someone from America come
volunteer and admire their work that's
something they're gonna remember so it
helps not only the poor but it helps our
staff and our staff are mostly doing it
for the for the sake of they want to
help you know they could make more money
elsewhere but they they get a lot of
satisfaction so getting some
encouragement is good for them because
they work in difficult conditions
hyderabad our staff work in ok
conditions it's quite nice our
facilities there but thanks for the
question though it's a good question we
have a few more minutes if you have
other questions or or thoughts I want to
um I just wondering for all the
different programs you have is there one
that you feel like has a notion of kind
of a tipping point where I think
something Google in particular is is
good at are excited about is is things
that after a while kind of have a
snowball effect you know what I'm saying
like so it's
think you're helping someone who's say
can you help them get better and that's
awesome and that's great the reason that
the computer program spoke to me more is
that you know you have this person who
then goes on get a job and could in turn
give back or you know inspire motivate
other people are there particular
programs you you would single out as
like having the most potential impact or
the biggest yeah that's very interesting
because I've really tried to think about
this I know you had the outstanding
people from Grameen Bank here a few at
some point this is a really interesting
question because I've studied
development on the field level for more
than 20 years and you know we've poured
globally incredible amounts of resources
into places which sometimes mixed
results like 300 billion dollars has
been given in Africa with mixed
developmental results and similarly in
India their programs we've done well
we've spent a lot of money and resources
and at the end of 10 years we go well
what did did we make a tipping point the
answer is no like we did mobile medical
clinics that helped a lot of people but
it didn't really change anything it just
helped those people and and and you know
so we've learned what we're excited
about right now is the combination of
microcredit and vocational training as
being something that can be a tipping
point this is what we've discovered what
we've discovered is not the gospel or
the truth this is just our perspective
someone else may have a different one
and they could be right what we've found
in with microcredit is that often
microcredit went down on a mass level
when there's millions of loans most of
the loans are a lower-cost alternative
to moneylenders but they're being used
for consumption this is one reason why
even though in Bangladesh one quarter of
microcredit one quarter of Bangladesh
ease in the last 20-something years have
received microcredit so it's actually
enough to change the country and yet on
the Human Development Index Bangladesh
is number 136 now and they were what
number 135 20 years ago so microcredit
alone is not the answer in
our experience and that's because if you
if you loaned everybody a micro credit
loan and they're all selling to each
other but you've not empowered them to
create a business that adds enough value
that they start exporting from their
village or exporting from their country
you still have a very large group of
poor people selling to each other and so
you haven't reached a tipping point and
so through through what we've been
experimenting with we're now trying to
add microcredit in to our training
programs where we will give people
training and then we'll give those same
people we trained and we know a
trustworthy loans and we think this is
very exciting because it gives us a
pre-screening ability to choose people
who are going to be successful as
entrepreneurs and not just borrow the
money to help their family which though
we think that's noble we don't think
loans to help your family
developmentally are always the most
effective way for an NGO to do it and
that's often where microcredit ends up
going is it is to meet family needs and
there's nothing wrong with helping
family but you want to actually create
wealth for the local economy so that I
mean that question is a good one but I
think that we're seeing some great and
exciting developmental results in the
tsunami area we've had a chance to
invest a lot in certain tsunami
communities because the the world paid
attention they were poor before tsunami
but with the world paying attention
there was a large amounts of money given
and we got some of that and we've built
some very large training programs in
nagapattinam we've also are building
microcredit there and so that they're
all these little businesses that are
starting up of people we've trained and
it's as a model is very exciting so I'm
hoping that we can layer microcredit on
we've seen organizations like Kiva and
others that we're not yet able to tap
into because we're not big enough in the
microcredit arena but if we get big
enough we could directly connect
borrowers in a place like India to
global capital markets which is now
available I know through some entities
so that's kind of what we're
strategically what we're aiming at right
now and we you know and this is my
comments on microcredit or not to say
it's a bad
thing but it's not the answer in and of
itself from our experience now someone
else may say you're wrong and they may
be right you know I can only do what
I've learned in my context and I'm not
trying to be the world's expert but at
least the expert of what I'm doing I
need to be um one thing I wanted to ask
about one when I won with Doug a couple
months ago and one thing that you were
discussing you moved in 1987 and so
you've had about 20 years of experience
in India and one of the things that I
noticed I was both in bangalore and
delhi is just just the changes that were
that obviously have changed in the last
couple of years there were shopping
centers and offices that look like there
had been dropped in by helicopters among
surroundings that were not not nearly as
gleaming and silvery but like I'm
curious on that point because that's one
thing that I missed is I don't have a
sense of the overarching what improve
what improvements have there been what
improvement have been made in the over
the last 20 years what have you seen
that gives us some hope for for in terms
of economic development and the dist a
Bushman of the middle class well you
know i-i've as someone who's lived in
India for a long time I've been very
encouraged when I went there I was just
filled with a sadness that I couldn't
describe I mean I just felt so sad there
was so much pain in poverty and I just
thought this is never gonna change you
know I mean I felt completely
overwhelmed and those who grew up in
India may understand this feeling but
what I've seen is a few things the
government has done a good job at
electrifying the villages okay their
electricity is spreading around India
the government has and I'm not talking
politically here I'm just saying in
general I've seen this secondly I've
seen that there has been a serious
effort to build roads in the last 10
years there are now actual highways in
India that you can drive on without a
certainty of death as you go between
cities i mean you know and that's very
important to develop the country i see i
see the government having a number of
terrifically failed programs like the
distribution of food
icds there's some programs almost all
the money is stolen like incredible
failures but there are some government
programs that are that are working like
there are there are primary health care
centers in almost every village of India
I've seen improvements in water you know
I've seen with infrastructure it's
varies from state to state a place like
Bangalore is a complete disaster
infrastructure Lee Hyderabad is really
coming up Delhi is coming up and that
has a lot to do with the state
government and this is my opinion you
know but I'm not impressed with
bangalore 15 years ago I was impressed
with bangalore now I look at bangalore
and i think compared infrastructure lee
it's it's really i mean it's
unbelievable the problems bangalore has
now whereas you know I Calcutta is
another one that hasn't come up cities
like Chandigarh Hyderabad Chennai has
come up a lot Delhi Mumbai has always
been quite an efficient City so you know
I see a lot of reason to believe that
India as a nation is at a tipping point
and it's a very exciting time for the
country and I also see tremendous
corruption still it's like tremendous
problems but it's an exciting time
because i don't i don't think it's all
in vain you know the country is a great
country capable of even greater things
in the future and it's a democracy which
is also very positive you know they they
really are trying to fix what's wrong
um one other thing that okay one other
question I have because most of us are
geeks yeah so in terms of infrastructure
not only not only the base things that
you think about like roads and
electricity but the product well and one
thing I noticed is like the
proliferation of of wireless telephony
yeah I didn't mention that that's
another incredible we're better than the
US on that yeah tell me about it um I
still have my terrible nokia um but what
I also wondering about the the internet
the possibilities for for data networks
how are they getting into the cities is
it being helpful that there is access to
a wealth of information both Doug and I
work on book search into villagers to us
but the Internet at large and how is
that helping I see i think that the in
terms of india moving up as an economic
power this globalization fueled by the
internet and telecommunications becoming
more accessible that is what's fueling
the boom indian poor people have phones
now you saw that even auto rickshaw
drivers have phones india skipped
landlines completely most houses still
don't have phones in in their house
connected to the network but everyone
has a cell phone now the internet I've
seen that Indian companies live by the
internet wireless internet is available
in almost every part of India now at
slow speeds but it's you know if you
have a Tata card or a Lions card you can
use it people who can't afford computers
they're like cyber cafes in every nook
and corner and like people so they're
very cheap and so almost everyone even
if you cannot afford a computer you can
still have access to Internet yeah yeah
as you were saying one of the things
that amazes me is even people from our
social networks who are very poor their
kids are on Facebook or you know I'm on
these kind of social networks that you
see on the internet which is really
is really amazing to me you know that
that here's a here's a family I knew who
was living in a hut and now their kid is
one of my kids friends on a social
network so this is very exciting for
India but the challenge is how do you
connect a poor family to that new world
because right now there many poor
families can't make the jump and that's
what we we hope we can be a part of I'm
really grateful you could come here
today I'm glad to give you my card and
you know try and make a connection if
you if you have something that you'd
like to talk about or if you're visiting
and we're thankful to google for the
opportunity to share this and if you
want to pursue some of the ideas that
you have you know we we really encourage
this and I thank you for your time
thanks a lot
