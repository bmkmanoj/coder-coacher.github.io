right we had to have a token founder and
Kevin crushed it so we went out looking
for security keynotes and we we got
nothing short of the best of the bunch
this guy Hugh Thompson has literally
given a talk at every testing and
security conference on the planet okay
we should be good and and he's he's
nailed them all in fact for four years I
held the record at star maybe you all
some of you all been to star for the
best presentation of all time right and
one number one and he was the one that
knocked me from my podium a few years
ago so I have a lot of reasons not to
like this guy I have a lot of reasons to
like this guy as well because at one
point he was my student many many years
ago and then years later I turned on the
TV and I'm watching MSNBC and Lou Dobbs
is giving his show and all of a sudden
this guy walked on to Lou Dobbs his show
and gets interviewed by Lou Dobbs about
some virus or something nasty that
happened to the world so the display is
try it again a Windows user
well that is the old joke right uh
there's an electrical engineer
mechanical engineer and software
engineer in a car car breaks down
mechanical mechanical engineer gets out
and starts checking hoses and stuff and
an electrical engineer gets out and
checks the battery and the software
engineer rolls down all the windows and
rolls and back up again okay so and then
he hue also is the program chair of the
this might even be one of the largest
technical conferences in the world the
RSA show that is it still in San
Francisco yeah and so so I'm really
pleased that he was here to join us and
I won't introduce him any longer now
that the equipment's working Hugh
Thompson thanks for that introduction I
think I think man I haven't quite known
either to thank you yet or not for that
but it's a real pleasure to be here at
gee tech thanks James so much for
inviting me to come you know it's great
to be able to talk to the testing
community and I know this is the token
security talk but Allah I'll do my best
represent our kind of community of know
which is what the security community is
usually known as well Allah I'll try to
represent as well so this is a talk
really about risk so when you add a
feature to a piece of software to a
hardware system you get utility but
utility trades off with risk in a very
very interesting way so this is really a
talk about looking at the features that
you add and trying to understand the
risks that come from them and how does a
bad guy gonna look at this thing so
that's how the users going to interact
with it and how much they love it and
enjoy it and the great things they're
gonna say on their blog or their Twitter
feed but how is an attacker going to
view it and to SAP this stage I want to
share a personal
curity story with you so I'm from Nassau
Bahamas I don't have anybody's ever been
there beautiful vacation spot a few I
haven't we need your tourist dollars so
even though it's a down economy consider
us and there's been two key events in
Bahamian history at least from my
perspective the first was our
independence from the British in 1973
which I'm sure you guys can relate to
and it was actually some applause for
that rich little troubling and then the
second which was just as important to me
personally was the introduction of soda
machines into high schools dude this was
like a pivotal event in Bahamian history
and you know we'd already we'd always
seen soda machines on pirated reruns of
Beverly Hills 902 100 that kind of stuff
and you know when the government
announced that they were buying a bunch
of them everybody's really excited so
anyway this is about three weeks after
they installed the first soda machines
me and two other guys are kind of
hanging around one and one of the guys
was my best friend all through high
school who later became a priest which
may be relevant shortly the second guy
though I'm just gonna say it upfront we
did not know him very well so I just
want to throw that out there early is
not a friend it's just a guy we just
kind of you know casually knew so we're
standing around this thing and it's got
a big handwritten sign on it that says
US quarters only now to give you a
little background the Bahamas has its
own currency the Bahamian dollar that's
artificially pegged one to one with the
US dollar which was a good idea until a
couple of years ago and the way things
work over there is if you buy something
in u.s. or Bahamian you'll get mixed
change so you can use either currency
interchangeably
now the government had purchased these
machines very cheap from the US so
they'd only take us quarters and none of
us had a u.s. quarter and so we asked a
question that any of you would naturally
ask in that kind of circumstance what
else can we put into this machine
we're said to give us a soda now we try
the legitimate things at the beginning
and we put a bohemian quarter and no
dice and didn't work we tried a u.s.
nickel even kind of didn't register and
so then we essentially started to fuzz
it like a guy you know Prada washer off
of a chair through that and nothing was
happening another guy tried a pencil but
there was a user interface problem there
that didn't work out very well another
guy tried saltwater but turns out that
was just masse so that that didn't cut
it and eventually we got down to using a
Bahamian tents and peace now if you've
never seen one of these they're kind of
interesting
they're corrugated around the side so it
sort of looks nothing like a u.s.
quarter but when we drop this thing in
the machine instantly registers 25 cents
now we are understandably pretty excited
about this you know it's a pretty
substantial discount on the sodas so we
look for as many 10-cent pieces we could
find right so we put another one in it
says 50 cents another one in
seventy-five cents a last one in it says
a buck I hit the button and we get a
soda and you know so we got 1314 sodas
and then on the fifteenth soda when we
went to hit the button the unthinkable
happened like worst case scenario for us
the red light comes on so this thing's
Atta sodas now not not willing to take a
loss on our fifteenth soda we hit the
coin Return button
now given the wording you would expect
coin returned to me we have just given
this machine some coins and now it will
return those coins from whence they came
kind of thing it turns out though how it
was implemented as feature then it takes
coins from the bottom of the machine
slightly more mechanically efficient
than taking the coins you just put in so
we hit coin return and we get one u.s.
dollar worth of coins so now at this
point the three of us react very
differently so personally you know I'm
all for discount soda so I'm like dude
now we're into money laundering right so
I followed I followed what's known as
the responsible disclosure method and I
said dude you know we just got to tell
the principal all right this is what you
do when you find something really bad
you go and tell the company hey look in
a senator okay so that at least that's
the width story goes so the second guy
who later turned out to be the priest
you know it might be relevant this guy
was more of a gregarious kind of fellow
and he took the full disclosure model so
he's like man we got to tell all our
friends right so he is
that's reasonable I thought that was so
it's reasonable and then the third guy
again I just want to emphasize he was
not a friend not a close associate I
don't know where he is now this guy
followed a very interesting model that's
now known as nondisclosure he said and
he was very forceful so we listened him
for a while but he said don't tell
anybody we're gonna make us some money
all right so again it was very
convincing argument at the time so the
next day I see this guy walking up the
driveway to school and he's jingling
like an ice-cream truck you know just
loaded with these tents so he wiped out
that machine that the guy wasn't
supposed to tell anybody told his cousin
in another school it escalated into this
issue that became known as soda gate and
not not a lot happens in the Bahamas
it's easy to make papers but let's look
at this from a vulnerability perspective
what went wrong when the Machine
measured and asked the question is this
a u.s. quarter it did it in two ways it
looked first a diameter of the coin
right so it took the diameter of the
coin measured it with some type of
caliper and then it looked at the weight
of the coin and it turned out just as a
matter of coincidence if you measure a
Bahamian tense and piece the size is
almost equal if you measure the weight
again almost equal indiscernible by the
equipment that they were using now think
about this feature because this is a
choice of how they decided to implement
it think about this from a rest
perspective when they built this machine
they built it in the context of the US
right that was their deployment model
we're gonna sell these things within the
US when they did that I'm sure they
probably went to a Home Depot or
whatever thing like that existed back
then and bought any round thing that
they could buy the cost less than a
quarter and throw it in and and that was
their testing right if it dude if it's
costs more than a quarter why would we
care cost less than a quarter it's kind
of an interesting case
but they had this assumption in mind but
didn't track that assumption through the
lifespan of the product all right so it
seemed like a good idea at the time but
now they're selling into a different
market it's going into a country where
every single user in their pocket has a
weapon that they could use against this
thing a very very different risk model
so I want you to keep this soda machine
in the back of your mind because we're
gonna refer to it again a little bit
later because I think it gets to the
heart of where security problems are
today we still got buffer overflows we
still have sequel injection problems
cross-site scripting still a big issue
but more than that we're getting into
this very interesting place where we
built a set of assumptions around
features and who will use those features
and how they will use them and attackers
are starting to use those against us
well before I go there I wanted to make
a quick public service announcement
because this is as I mentioned talk
about assessing risk and the of the
announcement is there is a current shark
crisis that I've labeled shark mageddon
I don't know if anybody's been following
this but a report came out earlier this
year that said the number of worldwide
shark attacks is up 25% do 25% increase
that's crazy you know I said I was from
the Bahamas you know I look into destiny
at any one time I'd probably have four
family members in the ocean you know do
I call somebody do I have a cousin blow
a coconut you know how or a conch shell
you know how big an issue is this thing
so I decided to investigate further
MSNBC front-page story shark attached
rose by 25 percent across ago and look
at this very scary picture of a shark
which emphasizes the problem Los Angeles
Times us led the world and shark attacks
last year again panic serious concern
now let's take a look behind the numbers
that got us to this point of panic or
earlier this year the number of shark
attacks world wide went from 63 to 79
yes that is a 25% increase I will give
you that but the chances of you
personally getting attacked by a shark
are like miniscule like the chances of
you getting maimed by a coconut and then
like some kind of rabid squirrel
attacking you and in combination are
much greater than you actually getting
attacked by shark and I think for that
reason we're in a really interesting
state and risk management we either
don't assess risk at all or when we
assess it we assess it on very bad or
incomplete data so we're gonna go back
to that in a second oh yeah actually
much of the increase was due to two very
angry sharks I thought that was kind of
interesting that one shark can make a
difference if you if you take nothing
else away No okay now this is another
interesting risk case here was a fellow
who was on vacation didn't realize he
was taking a risk but took a photo at
one might say an unfortunate angle and
somebody put it online and labeled this
guy the thumb man because of his
striking striking resemblance to a human
thumb right you know that's right very
interesting again you know very poor
risk assessment didn't quite understand
you know what was going to happen but I
want you to consider this thumb man for
a moment because he is going to be kind
of our inspiration for the rest of the
talk I feel because the thumb man was
not defeated by this incident in fact
the thumb man owned his thumb likeness
and created thumb and net
he went web 2.0 entrepreneurial you know
I'm gonna deploy he started selling
thumb man merchandise I own a thumb man
t-shirt so it and and I have discount
code if anybody's interested later come
and see me after the talk but there he
overcame this kind of unfortunate risk
choice and turned it into an advantage
and I think that that's what we can do
today with some of the rich ices that
we're making particularly around sharing
data and I'm gonna get into some very
specific examples of that risk is is a
really tricky thing so we looked at the
case of the Sharks where we think we're
assessing risk
we're actually assessing a variant
appropriately and messaging it very
inappropriately this happens often in
the security space we rely on fear
uncertainty and doubt often to convince
somebody that you should do something
from a security perspective if we don't
rely on fear uncertainty and doubt we
tend to go back and rely on some set of
data which is grossly and complete and
truly misrepresents what the real risk
is so I'm going to talk a little bit
about how we may be able to get better
risk assessments and I think the biggest
problem with security is that it's
difficult to measure what you prevent it
even retrospectively so I you know I
talked to my mom last night James says
my mom you know we probably talk to her
every know you had thumb and on that
dude I got the discount code man don't
buy without the discount code you're
only hurting yourself so every time I
talk to my mom when we end the call she
says son did you take your vitamins and
last I said son did you pack your
vitamins which I guess a small variation
on that and she's never built for me the
right business case to convince me to
take my vitamins because look I take the
vitamins and sometimes I still get sick
I don't take the vitamins and sometimes
I still get sick it's very difficult for
me to quantify how much benefit that
prevention gave me so we're going to
look at some math
I think that may help to give some more
clarity around that but before we get
there I want to share another story with
you I think this is before I met you
James and before I met Ibrahim who's
speaking tomorrow rusi who was here
earlier it was definitely during such a
misspent period in my college career I
was really young everybody kind of makes
some unfortunate choices during those
times and for me you know i hain't hung
out and kind of a sort of geeky crowd
and I say that with pride and it was a
very important time I think in the
formation of technology because it was
when the world's first talking Barney
doll was introduced to the market now we
had seen this talking Barney doll and we
had heard that some people had gone out
and were able to actually reprogram the
EEPROM that it was sort of based off of
so we went to the toy store where we
bought one of these Barney's and we
played around with it for probably eight
hours or so and had it's a key phrases
from Star Trek so instead of like the
classic I love you you're great you know
your mom's so cool that kind of stuff it
would say things like dammit Jim I'm a
doctor not a miracle worker right and
and we had to say some really
inappropriate things like I think your
mom has a knife like that kind of stuff
but I didn't sanction that at all that
was the other guys and so then you know
we're playing around with this thing for
a while and I was kind of entertaining
and then somebody in the group says dude
let's return it back to the store and
then kind of like watch for you interact
and I'm like no way we're not going to
do it absolutely not so four hours later
we returned it and and you know watch
people and then and then I you know we
felt really bad about it so we bought it
back one of them still has it actually
but I keep that Barney in mind for a
second because what it got the group
thinking about is who do you trust and
I'll get back to that in one second so
you got the Barney
now it's two weeks later same group of
guys
and we used to get together every
Saturday and play game called West I
don't know if anybody's ever heard of
West even it's like very similar to
bridge so it's a partner game where
you're playing against two other folks
and this other team had just been
crushing us for the last probably month
and a half and I knew they weren't that
good and so finally we accused him of
cheating like dude you guys are cheating
these deck is marked and they said look
next week what we'll do we're gonna go
together and buy the card deck together
as a group from 7-eleven which was right
on the corner a trusted third-party
Authority unless you're getting a hot
dog but other than that I generally
trusted there so we went together we
bought the deck we played the game and
again our team got completely crushed
and later they fell guilty and sort of
told us what they did and what they've
done is the day before they went
7-eleven they bought all the card decks
they marked them and return them back to
the store inspired by our Barney
incident now I bring that story up
because it was an interesting trust
relationship they are right that was
inappropriate we trusted 7-eleven as a
third party we truly thought that that
was an unbiased third party that didn't
have any sort of skin in the game
favoring us or anybody else and what's
interesting about that is that today
users make very interesting trust
assumptions that are inappropriate
so I teach the software security class
at Columbia University and we always
have the students do very interesting
projects so this year we made up a term
and this was right around January called
context reflux so you may have never
heard of this term because it totally
doesn't exist but we made the definition
of it to be the cost of context
switching so if you're moving from one
task to another that cost of changing is
context reflux or at least that's our BS
definition
so I asked them to quote seed it into
the Internet alright so one guy puts it
on his blog and other guy creates a
Wikipedia entry a third guy creates like
a horrible one slide YouTube video about
contacts reflux and within a couple of
days we had the first two pages of
Google search right previously
non-existent term and now it has a
definition right and the definitions are
all consistent so then probably I'd say
a month later we had this RSA Conference
and for the closing keynote one of the
things that we did was get up in front
of the crowd and I don't know maybe
there's 10,000 people there or so and
played a game of balderdash I don't know
if anybody's ever played that game it's
where one person has a legitimate
definition of a term and the other
people have fake definitions and they're
trying to sell you on the fact that
their definition is correct so there's
not really a definition of this thing so
I went up and kind of sold people on my
definition which is the one that's out
here on the net and I had a buddy go out
and try and vigorously sell there was
some kind of gastrointestinal thing I
can't even remember exact which makes
sense because reflux related but and it
was fascinating you could see people in
the crowd first thing they do pull out
their phone type it in to search and go
and see what Google says that there's a
trust relationship there and this is how
you choose to optimize sites and it's
not wrong it's just a natural function
of taking data and presenting it to the
user but I'll tell you how attackers see
this which is very interesting the spam
and phishing email I'm starting to get
says for security reasons we are not
including a link and that feeds into the
type of security awareness training that
they're getting inside of big companies
look if you get a link don't click on it
it could be really dangerous so the
email says and confronts that and says
look we're not including a link so
instead of a link what we want
to do is we want you to go and we want
you to search for this term and find our
website it'll come right up and then go
there and download whatever tool you
need to download very very interesting
so they're laundering trust through a
third party and I want you to think
about that for a little bit because I
think that's where the future of
attackers are heading they're looking
for vulnerabilities and trust
relationships things that people are
inappropriately looking at one way when
they actually means something else so
what was really cool and this is we
don't have it anymore but we also own
suggest so if you type in context our
reflux was the first thing but it isn't
anymore I forgot what beat us have but
I'll check it after this and so with
this in mind I want to introduce this
concept of gateway data because the
internet now is all about data the data
that people choose to volunteer the data
that others volunteer about us and
really the data that institutions have
about us that are now becoming
searchable I don't know if anybody here
has an ancestry.com account but it's
incredible to see the kind of data the
biographical data that you can now mine
search categorize and find out what you
can really find out about a person over
time and their family and their history
and that's a really interesting thing so
gateway data is data that seems harmless
it's the name of your pet it's your the
fact that it's your cousin Sal's
birthday but when used properly can
facilitate access to highly sensitive
information so I think there's three
types of this gateway data one is direct
use so this is data that's convertible
directly and to access a password for
example is convertible directly to
access it fails the definition because
it's something that you hold close but
for many people the name of the place
they went to high school actually gives
access through password reset
and very very interesting so that's
director you Skateway data I'll talk
about the other two in a second but on
the topic of direct use let's think
about how this is used today so they
have about standard password reset
questions now this is another one of
these like the Coke machine something
that was a good idea from a risk
perspective a long time ago and now the
risk climate has changed so think about
this for a second I'll tell you a quick
story this was I don't notice about
three years ago I was under a vicious
deadline to get this privacy article out
for scientific and I just hadn't written
it yet alright and now it's like closing
in to d-day and my wife tells me that
she's having this dinner party and it's
with people I hardly know and I'm like
man I'm hoping my dentist is available
for an appointment during that time so I
have something else to do but instead I
thought well this would be a very
interesting experimental group to do
something with and then write the
article based on so I asked people came
in I asked him would you mind with your
permission and under your supervision if
we sit down together and I try and get
into all your accounts online not
through hacking through password reset
so a lot of people said no there was one
very vivid gesture that I can still kind
of had if I close my eyes are very
creative actually but a couple of people
a couple of people said yeah so I did it
with three folks for two of them within
an hour I was able to get into every
account they cared about so bank account
first place to start what do they do in
many cases they ask you to answer a
biographical question and then they send
you a reset email so they don't just let
you reset your account so then next
place you go is that email account how
do you know even where it got sent you
mine online and you look for any old
resumes this person may have what email
is associated with it there you look at
other source
that may tell you for example their
college email account and depending on
the school that you went to that email
account may still be valid and it was
fascinating to see because it turned out
in those two cases and probably like 30
other times I've done it since then that
unsanctioned sanction for the rack this
is being recorded okay that your
identity online precariously rods on a
set of biographical questions that's
asked on your oldest email account so
think about the chain a trust for
example really interesting experiment to
try on yourselves and your own account
how does your bank reset probably sends
it to an email account how does that
email account reset who may send it to
another email account eventually you're
gonna get to an email account that
doesn't know any other email accounts
and it's gonna ask you some very simple
questions questions like what city were
you born in questions like what was your
grandfather's occupation at a student
this past semester do a comparison
between the password reset questions of
the top five free email providers and
ancestry.com the stuff that you could
find instantly on ancestry and it was a
thirty percent overlap really really
interesting so this choice and it was a
design choice this choice of using
biographical data to reset your password
was like a good idea twenty years ago
like who knew this stuff except for your
close friends and family and they could
do a lot worse stuff to you than reset
your password but now you are so
knowable at a distance by somebody
you've never met that it's no longer an
inappropriate it's no longer an
appropriate risk choice for many people
in many cases category number two
amplification gateway data so here's
where things get more interesting
instead of something like talking about
your cat fluffy online that you can
translate into access the
Password Reset you know what's the name
of your favorite pad this is data that
when you bounce it off a person will get
you more sensitive information like for
example if somebody called you up on the
phone and said hey you know this is like
your bank or something right maybe they
say more eloquently but can you you know
for security reasons can you tell me
your social security number I don't
think many people would unfortunately
there are some people that would just
give it automatically but I don't think
most people would do it but what if the
bank called and said or the person
pretending to be the bank called and
said hey look this is your bank for
security reasons I am going to give you
the first five digits of your social
security number and I need for you to
give me the last four and that way kind
of I confirm to you that I'm your bank
and you confirm to me that you're you
and it turns out that a lot of people
will actually give it in that
circumstance now the first five digits
of somebody's social security number is
based on things like where they were
born there's some wonderful research by
a guy named Alessandro Christie at
Carnegie Mellon about two years ago
fascinating paper on how you could
predict those numbers but even forget
about that for a second if you have
access to Laxus and access for example
you can get the first five digits of
someone's social security number very
very easily so it's really the last for
that interesting things hands on another
very interesting thing about social
security numbers is that they're being
used in an authentication context where
that was never the original intention of
how those numbers should be used when I
went to college my social security
number was my student number I wrote it
everywhere it's on all kinds of pieces
of paper I'd say for many of you then
it's probably the same situation now a
social security number is sacrosanct
right you'd never do something like that
with social security number because if
you ever exposed it to anybody
now you fall prey to the breach
notification laws so it's really
entering
if you take a piece of data that didn't
used to be sensitive and you suddenly
make it sensitive we don't have a
mechanism to do that today
everything's sticky once it was not
sensitive and now it is it's not a
tenable sort of situation here's another
interesting example so the way that many
banks authenticate to you that this is
actual email from the bank is they put
the last four digits of your account
number in the email how many people have
gotten an email from their bank that
does this out of curiosity
okay I'd say about 40% of the crowd so
there was a really great researcher he
said PayPal now he's an Indiana
University at the time that he did at
Marcus Jacobson they did a study where
he sent a bunch of people these kinds of
emails that had the legitimate last four
digits and then he sent another group of
people the same email but it had the
first four digits of their credit card
number almost no difference in between
those two groups from a trust
perspective but those numbers actually
represent very very different things
from a Sanders perspective the first
four digits of somebody's credit card
number are basically public they just
say what s you were issued the credit
card number so if you've got a Discover
card it's like the same for everybody if
you've got a Visa or a MasterCard it
depends on the issuing bank so this
again is a type of data that when you
bounce it off a person is interpreted as
a higher level of trust than it's truly
meant to be
now the third category I think is the
one that's gonna plague us in the future
its collective intelligence gateway data
so it's data that seems to be totally
useless like even if you put it in the
context of password reset doesn't do
anything really interesting if you told
it to somebody in an email doesn't sound
very interesting from a trust
perspective but when you take it
and you cross-reference that with a
bunch of other stuff about a group you
can tell really interesting things
there's a couple of types of data that
fall into this category one is location
where you are now you know most people
don't think twice about telling somebody
where they are in fact a lot of the
tools that we use now regularly top date
Twitter for example include a Geo tag
when we take a picture by default many
of the phones certainly my iPhone does
automatically encodes it so I can find
out where somebody is and where they've
gone and I don't think most people think
that's a huge secret but now think about
this again through the lands of the
attacker and the attacker here may be a
bad guy or they may be a competitor
what an attacker can do is look at the
movement of groups like for example I
would love to find out where the mergers
and acquisitions team of HP for example
has gone for the last month that would
be really fascinating or where has the
sales force of my competitors been
moving over the last month or the last
couple of weeks that's really
interesting data that's incredibly
sensitive data to the company but it's
the kind of things now that it's just a
matter of tooling to be able to
aggregate the data is out there
something matter the data and are being
out there it's just a tool in question
around aggregation so here's a tweet
that's not very interesting when you
kind of look at it flying to Bentonville
Arkansas for a quick trip and meeting
straight through the day alright let me
ask you a question if you're flying to
Bentonville Arkansas for all-day
meetings dude who are you meeting with
Walmart who else is in Bentonville right
really interesting so you've just told
the world that you guys are courting
Walmart or maybe already have a
relationship with Walmart that's really
interesting again from a competitor
standpoint we're starting to see
tools in the research community the
security community good and bad that are
focused on mining big data and
aggregating the state in really
interesting ways this was a cool project
from a couple of years ago you many of
you may remember this
please rob me calm does anybody remember
this
Amerigo there they called it a robbery
opportunity portal right so a cab track
based on things that you tweet are you
away from home that's all it cared about
were you a way from the home and if you
were that's a fascinating piece of data
to a physical burglar that may want to
break into your home really really
interesting there's another really cool
project appropriately named called
creepy I don't know if anybody's ever
run into this one but at the name it
really kind of lives up to it it allows
you to track this geolocation data over
an extended period of time we've seen
some tools pop up in the attacker
community for example that are mining
personal tidbits of data and
automatically integrating them into
hyper focused and hyper personalized
phishing attacks think about that for
example right if you started to get
hyper personalized phishing attacks how
vulnerable are not vulnerable do you
think you personally are to that kind of
threat think about the choices that you
make when you see an email you look at
who sent it I don't know how many people
here routinely use PGP
but it's nowhere near what we thought it
would be ten years ago right so you make
trust choices often just based on the
content and that's a problem with
phishing emails now is there starting to
get boring like I miss the days when
there's like a guy that has 10 million
bucks and is willing to give me 2
million if I'll just help him get it out
of the country those were great they
were horribly spelled you know there's
always money involved you know said
wonderful times
now those same types of emails that
we're starting to see from a company
perspective are very tailored very
personal and they look just like the
boring work emails that you routinely
get really really interesting and
they're built because of data that's
publicly available related to this topic
the ability for people to make good
choices about risk and security I think
was never great to begin with but it's
starting to erode because of the data
that's out there and I think we often
create processes that expect too much of
users they expect users to make very
fine-grain trust choices this is an
example I don't know if anybody's been
in New York recently but you kind of
live and die by the MetroCard
this is the thing that gets you into the
subway and they have interesting things
on the back of them you know some have
like a message if you see something say
something report a crime that kind of
stuff one of them on the back has
emergency instructions so this is what
to do if there's an emergency inside the
subway so it's a little blurry so I'll
read them number one
notify train crew or police if you see
someone in distress or notice unlawful
or suspicious behavior that's pretty
good that's good good certainly a good
thing too number two do not pull the
emergency cord let me ask you a question
if you are in the middle of an emergency
in an enclosed subway are you going to a
start reading instructions on the back
of your card or B pull a huge cord that
says emergency on it right very
interesting making some bad choices
about what the user can or can't do this
is another very interesting one so a
friend of mine recently went to buy
purse at a very high-end store and she
finds one that's just perfect right
exactly what she wanted but didn't have
a price tag so she figured it was
something that somebody else probably
had returned you know they didn't like
it for whatever reason so she went up to
the counter to check out you know they
look up the price she buys the purse or
I think officially it's a wallet and she
takes it back home starts to transfer
all of her stuff over and she opens it
up and she finds something fascinating
inside this piece of paper with admin
and server passwords written on it
so this is somebody who not only made
the bad choice of writing their
passwords down but also put it in a
purse that they then returned back to
the store now I bring this case up
because it's an interesting one and one
that we shouldn't be surprised about in
fact it's one that we should expect of
users and you know we do interesting
things and in the security space we do
it to ourselves all the time we crank up
a dial on security forcing users to do
even worse things than we were trying to
prevent for example you know hey look
people are picking bad passwords they're
choosing password as their password or
they're choosing like their favorite
Bunny's name or something like that so
we want to deal with this problem so
what we're going to do is we're going to
enact a 12 character password policy
it's got to have at least three special
characters in it one foreign language
can
character and it can't be similar to
last 78 passwords you just sat right and
this is going to be good this is gonna
solve our password problem well what
happens when you crank up a doll like
that in isolation it's not
psychologically acceptable to users
they're gonna do things to work around
it's a good of write stuff down and put
in a purse that's like natural so I
think it's really interesting when we
start to think about the users
experience so you know my mom is just
such a great sort of user case in
general so she it's interesting to watch
her online and then on her mobile phone
so online if she gets to a site for
example that says hey look the thing
you're about to do is really dangerous
you should definitely not do it like
seriously seriously don't do it she's
always gonna hit okay because she just
wants to see what the site does right
she doesn't even read the message she
just hits okay and it's fascinating to
see her install stuff on her Android
phone right hey here's an application it
wants to access your payment cards it
wants to check the security log once
okay she doesn't even look at it all she
wants to do is be able to shoot the bird
towards the pig and get done you know
whatever she needs to get done and and
what we're doing is we're outsourcing
security choices complex security
choices to a user we know it's not gonna
make good choices that's crazy
when you think of that as an from an
ecosystem perspective it's a good idea
in isolation we want to inform the user
we want to tell them what their grained
- and practice if you look at it at a
macro group that's like a really scary
scenario because you know in practice
most users are gonna make the bad choice
so the question I guess I posed from a
security perspective
is how are we going to help the user
make better choices in general and I
think it's designing systems that are
easy to use securely and difficult to
use in securely because historically
we've done the opposite we've designed
systems that are super easy for a person
to use in securely but very difficult
for them to use in a secure way in fact
they don't even think about that
trade-off usually when they do something
now don't be deceived by this slide
saying summary because I still have
quite a bit left to go I want to share
with you another very interesting story
and this happened I don't know I guess
this happened maybe about five years ago
and I just the most amazing bug types of
things happen to me on planes I can tell
you some other stories later but this
one was about five years ago you know
again I sit on this plane I'm sitting
next to a guy and you know I don't know
how it happened but like almost
immediately we get into this argument
around whether Star Trek Deep Space 9
should have been included in the Star
Trek family of television shows and I
was adamantly against deep space 9 I
mean I really didn't like and he was a
huge deep space 9 fan and we kind of we
just locked heads on it and then finally
we agreed to disagree and then I asked
him you know what what kind of business
are you in and he said I T and I'm like
I'm not surprised so so we started to
talk a little bit more and he had been
hired as an admin at a manufacturing
company ten years before this so think
about it's like 15 years ago so he gets
hired at this company he does a quick
assessment and he realizes there's no
backup in recovery disks for a critical
system that's operating floor equipment
so he goes first thing he does is
creates a set of backup recovery disks
and back then it was sold five and a
quarter inch disc I don't know if
anybody even remembers those but when
floppy disks were really floppy or when
they even existed so he you know builds
a set of desks there's ten of
he walks over to the secretary / admins
office and says hey can you please label
these disks and put him in the fireproof
safe right should have taken him
off-site but that's fine at least that's
better than where they were so she says
no problem six months later something
horrible happens there was a power spike
the system goes down he's got to take a
secondary system and bring it online so
he goes to her office and says hey you
know can I get those recovery desks
she gives him the desk she puts the
first one in and he sees the two
scariest messages you could ever see as
a system administrator Media error okay
so that disk is totally gone he puts in
the second disc media error the whole
stack is gone so he spends the next
three days no sleep of rebuilding this
thing from scratch finally it's up and
running the machineries working he goes
and he makes another set of backup
recovery disk takes it to her office he
walks over to the coffee pod they're
sipping a cup thinking about a career
change and I think all of us have been
at that point and she sees he's very
upset and she says I'll do it
immediately so she takes the first desk
she puts it on the desk she takes a
label out of the drawer she sticks it on
the desk and then she takes the desk and
she shoves it in the typewriter Craig
Craig Craig and then she starts type and
B for backup and so now he realizes
every disk he's ever given her is gone
now this is a very interesting moment as
in the days that followed the big
question there was was this her fault
very very interesting question if you
think about it she'd been given a task
she didn't know how to use the tools
that she'd been given in a safe and
secure way she know anything about desks
she used a typewriter write her process
was if then enough to fit in
typewriter put it in a typewriter but
it's CMM level 5 it's a repeatable
process right at work it's it's like
there's never never been any complaints
before you know this was just fantastic
right but what she'd been given is she'd
been given this new technology this new
thing but no instructions on how to use
it safely and securely she didn't
understand that what she did was about
to ruin those desks she didn't know was
it her fault
I think that's a position we're putting
users into today we're making them we're
forcing them to make really interesting
decisions that they're not equipped to
make we haven't educated them on the
ramifications of those choice it's
really interesting now think about what
came afterwards after the five and a
quarter inch desk does anybody remember
go way back the three and a half was the
difference between those two things if
it was hard it had a hard shell it still
had the same floppy disk inside of it
but some amount of knowledge on how to
treat that thing right was built into
the product itself you knew not to ban
that thing dude the plastics gonna break
it was knowledge built into the system
it was easier to use in an appropriate
way than the five and a quarter inch and
I think that's a model we need to start
striving for in the security space let's
make it easier let's we can more
discoverable for people to make good
choices so the key things say I hope you
know if you reflect on this later or
maybe you totally won't and I'm so glad
it's dinner time type of thing but as
security and privacy really has become
one of the most interesting areas I
truly think in software development and
tasks because there's so many
interesting security ramifications to
the stuff we do and I'll just tell you
over this past 12 months in the security
space we've just been shaken it's I'm
sure you've been following the headlines
but we've seen the
rise of hacktivism in a very interesting
and material way and we've also seen the
rise of at least what the industry is
calling advanced persistent threats so
these are very targeted attacks by very
smart groups of people on the other hand
and they're exploiting these trust
problems so we've had for a long time
but frankly weren't an issue on scale
and now they're becoming an issue on
scale so we need to really consider the
types of choices that we're making users
make today I think that's gonna be so
critical not just today but if you think
about the data exhaust that people are
creating think about how interesting
ways that might be mined in the future
and we have to also think which really
makes the space exciting that we have an
active adversary on the other end and
these guys are smart this is not like
you know your grandma's hacker kind of
thing these are guys that are very smart
and motivated and you know there's this
old saying which I'm sure you've heard a
million times said you know you don't
need to be faster than the bear you just
need to be faster than the slower guy
and that that assumes though that you're
dealing with a Hungry Bear right if
you're dealing with a Hungry Bear the
algorithm is really simple you just
bring a slow guy with you every time you
go camping right it's a simple algorithm
you can follow it leads to a very safe
outcome but today we're not just dealing
with hungry bears hungry bears who are
the cyber criminals of yesterday if it's
more difficult to get into you than
somebody else and they'll go after
somebody else but now we've seen the
rise especially the last 12 months of
the angry bear so this is somebody who
will go after you personally you either
because they feel that you've done
something wrong or because you have very
interesting and unique capabilities that
others are using they're going after the
supply chain and the angry bear they're
gonna run past the slow guy they may
just slash them for fun on the way but
they're gonna keep going and they're
gonna go after you so it's a really
interesting time and thanks so much for
taking the time to be here this
afternoon I really appreciate and thanks
James
and as it turns out we have time for
some questions so bonnie has the money
Boyd the sharks and all costs at all the
statistics are real is it the discount
code dumb man discount car four seven
five so thank you for a very interesting
and stimulating talk there's been
research in usable security for ten
years
Carnegie Mellon has an entire graduate
program in it absolutely you're sitting
here and telling us make security easier
to use so we'll use it how do we do that
I don't know next question
no no you bring up a very interesting
point so the folks at Carnegie Mellon
Laurie crane or Alessandro Christie is
there - who's looking at the behavioral
stuff with security I mean there's a lot
of people that have been thinking about
this for a while but the truth is it's
been very difficult to make progress and
I think the reason for it is that
security typically trades off against
other things that we really like
so you crank up security in some cases
at cranks down performance or at cranks
down functionality or it cranks down a
user's ability to kind of intimate the
space I'll tell you one thing that has
me sort of optimistic and this is some
research that a guy I mentioned before
Marcus Jacobson did I think this was
just about a year ago and so his
research was on friendly fraud so
imagine you know you've got a device
like an iPad for example or a Google
tablet or some other device and you're
passing it around to others you're
looking at a photo album those devices
are a lot more social than they have
been in the past typically you wouldn't
take your laptop and kind of pass it
around the same way you might one of
these other devices so I think it's
important to think about that socialness
of the devices so what he did is to be
able to pay for something because there
was a kind of interesting rash
of somebody taking your phone or taking
your device your auto logged into some
site that you can buy stuff like a
headless mr. t doll for example from
like eBay and you can like buy a buddy
ten headless mr. t dolls by hitting a
button and say one click and buy it and
ship it out well what he did was change
the payment mechanism so that instead of
clicking the button you had to drag cash
from a wallet into a cash register and
it's amazing just that one change how it
reframed it to the user how it felt
different to them and the friendly fraud
cases at least in his study went down in
an interesting way so that kind of
research gives me a lot of hope and I
really think that from a security
perspective it's about signal mapping so
my mom you know I don't don't know it
promises last time I'm gonna pick on mom
and I love her so much and you know if
we walk down a bad neighborhood in New
York we both know we're in a bad
neighborhood we see graffiti on the
walls there's gunshot holes in the side
of the bill and there's huge locks you
know so we know those signals so we've
natively grown up with them these are
signals that we're in a bad spot we need
to get out the problem with the internet
and with technology is that most people
aren't attuned to the signals of danger
and I think the banner that we can do
signal mapping in that way even tying it
in to something that we already know is
dangerous or no is problematic I think
that's that's an area where we can make
some interesting progress that's very
long-winded answer or very long-winded
expansion on I don't know but that's I
wanted to know if well I I recently got
a Time Warner Cable in New York and my
yeah and my BIOS my SSID was SVG six
five eight zero and my password it was
SVG six five eight zero D F 6 and 6 5 s
BG six five eight zero is the model
number
the access point nice that's good that
won't forget it yeah and I couldn't
change it the only way I could change it
was to go to 192 168 0 1 and type in
admin motorola for the past the default
password for the for the device and
reset it to a secure password my
question is these companies like Time
Warner Cable that are not interested in
your security they don't have you know
they don't care about your security so
what do you do about that
great question I and I I'm so sorry to
have to bring mom back into it but there
really is there it there really is an
interesting kind of mom tie-in to this
so she bought a wireless router and you
know she bought it from the store she
plugged it in she you know found it and
I walking her through it over the phone
you know she finds it on the list of
available wireless access points and
clicks on it and it needs a password
right so this was one of the ones that
by default has the key on the back of it
and I'm like look you know I'm sure
that's around there somewhere and it was
the sticker wasn't on the back maybe was
on the box I don't even know where it
was and since she returned it it's just
like I can't I can't do it and so she
bought another one that by default was
open as a wireless access point and I
think that speaks directly to your story
or to your your kind of question in that
because security trades off against
other things so we prize and are so
visible that folks are just pushed to
make those kinds of decisions you know
it's one thing to have it on your router
it's another very interesting thing to
have it on voting machines and it turns
out that the way that most tabulators
work for Evo ting is very similar to
your story there's a hard-coded password
it's the same for everybody and it's
security through obscurity you think
that nobody's going to have access to
that particular manual that has the
systemic problem of exposing everybody's
passwords and nobody ever changes that
and it's been fascinating to even see in
that context where you're dealing with
critical date I mean that's critical
infrastructure stuff that we still
haven't seen a change and the problem is
that we can easily assess the usability
of it
I'm sure Time Warner can easily assess
the kind of support benefit to them I'm
just telling you well what's your number
oh it's underscore df6 at the end of it
and you're set all right there's a clear
support benefit of it but the user isn't
pushing back on risk because that's not
quantified in a very real way so I think
the way that we're gonna get past that
problem is have users be able to assess
security in much more interesting ways
in a very different paradigm than they
are today we're already seeing that
happen to the business level if you look
at RFPs or RFI's that go out for b2b and
look how those have changed over the
past five years they wouldn't ask
anything about security before and now
you're starting to get very interesting
very probing security questions so it's
happening in b2b b2c we just haven't
seen it yet mom still hidden okay cuz
she wants to shoot that thing towards
the pig she really hates the pig yeah
good question I'm curious if you're
familiar with the electronic curtain
currency called Bitcoin and urine and
your opinion embarrassin the mysterious
creator yeah yeah Satoshi yeah I was a
good question like thoughts around well
you know it's it's kind of interesting I
mean it's if you look at at the economy
it's created on the back end you know
you got guys that are taking server
clusters and just mining for coins and
trying to be there which is a very
interesting survey Galit aryan way to
disburse it but from a security
perspective I think that we're going to
need something like that on a
forward basis a big problem now with
electronic currency is traceability and
a lot of people don't think about that
today the traceability aspects of it
they just ignore it meaning that they're
happy to kind of use their card and
somebody in the sky knows that they
bought this particular product or
because they're not they're not thinking
about it actively but I think in the
not-too-distant future we're gonna have
like a privacy Armageddon incident I
don't know what it is I don't know how
it's gonna look but I know it's gonna
affect some senators which is going to
force a legislative change and that's
gonna be a very very interesting and
scary period for all of us and I really
think that that's gonna happen I don't
think epsilon did it even though
everybody was getting you know crazy
emails from the hotel they didn't even
realize they'd ever given their email
address to but I think that we're going
to see something happen in the next
couple of years it's gonna affect some
key policymakers in Washington and force
privacy to be a big issue that and
getting back to your Bitcoin question I
think at that point people are gonna be
really freaked out that there's then
traceability from what they spent to the
merchants and how it was used and it's
gonna spawn the use of more disruptive
payment technologies that can
disassociate those things electronically
which I don't think we have a good a
good mechanism for today so I don't know
if that at all kind of answers that yeah
I would use it yeah I would and there's
a couple reasons for it one just because
I'm really curious about it and I think
it's really neat but the second thing is
you know there looks like to be some
really strong if not kind of esoteric
and somewhat very difficult to decipher
crypto behind it and I think that's kind
of fascinating I I think it's just such
a great project to see kind of how its
evolving and how its disrupting the
space and then we're gonna see more
stuff like that - okay we are officially
out of time I have no
desire to stop this though I'm
fascinated I think everyone else is too
so let's just continue with if you still
have voice can you continue with another
to go but I don't want to launch a
denial of food attack that oh man no no
people tend to remember that kind of
stuff when you're there yeah okay
my name is a cheer double-dose
corporation thank you for an amazing
presentation I have a couple of
questions the first is what do you think
about the future of security privacy in
the internet and the second how to
estimate the current state of security
privacy in the Internet
okay we're doomed and bad No
okay so I so I think think the first one
is kind of the future security and
privacy and I you know I'll tell you I'm
very very optimistic and I'll tell you
why every year at RSA Conference we run
a competition of startups so these are
companies you know back of the napkin
kind of stuff and then they got some
funding and then they kind of move to a
stage where they really have a product
and they compete I don't know if
anybody's ever seen Shark Tank or
there's like the real one which is the
British one that spawned it but there's
some guys you know the guy will come up
that's an inventor of something and
there's some investors of just like rip
that guy apart it's really interesting
television but that's that sort of when
we do on the security space and
fascinating companies have come out of
it and there's companies that are
starting to think about security
differently which i think is so critical
I think the old legacy stuff that we've
been relying on is eroding very quickly
like signature-based technologies for
example we're in a very interesting
state with signature-based technologies
right in the past five years ago when
all the malware was stuff you've seen
before and it was just about protecting
users on the desktop those things were
great and they're still important but
most of the tax that we're seeing today
that are meaningful or freshly compiled
malware like compiled three
hours before they were actually sent and
deployed through a phishing email or
through a download link so that's very
disruptive to the current set of
security technologies so I think that's
one interesting path is the sort of
death or the reimagining of signatures
the second is on privacy I I don't know
what's gonna happen I think we're gonna
go down one or maybe three roads one is
we recalibrate as a society on what
privacy means people are so knowable now
in ways that they never were before you
know that you mentioned the Carnegie
Mellon team I don't know if anybody saw
but there was a presentation at a
conference called blackhat earlier this
year where a group of students there had
built an app I think it was an iPhone
app nothing personal against Android but
I think it was and I made a banana
African I remember but this app would
let you take a photo of someone at a
distance it would then cross-reference
that photo with a database of pictures
and then figure out who that person was
before you even interacted with them
that means that you were forming an
opinion of that person and they bring a
legacy drag of history before you even
shake their hand for the first time and
that's from a societal perspective
that's gonna be really interesting to
see how we recalibrate to something like
that the other thing on the privacy
front is that the trust choices we've
been making natively for a long time are
just gonna be broken in the future like
somebody sends me an email saying hey
dudes great meeting you AG TAC remember
I said I was gonna send that video
here's the link okay you know that's
kind of interesting maybe I did meet you
a G tag maybe did say that there was a
video link how am I gonna know the
difference anymore
all right folks know I'm in G Tech it's
online that could be a legitimate person
an illegitimate person and I have no
reasonable data to make an assessment
between the two and how do you deal with
something like that as a society that's
going to be really interesting
especially when tooling makes that
process
accessible for everybody right right now
there's some effort associated with it I
have to like really have an axe to grind
with you to kind of sand in this but
when the marginal cost of sending one
more hyper personalized email goes to
zero I think we're going to be in a
really interesting state so I think
we're going to need to have security
tooling that brings visibility to data
even in an email I came when that thing
pops up I don't just want that virus
scan or run on it I wanted to highlight
for me key pieces of data that are about
me available online to everybody so that
I can make a more reasonable choice so I
don't know if that even starts to get
sort of the future of security but I
think that we're gonna need some
disruptive trust technologies now that
makes security a lot more visible to the
user and make them make better choices
because right now they're making choices
to share data which is great it's
connecting people it's bringing the
world together but it has implications
that we don't fully understand yet
because we haven't seen the bad guy
tools yeah mainstreamed yet what I was
like I wouldn't worry about the Sharks
so that was like a hundred answer so
because you're such a long-winded answer
we're only gonna have time for one more
and then don't leave because we're
giving away free cool stuff immediately
after this so one more Bonnie you have
one over there hi I have a quick
question
first I companies like Google and
Facebook I've taken has been warning
users that hey you you possibly could
have been hacked because someone from
Nigeria logged into your Gmail and you
don't usually go to Nigeria do you think
users are capable of handling that and
like somebody I've seen this before for
example credit cards I got asked
questions by the TSA I'm away down here
because my credit card decided my flight
purchase was suspicious there's gonna be
able to where that can go wrong and
maybe go too far like do you think these
kinds of things of letting users know
when they could have possibly faced the
problem they were able to process that
but more importantly able to figure out
why they were hacked and then take steps
to avoid it happening to them again cuz
you just tell them you were hacked and
they still click on every link and log
into Facebook from the Apple Store like
it's gonna happen again next week yeah
no that's that's a great question I'll
try and give a short winded answer to it
so about maybe four years ago
I started a company called people
security that just does security
education for enterprises and I give
that preamble because that's one of the
biggest challenges we've faced is how do
you go to development toward for example
so how do you go to developers had to go
to testers how to go to architects and
designers and make security relevant and
then thinking about security with every
incremental choice but then how do you
go to the general populace of users
inside that company and first make them
care which is like a really important
thing but second make them change after
something bad has happened and it's very
interesting at least the stuff that I
found and this is totally anecdotal is
that one if you show people vivid
examples then they will remember them
and I think first that's a very
interesting point to recognize if you
just tell people don't click on stuff
it's dangerous or look don't access it
from a kiosk or like Nigerian hacker
guys are gonna get into your Facebook
account those things don't tend to be
very effective even though they're very
true but if instead you say here let me
walk you through this process so I am
the hacker I go into this space and I do
this and I do this and I do this the
retention rate on something like that is
much much higher so for and I'm just
bringing out a kind of the developer
domain I think that software security
for example which is so critical I mean
I think the pressure on software
developers to make more secure
software's increase dramatically over
the last few years but for a software
developer you have to make it personal
you have to show them vulnerability in
their own type of code or own type of
system and you have to go all the way
through from here's an interesting
problem here's how bad
looks at it and now let's exploit it and
do horrible things with it and you have
to show them those horrible things for
them to get it on the back end so I
think it's just a vivid display of what
the bad guy does to the system so just
telling somebody hey look you know we
think your account was hacked that's
gonna lead to them making a series of
sort of even more paranoid choices that
may not be appropriate like they won't
click on the lengthy email anymore for
fishing but they'll always do the hey
for security reasons we're not including
the link and look us up on the web it
changes their behavior but not
necessarily in a good positive way so
again sorry that was medium winded not
quite long-winded but but you are gonna
send everyone an email with a download
link absolutely
presentation will be sent by a length
trust me it's good thank you you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
