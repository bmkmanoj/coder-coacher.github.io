to introduce dr. Gregory Benford who is
a famous science fiction writer and a
real-life scientist and his done lots of
other cool things that it would take me
way too long to enumerate but today he's
going to talk about selection and
genomics and longevity research so that
feather did thank you I I'm happy to be
here I've been to Google before enjoyed
the science food this summer and I'm
here to talk not in my role actually my
hobby as a science fiction writer
although I would point out is there
anyone in the audience who's ever
written the grant proposal you to our
science fiction is perhaps not as well
pay but that's it about ten years ago an
elderly woman was interviewed on
television and the interviewer said
what's the best thing about being 104
years old and she thought for a moment
and then said very decisively no peer
pressure the point about Jeunesse Ian
the goal is to make that little joke
obsolete by using the methods which you
people know very well aighty methods and
a very well-known thing a presence in
this in our scientific world for a very
long time which is however not been
widely used natural selection although
actually genessy incorporation uses
artificial selection and the artificial
aspect of it why is my slide not jumping
no I'm hitting this or ah okay didn't
get a pit here really is
is to noted that in a sense sexual
selection of course has been acting on
the human population for a very long
time as you can see from this data which
I harvested from many sources the
species has had a hard time of it it's
amazing we've gotten this far in so
relatively little time roughly a hundred
thousand years because in prehistory it
was a very tough job to get out of
adolescence you know that is to actually
get to Bernie produce and that's really
the point natural selection acts up
until the time you stop reproducing and
beyond that point it has no way to
convey information forward into an
organism because you cannot carry
forward to the next generation and for
us that means roughly age 40 although
it's age 44 women but not for men which
leads to an another topic entirely but
notice for example that the big change
in the civilization has been to slowly
get rid of early childhood mortality as
you can see from the difference data
between say Mexico and India that is
depended on what culture you were in so
it's about the same time it was better
to be in Mexico than in India because
you were making at least some uses of
new technologies and right now the main
life span the United States is roughly
78 79 and so you could imagine what is
the best present possible that's that
curve that essentially ends at 100 but
the world record in longevity is a
French woman who lived to 122 died a few
years ago and once sold pencils to van
Gogh I think that's a great way to pin
how much experiments experience she's
had and so it's worth asking how much
longer can this go on well they haven't
we have from the Methuselah flies which
janessa incorporation has developed and
owns is that it can go great deal longer
I compile this data from the US Census
Bureau and it tells you something
interesting about just the last century
you'll notice that the top curve by the
way the yellow is a mean lifespan for
women in the united states for the 20th
century and below it is men notice that
big downward jog around nineteen
eighteen nineteen nineteen that's the
Spanish Influenza it had a really big
effect but more importantly look at all
the data leading up to about 1940 there
are all these ripples with a periodicity
of rough periodicity of about four years
they were propagating forward these
polishes in the population and changes
in longevity from many plagues that have
occurred in the 19th century and you'll
notice that the whole curve starts to
smooth out around nineteen forty that's
the advent of what I think I was truly
modern medicine penicillin vaccines and
you'll notice that all those
oscillations went away meanwhile a
steady progression upward and the
longevity women has consistently ranked
higher and in fact it's increased until
very recent times steadily also versus
men so you can learn a lot a great deal
about the impact of technology look just
looking at data like this but I just
gave this talk at the singularity summit
and Manhattan and and and there are a
lot of people there who expect the
singularity to change everything in
human society and I would hope longevity
but there's this problem what I call the
gap problem is that you have to get to
the singularity to enjoy its benefits
and for some of us that's a significant
issue because when reycarts file when I
asked him again last weekend you know
what's your best date for singularity
and he said no maybe 20 45 and and any
proudly said it and I take over 200
supplements a day to be sure that I get
there and I said ray you know we've
spoken this before but you you realize
you know you only got two kidneys and
one liver and you got worried about
stressing these systems but in more
general terms I think it's really
earth saying that the what we now have
to do is use the greatest tools that
have ever come into the hands of
biologists and that's the ability to
truly read the genomics of both
ourselves and other species that's an
enormous advantage and it's only been
around a decade so this is just the
beginning in which we are turning on the
flashlight in a room that's always been
dark to the biologists and everyone else
and try to understand what we find there
and to affect what we change there but
you've got to be careful that you don't
use the wrong technology in the wrong
setting I love this this cover because I
actually saw it on this issue of
astounding SF seizing a spaceship in the
future right taking your own
computational ability long now the
problem is that you couldn't make this
same visual analogy anymore because what
would he have between his teeth not the
simulated dagger that pirates famously
carried in their mouths come aboard it
would be a hard drive or something I
mean the visual imagery wouldn't work
but you do have to be careful to not
take the modes of thinking about
technologies forward into a changed
world and so what genessy ins has done
is take them through the flies which
developed by michael rose who was a
professor at UC irvine it just as I am
who came from Canada personally owned a
owning the Flies he had already
developed for over a decade by a simple
method he took just awful of fruit flies
and would put them in cages 500 at a
time so the populations were huge 10,000
flies so they not become inbred when you
hear Mouse results for example in
medicine almost all mouse experiments
are deeply embedded so you have to
question how relevant they are to us
because if you know we have many bad
qualities but one are our best
biological
qualities that we're out bread that is
to say we don't carry forward pernicious
genes in the population these can always
be factored out and so we have a wide
range of genomics and therefore by the
way a wide range in mortality so Michael
continued this in 2006 when I and a
co-investor bought these flies and
founded Jeunesse Ian they live to be
four and a half times larger than
ordinary flies they had gone through
over seven hundred generations of forest
that is artificial selection since then
by the way I've since I was the CEO and
I'm not the chairman of the board I
simply took another population and had
the lab people accelerate the force of
natural selection by removing the eggs
after 75 percent of the population was
dead still keeping enough flies to have
them be out Brett and those flies now
live five and a half times longer than
control flies what would the genomic
implications of all that nobody knew
because if genomics had never been done
only a decade before it would have been
hopelessly expensive to do so but we
managed to do it for just a few hundred
thousand dollars and analyzed it in
detail and and it's one way of talking
about this is to say you're it's it's
fairly easy using old methods to
illuminate simple biological mechanisms
but the really big problem is that the
genomic networks illuminated over the
last decade and particularly by the
Methuselah flies are incredibly
complicated so they become an
information technology problem and one
of the problems of biology is that it
typically didn't have a lot of IT people
on hand so in fact we've been bringing
IT people in not just janessa but
everybody in order to try to figure out
all these pathways because what these
results show and I'll go into more
detail in a moment is that longevity is
a very general trait and there are many
paths works
pathways involved and in the Methuselah
flies versus the control flies we found
that many many had been used and certain
genes and snips that's single nucleotide
polymorphisms emerged as really
outstanding but there were a lot of
contributors so it's it's a very
complicated problem because evolution
does not have to do things in simple
elegant ways it can do them because it
has an infinite budget essentially it
can do them as it likes and it can do
them all simultaneously evolution acts
upon Suites of genes not just one or two
and so there's no miracle solution
there's no gene this is going to
suddenly make you w live expected
lifespan and the thing is about these
networks is that they really are large
networks involving tens of thousands of
snips and the way to understand this
from the IT perspective would be to just
do an enormous an enormous study and a
lot of code but of course the nice thing
about science is you can do experiments
and so what we've really done is
eliminate this problem with an algorithm
that is artificial selection and it took
a lot of time it took over 30 years for
Michael Rhodes to develop these long
life lies there are no such other
organisms in the world now flies no mice
nothing and therefore it's the unique
case no one had the patience to do this
over decades and that's also why we have
an enormous advantage we've got the
information and it's not going to be
easy to get it in any other way it's
worth remembering though that remember
that reproduction and the end of
reproduction marks the closure of
information propagating forward into the
next generation so if you keep moving
reproduction forward that is to say you
select for the flies that can reproduce
later because after all if you wait
until half of dead
only the long live we're going to be
able to reproduce then you can continue
to shed the genetic modifications that
shorten your lifespan so that if you can
imagine this yellow box and reproduction
sliding in that direction then the
downward arrows which are the bad
janovic symbols of signals that is they
are bad for us or bad for any organism
the communication of those into the next
generation gets pushed further and
further out so that only the movie the
children of the long live flies are more
robust and function better and so that's
the key to getting an advanced lifespan
and of course this is not a new idea i'm
known as a science fiction writer but
the actual idea behind this was proposed
by robert heinlein in the thews lewis
children a novel in the 1940s uh and I
talked to Heinlein he was a friend of
mine about this and he said you know I
hope they could be done in a few
centuries but we now know actually just
from the simple data from the flies that
a few generations is not going to do it
ten generations gives you an increase in
lifespan and the range of some percent a
few percent but not one hundred percent
and and so you can't wait for that it
would take i calculated 17,000 years to
do this humans but you could do it
replies and we had so what did we learn
from them loose loose well it's actually
all good news there was a novel in the
1930s by aldous huxley called after many
a summer dies the swan in which all the
way through you know that there's some
people who have managed to live a long
time and he finally meets them the
protagonist and he discovers that they
are in terrible shape they're weak
fragile huddled over not really enjoying
life but they don't live longer the
losers have taught us
that none of that's true those little
flies and we actually measure these
things there are biologists who spend it
working for us who do all this kind of
thing you'd never do that the Methuselah
have more sex throughout their lives
although they start reproducing a little
later than the other ones and then
reproduce much longer they lay more eggs
as a result of that and they're more
rigorous and if you put them in a cage
with the control flies they beat them up
I mean look they out-compete them you
can actually measure this quantitatively
because the flies have to do the males
must do a mating dance right in order to
get to fertilize the female so you see
it's just like us and you can measure
how good they are at it and you can tell
when they're going to die because they
can no longer do the mating dance and
the interesting thing is in the
population curve that they the pot of
the Methuselah dewyze have a long
plateau it toward the last third of
their lives and then they fall flat off
the plateau if they stop doing the
mating dance they will be dead in a day
so in a way perhaps it isn't also like
us and so this is what a kind of
population curve looks like toward the
last portions they have better lives not
worse lives and so if we can harness
this information and we have then we can
go forward to a world in which you will
not only live longer but you'll live
better that's the survival percentage
starts at one hundred drops to zero so
that's the same population curve I so
you humans with business replies so what
we did it is read the genomics of the
Flies and using expression analysis we
found about a thousand changes that were
plainly to a high probability by that I
mean a probability better than one
chance it will the chances that are
you're wrong are less than one in a
thousand we impose that standard we have
a bunch of things that are good too
100 which would be extremely good in
other kinds of biology but we insisted
on standard in which you absolutely know
that these things are implied in
longevity that is compared to the
control flies we found found about a
thousand of those and we then in front
of this gene expression we compared with
humans I mean the standard question we
always get is why should I care about
the lifetime of flies in fact i'd like
to kill all the Flies of my house
actually that happened to be because the
for the first two months of the company
while we were looking around for a place
to put a lab we kept the flies in my
house and we did you general bache
analysis on it they're shipped it out
actually the affymetrix to use their
half a billion snip a half a million
snip codes but several of them got out
so we moved the flies to the lab there
were about half a dozen methuselah slept
and you could tell if a Methuselah came
into the room I be sitting there reading
and I'd hear dis faint a little buzzing
I mean how many times do you hear a fly
buzzing across the room and they would
buzz around and I I try to swat them and
it couldn't hit him they were so fast
they could get away they were good at
everything we had to wait until they
died which actually never successfully
killed a single one so to me that was
impressive I mean I never mind the
genomics unreal things that I care about
they were good so in this we were we
were then looking at why should we care
about flies when we really are concerned
about humans and the answer is that the
flies were the template that evolution
worked out to do things that we do all
the time we separate it i mean the sense
that that makes sense separated from the
thews zones from the fly 600 million
years ago so it's been a long time in
production well what do they do for a
living the sugar and they fly around so
they died type 2 diabetes cardiovascular
problems and interestingly to us when we
mapped it into the human genome we found
that they had a lot of neurological
problems
and so in fact we harvested and have
patented in our methods patent and
elsewhere genes which nobody else knows
that are associated with Parkinson's
Huntington's and Alzheimer's and we
check those against other human
databases to and it holds up so they the
Methuselah have the ability to defend
their bodies against these disorders and
we know what those jeans are got a
question it sounds like you were
amplifying the selective pressure but
still selecting only for things that
would have been selected for in their
natural environment so given that
they've been in that natural environment
for vastly more generations than your
experiment why I mean was there anything
maladaptive and what you are selecting
for and if not why did you get results
that many more generations of evolution
in their natural environment did not get
and I just to extend the question since
some flies did escape is there any
evidence that those flies are displacing
the regular flies in the natural habitat
what we don't know about any Methuselah
ever escaped but remember they were
still in my house but no why why doesn't
everything live infinitely long right I
mean how come natural selection doesn't
but because there is always a trade-off
I remember high school when the football
guy got all the girls he was trading off
benefits here right actually I happened
to know who the I used to play high high
high school football and four or five of
the guys were on my team are already
dead they've been selected out there
were really great in their teenagers but
there's always a selection for early
reproduction but we removed that we got
rid of the early reproducers so we
specifically selected for longevity and
that's why nature doesn't do it because
it always favors the young and
did the worthy where the late
reproducers less good at early
reproduction uh yes the height the
Methuselah do not reproduce as early as
ordinary flies that's also true you will
notice of everyone who goes to
universities in fact when you think
about the university system is selecting
for longevity so you've already gotten
the benefit my parents I should didn't
go to university so there you go I grew
up in southern Alabama on a farm so so
that was a very good question because it
illuminates why this could emerge and
did not in nature although there are
extremely long live species the sea
turtles live well over a century and of
course we know trees that live that were
alive in there in California at the time
of Christ so what we really learned and
and this was an open question until we
actually did this genomic mapping is
that these genes are salient in our
longevity so these homologues from the
flies to us are extremely useful genetic
medical information and when I say that
we we found say some some Parkinson's
genes we got a large number of the genes
associated with Parkinson's in humans
that are known but we also got those
that are not know and that's the key we
we just got more genes than you can pull
out over all human data we went to the
Wellcome Trust genomic information which
is now publicly available took us happy
a year to get it because they were very
itchy about giving it to accompany you
know they you know the Europeans they're
suspicious of profit and and we found
that we could go in there and pull
information out of their database that
they cannot because we have a signal to
noise field we had the roughly thousand
snips to look for and say how does this
correlate in this 16,000 patient
inventory
and so we could find things that they
could not and that's another use of this
kind of method you eliminate a lot of
noise this way so what we've done is use
selection as a supercomputer to pull
long live jeans out of another species
and then we did the next thing because
so I and my co-founder who was a an
Italian a brilliant Italian woman named
Christina Risa he was a cardio vascular
specialist decided that we were not
going to turn this into just a
diagnostic company because frankly I've
been noticing that I wasn't getting any
younger and that's my motive I don't
need money I've got lots of money so we
immediately began a program in which
since we know these genes we had
biochemists biologists work backwards
through the genetic pathways to find
substances that can act to upregulate
the genes that people already have that
defend against these diseases the by
upregulate I mean you stimulate it with
these particular chemicals so that the
gene functions at a higher level that it
took a while to figure out this and we
learned a lot about why the FDA is in
some ways a block to progress because as
you all know it takes about a decade to
develop a pharmaceutical but there's a
hole in the whole method oh the
traditional medicines of India China
other places have been grandfathered in
to the American pharmacopoeia they are
called the grass substances generally
recognized as safe because they've been
used in China for 5,000 years etc so we
went into that sweet which is thousands
of substances we found those that our
own analysis said could up-regulate the
genes and then we tested ohmylanta in
long lab bounds quickly flies well it's
been done on mice and we then resolute
lee march through dozens of these things
and found out if we could increase the
lifetime of control flies by simply
giving them these substances in their
food
direct experiment down to the tune of
tens of thousands of flies so you get
lots of nice data that's another problem
with human genome stuff it's a big deal
and takes a lot of time and money to get
a 10,000 human genomic analyses done but
of course we what we did was simply
force we're through the experiment
forest flies to force the substances we
chose it to see if the Flies could in
fact live longer and we looked at side
effects did they reproduce because in
fact some of the substances yeah they'll
extend lifespan but they don't reproduce
ah when you look at studies of C elegans
and place and stuff like that such as is
done near here in San Francisco oh yeah
they live longer and they lie on the
bottom of the cage and they don't do
anything else it's easy to sedate
animals and make them live longer
calorie restriction does the same thing
calorie restriction has many good things
about it I suppose but I knew Roy
Walford who died some years ago for over
20 years and he's once when he had a
drink one drink if you don't drink much
one drink will reveal a lot and he said
you know I really want to live longer
but I really do miss sex I really do
miss vigor and so forth and so I well
I'm just not willing to make that
bargain but we found that some
substances will knock the flies down and
let them live longer but they don't do
anything else so we looked at the mating
essays the fecundity and the vigor
analysis and we only kept those things
that would increase lifespan and let the
Flies remained rigorous because that's
another clue Methuselah remain vigorous
so we wanted to look at that narrower
suite of substances that can do that and
and we've now found quite a few of our
lead product which will be out next year
increases the control fly lab span by
thirty percent it's good five standard
deviations we have others combinations
of single substances and that's what
nature hasn't done is if we take several
of these things and put
together you see which doesn't occur in
Chinese medicine but it's okay because
individually they're all in the grass
category and see what they do the life
span we've got about at the moment half
a dozen that can increase the lifespan
over twenty percent we think we know
what the leader does we think it's a
repair mechanism from research other
people have done so we're pursuing two
different things we've got a we're going
to sell what we call nutrigenomics
agents mean we know these act on these
genes that are associated with longevity
and then the first sweet 46 it's all
cardio I mean it undoubtedly does some
other things just the statin drugs do
and I've been taking the SAT drugs I'm
going to live forever right so we
stopped but nope signature a problem
we've we've consistently tried to find
the substances that will do all those
major functions and we know in this case
what they're doing they're operating on
cardiovascular system why because over
half of all deaths and the advanced
human population are cardiovascular
problems so we're now going to march on
2 diabetes Alzheimer's Parkinson's and
Huntington's and some others that are
lesser so what's the moral of the story
we're not operating on single genes
we're operating on networks of genes so
it's not a quick fix and the
age-dependent disorders particularly
heart disease are central to all of this
so we've actually gone ahead and done
other things to do this we look at side
effects resolutely male matting mating
success and also by the way the
resistance to infection in fact I'll
show you a little data here's a heart
pacing experiment in which
this is the percent percentage of heart
failures basically what it's saying is
that be in this notation means ordinary
flies and 0 means Methuselah flies Oh
for older these this is the heart attack
rate we actually have developed ways of
giving hearts the hearts of flies
attacks give them fibrillations by
electrical current and and you look at
the heart and Count it space pacing and
look for other disorders you find out
how the fly performs after heart attack
in other words the ability to survive a
heart attack and we've been able to show
that the Methuselah are much better at
surviving heart attacks which is
actually going to happen to a large
number of people half of those who have
heart attacks die in the first heart
attack you can make it through the first
well it's certainly a good idea but so
we specifically looked at that ability
and we showed that this is true of the
Methuselah to a probability which of
better than five percent by a
chi-squared test so we actually know
that the Methuselah survived heart
attacks better and we also know this is
sepsis that wispy that flaw these flies
are better at surviving infection now
will it occur to you already that since
and you can just study this data here
for example this this has not been
published yet but the survival of the
Methuselah is about fifty percent better
forgiven infections it will have
occurred to you though that you can take
the flies that survive and use those as
a selection protocol this gentleman
asked you know so you selected for
longevity what else do you get well you
can also select for survival of
infection or survival of heart attacks
and that's another selection mechanism
that will illuminate different pathways
in different ways and so it's not just
one thing you can do with these you can
force the force of natural of artificial
selection to give you information you
can use that in the laboratory that's
the long term president we're not going
to start stop just with longevity we're
going to look at survival for the
insults the slings and arrows of
outrageous fortune that occurred all
humans now so what about you I mean
you're all young hopelessly young but
and so the the fruit but the best point
is is take care of yourself delay as
long as possible your need for these
kinds of mechanisms but that's not
available to me I've already I'm manage
to get old so my second piece of advice
to you is don't do were like great Chris
file he's a very sharp guy good friend
of mine but don't overload your system
with a whole lot of supplements because
one thing we found from our experiments
is that occasionally we take separate
substances that in send the life span
say three or four of them we combine
them and you get a negative effect and
so we've done dosage studies and we
found that some of these things are good
in this rig wing have no effect over
here and are negative over here by the
way I would mention to you that there is
a large negative region we tested this
on the Flies for caffeine ring any bells
we found that at large overlay same
privilege about ten cups of coffee a day
we the flies have a reduced lifespan now
that's not an open-and-shut argument but
I don't drink a lot of coffee anymore in
fact every biologists in the company
stop drinking coffee and we stopped
giving away coffee in the corporate lab
after this result and we published this
three months ago so what janessa is leav
always stuff that works really works and
our our intention is to carve out of the
the marble that genomics has will carve
out something useful and beautiful by
using first under learning and then
using the genomic pathways that are
there available and all of this is using
adaptive selection
force the animals to select to through
forced selection artificial selection to
tell you information and then use that
in the laboratory and we call that
evolutionary nutrigenomics the nice
thing about it is you can sell these on
the market you do not require human
trials beyond safety trials which we're
doing right now and I should probably
advertise that I've been taking our
number one substance for half a year and
I've seen be reasonably alive and and
then deployed in a market mechanism so
this by the way I will read it to you is
a summary of what I think we've
accomplished by direct application and
shown in the laboratory so far and then
I'll have a couple of yeah I'll just let
you read that for a moment meanwhile
answer a question could you elaborate on
the great a little bit more on your
human CST oh you give it to a small
group a few dozen people and look at
their basic performance things but the
blood pressure how do you the most
important is how do you feel do you feel
better worse you know do you have
depressed thoughts no suicides I mean
yeah basics like that that's all the FDA
requires by the way or actually the FDA
doesn't even require that for
supplements which may shock some of you
shot me your government at work yeah
well you see the grass substances are
generally accepted as safe because
they've been used and so no it's not
obviously bad for you like say chocolate
actually that's a joke chocolate
actually theobromine bromine is good for
is actually good to eat chocolate which
amazed me so here's a kind of a final
conclusion I'm a physicist number
professor of physics use the irvin but
we're already in the next century and
it's obviously one that's going to be
about biology also about climate change
but that's another talk and we now know
the biology is from fundamentally an
information problem that's where you can
get the most illumination and that we
have been begun using selection and
genomics to pull this information out
and so what we're trying to do is start
a health revolution that is based on a
new technology in a new way of looking
at the world so that we can all advance
because that event that occurred back
around nineteen forty in which we ironed
out the longevity curve and we entered
the era of modern medicine it's just the
beginning here's a new technology beyond
way beyond what vaccines can do that we
can use to advance our prospects in that
case and then these are our
collaborating institutions we hope to
have a future in which you can greatly
increase your longevity in that opening
slide when I said you know maybe we can
live to be a hundred and fifty I think
that's actually going to be true i think
is quite plausible that people will live
to be 200 300 but it's also quite
possible that people who will live to be
a hundred and fifty are in this audience
right now because we've actually managed
with other techniques both in the
nineteenth and twentieth century to
increase the mena longevity in the
advanced society by fifty percent each
time you know what the mean longevity
was time at Thomas Jefferson it's about
40 the mean longevity for time of Jesus
Christ was 30 so we had 32 when he died
on the cross he was actually a little
bit beyond me oh you don't think about
that but imagine a society in which
people live to be only 30 wait you don't
have to imagine it it's in the Bible
right which is obsessed with the
afterlife guess what it was going to
happen next week but what about a
society in which people live to be a
hundred fifty I don't think it's an
accident that the environmentalism for
example has occurred in the last century
the national parks are only a bit more
than hundred years old why because
people were living long enough to see
the results and they could see the rate
of change other concerns about climate
change in this century and even things
like say archaeology how come
archaeology is not a thousand-year-old
subject how come it's only since the
time of Lehman
so centuries ago what's because people
didn't have enough of perspective to
even think about the ancient past it
seems relevant because after all they
were gonna die pretty soon it's worth
imagining what's going to happen to the
society in which people who live to be a
hundred and fifty I think they're going
to have a much longer time frame in mind
and as you probably notice our major
problems are on that time scale climate
change is a problem for the four on the
scale and of a century because by that
time we will see at least two I think
more like four degrees centigrade
changing the temperature of the planet
unless we do things like geo engineering
which I've been working on but the
points this is an errant Lee a long time
scale problem if you make people live
longer you will get more wisdom out of
the society and of course you'll get
more productivity because people won't
be retiring at the age of 65 know need
to know need to at all they will work
all the way past 100 and you'll get much
more yield out of them after all you
spend what 20 years educating people and
then you get 30 years of work and
they're gone that's not a really great
way to run two societies if you get
essentially more out of them it's bar
more productive worth remembering that
65 was the retirement age and social
security for and is set up in 1936 you
know why Plus at that point half the
people were dead so you could fund the
program on the backs of everybody but
give it to only half is worth
remembering that your perspective
changes with your lifespan so that's the
genessy and agenda that's what we want
to do and and the company is growing
very fast and it's a perfect example of
how people like you who NIT can help
fields that seemed utterly different
utterly different but longevity is in
fact your kind of problem so get to work
on it thank you
um I noticed in the in the infection
study that you had actually shown the
age of the flies when you tested them
but in the sort of the mike yeah in the
study for the substance nutrigenomics
you didn't show at which age you started
giving these substances of the Flies I'm
wondering you know when you transfer
that the humans with it applies to how
early in life you have to start taking
these nutrigenomics to have an effect
how early should you begin taking a
genomic arrived due to genomic because
after all you don't need it when you're
just a snot-nosed kid right well a rough
measure is you should take it after the
age in which human reproduction stops
which is roughly 40 by the way my
co-founder the cardio vascular
specialist gives all of her patients the
statin drugs at age 40 because it is
essentially a longevity drug in itself
it's really great for cardiovascular hey
drops to the death rate from cardio
problems like forty-five percent one
drug right but it also reduces the
cancer death rate by twenty percent and
the Alzheimer's rate so it's a very
general kind of thing but she gives them
to it at age 40 for exactly that reason
and by the way the actual data shows
that it works even in that low NH so 40
I would say but of course there's no
real problem with taking it earlier
because it has no bad side effects yes
flies the human seems like an awful big
jump have you thought about adding in
testing on mice as an intermediate stuff
yes everybody said why didn't you do it
in mice well two things the control
flies we use who live in big
environments under a significant stress
is if they live three four weeks right
mice live several years so it's going to
take you much longer to get so profound
a result but there's another problem all
the way of mice are inbred so you're
looking at a narrow suite of jeans
these are not Nashville mice third mice
died mostly of cancer and cancer is a
worthy topic but that's all you're going
to get mostly is cancer so those are the
reasons we haven't done mice it's far
more expensive but we are in fact
carrying forward such a program now it's
just that flies look like the
low-hanging fruit if that's a metaphor
as they are fruit flies right so as you
say you get very fast results from
breeding flies and testing on mice is
they're expensive and it takes a really
long time to get any useful data and
then you are going to go and you're
going to sell these to humans and to
actually do a double blind trial of
humans taking these for long enough to
demonstrate a life-extending effect we
take a really long time so is it going
to take 40 years before where we can
tell whether you're actually selling
anything useful yes I mean problem of
affecting human longevity as it takes a
while and 40 years it would be nice to
have a program that that revealed a
result in 40 years but where do you get
the funding so we hope that half century
from now will be clear that these things
illuminate human longevity but no one
will know as you say until we get that
far our problem is that it most people
are rather impatient are there
beneficial effects that you could test
for that you could do on a one-year
trial or a six-month trial well you
could say well look this person's
cardiovascular health is improved by
taking these things because then it
would would seem to give much more
confidence that's really good deep are
you interested a job because no thanks
I'm good because that's exactly what
we're doing we're looking at their
general overall performance versus time
and must you early to say anything
except that i can tell you personally
i've been taking for half a year and i
think it improves your your energetic
levels i think we actually know why so
yes we're going to look at people's
basic performance over time longevity
takes a bit
good deal longer thanks so have you
tried giving these you know cocktails of
chemicals to the Methuselah flies and
seeing if it actually helps them uh yes
but I can't tell you any results because
we don't have them yet ah that's exactly
we're doing an experiment right now yeah
he was you're right you're looking for
John no you got a good job baby grace
leister work so provided that the
project comes to fruition and you are
able to extend human life I know several
times and like how do you think it will
affect the creativity in the Indus ID
because ideas mostly the youth young
people are the source of new ideas in
the in the SIA tea and in a society that
has people living much longer but still
resource constrained they will be very
few youngsters yeah that's essentially a
social question it says suppose you
create a long live society well actually
you know I would say yeah we'll worry
about that when we get one but at you at
multi creativity go away two things 1i
think the lapsing of creativity occurs
at least in part because the lapsing of
vigor in the human population on the
other hand is also true that Leo Tolstoy
wrote on a criminal when he was in his
70s I mean there is some creativity late
in life it tends to be places where
accumulated wisdom helps you
particularly novelists and Beethoven
wrote the Knights entrance in fernie
only was in his 50s but but that's that
is interesting implication Chris doesn't
mean you won't have young people around
it may be that you'll have a wiser
society which if you know much of this
history of the 20th century might
test itself as a good idea so those
social implications are going to be
worked out by oh that's right you guys
you guys because you're going to see it
oh and you can even live to see the
singularity yeah but yes you let's hope
me selecting for something more than
just long line it's probably going to be
a much more conservative Society um will
it be more conservative you mean it will
do less or it will be more cautious I
feel be more adverse to change oh um
will it be mmm but wait a second the
societies there as long as loud people
in it have been the of those who had the
greatest rate of change that is the
societies of the last 200 years so it
this Oracle experiences it goes the
other way you want a conservative
Society think about the Pharaohs right
very little happen for over a thousand
you know a couple of thousand years
that's a conservative Society so I don't
think it's obvious that these societies
will be averse to change because the
rate of change in the last two centuries
has been the highest human experience
and it's also those the one in which
people no longer so it's not an obvious
issue thanks so my understanding is it's
a five years from now we're going to
have huge amounts of genomic data for
you know hundreds of thousands or
millions of volunteers correlated with
their medical records so I'm assuming at
that point you could take your fruit fly
jeans and look at the million volunteers
and see if there was a correlation we're
the ones the humans who live longer had
these genes also is that in the playbook
that's that's exactly what's going to
happen and in fact the there the the
centenarians is that internal the
centenarians a group those who live
longer than 100 they're growing they're
the fastest growing group of the
population and so exactly there's a hall
ready a society that studies this
genomically and tries to pull
information out
by the way the Methuselah show a plateau
in late life so do the centenarians
those beyond 105 the rate of mortality
the mortality rate is flat it does not
continue increase in the human
population mortality rate increases all
the way up to 105 and then plateaus
exactly the same thing as the Methuselah
system which is we're very suggestive
that longevity means both vigor of a
sort and that the mortality rate stops
declining so that's very suggestive and
that's exactly what's going to happen in
the next decade yeah so I'm over 40 what
do you suggest I take now so you're over
40 take statin drugs regular exercise
all the things that our mothers told us
turn out to be true isn't that
embarrassing I mean eat vegetables and
fruits that the usual stuff do not take
up hang gliding as I did I broke his
shoulder twice once in baseball and
worsens once and surfing and this might
for spine and surfing my ankles and
mountain climbing don't do those things
I stopped laying off that stuff about
the age of 45 to 50 otherwise uh oh yes
that's right by our nutrigenomics
anybody else okay thanks very much
