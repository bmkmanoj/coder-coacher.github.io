here we have a Vince quali formula from
heater wire and he is going to be
talking about instant networks using
ultra wideband my immobilizers and
you'll be talking about the very
interesting way of creating some
multiple multiple radios in additional
to have a very vibrant communication
also to have very good virtual
organization on there this is an
external talk please remember to use
good judgment in your questions this
will be videotaped and it will be
available to the public
thank you thank you salton and thank you
for all for coming this afternoon so
it's a pleasure to be here and talk
about ultra wideband and I'd like to
first say this was work that was done
over a 10-year period of time primarily
by several team members and one of which
dr. Jane Lin is also here
so she designed the chip so if you have
any questions she's I'm sure she'd be
willing to help out most of the work was
completed about two years ago so we
might be a little rusty if you have some
questions but it's all here and you know
if you have a question we'll definitely
get to the answer we have there's a lot
of brief when we entered this field
we've found that there's a lot of
rediscovering in the world of ultra wide
bands people discover something they
think its new and they dig a little
deeper and they find out it was done
before or in a different way or whatever
and one of the hopes in this
presentation is to share with you what
the work we've done so you can build
upon it in whatever way the and there's
also a lot of slides here and too much
to go through in one hour but I wanted
it we wanted it to be complete and will
give the slides to salt in the file as
PowerPoint is quite large so if you want
the slides you're welcome to them and
also we'll give some background on the
system we developed and if you to lead
up to the memo and some of the
applications and I think that's the more
interesting way of presenting the
material but if you want us to skip over
that we can do that too
and we also brought along one of the
larger units with the multiple antennas
so he can describe that to you and maybe
pass it around as well so with that as
an introduction okay that was just the
abstract for the talk and again the
overview will give you a will talk about
how the ultra watt how the ether wire
ultra wideband system works we'll talk
about some of the projects we did over
this ten-year period and the successes
from and and how the research built upon
itself and finally the MIMO and how we
perform beam forming and steering to
increase range and data rate you know in
our with our unit now ultra wide bands
has a lot of interesting characteristics
sold obviously RF has been around for a
long time hundreds 100 plus years
lots of modulation schemes lots of lots
of ways of use it in applications ultra
wideband though is relatively new
compared to narrow bands you know
there's probably hundreds hundred
possible signaling scheme and maybe this
10 or so that it typically used maybe a
little more than that nowadays but
certainly there's room for more and this
one of the things that attracts people
told your wideband is the bandwidth of
it typically greater than 100 gigahertz
we chose in our work to focus on the low
frequency below the GPS l1 l2 and we
chose to focus on it to do range
resolution like the company named ether
wire right wireless networks and
location so we had a very narrow focus
within this wide field of ultra wide
bands and some others they'll use it
because I like the high data rate
possibility it has some very good
techniques for time to time resolve
multipath low frequency was very
important to us obviously penetrating
materials we very much focused on
handheld devices indoors human warned
not airplanes or cars or ships or things
things for soldiers or people
firefighters Public Safety also
being episodic it has some very
interesting potentials to be in
low-power the waveform we chose is on
the bottom there which is a doublet the
bottom left the most the the last we had
six series of localizer six generations
the the final one the most recent one is
the one that I have here and also that I
show on the the slide here we call it
the generation six and the block diagram
is also more or less shown there on the
left you see the receive antenna which
is a big loop antenna not a whole lot of
technology there on the right is the
transmit antenna and there is a lot of
Technology there actually more than you
might see it's what's called a large
current radiator there are two loops
it's we made a 2d antenna you'll see the
earlier revs of it with 3d basically
been copper and in the middle between
the two antennas is a driver chip
because a custom chip that we developed
that uses flip chip technology chip on
board so actually it's bonded directly
to the PC board itself wanted a low
capacitance connection between the
antenna and the driver chip and we'll
talk more about the driver chips and
then in the middle is basically the the
key blocks of the circuitry you see kind
of highlighted in blue is the ether chip
that's the receiver chip and it said
it's really a mixed digital analog chip
that basically have some block diagrams
for it but that's what's has the time
integrating correlator is basically
pulling the signal from the noise to do
ultra wide bends and it is a system it
is an embedded system in the earlier
renditions we use the motorola Coldfire
processor mainly because there's fully
static we looked at an arm and later if
versions of the system and a lot of
memory obviously to run the are toss we
developed a are toss to run with this
system and then obviously a time basis
which basically is a cell phone crystal
okay and this some word slides on the
technical approach basically what we did
is we form two mobile ad hoc networks of
devices so no mo no mo true mobile ad
hoc no fixed infrastructures and
members can come and go at will and one
of the key parts of our system was that
we would do we would measure round-trip
delays between nodes and we accumulate a
lot of those delays and then push it
through a multilateration algorithm and
then come with range estimates and then
it's very much a network based system
five or more you know the sweet spot was
more like twenty to fifty nodes and you
can come with relative positioning for
the unit's right 3d position so that was
kind of one of our key objectives also
you can come with some modest data rate
about a thousand kilobits per second was
kind of what we targeted and as I said
earlier early in the presentation we did
actually take it a bit further using
multiple antennas and start doing you
know beam forming and beam steering to
get greater distances or potentially
greater data we tended to focus more on
distance than data because we thought
there other ways of doing higher data
rate than what we were working on on the
bottom we talked about some of the
timing one of the big part one of the
one of the big tricks of ultra wide
bands is to get accurate range of
estimates you have to have accurate time
basis and there was a lot built into our
technology to come with using the
crystals to come with basically a couple
of centimeter accuracy between nodes and
we'll talk a little bit about how we did
that here's a block diagram for the
system kind of went through that when
talking about the Gen six but you see on
the upper left is the receive antenna so
loop antenna with an RF amplifier going
into time integrating correlators an A
to D converter so basically that's the
ether chip on the bottom left you see
the processor with the kit with the
program storage in memory basically
that's you know the Archos is running on
there to basically to basically figure
out what is noise and what is signal
that it sees in the correlator bins and
then on the lower right is the driver
chip that's basically driving the large
current radiator antenna okay there's
just a couple of things on the chips the
big thing is that when you're dealing
with ultra
dealing with you know below part 15
right very you're dealing with very very
low pain signals and one it's one of the
tricks is you have to be able to pull a
lot of signal from the noise that's
basically what you're doing in a
receiver chip your what's called a
transmit starved link that you can only
put out so much energy but you have to
be able to pull a lot of energy from the
noise so one of the tricks is you have
to make sure your chip itself is very
low noise and that was a lot of work and
kind of talked about in the first bullet
there is coming with a logic family for
our chip they're full custom chips to
basically have a very low noise floor
and believe me when you started this
project if we thought we can buy chips
to do this we would have but it turned
out to be soup to nuts the whole thing
custom chip development custom Hardware
signaling software antenna quite a
project so talk a little bit about the
antennas so our problem that we're
solving was location and also we wanted
this to be like I said in the onset
something that's human worn or on a
sensor or something that is relatively
small and could be orientated in many
different ways so that puts a lot of
pressure on your antenna your antenna
technology has to be small it has to be
able to work at different orientations
and near humans and also it has to be
omnidirectional because you know in the
location you can't make assumptions
about where the different intent where
your your neighbors are that you're
talking about you're talking you're
communicating to and also it has to be
since we're dealing with pulse it has to
be a very flat across a very wide
bandwidth so that was a lot of work that
we put into it and we did a lot of work
using in the middle bullet they're using
them rather large reference tempting
horns they're call like three meter long
horn antennas as some pictures that we
show here obviously those are not very
practical to be low cost and human
wearable so we did a lot of work
developing the antennas and we came with
a large current radiator the
intended that we show in our devices
also the transmission that we use is
episodic I mean that's basically adult
too why been is it's also called pulse
radius and we have you know again
there's a lot in these slides I kind of
just skip over the we have a CDMA TDMA
encoding built into it and we have very
large sequence we did some of this work
was funded by DARPA and it had potential
military Public Safety kinds of
applications so they're very concerned
about having very long codes and you
know data buried in the noise and things
like that because kisame codes the
reception we used time basically a time
integrating correlator
and basically the energy coming that's
you know captured in the in the loop
antenna is then put in two different
bins and the correlators and the ether
chip and then basically that's where the
processor is interrogated it's looking
for Peaks looking for peaks in the in
the signal that's not noise a big part
of our effort to was doing all the
networking again this is a mobile ad-hoc
Network five to twenty ideally fifty
kind of nodes we always focused we
wanted these to be small and cheap
whenever we had a design trade-off
instead of making it expense you know
anyway nobody tries to make things
expensive but we made the assumption
that if we can make them small and cheap
you'd have lots of them so you'd worry
less about range for instance so our
sweet spot was always in the ten to
thirty meter range although like I said
using multiple antennas we got up to 100
meters but we always wanted good
networks that he can have multi @ha
multi-hop kind of things you can form
clusters within the network and also you
can selectively share data across the
network that some of the things built in
about that maybe again from the darker
roots maybe you don't want to use this
for you know for enemy gets it for
targeting or things like that we tried
to make it so each unit itself was smart
enough to develop its own location that
had run the
multilateration but in a lot of the work
we kind of just assumed that that would
be something that come later and we
tended to have one like a computer
running the multilateration algorithms
in the networking we form mesh networks
the nodes would aggregate into clusters
and the clusters would all have
consensus clocks across them you know
again because the time basis the is very
important to calculate accurate ranging
so we had consensus clock which is kind
of like a flocking bird flocking
mechanism that would bring the furthest
member of the network into over time
into a closer a time basis as the as the
other members store-and-forward message
have been just kind of hitting on the
key points here storage forward message
passing if you want to use again we had
just a trickle of data the idea here is
that this would be sensor kind of data
but it might be important to get some
sensor data from one node across to the
other end of the network and you might
want to have some pirate priorities and
things like that so that was built into
this as well we had TDMA and CDMA
channelization the TDMA was in the
cluster and then across clusters it was
based on a code CDMA and the consensus
clock the algorithm that we use to bring
all the clock that bring the the network
clock to basically maintain tight timing
across the network an important part of
the technology was acquisition and this
is a you know key problem in ultra
wideband because you buried in the noise
right you know and your mobile a dog so
you can't assume you got all the members
there and you know there are more
members so you always have to be looking
for more members in a way that you can
do other stuff as well so we developed
the acquisition schemes called a rapid
acquisition scheme that it can basically
periodically go out and look for other
members and if it's a member it already
knew that was there right it says hey
I'm there that then this note the
localized would know I already have you
move
quickly so that was part of it another
part of it is that it can very quickly
know there is a member versus that's
just noise it's looking at so there was
a lot of work put into the rapid
acquisition algorithms that we used and
these are just some of the slides on
that as far as all the network layer we
we had basically level three and below
Network and we're very much focused on
the fie in this effort we assumed that
people would build applications on top
of that and we just wanted to do a
really good job with the fine deliver
good you know range estimates and good
network level but we did have a Mac and
also link level link logical link
control and that was just the
architecture of the Mac and link
management but what we focused on was
like this block diagram here where we
would have a unit a localizer connected
to a PC basically and one of the
challenges in this work was whenever you
had something other than the localizer
connected to it you couldn't use copper
because that something other could
become part of the antenna or if it's
connected to other lab equipment or a
wall outlet or whatever all of a sudden
you have cheap cheap paths through cheap
paths through copper for your network so
you get artificial artificially
short-range estimates or distorted data
so it's very important in the setup and
we probably showed it too much in this
slide but everything between anything
else and the localized was using fiber
so this way it was isolated and in later
work we did more handheld kinds of
things and we tried to always keep it
isolated the idea that the military had
was this would be a PDA kind of thing
and the localiser part of it would be an
add-on unit which would be on the back
of a radio a back of the power pack and
that would be isolated that way from the
rest of the unit one of the nice things
about ultra wideband is that it's
inherently LPI LPD sparse codes keep the
power low you have long codes so you
really it's like looking the analogy
used was like looking for a submarine
in the Pacific Ocean you know during the
Cold War 1020 years ago that's kind of
the analogy of the processing power
you'd be using common filtering two
levels of common filtering that were
used in our implementation this slide
kind of shows which the challenge of
doing ultra wide bends a is showing the
top one is showing the transmitted
signal a and C and then B and D are
showing what receives the receive signal
that you see and B you can kind of see
the doublets in there without the noise
but obviously we're dealing with in a
system in the real world is d we have
all the noise in there as well and
that's really the challenge of the
algorithms is pulling all that signal
pulling that signal out of the noise one
of the other interesting aspects of
ultra wideband is a signal is the energy
is spread across a very broad spectrum
and there's always this concern about
ultra wideband raising the noise floor
well you know it's spread so far that
you kind of work through some of these
slides probably not very much of a
concern like I said the last days
generation six the most recent
implementation of our localizer was like
these are the specs forward and have a
unit here showing it you know even in
prototype it was targeted about a
thousand dollars a unit battery life
about half a day again the node to note
is about 30 meters you can kind of read
some of the specs here five centimeter
Rane an RMS range accuracy what we're
told for a lot of applications is the
good target is roughly the size of a
beach ball if you can come with pretty
accurate estimates in a 3d the size of a
beach ball that's pretty good and kind
of that was our goal okay I'll go
through some of the projects we did so
you can kind of see how the technology
evolved and you can kind of see the
dates too on this to see how long it do
we working on it and see how much
funding we had so obviously have far
greater resources here and you know
obviously technology has moved on and
things like that so
new efforts should certainly go be a lot
easier than our effort but we go back to
the late 90s working on this very first
project I was working on a DARPA project
and with there we had some localized
already had the base technology I show
you the next slide but we developed the
fourth-generation
to demonstrate mobile ad hoc networks
with uwv ranging we're told at the time
by DARPA that was something that was
never done before we had to develop the
UWB chips couldn't buy them if we could
find something available we would have
and we also had kind of the specs that I
showed there in bullet number three ten
meter range range accuracy to several
centimeters and then about a thousand so
the specs never really changed no drain
data rate of about a thousand baud and
this slide actually shows the localizers
that came before the generation three
and basically the very first one which
is on the left is actually kind of
interested in the work that the
investigators did the very first one
showed that you can create a pulse and
you can launch that pulse into the far
zone and they and it wasn't very obvious
at the time I mean they did just try
half the pulse but it would collapse so
they needed both the positive and the
negative side of the doublet to launch
into the far zone and the second
generation showed that you can have a
train of pulses so they had like a pal
or a state machine I'm driving at the
third generation they actually made a
receiver and that's when they started
getting involved in the receive antennas
and showed that you can receive a pulse
that's and interpret a pulse that's
launched into the far zone and then the
fourth generation they started doing the
networking and these are showing the
earlier chips that we had the ether chip
the receiver chip on the left and the
transmitter chip on the right these are
mostly mostly analog implementation so
you could see a lot of test pads running
vertically towards the right of the dye
they tried to have every analog every
circuit they could have a way of probing
both sides of it every critical every
circuit that they felt critical and
every implementation had to be probable
on both
you can see the correlators in the chip
on the lower left now on the right side
is a driver chip and basically it was
that it was an h-bridge at least that
one was the driver too we had another
driver years later on called driver 3
but the driver 2 is basically an
h-bridge like a stepper motor controller
and basically it was a current mode
antenna that we used and then again in
this early DARPA project and this was
done in Marin this is where the lab was
at the time we demonstrated ad-hoc
peer-to-peer networking with eighth
notes with rapid acquisition and and
flooding of range data so you can
basically turn you know introduce and
take away members to the network and we
use these I think those are call kiddie
condos that's what those were
because again if you had anything made
anything metal you'd have all kinds of
false positive data because they'd be
antennas all of a sudden so we tended to
use all this wood and umbrella stands
and things like that at different
heights elevation we did outdoors and we
did indoors
I guess these pictures show the outdoor
kind of data and actually it was a lot
easier this work was done in Nicasio
which is a town in San Rafael very close
to Skywalker Ranch and just as the side
when we moved from there down here to
lab and sunny though we actually took a
few steps backwards because there was no
background RF there it was pristine cuz
up in the hills maybe a cell site but
when we came down in the valley here it
became a whole nother challenge and we
also did work at Berkeley nearly with B
WRC and they had a cell site right near
their labs that was a real challenge as
well then the second project we had so
you know DARPA like we did and this was
with the US Navy onr and this one was
more that they said let's let's see how
good you guys are and we know you can do
some of this stuff in Marin and you know
in a really nice environment well let's
see how you can do around cargo
containers and the idea here was that
you I guess the application they had in
mind was you know a lot of
stuff for the military shipped in cargo
containers and they would like to have a
way of tagging and ID and things and all
that I guess that's kind of the
application that in minds but they were
really curious to see if the if the
unit's could work in the container and
if they can communicate with units
outside the container so that was
actually the to two points here in the
bottom we had to demonstrate the ability
to communicate inside and outside the
container and we also demonstrated
operation inside the container and
inside the container was very
challenging because you get a very large
resonance and it kind of sets it there
at 87 megahertz one twenty one thirty
eight and one of the unique properties
of our system is that you can control
the doublet separation so we actually
had a way of cancelling out of avoiding
they resonance frequencies in this
application that was kind of the aha we
got from this project and some slides on
that so this one first shows on the
lower right shows the I guess a
primitive drawing of two cargo
containers next to each other and this
was out at the Port of Oakland so we
actually had some time out there to do
this and we actually were able to have
localizers in adjacent containers
communicate basically through the wood
floor that's what they did when you
started stacking them it became nearly
impossible but when they were on the
floor we can do it and then we also went
out and bought a container as part of
this project and they and you can do
that you can buy even small companies
can buy containers are never expensive
and we actually set up on the upper
left-hand corner you can see it a couple
of localizers inside the container and
whether we opened or closed the door
didn't really matter very much and we
did actually the PSD 3d PSD diagram in
the middle there is showing if you look
at a cross-section of the container you
can see the power the power in the
z-direction
versus the frequency in the y-direction
inside the cross-section of the
container so when we like I said in the
earlier slide we'd found where the peaks
were we basically just tuned our
doublets to avoid those Peaks
we actually set up a little network
inside a container kind of cool next
project we had was this is another DARPA
project and basically this is a lot of
the work with the large current radiator
so again making the transmit antennas
better and one of the big things okay if
you if your do an ultra wideband you
can't put out more power that's kind of
regulated by the FCC you can only do so
much on the receive side and we did as
much as we could but we try to do is try
to be very clever the way we put out the
pulses call it pulse shaping so put out
pristine pulses so that's what this was
all about working on the driver chip
that control that generated the pulses
and working on the antenna that
propagated the pulses to the far zone so
that's what this was all about and you
know some of the the hogs were shown at
the bottom there that we had in this
Australian send the slides we came with
the kind of a novel antenna design
methodology for both the receive and the
transmit side at the time and there
might be better tools nowadays but we
use a REM con fdtd simulation tool for
basically you know basically what the
investigators did is came with all the
extra terms to model Maxwell's equations
for non-science sinusoidal functions for
periodic functions using numerical
methods such as fdtd so they'd come with
different shapes for antennas and then
they try model init in rem con in fdtd
and then they try building them and
usually the they would get some kind of
promising results using the simulation
and they tried building them and then
either they find it's not practical to
build or the results just weren't as
good when the actual unit so if you kind
of follow through these slides that this
these flowcharts that's what they were
doing you know simulating using a clever
set of tools then building the antennas
using lab equipment testing them
then going the other way and improving
the next time around so that was the big
part of this project is coming with all
in the whole methodology and then we
settled with this large current radiator
and if it yeah okay the a/v well a V
file works here so basically this is
showing the this is the fdtd simulation
showing the field strength building up
in antenna and then all of a sudden
you'll see it break off and launch
omnidirectional into the far zone and
you do get a little bit of a I know what
the term is a dimple on top so you get a
little bit of that but part of the
challenge was obviously to minimize that
and make sure that you move in enough so
that's never pointing to the object of
interest so and that led up to the
generation 5 localizer
so the one I showed before and the DARPA
work was for and the one we have now is
six so this is the one in the middle and
the earlier antennas like I said were 3d
they were basically you know made it at
bent metal and it was very easy to
prototype that way and a lot of
different advantages and we also made
them like this board stack approach
which has it's good in his bed the good
is that it was very modular so that we
can change system components the bad was
connectors are inherently unreliable
especially when doing field work and
especially when you're doing this kind
of work were you debugging so many
different things you want your hardware
to be solid but it worked
on the bottom stack that obviously was a
power board and then one board was what
we call the ether board that had the
received chip another board had the
processor on it with the memory and the
ties into the you know motorola debugger
and things like that and then the top
board was the antenna board with the
driver chips so it was all stacked
together like that and it actually was
good because it ran who used this for a
couple years during the projects back
then and made a lot of iterations to the
components and it was small that was
always important we always knew that we
can make things smaller but we wanted to
start with something that was reasonably
small
then the next project we did we started
focusing on applications and this was
with the Marines and you know obviously
in this whole field of ultra-wideband
back then very little commercial
interest at least in what we did most of
it came from the government and military
that's why you see all these slides here
this one was with mout with the Marines
where basically they wanted to be able
to track soldiers inside buildings and
they're very interested in not just
soldiers but firefighters and and if you
look at the time frame this is around
911 right so those obviously of great
interest back then in our country so we
came with so if you look on the bottom
the two successes there basically if you
look at a room the little 3d
representation there and there's a few
localizers stationery and you can move
in that path and we demonstrated that
you can you can display in the screen
where you are in a room as you move
through and also using some software you
can also come with the shape of the room
which is kind of novel because you know
you can't assume walls right when you're
doing this the units don't know where
their walls they just know you you
generally don't walk through walls so we
actually had a little algorithm in there
that would come with this shape and size
of the room and we also did a lot of
work in penetration back then that was
important because this is very much for
indoor applications and what materials I
guess what was important to them is
where doors were or where possible
places of entry are I'm just going the
wrong way into a building and then this
is showing the actual pictures from that
on the lower left there you can see the
units on these okay so we had we moved
on a little bit from the from the kitty
condos and this one we actually put the
units on top of umbrella stands that's
what those are and we had different
heights and then one of them we had on
wheels and you can move it through and
that's basically the person moving
through the room and then on the lower
right we had a little GUI they're
showing the representation of the room
and the 3d multilateration was running
and inside that computer as well we also
did some work and penetration of UWB
through materials and to some of the the
slides of the data collected there what
we obviously what you'd find is if you
have enough conductive mass it's going
to absorb any kind of material sorry any
any signal no matter how low frequency
or how strong but for common building
materials the spectrum that we chose was
pretty good and also we'd always tried
to make it so they have a few extra
paths in case you artificially got a
very long path because it's blocked your
algorithm be smart enough to know well
ignore that one this other way of
constructing that path seems to be more
accurate so that was kind of built in as
well so then we moved on from that we
had some money from the NSF a grants and
we did this back with Berkeley with B
WRC Berkeley Wireless Research Center
and this kind of gets involved with one
of the topics here of the of the MIMO
antennas so they were very interested
okay you can put these units on people
and track them well can you also kind of
make statements about people that don't
have don't have the units on them can
you be able to find let's say a hostage
situation or rescue whatever other
people in the building as well as those
wearing tags so we used an approach I
guess the term for that is tomography
where backscatter radiation I think
that's what it is
where basically we would be able to take
some extra data that we'd get from the
network and process it offline the real
challenge today I think you could
probably do it in real time but there's
a tremendous amount of processing and
this is a big big part of the Berkeley
work was coming to the algorithms to do
that to basically make statements about
humans or objects of interest in the
field as well and have some slides
showing you about that and the second
point there is also doing focusing and
beamforming where you can you know get
greater distance
again we focused more in distance than
data rate because that was kind of our
you know we forget other people would
work on the data rate part of the
problem but and we did actually has some
interesting aha there that basically
three playing with the transmitters
right it was as much the receiver side
putting additional transmit antennas on
there we can increase the field strength
and get and get greater range and then
this slide shows a tomography part of
that work where we set up an experiment
the where we had in the middle there you
can kind of see that's isotonic water
basically water's the salinity and
volume of a typical human moving in a
field surrounded by the ultra wide band
and basically we obviously know we're
removing it and then we'd come with the
from that kind of developed the
algorithms to you know determine its
location and in the field of localizers
and the data was actually pretty good
there's some backup slides I have in
here on that that we collected and then
we also did work on the focusing and
beamforming and that was pretty good to
the we use three transmitters and a
single receiver and we're actually able
to get a focus zone they received power
that's nine times that from a single
transmitter so it was additive it did
the and again have more slides on that
and will work that we did in that field
so then we went back to chips the chips
were getting a little old and dusty
doing all this system work if you've
been following the years and everything
in the dates here and we're fortunate
enough enough to get a NIST
ATP Award it's kind of a scholarship for
small companies and they're very
interested in making these coin-sized
and we always wanted to make things
smaller too that was a big part of our
work so we always design the radio chips
so that they could be put on a CMOS
process and the processor could be
integrated with the memory and you know
nowadays obviously with the with you
know 45 30 nanometer or whatever
technology that seems kind of old but at
the time we had
half micron parts and we're looking at
getting in 0.35 and 0.15 micron
technology so this goes back a few years
but you know obviously could still be
applied today and the real challenge
with a lot of this is the radio stuff
really doesn't need the deep submicron
it's really the processor in memory
which inevitably is the biggest partyer
chip anyway and the movement of the fab
because people don't make the old
technologies so in order to stay current
you have to be able to move your radios
forward to just have gains in other
areas and the thing that works against
you in doing this is these technologies
also tend to be very low voltage so you
dealing with more noise margins and
things like that that was a big part of
Jane's work on this project
and we came with a tool flow we did this
I mean if you've been following the
dollars you know this is to large extent
self funded and grants and things like
that so he came with a tool flow that we
can insert bloats and shrinks in order
to scale to go to the technologies that
we wanted and then artificially make
bigger the analog blocks that we needed
to and it worked I mean obviously in a
in an ongoing company a chip company it
probably have a more automated flow but
it did work for what we were doing so I
mentioned that we had a new driver chip
along the way and this is a driver 3 B
and a lot of the work in this chip was
to make what's called pulse shaping in
order to get better range we wanted to
make better pulses and the antenna was
part of that and doing the chips was
part of that and this came with a new
approach of doing pulse shaping for the
driver chip and we also came with a
succession of of new ether chips
receiver chips and one of the challenges
to when you're doing chip design with
system design and everything else at
once is you know you've running chips
and you can't afford to have too many
mistakes so we actually tended to do
these reticle kind of things we'd have
multiple versions of the chips sometimes
with little things changed here and
there
so that hopefully from that run you'll
get a few chips you can use because you
really only need a few chips and then
you could always zero in on what worked
and make more of them later so that's
what we started doing with the ether 6
and then the ether 7 and the block
diagrams that kind of shown there for
the chips and then the ether eight and
nine we started doing more work with
okie semiconductor and the 0.15 SOI
process and with this we also started
putting the ARM processor and the memory
on the chips as well so the ultimate
goal was to have one chip that was the
receiver chip with the processor in
memory and then one chip that was a
driver chip maybe eventually one with
both of them but the driver chip would
tend to be married to the antenna and
the intended tenant would tend to be
part of the packaging of this so-called
coin-sized localizer another project we
did ok this one was a back to DARPA and
some of these overlapped a little bit
but they had a project called nedick's
that they basically wanted to have
networking in extreme environments and
what we did here and this also gets
involved with the multiple antennas and
things they're very interested in having
radio technology that could work when
you have all these other radios and
jamming technology and things like that
going on so the the tests and tests that
they required were pretty severe and in
fact at one point we actually did go
down to Edwards Air Force Base they have
a big anechoic chamber there and did can
conduct some experiments because we
needed one hundred and hundred meter
kind of range to do this and that was
the largest anechoic chamber on the west
coast so the the successes is shown on
the bottom there we developed the flat
antenna the you know up until this time
up until then this before this we had
the 3d antenna and this one we got to
the flat antenna we also demonstrated
multiple antennas so the multiple
transmit antennas in an arrays because
then the NSF work was using tame horns
and
like that so now we use our own little
antennas to do this and we produced the
new ether chip the third bullet there
the ether seven which had higher data
rate that was also in well that was
important to DARPA probably less
important to us but we did it was
important to them they had some targets
what they needed for data rates we
supported some partners in this
telcordia and boeing at the time and we
successfully demonstrated hundred and
hundred meter range and actually did in
a parking parking garage right near I'll
tell you the story in that in a minute
so this was kind of the nedick's program
that were involved in and again it was
very much focused on the dismounts
soldier so that was kind of always we
always focused on people and sensors
small things I mentioned we developed
the 2d antenna we moved from the 3d to
the 2-d here it allowed much better
packaging it was easy to manufacture it
kind of got tired of bending all the
sheet metal and it basically became our
standard antenna technology and you can
kind of see going on the right there
from the 3d those big loops to the 2d on
the bottom right and you can see those
capacitors in the middle that too became
a little bit of a bear for us to produce
so like I'll show you that in a minute
so we came with different ways of
putting these this the capacitance that
we needed between the two loops and on
the Left we actually experimented with
foil to kind of dial in the the what we
needed and then we came with a way of
doing it using Ferro flex be well it
says if they're fair flex be BC 24
material so basically we when we dialed
in the resistance that we needed we
basically produced a very special PC
board with farrah flex material in it
you know you can do that nowadays from
multiple well you know they use I guess
they do it for buses to control the
capacitance but we used it to basically
control the resistance between the two
loops of the antenna so it became
something you can produce in volume also
it's kind of hidden in the picture there
but you can see between on the bottom
center of the the antennas that was a
driver chip right there we actually had
it chip on
bored in the later implementations we
had it which is a epoxy goop over it but
for that one we had a little a little
cover that we put over the chip but the
chip was mounted right on the board
there's no package using flip chip
technology and then we also know this is
just getting involved with some of the
simulations we did and the inner layers
of the board and how it was made for the
2d antennas and we tried different sizes
antennas and we actually tried the
larger ones and the smaller ones the
larger ones really didn't buy very much
a properly designed smaller antenna was
just as good for the work that we did in
terms of range but that was as large as
we got the ones there and we made a
raise and we simulated the arrays using
them using the X DTD REM con simulation
and we came with some optimal spacing
between the antennas that was kind of
always going in here in this slide and
then we came with the version of our Gen
6 antenna that you can kind of see here
that would have again we go back to the
connectors so although this time is a
little easier because these are antennas
they weren't we didn't have the
electronic components connected through
the connectors but we came with this
approach that you can stack multiple
antennas and change them out to this way
you can experiment and I mentioned I go
back to the story of the garage in
Sunnyvale if you go over by the train
station here in mathilde in Sunnyvale
there's this big antenna this big garage
that I think is like three or four
levels below grounds and it's kind of a
I guess it's a public video you know a
lot of companies go there to do RF
testing this is it's as close as you can
get to an anechoic chamber without and
and the city of Sunday mail was very you
know we we just had a sign a release and
we were you know and other companies do
that as well and you go down there into
your RF testing so as actually kind of
neat
and we set up a system like shown in the
picture or similar to what was show here
in the unit have here and we actually
did it did get a node to node of 93
meters using the four antennas so 100
meters was kind of the goal and we came
pretty close to that and we also came
with some this is just some of the
technical data from it showing the bit
error rate and the range for these so
these are point-to-point so these were
no longer location these are
point-to-point and we also came with
actually with telcordia partner we came
with this very nice software to
thoroughly test the link of the nodes so
basically when you establish a link then
the soft will report all kinds of bit
error rate and different statements
about the quality of the link and the
and any kind of interferes and the link
and things like that so we learn more
about what was happening between the
localizers up into that point we
basically just took the data and
interpreted it to do location but this
actually let us learn more about the
links themselves then we had another
project
DARPA kind of like what we were doing
and this was a nest network embedded
sensor technology and they this nest was
and here they were concerned about
having the localizes themselves do the
time of flight basically no longer have
a central unit that would do the
multilateration they would have the
multilateration you've done on the units
themselves and a different kind of
multilateration usually multilateration
assumes that you see a couple of
satellites because it's very gps centric
this assumes that you have many sources
of data and none of them are very good I
mean as a network they're probably good
but you know you could have blocked
paths or units that come and go from the
network so we also have built into that
kind of intelligence that you would have
a timestamp for every range estimate and
newer estimates were better than treated
at a higher rate at higher level than
older estimates and also you'd have some
way of double checking to see if you had
a block path if you're really dealing
with a multipath as opposed to direct
path we
no it's because you had block signal and
the second part of this project was also
to look at channel models and near body
effects and things like that so some
data came out of this work so this we
started you know this gets involved with
the multilateration that we did between
between units at the at the node level
and you know making basically the way
multilateration you think of it as a
succession of ellipse of a overlapping
ellipse ellipsoids and that's what they
show and they they graph on the right
and then we also got involved with
coming with the channel model because
they wanted the math in the channel
model for our work as well and came
involved with different cases where you
have a line of sight and an on line of
sight that's it shown at the bottom
there so this is deterministic with a
line of sight and this is with no line
of sight and also it came with some body
proximity effects okay because again
these are sensors that could be human
we're warned so looked at modeling the
near body effects and we also got
involved in later project with doing the
beamforming where basically you would
have a smaller maybe this is actually
the toughest them all we have on the
left there you'd have a network of
localizers that would communicate and
then some of them would be a little
bigger than others and they would
actually have the multiple antennas and
all that and they transmit to some
platform further away hundred nine
hundred meters kind of in the work that
we did and then they would have their
own little networks and then communicate
to other networks elsewhere and that's
what this got involved with so this
actually let's see what time are we at
now are we over there one hour I was
kind of getting more into backup slides
I can keep going or I just take you
through this data real fast
so I mentioned in doing the
because they know your interest in the
multiple antennas doing the the
tomography and the the beamforming these
are just showing the experiments that we
set up and the set up a track with the
human the isotopic water moving on this
track and the four antennas that we use
these are before we had the multiple
antennas that we and the antenna arrays
like we show here and then the focusing
results that we did and on the bottom
they can see the conclusion the electric
and magnetic fields can be superimposed
spaced spatially and temporally with
sufficient precision that the field
strengths can add as opposed to having
them cancel out sorry the picture
overlap the slide the words there and
this is just some of the data on the
focusing we do lose with one over R
squared decrease in power right but it's
offset by the N squared increase and the
power due to the focusing points that
was the idea of increasing the field
strengths and then just some of the 3d
views of the focus zones that we created
and then these were just some
simulations we did on the receive
antenna of the data and that was pretty
much it and I have the unit here if
anyone wants to I could pass it around
you can come up and see it I'm not sure
which is easiest way to do it if
anyone's interested any questions
that's the 6th that's the last one we
did I think it was a six ah which
generation is that that's the sixth
generation so that's the most recent and
I think it's a six a as we call it so
that actually had the latest technology
with the multi antennas and chips we did
smaller packaging but in terms of the
board level that was the biggest that
was the last one and you can kind of see
in the middle you can kind of see the
ether chip and you can see the on the
antennas you can see the little blob of
epoxy in the middle of the two loops and
the driver chip is there and you can
twelve is buried in the inner layers but
those antennas have the fire flex
material and you know obviously multiple
antennas and multiple driver chips so
this is the software controlling this
was a little special because it was
coordinating in time and and it was
coordinating the four driver chips
any other questions
yes
yeah
so the question was one of the dye plots
has to Dax Jane maybe you can answer
that what's the question why we have to
Dax are like
maybe that was my mistake Tandy might
want to step up to the microphone so
that's where they catch it in the
recording I'll try to find that slide to
me I'll find it
yes
this deck Actuaries a lot it's just
tragic about using us 7 bits or 6 bits
to control some kind of passing with
your cell use in the current mirror
don't adjust I'll try to get to the
biasing current right for some mapa
always a lot of adult subject based
enemy to control our current
of use
current current yes they're using six
bits control adÃ¨le accuracy of the
current yeah
any other questions
Oh how much power the question is how
much power do we transmit this one it
was yeah it's kind of hard to say
because there's so many different ways
of I mean when you know measuring the
power but it's yeah it is way below part
15 I know that do you remember any of
the the driver and you might want to go
into the microphone the parkin centuries
drivers um no they I think he means
transmitted or radiated power in tonight
choice because it's very low impedance
is you only a few ohms like a one not
two arms so it's a it's a lot of power
consumed but the power all of this I
would said this this large current
radiate radiators the politicians I
won't I don't think it's very good but
now we just using a it's a pendulum
processing can signal is very small is
lower than kind of low land noise it's
below noise levels that were using
interpret doing correlation integrates
excellent chips so retarded processing
game but the signal level is low
yeah the question was and then maybe
Jane can answer it we they we develop
low-noise logic family that was a
question right on the chip itself this
receivership actually is the reason we
heard a loud noise logic because it's
actually it's a deist
it's all our logic has a DC current a DC
bias so it's a so it's not the digital
circuits and all the circuit is a small
signal string and it's so it's great
they are current drop yeah because yeah
so it's very low noise but that of
course it's a at the cost of it has DC
bias and but that because this one when
you really use it that you is we only
using that thing I transmit the averaged
average time duty time duty cycle is
saying one percent so the total of ha
this chip I remember receivership is
about 100 million but if you're only
using one one hundreds of the time then
it's only one minion yeah
it's DC but it's all DC fire who has DC
fast so no noise because of its DC Isis
yeah
different yeah but they're kind of
digital noise we do have that we do have
three stage of the clock and the one of
us one of the stage of the clock is the
is that the digital is a logic is a
teacher each digital circuit it's not a
small swing itself or three but the less
that one is done
it's that's not a very fast clock that's
our the largest time scales clock yeah
did you talk to each other that we small
swing only yeah any other questions
well thank you for having us and you
know any anything we can do to further
this work please feel free to the
resultant or the emails on the slides
I'd be happy to get any answers to any
of the questions you might have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
