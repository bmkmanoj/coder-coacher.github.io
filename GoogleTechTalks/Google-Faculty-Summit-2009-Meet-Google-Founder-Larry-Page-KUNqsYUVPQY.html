start with that you know we really I
think have a huge debt to how the
computer science research researchers
out there that trained us and gave us
the tools to really built this company
and to make to do all the things that
we've done so first I want to thank you
what you all do is very very important
and my dad was a professor so I kind of
come from that environment and I really
enjoy it and I miss it a little bit
actually not that I'm in a hurry to
leave here so I had about a hundred
things I want to say to you all today so
I probably won't get to all of them gosh
I'm gonna try to leave some time for for
discussion or questions at the end but I
think I guess I feel like there's a
tremendous opportunity sort of between
what we do and what you all do let's
really make the world better and I think
most people are not aware that what's
possible I guess in technology I mean if
you look at what we do with computers I
remember when we were about 5 employees
we moved into a little office in
downtown Palo Alto and we had several
million customers and we actually
accidentally put our phone number on the
web and that just did not work at all we
actually had to get a new phone number
as our phone rang off the hook and um
you know that's really powerful I mean
you can be sitting there with five
people in a room you know through little
computers and typing and stuff and and
you can produce something in the
millions people are using or even
hundreds of millions of people these
days and that's because of Technology I
think somehow that people psyche that's
not in people's psyche people are
worried about their job so um I was
gonna ask you guys how many of you saw
the New York Times article about Markov
on Sunday with the robot plugging itself
in raise your hand
well that's a pretty good number but
that article sort of I was a little bit
upset with Markoff I happened to be with
him so y'all doing about it
oh but I said you know you're basically
telling people like you know you're
gonna flame all this fire about people
losing their jobs because computers are
gonna do things for them but that's
already happened like hundreds of times
in the past like how many of you are
farmers raise your hands you know like a
couple hundred years ago that number
would be ninety five percent or
something right and somehow you know
we're still surviving rates and it's
great that we don't all have to farm or
you can choose the farm if you like but
you don't have to so I think I think
somehow in society this hasn't really
this understanding of the power that we
have available to do things differently
and potentially better or in or in
different ways hasn't really synced into
people and there's generally fear to it
rather than excitement and this is why I
think computer science is not sexy
you know Romans are down especially
among women other groups I think that's
really big the sign of the lack of
sexiness and I think it's real real
issue for us all oh I think we actually
have the ability to do a lot of things
that most people in the world would find
really useful like you know I was really
excited about the automatic car stuff
the Grand Challenge which we went to and
you know we've been trying to help out
with out a little bit I mean you think
about the drudgery of driving and also
the I guess there's about four or five
million people killed Eeyore house is
driving it's probably no reason for that
and we could probably automate all that
stuff we could I don't know how many
billion trillion dollars we we spent on
infrastructure and roads you use those
probably three times more effectively
pretty easily and you know then people
will say things like wow transportations
not really that important you build more
roads they fill up that's because people
want to move around and you actually
look at it if you assume people are
married and they're working they want to
have choice of jobs and that's why they
moved to metro areas in the number of
jobs they can reach is a pretty good
fitness measure for you know their lives
like you're spending most of your time
working you want choice and jobs you
need transportation
maybe it's pretty straightforward thing
but I don't see those kind of arguments
so I just I wanted to sort of throw that
out is just sort of start and say I just
I'm tremendously optimistic that there's
a lot of things that could be done that
really benefit the world that that we
all as community can do I don't think
we're really focused on it I don't think
we know what those problems are I don't
think there's a discipline to identify
those problems I was on the Grand
Challenges community with the nae and we
kind of made some attempt to do that but
I don't think that's enough
you know when are the really big
problems we should be solving you know
computationally robotics I went to
synthetic biology conference just this
weekend it's amazing what they can do
there's certainly a lot of those
problems there also but even in computer
science there's there's tremendous
number of things that that could be
solved that are not being solved I think
robotics is a really obvious one you
know I mentioned the automated cars but
also you know the New York Times article
the computer plugging itself in that's
actually I'm the guy who did that is
Scott it Willow Garage and he was one of
the early Google programmers so we know
him really well he worked on Google
before it was the company and uh you
know he's been questioning a lot of that
stuff to actually make things that are
useful and I think that's clearly
possible when I was at Stanford I
actually wanted to work on automated
cars and my advisor Terry Winograd said
well I hadn't like three projects I
wanted to do one was telepresence almost
automated cars and one was the link
structure of the web and Terry Winograd
said when you work on the web that
sounds like a good project and I was
very good advice
but I think the other things not much
has changed since then really in terms
of what makes it possible or not and if
you go and look at those areas there's
still very small numbers of people
working on them and they're all doable
and they're not necessarily doable or
not for the kind of technology regions
people think you know it's in the
automated cars I knew when I was wanted
to work on it that sensing was a really
big problem you know if I took a car and
I put my video camera on it and tried to
drive it remotely you know I would kill
somebody right there's no way that's
gonna work and the advances there have
been largely I think due to the really
great time of flight laser scanners
which are now the dominant sensor there
I think in robotics you know the issue
we've had we have quite a bit of
industrial robotics now but they can
easily kill you right if you walk into
one you know and sorry I'm swingin it'll
just take your neck right off or
whatever that's not that you know we're
not gonna get robotics that way that's
section one of the great things the
research that came out of Stanford
that's cotton they're working on at
Willow Garage you can have relatively
big robots that can do things that won't
kill you even if they go a bit haywire
and I think that's a necessary condition
to make that stuff work but nobody you
know there's not been any serious worked
on with that as the starting point I
think there's a real big opportunities
there now I just wanted to maybe talk a
little bit about why I think people
aren't really working on the right stuff
I think there's a tendency always to
work on things you know are going to
succeed so if you're working on
something you're like well yeah I can
make this thing that I already did it 5%
better yeah we can improve our ranking a
little bit or whatever um you know it's
very easy to do that it's very easy to
publish papers there's already community
they can already measure or what you're
doing all those things the problem is
none of those things matter that much
and the thing that really matters is to
do something differently or do something
new and usually there's no community
it's hard to get people excited about it
my experience I just thought I'd
mentioned a few things we're going to
hear more about book search we actually
also wanted to do while we're at
Stanford as part of the digital
libraries project and everybody
basically thought it was in
and I also thought it wasn't related to
the research they were funded to do
that's another story
yeah we've now done over 10 million
books and you know it's been work but
it's not particularly hard thing to do I
don't know how you have a digital
library without books so and but yet
there's a lot of work don't know I think
it's very sorry I personally tried to
get people to work on that for many many
years and usually people thought it was
impossible but they thought that without
actually calculating anything so you
know if you actually run through and do
all the calculations it's actually quite
possible to do for reasonable amounts of
money and so on
and I think there's a lot of things that
don't get done for that reason it took
me actually about six years to get
people to work on that if I go back and
look at when we first figured out that
it was possible and practical so we
actually got somebody working on at full
time it took about six years and nothing
much changed during that six years I
mean you know whatever computers are a
little better and so on but didn't
materially change it pretty much all the
projects we have they just come out
Street View was also similar and it took
me a long time to get people to work on
that actually both those projects I had
to do myself in some sense I had a
camera in my car mounted which I drove
around and took a bunch of video and
convinced myself that it would work for
Street View and with books can I
actually scanned a bunch of books to
measure how much time it would take and
what the issues were and then I left it
in my office and eventually people
realize they should do that but I think
the problem why these don't get going is
that people aren't thinking about stuff
you know generally and you know we're
trained to be very you know I'm a
whatever a database computer scientists
and I work on disks or whatever not not
anymore but in the old days
and I think that's not very healthy I
mean I guess it's fine for people to be
doing that but there should be people
doing the more general things and I
think there aren't those people I'm not
exactly sure how to fix that I think if
I were training people now which I've
thought about trying to do
I actually think a really broad
engineering education would be really
useful in terms of what's possible if I
look at what we do you know the projects
I just mentioned there's a lot to do
with sensing and the physics of sensing
and cameras light and all that there's
probably a lot of mechanical engineering
that goes into robotics it's all
relevant I mean you can't do robotics
you're gonna kill people so you need to
solve that problem too and for all those
things they're pretty and
interdisciplinary if you look at what
really goes on to make the advances
I'm not saying everybody needs to be
interdisciplinary but there needs to be
at least enough people to figure out
which things are practical and possible
and I actually think you got great
research out of those things I had a lot
of debates I remember at Stanford us
saying well you know photographing the
world it's a pretty good research
problem they said no it's not very
interesting too practical we don't want
to work on that and then they started
getting into it and they figured out
they could do different kinds of
projections so that you could you know
see streets they look realistic but
actually you can see everything there's
just all sorts of research problems that
go into that how do you stitch the 3d
geometry so I make this stuff real I
mean there's tons of great research that
can be done in that computer graphics
Orang have many other areas so anyway I
just the other I guess main complaints
about not doing things that could really
change the world people say is that oh
you know I'm gonna fails too hard you
know I don't want to work on AI a real
AI because you know people have worked
on it before and they didn't succeed you
know and I might fail doing it and
that's true but in my experience you
know we had a group working on Cori I
for a while and they actually came up
with our hats targeting system by
accident which we make roughly half our
money from the the system that goes from
reading web pages to figuring out what
they're really about now as a side
effect of that that seems like a pretty
good side effect actually distracted
them enough they never built AI not that
I'm complaining too much about that but
my experience with these things is
that's how they end up like they often
don't succeed at the really big goal
that's not
but if people are really ambitious about
trying to do something big
they always achieve something
interesting they always attract really
smart people or working really hard and
something good comes out of that and I
think if you look at any ambitious
projects you see that then the power
projects a lot of the materials we use
that are exotic
no still are from that project right you
know they obviously we don't have a
space industry but we do have all the
side effects of that okay so I guess
I'll just maybe switch topics a little
bit I want to say that I guess I want to
spend just a few minutes talking about
AI specifically I think that's a great
area for people to work on and I don't
understand why they don't work on it
um I think you know nowadays well I'll
just start with a kind of a supposition
first were first I believe that when we
have a I will be kind of shocked at how
simple it is and what I mean by that is
I think most people who are working in
AI think that you know they're gonna
stand at the whiteboard for you know 50
years and then eventually they'll get
some key insights that produce AI you
know there'll be a you know whatever
hundred whiteboards that explain how it
works or something like that I think
they'll be like one or two whiteboards
and a whole lot of work more scale than
really being smart oh and that's just a
supposition but I have some data it's
kind of back it up one is that you're
human you know the human genome
compressed is about 600 megabytes which
is smaller than all our modern operating
systems by a pretty large factor and it
has to describe all of your physical
attributes and we know there's lots of
other animals that don't have big brains
that have similar sized genomes I hand
Solon so I think the amount of code
that's in your genome to describe your
brain is probably small part of the
whole code even from a physical point of
view and the software part of that's
probably even smaller if there really is
a large operating system that's booting
your brain is probably not that big I
mean sort of argues against
really complicated algorithms that we
fundamentally wouldn't understand
that makes you smart the other argument
is well we you know we tried it and have
failed and that argument yeah I remember
my dad Nash worked on artificial
intelligence and you know I was actually
here at Stanford when I was like six
when they were working on that stuff you
know the computers we had at that time
were like Commodore 64 computers you
know they had 64 K of memory and you
know you've got you know in your pockets
you have a much much bigger computer now
and you know it seems comical now that
you try to build AI on a machine that
can't store a high-resolution image
right but that's when it happened and
that's when a lot of that work was done
um so I guess I just I actually think
it's probably a lot easier than people
think to do make progress in those areas
and I also think if I was doing research
I'd love to do it here in that area
because nobody else is doing it there's
no competition you know I'd love if you
guys can tell me people who really
ambitious to work in me I'd love to know
but I can't seem to find any and I
actually try really hard to get people
to work on it here or to and it's given
me all sorts of reasons why they can't
do it um but I know you're not going to
succeed if you're not doing it that's
pretty clear pretty clear thing I think
I've covered most of the things I wanted
to say I also just thought I'd mention
quickly the singularity University which
is going on right now which we had a
little bit of a we gave him a little bit
of help to get it going
it's running at our NASA Ames but the
passion I've been getting very positive
reports about its but it's kind of
related to the topics I was talking
about because what they're basically
trying to do is figure out what are the
really big discontinuities that can
happen in technology you know things
like AI you know if it happened it's
obviously kind of a singularity you go
through that point and you come out in a
different way
oh and I think that's they've also
gotten a lot of young people involved as
students and then sort of a more
experienced people extra in them and so
on but I think it's so interesting model
and it seems to be doing quite a bit of
an excitement in this general area and I
think the people coming out of that kind
of program
I'll have a lot of knowledge about
computer science possibilities there and
other technology areas that are
interesting I think that's maybe a good
model for higher education to take on
more seriously finally I just wanted to
mention a little bit about Chrome OS I
thought it was an interesting topic to
maybe just few words about what we're
thinking about why we did it one of the
things we noticed was interesting even a
couple years ago we'd walk around when
we're having a meeting and everyone have
their laptops and we're just looking at
what programs they were running but even
a few years ago they about half the
people would only be running a browser I
always thought that's pretty interesting
you know you have this whole computer
that's you know supposedly doing
complicated things for you you're
basically running a browser and if you
look at the history of molasses I guess
you know UNIX just had its 40th birthday
which is amazing and basically now all
operating systems we use are really
derivatives of that right I mean
actually there's article in nature I'm
somebody one of you guys gave to me
that's very funny they said they wrote
it and like I think they wrote the
initial version in a couple of weeks
that was a really good use of time by
the way obviously it was very very smart
a couple of weeks to get that initial
version out and it's affected all of us
a lot right and in both positive and
negative ways but I think it's good
thing you know it's periodically start
fresh and try to make things simpler and
make things really work
I'm still astounded and all the stuff we
launched you know is not instant I mean
if you look at the computers that we
have and how fast they are and things
like that and we've had a tremendous
amount of software bloat and one of the
things I've been trying to get our teams
to do is just has to meet kind of the
minimal the how do I say this the
theoretical minimum for how long
something would take to do on a computer
and if you sort of look at you know your
common tasks you're doing or whatever
you know the theoretical mins for those
are very very low for us you know we're
running these big services like Gmail
and things like
you know we're well above the
theoretical minimum but we're not a
thousand times above it because we're
actually you know we're running that
service for the whole world and we need
to be pretty efficient I imagine most
things you do on your PC you know are
easily a thousand times above the
theoretical minimum now and I think it's
just a variety about software
development techniques and layers on
layers and layers that have caused that
but there's a great study a while ago
that went up on stats where someone
tested Microsoft Word on a Mac plus with
a hard drive and Windows Vista and the
Mac post with the hard drive was
actually faster for a lot of common
operations like checking pages and stuff
like that
other than the machine running Vista and
you know obviously the current version
does more stuff most of those things you
don't use most the time I mean there's
certainly a software engineering way to
make that run faster for the 99% of the
common things you do we've just been
lazy about that so I think part of the
reason why we're more interested in this
area is I just do think there's
tremendous opportunity you look at the
very low cost you know best buy you can
buy tons of $300 laptops right now they
run for five hours you know that machine
is a pretty nice machine it clearly
could run the basic things you do now
instantly oh and we'd like to make that
really work and so that's kind of how
we're thinking about it I think you know
I have a bunch of computers I'd like to
have more computers but I can't maintain
them you know they're always asking me
things like do you want to install there
is for that sir and you know you find
actually I think my limits about five
computers and then all of my time goes
into administering them and I can't do
anything and I think the computer
industry hasn't really gotten this but
you know if you made it really really
easy and seamless to have computers I'd
have a lot of $300 computers right I
mean your your computer in your chair
would roughly be the same cost right so
you might as well have a computer at
every chair which we don't do now but we
would do I think if we had had operating
systems that worked well so that's kind
of very high level kind of things were
thinking about application installation
is also
and obviously if you have a lab model
that works well you that comes without
installation which is really nice and
you're gonna hear more about that with
the Native Client stuff they're going to
talk about so um I wanna leave a little
time for questions and discussion so I
think just in closing you know we'd love
to work with all of you more I think one
of the things I didn't talk about is
that we grew up you know as part of with
with marks off to us as 95% of machines
or 97% of machines probably when I was
growing up in the university um and we
didn't like that world you know I think
as computer scientists it's a pretty bad
world to live in where you know you're
right trying to write software for
everybody in it's in a closed system you
can't change it you can't understand
what's going on it's generally sucky so
I think you know we we grew up with the
open source alternative to that really
you know in Linux and so on and we
really liked that model and we liked the
model where the core things that you're
using every day are really hoping and
modifiable you know can be studied by
you all and improved and all that and I
think that's really a great thing and
I'm really excited about you know us
being successful and really pushing
those models forward in the real way
that was the other thing I was gonna say
so I'd like to work with all you you
know ology more and them without I mean
be open up for questions comments yeah
so by interesting coincidence as I was
packing to come down here in my mailbox
popped up a message from the FF saying
bug Google about keeping book searches
private and making sure that you know
keep records of what books I searched so
keep my book searches private and what
do you have to say about that yes we'll
do that I mean I think there was a
little bit crazy I know they were home I
mean I liked the FF Lots but I think
they're a little bit crazy on this one
but we don't have a released product or
I mean I they're worried about the
history of people checking our library
books and all
laws protecting those and everything and
I think so in terms of the issues we
actually face on a practical basis I
don't think that's the biggest issue by
far probably the biggest issue I would
say they should be working on which they
are working on is to really if you right
now a store your email on your machine
has different protections than if you
store it in the cloud at Google and I
think that's clearly a mistake we have
some good laws for data protection on
your individual equipment but it doesn't
apply to cloud-based things and I think
that's clearly just oversight and allows
we need to get those changed but in
terms of your privacy that's a really
big issue because you tend to have email
and other you know even if you store
your email PGP encrypted on your own
machine they know you've sent everybody
else's so other questions yeah in the
back hi Larry we know each other from
Willow and I couldn't agree more on all
the robotic stuff glad to hear that word
early and often but I could show my
questions about AI so for those of us
who jump ship from AI and went into
robotics machine vision machine learning
you name it natural language speech so
the question is do you go to which guy
do you go to triple AI you know what
what is the AI you're asking for because
I can imagine a lot of AI people people
would think they're AI saying we're
doing that we're doing that now and so
that's I'm not among them but what do
you think oh yeah sorry I didn't explain
what I thought you should do yeah I just
forgot oh the I I do think that we have
the web now which is a really great
training ground I mean I don't know if
you gave a you know baby growing up the
way I but nothing else whether they be
smart or not it'd certainly be deranged
in some way there's an awful lot of
information there and I think yeah and
it's kind of a practical sort and so on
that we haven't had in the past so I
guess I'm a believer in the relatively
dumb algorithms like a whole lot of data
a school of thought and I think you know
you have relatively simple learning
algorithms and the entire web and a lot
of compute power like
a lot you know tens of thousand
computers or a hundred thousand
computers I think you have a real chance
of making a go with that that's hard
thing to do in academia in general and
so I mean but we're we're interesting
working on and working on it with people
but I think you're gonna have to do
something hard in in terms of scale how
to make it work I mean you're just not
going to be smart unless you have that
scale and I think you're asking her
about our machine translation stuff I
mean that's been a tremendous insight
there is just you know be smart about
your algorithms have good good
algorithms but then you got to have a
ton of parallel text in order to train
those so you can do translation and I
don't think AI is gonna be any different
you know kids kids take you know
whatever 12 years to boot up kind of and
so if even if you add enough if you if
you had as much computation as a
person's had which is probably you know
10,000 computers or more I mean you can
look at the estimates but it's a lot of
compute then you know if you did it the
same way a person those you're gonna
have to run for you ran your software
running on 10,000 computers for 15 years
and then you'll get to see whether it's
succeeded or not now I think you can do
better than that if you're engineering
it obviously but I don't think people
are thinking that way I think they're
thinking much more I'm gonna be really
smart on my whiteboard and somehow I'm
gonna invent a high and I just don't
think that's going to happen yeah the
blogs this week are going crazy about
Apple's latest stuff and there's like a
lot of people saying I'm moving to
Android right away the only problem is
if it's not quite as smooth so what I'm
asking myself is get this extremely
disciplined authoritative organization
which puts out great user interfaces
very smooth things Android is going to
be the open systems equivalent but how
can you compete on the sort of polish oh
yeah those are good questions I think
you know the Android Android spend kind
of one version behind iPhone so if you
look at it
you know got released kind of one
version behind and I think you know I I
just got new software the right before I
came here on my phone which has a bunch
of improvements on it so I think it's
just a matter of time and I think we're
doing quite a good job I mean I really
enjoy using my Android it's my oh my
phone
it works really well for me so I think
we're getting I think we're getting
there and I should one of the things is
this hardware that were I think it's
gonna be released in the u.s. very soon
it's already released in Europe but this
is a great phone like it's really light
it has them has a really great display
you know that's basically a lot of the
same hardware from the previous film but
it's much thinner doesn't have a
keyboard which is a disadvantage for
typing but advantage for everything else
and this I think the harbor's she's also
getting to version 2 on the hardware
really helps but I'm really excited
about it we've seen tremendous uptake of
the Android devices we have huge numbers
of apps in the environment there and a
lot of them that aren't on iphone I
think our development model is gonna be
easier and better you can actually run
things in the background for example
which is really nice I'm very optimistic
about it so I have a follow-up question
on that over here oh sorry
Katherine McKinley UT Austin so you
pointed out that you'd have many more
than five computers if you could keep
them all running but that you only had
one phone so so is one prediction of the
future is that we're going to move to
one universal device and then that
that'll be our computer and our phone
and everything are and run our
refrigerator remotely so how do you view
Google as fitting into that vision of
the future and do you think it's true I
think you want to have a lot of hardware
I mean I think is amazing at how cheap
displays are gonna go and you know I
think about this like you know I don't
understand why I have an alarm clock
like why don't I just how
like a little LCD next to my ballot or
something so I think if you go and look
at yeah I'd like consumer electronics so
you go to the Consumer Electronics Show
and you walk four miles and you see all
the devices that are being produced I
think it's not you don't want all these
special-purpose devices that's why we
have computers but right now our notion
of a computer is like you know it's only
very recently become a phone that we
have a real computer on here right which
i think is very powerful thing but most
things that aren't you know a laptop or
a desktop or a netbook are not computers
and there's tons and tons of other
things that you would like to be real
computers that aren't and you know all
those gadgets that you have that have
LCDs and input/output and all that I
think all those things should move to
real computers at some point so you can
get the generality um so I asked use
having many many many more devices and
for the world becoming I mean this is
the kind of HDI thing you know where you
have the you know you have surfaces you
can interact with and all those things
I mean maybe you'll also get it directly
projected into your eyes you don't need
the displays anywhere oh you just have a
virtual version of that yeah and there's
lots of ways to do that one of the
things I didn't mention actually which I
have on my list is the input/output what
I think is a huge issue from people to
computers if you just think about it
right now if I want to like input text
you know 100 words per minute or some
relatively slow rate yeah I can only do
that if I'm like sitting down or not
same sort of awkwardly holding my laptop
and then I can only type with one hand
much slower and if I'm using a phone
like I have to use my eyes to you know
if I'm using a touchscreen and then
you're tying up my eyes which means I
can't drive which is obviously a problem
and so I just think in general like the
input/output we have is just
tremendously bad I mean the inputs
especially I mean I think that would be
a great area of people to work on too
because I want to be able to walk around
and type or input text or something they
say oh you can use speech but you know
that's going to be tough to do a noisy
environment stuff to do privately so I'm
not going to do that all the time
so the United stuff away
that doesn't involve that and I think
most of the user interfaces we've built
are just horrendous I mean yeah that's
my background is incubator interaction I
looked for real
researchers in that area and I found
like to write I go to CMU or I go to
Stanford right at that time and I think
that's an area that just hasn't got
enough investment I mean I see these
guys making cars that are guaranteed to
kill people yeah you produce the car in
a fist it used to be simple buttons that
you could memorize where they are and
they replace it with something that
requires your eyes that's just not a
good plan so the state of the art is
terrible it's a great area to do
research and it's hugely impactful yeah
so I think we may have to make this our
last question we talked in the talk we
heard this morning we mentioned that
Jacqueline fuller mentioned that you and
the other surgery and the CEO had a
great interest in energy I was just
wondering if you could share with us
your vision for Google wants to work at
energy and the research issues in that
area yeah yeah I think I gave him a
pretty good summary of the first part of
my talk when I was talking about just
people aren't working on things that can
really change the world it's true in
energy too and it was kind of surprising
there's a lot of people for example
doing we have interested in solar
thermal energy it's just really just
mirrors and heating stuff and you know
there's a lot of people working that
area there's a lot of startups there's a
lot of funding and if you know those
people and you say like you know can you
make energy competitive with coal using
solar thermal they will say yes yes we
think we can do that yes them are you
working on that and they will say no
absolutely not and the reason is that
plenty of people are willing to buy
large amounts for a start-up but small
amounts compared to the world demand of
energy at a high price it's California
will buy you know solar energy at you
know three times the price it will buy a
coal energy at and so those startups are
busy serving that demand and so part of
what we've tried to do is find the
people who are really trying to make
breakthrough kind of things like
you know are you building a system that
could be competitive with coal from a
cost basis you want to design that now
and start working on it
and obviously if you can do it you'll be
successful the problem is you can do
something much less ambitious and still
be successful in terms of having a great
company and an IPO we can't have a scale
problem we're not interested in fixing
the world problem with carbon you know
those companies are interested in being
great startups and being billion-dollar
companies you need a hundred billion or
five hundred billion dollars flippin
either and we're not working on that so
we're losing time so we've just saw in a
lot of these areas we can make small
investments and get people working on
that stuff now and it'll happen couple
years earlier than it would otherwise
happen we looked at this in geothermal
say you know intuitively if you drill
deep anywhere on the earth you get tons
of heat so is anyone looking at that
problem you say well there's lots of
people drilling they're all drilling for
oil more or less and oil is 100 about
$100 of the barrel and the issues were
drilling for oil are pretty different
and the issues were drilling for heat
and you know again we tried to identify
some people working on that we found
like 10 people we gave him a few million
dollars and they actually have money now
and they didn't before so pretty much
any areas like this I see it's the same
argument I was making before nobody's
working on the ambitious stuff there's
no lack in money for those people in
general because people realize that
they're being ambitious and they need
relatively modest amounts of money and
so we're trying to make that happen
quicker that's that's really been our
approach all right maybe take one more
and then we'll finish up I know I'm
making you guys late hi and I'm digital
from Oregon so actually I come from a
semantic web and AI community really
many guys like this question so I think
the tradition a I has a for example
ology based systems the major problem is
scalability you cannot do really large
size reasoning is not not of instance
even Semantic Web idea I think if you
think about a web scale reasoning that
would
a headache so I'm not sure how much
semantics or semantics candle of
computing and search and reasoning
Google singing about for example if if
we research a keyword right now just
that a keyword even cannot do this
synonym I think if we add little more
then we can get a more interesting with
that you know search it yourself so
that's my question yeah I mean I think
you you know the kind of chicken and egg
thing I think until you're working on
things that are large like none of the
things we're doing we'll work on large
things so I think he's it's just kind of
just you need to decide that you're
gonna do things that are big and
impactful and then you'll have some
chance of doing them and I think a lot
of the algorithms people are using don't
scale to those scales but that's also
probably why they're not working but
again I would really you know if I if I
had to Beth what would happen when we
have AI which will eventually happen
right you can debate how many years
decades centuries
it'll happen and but it's will happen
eventually I would bet that it's
relatively simple to explain and
somebody went through a tremendous
amount of effort to really make it scale
me that's just my experience with all
these problems is it's not it's not that
there's so much inspiration it's like a
lot of hard work if you want to make an
automated car it's not that there's just
a lot of fundamental things you don't
know how to do is that you need to
really make those sensors work you know
and they've got to be really good
probably better than your eyes or
whatever that's difficult thing they
ought to work in rain I mean there's
just a lot of issues so I'm not the
practical issues of getting things to
work or I'd say 99% just hard work and I
think there's a bias against that in the
research community which i think is
hurting you all so with that thank you
