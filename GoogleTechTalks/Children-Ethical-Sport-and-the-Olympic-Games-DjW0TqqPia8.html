afternoon my name is anita de france i'm
very pleased to be here today i was
invited by your colleague Robert to
speak with you aha we have some more
folks coming great great I have the
wonderful job of being president of la
84 which is the legacy of the 1984
olympic games we are endowed with 93
million dollars from those very
successful games that was forty percent
of the legacy of the surplus rather and
I spent all that money you know why not
and I spent it to make sure that kids
had the best experience with sports that
we could provide we do that foundation
does that by providing grants to youth
sports organizations and we realized
early on that money was not necessarily
the only thing that you need it and we
realized that people needed to have a
good understanding of how to coach so we
teach people how to coach and for the
last 10 years we've had a virtual
library we're very proud of it includes
a whole world of history on the Olympic
movement on the history of sports we
have all of the official reports from
the olympic games on this side and i
think one a few sites to say that we
have where the only place where all of
the official reports reside and that's
on our site so we're 24 7 365 on the
Olympic movement we have the Olympic
reviews which is the history of the
olympic games themselves now I'm into
sports because I believe that sports
blogs to us as human beings I've never
seen another species set up hurdles and
hop across those hurdles to see you and
get there first I've seen an act crawl
into a twig to get across the puddle of
water but never seen them line up those
twigs to raise across it so it's
something that we as human beings do and
if it's ours it belongs to everybody and
me it's been very important to make sure
that all young folks have accessed
sports and all of us oldsters oh I
forgot to tell you I am an Olympian and
I had the chance to row in one of those
big twigs with eight other people I was
a rower in the nineteen seventy six
games and living in the Olympic Village
changed my life why is the Olympic
Village so special to me because it's a
it's a community of very successful
people everyone there has been
successful they've been selected by
their country to be there and it's a
remarkable thing to live in such a
community the community had all sizes
shapes every skin color and both sexes
and that means if we could do it for
three weeks or four weeks we can
certainly do it for a lifetime in part
then my life is being been dedicated to
this idea that people can learn through
sport that sport is a powerful force in
society as a powerful force for change
the question I had to put when I told
Rob I was going to talk today was how is
it that I can be involved with getting
kids interested in sports with all the
ethical issues that have been put to us
about sports and how will that affect
the Olympic movement since i'm a member
of the International Olympic Committee
which is like the board of directors of
the Olympic movement and it's important
to me that kids have access to sport
because of all the things that can do
for them it's immediate access to
community for girls to be able to take
part at a team sport you learn that you
don't have to be alone you learn that
you don't have to work with only your
very best friends you learn that you can
reach out others and most importantly
you learn that you can ask for help and
that lesson is really important and it's
going to be important for these next
year's in this whole world so I want to
make sure that everyone has access to it
now what about doping what about drugs i
like to say no dopes in sport
because it's a terrible thing some
people posit that well why not let
people use whatever it is there are lots
of reasons to not do that first of all
we want especially in the Olympic
movement we want sport to be safe and
fair we don't want people to die
competing at the Olympic Games and too
often these drugs which athletes take
you have no idea what you're really
taking you know supplements there's no
control quality control on supplements
so if you're taking supplements or if
you're taking drugs that are special
designer drugs even god only knows
what's going to happen ten years down
the road if you're taking some designer
drug it's just unreasonable to ask for
someone to take those risks you may have
heard that people there's been research
taken so supposedly in Olympians or
high-level athletes will say yes to the
question if you take this if you take
this supplement you're guaranteed to win
a gold medal but you'll be dead in ten
years will you take it well that test
has never been replicated I think that
someone just made up that idea and it
sounds like of course they'd say yes but
it's not true it's not true we just the
LA for foundation data just finished a
survey and results are on our website
I'll do a little commercial for la la 84
foundation orgy we did a study with high
school students in southern calif in
that CI southern section of the
California Interscholastic Federation to
ask what they thought about doping to
ask if they were using drugs we asked
them if they were using drugs we asked
if they thought their teammates were
using drugs and we asked them if they
thought their opponents were using drugs
well only 1% self reported that they
were using drugs they felt that ten
percent of their colleagues might be
their own teammates might be but they
thought twenty percent of their
opponents
possibly using it they also said a
sixty-five percent of them said it would
be okay to have testing in high school
which is very interesting I think now it
wasn't a huge sample and we're going to
continue to ask these questions it's the
third and of our approaches as a
foundation to ask about doping we have
held a conference back in nineteen way
back in nineteen eighty eight on doping
and we have one in the mid-90s and we
produced a book on it and we want people
to know what's wrong with it it's
because it's not safe by the way there's
still one winner per metal regardless of
what you do so isn't it better to be
able to sleep what's happening in the
Olympic movement do I think that every
athlete is is taking drugs no I was one
who did not although I know for sure
among my competitors that happened
because I competed in the days of the
East Germans where there was
state-sponsored doping and every time I
look at that race we come in third but
how you know it's like I know that I did
the best I could on that day the very
best today yeah they're people are
taking drugs and again we don't know
what their future will be based on using
these drugs that are not for use for a
healthy people there for people who are
not healthy and it's a shame I think
that they're cowards and cheats they've
stolen something they've stolen
something from their cells if you can
steal from yourself if still in their
own integrity they've stolen from the
other athletes the opportunity to be
successful as a with with the integrity
and that's why in my sport and rowing we
used to have a life bad you were God if
you were caught doping one time but with
the international the world anti-doping
code we had to have rules that were
modified
that folks who made a living in their
sport could make a mistake if you
consider it that and still be able to
work in their sport so I've given you
kind of a flavor of things an arc of
getting into sport sport being something
that belongs to us all the issues that
were faced with and the fact that the
Olympic Games are very important and I
can tell you if you ever have a chance
to go to the Olympic Village and live
there you work with a lot of successful
people here so that gives you a little
bit of a glimpse of what it's like to
live in that community and know that
people from all over the world right now
every morning about 10,500 athletes get
up I hope brush their teeth prepare for
their day with the intention of
competing starting on august eighth of
2008 the opening ceremonies will be at
8pm in Beijing and their story will be
told before the entire world that's what
will happen in just a few months
I thought I would just give you that
flavor and then open the floor for any
questions that you might have I find
that people have much more interesting
questions then I've heard myself speak
before anyway so I would like to learn
from you what you would care to hear
about yes sir up two questions one is
the desert bones views work normally
terms of use five men than women and is
use on the rise or use the perception of
you so arrive at some questions I'm not
sure I can answer either of them I don't
know my hope is that most athletes are
smart enough to realize that they are
going to get caught they may not get
caught at the time as we found out
recently they're caught afterwards and
those who don't get caught have to live
with the fact that it wasn't fair that
they use something that they cheated I
don't think that it's on the rise I
think that because of the exposure of
those who've been cheating it's it's
clear that it's tougher to get away with
it for those who are out in that very
sharp edge that they believe it might be
okay to cheat it's less likely now we've
gone to what's called no notice
out-of-competition testing part of the
problem before and the reason the state
dope state-sponsored doping could happen
was the testing was only done the
olympic games because that's the only
time the ilc had control and the ilc was
the only group that was testing so now
we have no notice out-of-competition
testing so we can surprise someone and
that's a better way to control doping
then you know you really do expect an
athlete who's cheating to figure out
that if you're still cheating when you
get to the competition there's a much
higher
probability that you'll kick off so you
cycle off when you find a way that you
get to use you get the benefit of the
doping which for steroids means that you
can train more you recover faster it
means that you can do a whole lot more
work and be better able to maintain that
level of work so that when you're no
longer taking the steroids you continue
to have that benefit and that's what was
happening so I can can't say whether it
is or is not more my hope is that it's
less than we're doing everything
possible to make sure that it is less
prevalent than before
ok
because you are on the ilc and you talk
just a little bit about what it's like
to be Europe you're a woman on the IOC
near the US Rep I mean I've seen here in
town and I have seen kind of what that
perspective is how how how did that work
a little bit of a mystery I think about
you know whatever well it's it's a group
of people who meet once a year we come
from about seventy six different nations
and the age i think the youngest member
now might be around 30 and the oldest
member now might be 80 and remember we
had our oldest member oh no my oldest
members about 87 and that's a lot of
history and the oldest member was an
Olympian in water pole actually from
Brazil I was swimming or water polo and
he was subsequently he was president of
FIFA and was a part of the great growth
of international soccer what is it like
I was the side of fourths I think I was
the fourth woman elected to the IOC we
now have 16 women who serve on the IOC
what it's like is a group of people who
are volunteers who care about this very
high-profile event the Olympic Games who
have opinions and we have a kind of a
protocol where you sit on the basis of
your election so i might be i do sit
sometimes next to Prince Albert of
Monaco and then the crown prince of the
Netherlands it's a few rows behind me
because he was elected long after I was
and that's how we get along because it's
based on protocol order we're all peers
and we all have different life
experiences my life experience is vastly
different from the members I've just
mentioned and the wonderful thing is our
mission is and our responsibility is to
ensure that the Olympic Games
indoor and flourish it's very important
the best part about being an ioc member
is the fact that we get to present the
Olympic medals and there's nothing
better than presenting a metal and
saying to the person you shall forever
be known as first an Olympic champion
and you know that's just the best of all
they of course don't remember me but
it's a real thrill for me to be able to
do that I certainly didn't know actually
a team ice the teammates said to me you
know i need if we win a medal the Lord
is going to give it to us divine
province that's really good I appreciate
that she said no you nitwit the
president of the IOC Lord kaladan
respect the meadows okay that's good as
long as we're across the line in time to
win a medal but it's a really great
privilege to be able to do that and we
are the only ones who are allowed to
make that presentation so what's it's
like it's unlike anything else in the
world and we get to do it for a long
time
average place ever
yeah it's a terrible thing to have taken
that away from others you asked if you
automatically go to the second there's
an interesting case that's presented
because track and field in for the two
thousand games the track and field
Federation have did not have a rule that
automatically disqualified the whole
team if one member was found guilty of
doping yeah they put that in place later
in my sport one person is doped even if
it's the Cox'n and the whole boat is
gone but in that sport that was not the
rule which is why the men's team who had
someone who competed in the in two
thousand in the early rounds who was
found guilty of doping so the metal his
metal was removed but the rest of the
team kept their medals now this time
around there's a desire to you know make
take a position and say well that's
wrong that might have been the rule then
but to me now my lawyer hat goes on
which I don't usually let out of the bag
that I have an attorney but I can't help
myself the athletes competing then had
no knowledge that if one member are to
whether the rule was there wasn't a room
that if you won your metal in the team
event and someone on the team was found
guilty it was silent
so that I'm sure what the women the rest
of the women on the team now if it were
an individual event then yes it
automatically goes to the next person
and now the International Federation has
fix that rule so that if one person is
found guilty of doping then the whole
team loses the metal as different person
in soccer for example the rule is that
there have to be three people on the
team who were found guilty of doping
before the metals removed so it's
different and I come from sport where
again we had zero tolerance and we just
did something very remarkable the the
the Russian national federation in
rowing had had I see how many I don't
want to exaggerate I guess seven doping
cases within a year and we have a rule
that if you have more than four you
might get banned the Federation might be
banned and we just banned them for a
year so none of the officials can take
part in the sport and it's you say well
is that fair what happens to junior
rowers and how about the Olympic team
well it's up to them to develop a
federation or an organization that can
enter the teams but none of the people
who are part of the Federation officials
coaches none of those folks can do
anything can be a part of any of the
rowing Federation's activities for a
year we're serious no dokes in our sport
that's really important and that's the
only way we can can tell people and let
a fleet snow that we're very serious
about letting them have a safe and fair
chance to compete yeah this'll be
reviewed Buffalo bit more about ways to
get kids interested in sports
all right or not they all have to be
Olympians I believe that there'll be
great citizens we're doing a lot to do
that one of the things we have fun that
we created an organization called kids
and sports and what we do is we go into
parts of the city where there are not
sports organizations and we teach the
volunteers we teach the adults how to
manage a team and then we provide them
with the education the coaching the
structure and the uniforms so that the
kids have a good experience and that's
been a going for 12 years now and each
year about 9,000 kids have that
opportunity what we need is more
volunteers we need more volunteers
because there are lots of kids out there
and what we hope is that when we say
that we need a volunteer people raise
their hand and say it's okay it's a
wonderful thing especially because we'll
make sure you know what you're doing it
can be uncomfortable you know it used to
be that you get a clipboard and a
whistle and expect to be able to coach
well that doesn't work very well so you
we will guarantee you that you have
education where do you go there are lots
of organizations out there now there I
know that we're working with the middle
schools we just started a program with
the middle schools last year we had we
were in seven middle schools in the LA
Unified School District this year I
guess this month well we're going to be
at 82 of the middle schools all the
middle schools in LA Unified and 20
parochial schools so if you are close to
a middle school and you want to help you
just let the principal know that you're
interested in helping pick a sport
that's what I did I started out by
volunteering in my favorite sport which
was of course not surprisingly rowing
and through that I had more and more
responsibilities over the years and
wound up where I wound up but it really
starts with volunteering and picking a
sport that you're willing to learn about
and be there for kids there are lots of
other programs you can come to our
website or call our library and we'll
help you get hooked up with programs
thank you that's important question
I exhale up Madrid League remain
talked about what would be great to see
also foods be yellow I so I'm going to
ask you what would it take to get the
generic question could be was it take
for a sport to become a little bit game
and what would it take for ultimate
frisbee to become one of the game okay
well those fortunately are two separate
questions so let's let's talk about the
process for being a sport getting on the
program of the game's first of all it
has to happen 10 years in advance of the
games I'm sorry seven years in advance
of the games we select the side of games
seven years in advance so last year we
selected the site for the 2014 olympic
winter games and a 2009 will select the
site for the 2016 olympic games so
that's another interesting thing about
being an ioc member we're
future-oriented the beijing games are
over as far as we're concerned we've
moved on so anyway seven years you have
to be prepared and if you're nowadays
I'm very pleased to say that you have to
be a sport that has both women and men
competing in in it which is a rather new
part of what how we view the world so if
it's if it was if the primary if the men
are primary that it has to be in I
believe four continents of the world and
I forget right i think it's 75 countries
have to be active in it I think that's
the number and for women's sports it has
to be in three continents and 50
countries it has to be active and again
that you have to prove this up in the
years leading up to the seven years
before and it's really hard to do we
unfortunately took two sports off the
program for after the Beijing Games and
that's really unfortunate because they
were a baseball and softball yeah so
they will be conducted in Beijing but
they're working hard now so that they
can be put back on the program and the
interesting thing was although we took
them off
we didn't put any sports on and that was
very interesting and very disappointing
for the sports who were proposed there
were forced four or five sports proposed
as eligible to go on to the games and
the IOC did not select any of those to
go forward which is hopeful hopeful fact
for baseball and softball why not
baseball and softball baseball had the
issue with doping which now the whole
world knows that the IOC was serious
about the fact that baseball had issues
with doping and secondly they didn't
have the best athletes and the deal for
the Olympic Games is you have to have
your best athletes at those games which
is the case with tennis with basketball
because at the end of the day after
you've trained and you compete who wants
to go home saying well I was gold
medalist but you know the really good
athletes and that sport weren't allowed
to come because they were just too good
it makes no sense you want to compete
against the best athletes in your sport
so that was a problem also for
BASEketball now for softball the only
issue was that in the alphabetic came
after baseball and it was all thought to
be a truly us board now that's not fair
but that is one view the other problem
was it was not viewed as having enough
national federations in it so they are
working very hard to solve that problem
that was the only problem they you know
there are no dopes and that sets forth
they had no positive doping tests and
they have the best athletes that go to
the Olympic Games so it's a political
process there is room right now because
the Charter now says that's our guiding
document the Olympic Charter says that
we should have
at least 25 perhaps it still sits 15
we're going to change it so I'll say
twenty-five sports and not more than 27
so there's not a lot of room then there
I was a 28 maybe 28 all of this you'll
find on the website under Olympic org it
is not the most intuitive website let me
tell you as I have trouble with it and
if I have trouble with you might need
your spine with it but it's a bit of a
challenge sometimes so so the other
question I have is about what we take
for the AA that's your high ultimate
frisbee well you have to have an
international federation and you have to
prove that there is only one
international federation and that you
control all of the sport you have to
prove that you have adopted all of the
the anti-doping rules you have to have
Federation's again in the number of
countries i mentioned and all those
countries have to have you know the
whole structure of the sport you have to
have rules which as I understand and
ultimate frisbee is one thing that's
really not so much a part of it you know
there have to be standardized rules and
put it that way and I think ultimate
frisbee as I know it there's a little
more freeform than most of the other
sports oh okay educate so those are the
primary things you have to show that
there is an organization there so that
people you know kids can grow up and
wish to be Olympians and ultimate
frisbee so there has to be of there
there
so see you in 20 30 20 or 30 nada yes
question of all the aspects here my
other thing is that supposed to be
accurate not very professional so what's
balance here how do you survive handy
well here's a question if they're
amateurs what the heck are they doing
how are they surviving how do they live
and the same issue I have with with the
athletes in in the colleges here why is
it that athletes cannot earn a living
from what they do so in order to keep it
more fair it's not fair life is not fair
but in some countries the athletes were
completely taken care of in our country
there is no there is no Department of
Sport there is no minister of sport but
it because it's all done pretty much
through education but it's all done in
the private sector in this country in
other countries it's a part of the the
government to provide sports to folks so
to make since we're dealing with 205
national olympic committees 205 that's
more than that a number that belong of
countries that belong to the UN we
decided that the best way to do it was
to have the best athletes and if a
national epic committee provides support
to those athletes it's okay if they
don't it's okay to the ioc provides
support provides a lot of support
through what we call them exalted arity
to help athletes train will support
athletes who are promising athletes will
help them train and we had many of those
athletes actually win medals so you have
to have some kind of support you can't
live in this world without someone
binding way for you to eat and sleep and
train now I don't believe that you
should only do that there are some
situations where that's pretty much what
they do
I think it's important because I know
that the springs go at some point you're
not going to be able to take parts for
it all your life at the high level so
you need to have something else and
that's becoming more of a problem
because a lot of athletes today seem to
be focusing so heavily just imagine if
you were you graduated from college and
you put the next eight years focus on
competing in the Olympic Games so you've
lost eight years from progress against
the other students who graduate in your
class and now you're going to go back
into an industry if you hadn't had ties
with something during those eight years
it's going to be really tough catch up
with your peers so we're working to make
sure that athletes don't isolate
themselves in the world of sport in
rowing I knew that was not going to be
my future so I was busy going to law
school and become an attorney what I was
training yes mentioned going in days
long
report allegations that came out had
done
yeah well it's it's a problem for the
sport and I imagine that some of the
there's a group called shoot where they
called forgetting the name I forgotten
the name is terrible but they're
statisticians who care deeply about the
sport and I imagine that they could do
research and look at the rise of all the
injuries and how you know athletes were
on the disabled list far more frequently
over the last 15 years I think you'll
see that it will probably shadow the
rise of the use of these
performance-enhancing drugs in the
instance of steroids they put a huge
huge weight load load on on the Collies
the joints joints in the tendons you're
naturally not going to carry that much
bulk and so what happens you get injured
much more frequently and much more often
in the case i will not name names that's
up to Senator Mitchell but those who use
steroids are likely to have increasingly
good performances over time for example
someone who is a batter just in general
and batter will have more opportunity to
create the hand-eye coordination aspect
because their body will recover they
could spend more time in the batting
cage and it is true that it will make a
difference i have someone say to me oh
it doesn't make a difference if you're
taking these steroids you're working
just as hard but it has nothing to do
with hand-eye coordination it most
certainly does because you can spend a
whole lot more time testing yourself in
the batting cage with that kind of help
so it does make a difference
so it's a shame for the sport I'm not
quite sure what they're going to do
about it in the case of the Olympic
Games although we know for a fact that
in the era of the 70s certainly the era
of the East Germans oh I mean I tried
there was a there was a magazine that
came out that named names of East German
athletes who had been doped and I you
know I couldn't find the names of people
I'd road against and so I asked a friend
who was fluent in German he read and he
started laughing so it just says all the
women they can name NZ is it all of the
women so but that doesn't change the
experience and that some people said we
should asterisk that era I don't know
now it seems a little bit late although
there's some people who were really harm
there was a great us swimmer who's name
is going to escape me at this moment
surely bet well surely surely babish off
was one but there was an mi in the games
in 76 who had gone into those games
world champion in I think six events are
seven events and she was silver medalist
in all of those events and won a gold
medal in the relay because the US team
just said they were not going to be
denied that gold medal and she
complained that the athlete she was
competing against were doped and they
called her surly surely maybe was really
bad shot and you know they sort of
shunned her and she was right she was
absolutely right but you couldn't say
anything about it then because you were
like you're just complaining
since then they have apologized to her a
lot of good that does so what do you do
you make sure that as best you can that
you make sure that other athletes don't
get away with it it's what we do
what's it gonna take to get the others
back in United States and hot los
angeles los angeles I think suffers from
the fact that it's the only city in the
world that could host the games with two
years notice we can we're ready we are
the perpetual Olympic city because we
care about sport we have the facilities
when they bid this time around there was
a group who was bidding for to be the
the city from the US despite the fact
that we hosted the Games in 1984 their
bid had all new venues that are reading
existence with exception of the Coliseum
which is would have to be renewed
because they'd have to put the track
back in but we have that many facilities
we have swimming pools we have you know
we have the we have everything it takes
so people think they can wait now so the
city this time around is Chicago and
they have a wonderful wonderful proposal
they have the waterfront area there
where they're going to build the village
and have rowing and a half a lot of the
other sports all right there on the
waterfront and it would be a fantastic
thing for the athletes so I'm very
supportive of their bid so as far as
going back to us think positive thoughts
about 2009 in i think it's mid october
in copenhagen went help copenhagen
denmark when the session will gather
that's what we call our annual meeting
the session will gather and elect the
city for 2016 that's our next shot at it
but we've hosted the olympic winter
games in 1980 the olympic games in 84 of
the olympic games in 96 the olympic
winter games of 2002 to say nothing of
the Olympic Games in 32 in the olympic
winter games in 32 and the olympic
winter games in 64 so we'll be back
nothing else to be tell you is yes sir
about Beijing and the fact that they've
had to do a lot of sort of PR image in
China to try and make it acceptable to
have the Olympics there yeah I think
you're being nice and the way you're
asking the question so thank you for
that there are many people who are
saying that the IOC was wrong to select
the China and Beijing as the host many
people say that their human rights
violations are so horrible that they
shouldn't have the right to host games
hosting the games has already changed
China not just the city I was there last
August and it is just moving so fast the
changes throughout every level it's not
just the fact that now tons of
millionaires and even a couple
billionaire's there the people there
will be hosting the world and they know
that there are so many college graduates
who probably are having a tougher job a
tougher time having getting a job than
our college graduates are because they
don't have the kind of economy that
economy yeah that we have that we don't
have the many jobs that can be created
they don't have that there yet so there
are a lot of college graduates with
nothing to do and there still is abject
poverty there still are some things that
we would consider horrible however
there'll be journalists they're
reporting on the games there people
there who excited about hosting the
world in August that are the rowing and
we had the junior world championships
and all of the rowers stayed at a hotel
where they never had international
guests before and then they start with
rowers which is giant people and all
that so everything is going to be
different for these games and the most
significant thing about any Olympic
Games is to contact people to people it
changes people's lives so was it a
mistake I don't think so can we make
things all better all at once no it's a
two-week sports event that's what it is
although it is a celebration of human
excellence it lasts two weeks so we
can't put too many expectations on it
having said that thanks for that
question
and I don't think that there will be a
Tibetan team although there's a group
saying that they should have their own
national Olympic Committee in their own
team takes a while
so what can you guys do for me what you
can do for me is pleased care about kids
having opportunities in sports please
volunteer I look for places where you
can volunteer please support you sports
organizations with your time or you know
your money is good too that can help but
remember that you can you can do so much
for kids through sports and you can have
a lot of fun too it can make a huge
difference in someone's life to be able
to take part in sports you can have that
moment of excellence I can tell you
where how many of you have had that in
sports who have had a moment where it's
just sublime wear something worked so
well that you can't even describe it
yeah exactly mine I later learned that
it was a blind outlet past at the moment
I took down a rebound this is basketball
wasn't even in rowing so I took down a
rebound and boom I passed the ball to my
teammate was at the other end of the
court and she made a basket just like
that no thought no nothing in the zone
if you have experience in the zone you
can do it again and you can have
excellence in the rest of your life and
that's why sports is so important we can
make sure that all of our kids our life
ready through sports and I hope that
you'll help me make that happen in
Southern California thank you
