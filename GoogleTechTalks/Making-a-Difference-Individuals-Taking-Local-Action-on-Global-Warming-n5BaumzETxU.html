to
to introduce to you Giulio Mongolians
from the local chapter of the Sierra
Club the Loma Prieta chapter there are
their offices are just maybe a mile mile
and a half away from here on a show road
we have also bunch a couple of other
people from the Sierra Club here Melissa
Hibbert the director of the low local
chapter and Kirsten or hear from also
from the local chapter Giulio is going
to talk to us about their global warming
program and how they try to build up a
volunteer corps of people to help with
local action and also about their
program which trains people how to train
other people how to take local action
and individual action to be become more
effective Giulio has a background as an
atmospheric scientist i believe and he's
from NASA originally and he's now with
the Sierra Club for a couple of years
welcome Julian well thank you for
inviting me Robert it's really a
pleasure to be able to come here and
talk to you about what you can do
regarding global warming this mic on ok
great so what I'd like to do is really
talk to you about local action to
address global warming I think as we
look at the range of responses to global
warming and the climate challenge the
clean energy challenge I think it's
really safe to say that the local level
action is really one of the stellar
examples of where there's been quite a
bit
progress and so what I'd like to do is
to talk to you about our chapter's
campaign our global warming or climate
action campaign as a case study in local
action and we have a fairly quite a
comprehensive campaign so we can touch
on various ways in which local action on
global warming can be taken our chapter
the Loma Prieta chapter includes santa
clara San Mateo and San Benito counties
we're one of the largest Sierra Club
chapters as you may know the National
Sierra Club is divided into a series of
chapters ours is one of the original
chapters and also one of the largest our
chapter has made addressing global
warming its number one priority through
local action as opposed to say working
at the state level at the federal level
we've really focused on reducing global
warming emissions from the Silicon
Valley region and so what I'd like to do
today is talk to you a little bit about
why it's important to take local action
I'll give you a very very brief
introduction to the science I'm sure
you've heard lots of talks on the
science of climate change so my
introduction will be very very brief and
then I'd like to talk about some of the
work we've been doing in the various
aspects of our campaign so as Robert
indicated i started my journey to this
position actually doing atmospheric
science studying the climates of other
planets I used to study Mars and Jupiter
and the climates there and back around
the turn of the millennium I realized
that the science was very solid
certainly the atmospheric physics is the
same whether you're talking about Mars
Jupiter or the earth and I had been
keeping up with the research and I was
becoming very concerned that we weren't
taking action on global warming so
through a series of steps I left NASA
Ames Research Center or one of your
partners actually and moved on to a
series of steps to this position with
the Loma Prieta chapter our chapter is
unique in that it is one of the few and
far as I know the only chapter that
actually has a staff person dedicated to
global warming activity
so as i like to say this is our family
portrait here on the left having being
from NASA of course I do have to take
you on a short journey into space so
this is our family this is really our
family portrait everything we consider
near and dear to us is in that picture
whether it's our loved ones whether it's
the wonderful redwood trees that we
enjoy hiking in whether it's the
bacteria that makes beer possible it's
just a whole every single thing that we
consider near and dear is in that
picture and having studied Mars and
Jupiter I can really testify directly
that we really live on a very very
unique place this is the only planet in
the solar system that has liquid water
at its surface in fact one might call
our planet the water planet and it's the
only planet that has complex life-forms
and in fact as a diversity of life forms
and as far as we know is actually the
only planet that has any types of
life-forms at least in our solar system
so there are very unique conditions that
are responsible for that to enable life
and liquid water to exist and those
unique conditions are ultimately made
possible by our atmosphere the
composition of the air that we breathe
and so here on the right is a figure
that shows percentage-wise every breath
of air we take what are the ingredients
in that in that air and of course most
of the molecules we breathe in or
nitrogen and I don't think that's a
surprise about twenty one percent is
oxygen which course is important for us
as we metabolize and try to produce
energy to power ourselves as we go about
our daily lives but the ingredient I
want to focus on is carbon dioxide which
although a relatively minor ingredient
point zero three seven percent is
actually extremely important in
regulating this thermal balance that
allows life and the conditions on the
surface of the earth to sustain liquid
water and life forms now carbon dioxide
is actually of all those molecules is
the only one that has a significant
impact on this thermal balance and I
generated this slide about two years ago
and so the percentage there is 0 point
zero three seven percent for the carbon
dioxide concentration if I had generated
this slide yesterday that percentage
would be 0 point zero three eight
percent
their words it's very very easy
observation to see the rising
concentrations of carbon dioxide in our
atmosphere and if when our ability to
measure the composition of the
atmosphere is so accurate that we can
also see that the oxygen levels are
dropping just as the carbon dioxide
levels are rising we can see the oxygen
levels dropping and that of course is
because combustion consumes oxygen
combines it with a fossil fuels such as
coal oil or natural gas and releases
carbon dioxide and we can see the ratios
going up and down exactly as you'd
expect from combustion so this is a
chart which attempts to show the rising
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere so this is the year 1000 out
to today and then out to 2100 and this
axis here shows the concentration of
carbon dioxide in parts per million so
that would be 0 point zero three eight
percent using percentages and so here
from much of the time prior to the
Industrial Revolution the concentration
of carbon dioxide was about 275 parts
per million then with the start of the
Industrial Revolution this level has
been rising today it's at 385 parts per
million i think it is today and these
are various projections of where that
what the concentration will be by the
year 2100 so these different scenarios
represent different assumptions about
the where we're going to get our energy
from in other words what percentage
comes from fossil fuels how much
population growth there will be and how
much economic growth there will be and
an important point to remember is that
carbon dioxide is not a traditional air
pollutant in the sense that a
traditional air pollutants such as ozone
which is high today because of the spare
the air day in a few days or in a few
hours it'll be washed out of the
atmosphere carbon dioxide on the other
hand once we put it into the atmosphere
is there for hundreds of years so what
we see here on this rising concentration
of carbon dioxide
is the accumulated amount since the
start of the Industrial Revolution /
approximately 2 because half of it
actually ends up dissolving in the
oceans so what I want to make clear to
you is that we're really in a unique
moment in history right now we're right
about here and we have a choice now if
we take decisive action even if we do
everything right the best we can do in
terms of the concentration of carbon
dioxide is to get up to about 550
Plymouth the rise to about 550 parts per
million in contrast if we don't take
decisive action now and we do everything
wrong we could end up at extremely high
concentrations which I don't there's no
doubt that that would have a major
impact on climate raising rising
temperatures etc so really we face a
very unique challenge right now if we
take decisive action we can end up on
this curve rather than rising two
thousand parts per million so we really
need rapid decisive action now to reduce
our carbon dioxide emissions as well as
other greenhouse gas emissions that are
associated with other human activities
so what I'd like to just point out is
that really greenhouse gas emissions are
intricately intricately linked with
basic areas of human activities in other
words our energy use because eighty-five
percent of our energy comes from fossil
fuel burning whether it's we're talking
about the United States as a whole or
the world as a whole waste disposal
there's a former landfill writing or
there's a landfill right next to here
it's no longer active and in that
landfill the waste that's there is
through the action of Becht anaerobic
bacteria is producing methane which goes
out into the atmosphere methane is a
very powerful greenhouse gas on a per
molecule basis it's more pot more
powerful than carbon dioxide even though
carbon dioxide's the main
human-generated greenhouse gas and then
agriculture produces a range of
greenhouse gas associated with the
running of tractors of course that would
be energy use with fertilizers producing
nitrogen dioxide which is another potent
greenhouse gas so we we all have a role
to play here
because we are all ultimately consuming
energy consuming food and disposing of
waste and we all have a role whether
it's individuals institutions at the
local level businesses local government
state and federal activity is all
important in addressing climate change
so what I'd like to do is just highlight
where our local greenhouse gas emissions
are coming from so this is a chart that
shows actually the emissions inventory
represent in terms of equivalent co2
amounts so this would include other
molecules like methane except expressed
as equivalent co2 and this is actually a
emission inventory for the city of San
Mateo but this is pretty typical for a
city in our region the Bay Area and so
you can see clearly the largest
component of our greenhouse gas
emissions comes from the transportation
sector the second largest component
comes from combination and natural gas
and electricity which is associated with
the built environment essentially all of
that is being consumed in the built
environment whether its private
residences businesses etc and then
municipal waste for example dumps
accounts for about I'm sorry municipal
activity local government activity
include produces about two percent of
the total carbon footprint of San Mateo
and our region generally and then
municipal waste disposal could consist
of about three percent so why does this
matter what turns out a lot of this
these emissions are controlled by local
government activity and of course by
individuals so here we're talking about
the built environment traditionally
local governments that have had control
over building ordinances and therefore
they could potentially enact powerful
green building ordinances which would
reduce the emissions greenhouse gas
emissions associated with energy use in
buildings and other activities and
buildings cities traditionally have our
regulate development in a community they
regulates transportation and some
important regards and so they have some
control
over vehicle miles traveled and then of
course so waste disposal a lot of city
all cities have a mandate to reduce the
amount of waste going into the local
landfill and therefore recycling
programs and the like can have an
important impact on that so we really at
the local level there's quite a bit of
potential for impacting the amount of
greenhouse gas emissions locally so our
chapter recognizing the important
opportunity to address global warming
emissions at the local level has a very
active climate action campaign as I said
earlier our chapters executive committee
has made this its number one priority
and we've had quite a bit of success in
engaging a large number of volunteers in
our campaign so our campaign consists of
essentially four initiatives we have an
education and outreach initiative and
I'll say more about these as we go
through we have initiative involving
local government action working to have
local governments control the carbon
footprint of the lot not only the local
government operations but the community
as a whole that's called our cool cities
campaign which also happens to be a
national Sierra Club campaign realizing
that it's important to have a
comprehensive campaign in order to
really reduce the carbon footprint of
our community as a whole where we've
started a new program called Climate
Action Teams designed to create
individual and institutional action to
reduce global warming emissions and
finally the perhaps the longest-standing
component of our chapters in ish a
climate action campaign we have an
initiative tries to reduce local
barriers to solar power and has some had
some significant impact in that regard
so the first initiative is just
education and outreach and as you might
expect that includes cim presentations
mainly by me given my background I can
talk about the science of climate change
I can also talk about our campaign
effectively and really try to convey
what solutions might be possible as far
as addressing global warming we have a
really active
especially now that we have our climate
action campaign we have a very active
set of tabling at events this is just
our newest display highlighting our
campaign we have so far this year table
that I believe is now 18 events many
some of those during Earth Week but
throughout the year and this is an area
where volunteers have really enjoyed
being engaged because they can directly
talk to the community tell them about
their passion regarding global warming
and give them in full information that
might help them change their behaviors
and engage them in our campaign and then
actually one of the first things I did
when I started in my position about two
years ago was to really upgrade our
website to facilitate action on a large
scale by introducing an online database
which we call our global warming
database and just improving in general
our website and we've had so much
interest in our global warming website
team that they've actually moved ahead
and even helped the chapter as a whole
improve its website to facilitate the
interaction with members and to really
effectively convey what we do to
illustrate the success we've had in
terms of engaging individuals our global
warming database which is an opt-in
database which we started a beginning of
last year went from zero to 2400 people
in less than 18 months and that just
shows i think dramatically the real
thirst that people have to try to do
something about global warming besides
just changing a light bulb as i like to
say oops okay so what I'd like to do now
is talk about our local government
action component which is our cool
cities campaign and a derivative of that
cool cities campaign is what we call our
cool counties campaign and both of these
campaigns are designed to form teams of
individuals teams of residents in each
city or in each county and have those
teams work with their local government
leaders to reduce the carbon footprint
of the community as a whole as well as
from the local government operations so
this is an
national Sierra Club campaign our
chapter has really taken a cutting edge
taking a cutting edge role in that and
as far as I know of the chapters in the
Bay Area and we are the only chapter
that actually has an extremely active
cool cities campaign so the campaign
like I said consists of forming teams of
residents in each city having those
teams develop relationships with the
staff and the local government leaders
in their cities and counties and the
first milestone of the campaign is to
get the cities to sign on to what's
called the US mayor's climate protection
agreement or in the case of counties it
would be the cool counties declaration
and those instruments basically commit
the city or county to reducing the
carbon footprint of the community as a
whole and also put the city and county
on record as indicating that they
believe the global warming is an
important issue that needs to be
addressed and that actions needed at all
levels including at the city and county
levels the second step which our teams
are working for is to have the city's
inventory the missions of greenhouse
gases throughout the community as well
as in the local government operations
and then to set an emission reduction
target hopefully in a aggressive one
that's at least as aggressive as our
state targets which Governor
Schwarzenegger and the legislature
formalized through the global warming
solutions act of 2006 then our teams try
to have cities and counties develop a
plan for achieving those targets from
the baseline emissions and then
implementing that plan and actually
reducing emissions so just to give you a
status report on our own campaign on the
left here is a map showing how many
cities have and have cool cities teams
so starting our campaign start in
November of 2006 we have 19 cool cities
teams remember that our chapter includes
santa clara county san mateo county does
not include san francisco or the east
bay so we actually have a large fraction
of the cities in our region have cool
cities teams now they've engaged about a
hundred active volunteers
and here on the right this is a map
showing which cities have signed the US
mayor's climate protection agreement and
which counties have signed the cool
counties declaration and you can see
that 23 cities have signed the mayor's
climate protection agreement and both
county san mateo county and santa clara
county have declared that this is an
important issue they need to do
something about it and they commit to
reducing the carbon footprint of the
city and counties so our main activity
in the cool cities campaign in addition
to having our teams work with their city
and county leaders has been writing a
report or surveying the city's trying to
get a snapshot of what is occurring in
each city as far as climate protection
activities this cool cities local
government Climate Action survey is
about to be released officially next
Wednesday we're going to have a press
release and a major roll out and so I'd
like to talk a little bit about what we
found in very general terms and just
give you a preview of what's to come so
the objectives in this report we're
really to try to just get a sense of
what is going on as far as climate
protection activities in santa clara and
san mateo counties by the local
governments the city governments and
county governments and we think there's
a great opportunity here to facilitate
the exchange of best practices because
as we found actually there are some
cities that are really ahead of the
curve in some specific areas and so
we're hoping this report will facilitate
the exchange of best practices between
the leaders and the other cities and
counties that might wish to take action
but would like a model and then finally
our third objective is to try to give
our cool cities and cool counties teams
a tool that they can use to try to shift
their local government policies and
actions and again we've already had
several of our cool cities teams are
anxiously awaiting to use this report in
the coming weeks with their City
Council's to really push for a strong
action on climate change so some of the
milestones we
put out the online survey in March of
2008 28 jurisdictions responded that
seventy-six percent of the jurisdictions
in santa clara and san mateo counties to
try to get feedback and any updates from
those cities and counties we distributed
a preview edition of our report and as i
said earlier we're going to have a press
release next wednesday our report is
finalized now and already the teams hope
to use this we've had a lot of interest
from some of the city leaders as well so
just to talk about some of the general
conclusions of our study what I think is
quite clear is that there's been a
rapidly growing level of engagement by
local governments on the climate change
challenge and so back at the start of
our campaign in November of 2006 those
are the cities eight cities had signed
the US mayor's climate protection
agreement I already showed you this map
on the right but so less than 18 months
later in june of 2008 we have 23 mcpa
signings mayor's climate protection
agreement signings and two count cool
counties declaration signings so I think
that just dramatically illustrates how
there's this rapidly growing level of
engagement by local governments and I
really think this local government
action not just here although we've had
quite a bit of success but even
nationwide is really perhaps one of the
beacons of hope as far as addressing at
the government level climate change and
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
so there's been a rapidly growing level
of engagement this is actually a chart
that's in our in our report and this
chart violates the first rule of
presentations which has never put a
complex table up on the screen so I
don't want you to focus on the details I
want you to look at the colors and where
they're placed and what the general
conclusion here is is that there even
though there have been lots of
commitments there's rapidly growing
engagement there's still a lot of action
that needs to be taken we really
specific actions to address global
warming are still missing and the other
conclusion I'd like you with general
conclusion I'd like you to take away
is that notice that there are certain
outliers here and here and here so
there's actually a rich diversity of
cities that are really leading in
specific areas and so like I said
earlier our hope is to try to use this
report as a way to facilitate
interaction and exchange of best
practices between cities and counties
that are on the cutting edge and others
that would like to implement their
commitments so some of the conclusions
our local governments are so rapidly
growing engagement on climate protection
as I said earlier there are essential
milestones that have not yet been
achieved and we really need to push to
really make the Silicon Valley region on
the cutting edge of addressing global
warming I think especially in local
government arena although there's
growing engagement we really are still
not on the cutting edge i would say
cities like Portland Oregon and Seattle
Washington have been on the cutting edge
of government action to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions I think one ray
of hope is that there is a rich variety
as I said of cities and counties that
are leading in specific narrow areas and
potential there for rapid diffusion of
best practices and I think one of the
things we found is that a combination of
public engagement with regional
initiatives or even extra City and extra
County initiatives that provide
resources such as financial resources or
technical resources are really needed to
push and move action forward in these
cities and counties in fact the Air
Resources Board the California Air
Resources Board is now in the process of
finalizing its plan for addressing
global warming statewide and our chapter
submitted comments indicating that we
really think there's a tremendous
opportunity for early action on global
warming emission reduction by having the
state foster the innovation at the local
level and support local governments as
they try to take a leading edge position
on addressing global warming so our
third initiative which we call our
Climate Action Team program is just
beginning we started with our
development phase training series back
in the spring
and it's really designed to expand the
scope of our program to address
emissions associated with institutions
and individuals and it really relies on
a combination of training of individuals
on specific actions they can take a
social support creating a social support
network that will allow them to help
each other through problems make it more
enjoyable to participate and to help
extend some of these ideas beyond
themselves to institutions around the
Silicon Valley region so the goals
basically are too broadly extend
climate-friendly actions among
individuals and organizations like i
said earlier to try to take the training
that these individuals get and their
commitment and passion and try to funnel
that into moving institutions forward as
far as developing climate action plans
to reduce the carbon footprint of
institutions and I think an essential
ingredient in all of this is building a
social support network so one of the key
goals and the Climate Action Team
program is to really build a supportive
Network and of course the holy grail of
any of this is to try to create
exponential growth to try to broadly
diffuse climate friendly practices out
into the community and obviously that's
a tough one but we're hoping that we
might make some progress there so the
first step in our climate action team
program is to have a series of training
sessions and social support session so
during the development phase for example
we had three trainings three training
sessions and we had three social support
sessions and we're continuing to have
ongoing social support sessions to just
help people along and to make sure that
they implement their commitments but the
first step in the training series is
really to have individuals calculate
their carbon footprint and to set a
reduction goal so for example I'm going
to focus on one tool that one might use
to calculate your carbon carbon dioxide
footprint but there are many carbon
dioxide calculators this one happens to
be one that the sierra club's our
chapter actually helped
eight a few years ago most of these
calculators really only deal with direct
emissions in other words emissions
associated say with energy that you use
they don't include that whole other
category of indirect emissions
associated with say products you buy the
transportation associated with those and
I'll say a little bit more about that
later although some of the calculators
try to estimate that that's actually a
bit tough to estimate so this is the web
address for the kulick calculator and so
we're asking each participant in the
Climate Action Team program to reduce
their carbon footprint by at least ten
percent once they've calculated their
carbon footprint is ten percent of that
so trying to get down to some specific
numbers this chart attempts to show a
typical carbon dioxide footprint for an
American household so that's what we
have up here and so what we have here
and the purple and pink is are the
direct emissions associated with a
typical household in the United States
so the this includes things like
obviously heating lighting and
appliances hot water heating you can see
that the biggest component of the carpet
the direct carbon footprint in terms of
household operations is the heating
associated with your home and air
conditioning and refrigeration here or
others in that category down here
roughly a little less than half of the
carbon footprint for the average
household is associated with automobiles
transportation gasoline use and then you
can see this whole other category of
indirect emissions associated with the
products that we purchase and a variety
of services that we make use of so
roughly I think speaking our direct
emissions account for about half of our
total emissions the other half being all
those direct emissions associated with
things we buy and services we purchase
just for comparison the average for the
not the countries outside the US the
worldwide average is down here at 9.5
tons and then down here I have numbers
from our first Climate Action Team
program training participants we had a
tea we had
10 participants we wanted to keep it
small in this development phase as we
try to refine our program and the carbon
footprint ranged from about 4 tons to up
to nine tons per person of our
participants and that just included the
direct emissions but what I want to
actually one of the odds that our
participants had was that many of them
their foot even though they're trying to
conserve energy at home and do the right
thing they really found that airline
travel was their big footprint the
emissions associated with their trips
around the world we're really having a
huge impact on their carbon footprint
okay so once we've had our participants
evaluate their carbon footprint we then
present a series of opportunities or
series of options a menu of options that
actions people can take to reduce their
carbon footprint so we've tried to do is
put together a menu that ranks actions
based on the carbon impact based on the
amount of savings that they may have as
a result of taking that action and the
simplicity level of that particular
action so all these numbers for the co2
and the costs are based on national
averages and what you can see is that
you know a series of actions one might
take can actually have a big impact so
just highlighting here if you were to
switch from washing your clothes in hot
water to cold water and actually using
the sensor the humidity sensor in your
dryer you could have an impact of about
a thousand five hundred and thirty three
pounds of co2 and I would reduce your
footprint by 1533 pounds of co2 another
example might be what we call smart
driving namely reduce your foot reduce
your average speed on the freeway from
65 miles per hour to 55 you could have
an impact of about seven hundred and
twenty pounds on your carbon dioxide
footprint I've seen this dramatically
being a scientist of course every time I
fill up I have to write down how many
miles what the odometer reading is and
how much
yes I bought and when I do that
calculation I can really see the
improvement in the mileage I get with my
car as I try to reduce my maximum speed
on on the freeways and then finally this
just reemphasize 'as the importance of
the footprint associated with airline
travel you can see a huge impact on your
carbon footprint by say substituting a
bus trip on a 500-mile journey or four
hundred fifty mile journey rather than
taking air line along that short hop for
that short hop so what we do in the
training series is we have the
individuals calculate their carbon
footprint and then develop a personal
climate action plan to reduce their
footprint using that climate that menu
of options i showed you earlier so i
just want to walk you through here um so
we have joe average here he or she or he
calculates his carbon footprint of
20,000 pounds per year he commits to
reducing his footprint by ten percent he
then goes and does the calculation of
course wants to reduce his footprint by
2,000 pounds and then he develops a plan
to achieve that 2,000 pound reduction in
this particular case the reduction is
achieved by adopting smart driving in
other words lowering his speed from 65
miles per hour to 55 he seals its haul
more effectively to reduce heat loss
from windows and this is not the answer
this is not working on your
installations is actually just say
improving your insulation in your window
sorry improving the seals and your
windows and your doors he decides to
skip some beef on once a week has a bit
of an impact he decides to plant the
tree and comes up with a total reduction
of two thousand eight pounds and a
savings of two hundred twenty-six
dollars again based on national averages
so our goal is to have people develop a
personal Climate Action Plan and then
work with others that are participating
in the program to form a climate action
team to support each other as well as
then once they've developed a personal
climate action plan eventually extend
these ideas to an institution and
hopefully get the institution to develop
climate action plan so the next stage as
i said is actually trying to approach an
institution we emphasize that these
institutions that people go to should be
really one where they have a personal
connection that obviously gives them a
bit of an in and so we try to take the
knowledge that these people who have
acquired in the training series the
confidence that they've developed
through the social support sessions and
then try to extend that into an
institution and have the institution
develop a climate action plan I should
say an eye cap here an institutional
climate action plan is a plan for
approaching the institution not a the
climate action plan that we're hoping
the institution will develop so just to
talk a little bit about impacts
associated with our training series our
development training series we had ten
participants the estimated co2 reduction
for all those participants was about
fifty nine thousand pounds the estimated
cost savings as they all develop their
personal climate action plans is about
twenty three hundred dollars and now we
have our teams are Climate Action Teams
approaching a variety of institutions
the class lake charities ebay and Half
Moon Bay School District and so we're
trying to take this experience from our
development phase training series and
try to develop refined program for the
Fall so we're continuing to have ongoing
social support sessions for our initial
training development series we're hoping
to incorporate improvements from the
development phase into our second round
of training to our official roll out in
the fall of two thousand eight and I
think one of the striking findings we
found we determined from our training
series our development phase is that we
really need to move this on to the web
and create a set of web-based tools that
allow people to integrate instead of
having separate excel spreadsheets
calculate their footprints integrate
that with the menu of options that they
can incorporate an a personal climate
action plan have this all online so they
can not only see their personal impact
but they can aggregate it's a with their
team members
participants in the Climate Action Team
program and maybe other people that they
engage in this activity and institutions
so I think there's a lot of I think
that's really going to be the cutting
edge develop web-based tools not just
for all of this accounting on carbon
footprints but also perhaps use some
social networking tools that website
social networking websites have
developed the trotti maybe enhance the
social support experience and then as
far as our fourth initiative this like
as I said is one of our longest-standing
initiatives and really I think
demonstrates the power of individual
action volunteers becoming engaged
taking their passion and actually doing
some taking a small step and having a
big impact so a couple of our volunteers
back in 2005 decided on the simple
proposition that they wanted to compare
the permit fees charged by cities to
install a solar electric system on a
home so they went and surveyed all of
the cities and in our chapter's area
they then compared wrote a report and
compared those solar permit fees and
what they found was that there was a
very large disparity in the permit fees
charged by cities several cities were
charging many thousands of dollars a
couple thousand dollars some are just
charging a few hundred dollars or even
less to install to get a permit to
install a solar permit solar
photovoltaic system so it turned out
that Paul Rogers at the mercury news and
a variety of other reporters gave this
study a lot of press attention and as a
result of that there was a dramatic
decrease that cities became embarrassed
by having such high fees that were
actually not an insignificant percentage
of the total cost of installing a solar
system and so 27 cities in the chapters
area have reduced their fees
significantly and in the greater bay
area 72 cities have now reduced oh
actually I think the number is even
higher now but at least over 72 cities
have now reduced their fees in the
greater Bay Area and in fact we see that
in our cool cities a local climate
action
serve a local government Climate Action
survey so what I like to do is just
provide you with a few conclusions and I
think I'm doing okay on time so I think
what I'd like to convey to you is that
an essential component of addressing
climate change really is local action
and I personally think that's one of the
stellar areas in which we Excel not just
our chapter but there's just tremendous
opportunities for action and there has
been a lot of leadership both in
institutions local governments and
through individuals to really address
global warming emissions what we've seen
in our study of local government action
is that there really is a rapidly
growing engagement in the Silicon Valley
region but we really still need a lot of
key milestones to be achieved to really
implement those commitments as this
rapidly growing engagement is converted
into actual action there you know it's
not rocket science what you need to do
to reduce your individual or
institutional carbon footprint and I
think what we really need to do through
programs such as the Climate Action Team
program is to really take these well
understood ideas reframe them in a way
that is easy for people to integrate
into their lives and then broadly
disseminate this information and so
we're trying to do that with our Climate
Action Team program and I just want to
say that of course our chapter solar
permit fees study i think is an example
of the impact individuals volunteers
with a passion who really want to have
an impact can have a significant
influence on I it may be a small step in
fact in many cases it was a significant
step because many of the permit fees
were so large or a relatively large
fraction of the installation fee for a
solar a solar system so you can have an
impact as an individual and then finally
I think are cool cities local government
climate action survey has the potential
to have a similar impact as the solar
permit fee study did on a broader array
of climate protection action
being adopted or that should be adopted
by local government in our area so a
couple action items for you you might
want to consider signing our cool cities
letter to the mayor and so I have a
clipboard with a petition or a letter
over there and we take all of those
names we sort them by city and can
present them to the mayor to indicate
their support for action at the local
government level become part of one of
our cool cities or cool counties teams
or become engaged in some other way
table if you'd like interact with the
public share your passion about
addressing global warming adjusting the
climate challenge calculate your carbon
footprint that's quite easy to do with
the kulit calculator or the state of
California now has a carbon calculator
you could use in their variety of them
out there set a reduction goal just
really set a reduction goal at least
they'll start you on your journey
perhaps to reducing your carbon
footprint you can learn to reduce your
carbon footprint in a variety of forums
but one way you might consider doing
that is by joining a climate action a
Climate Action Team program and maybe
even starting a climate action team at
your institution help us broadly
disseminate some of these basic emission
reduction ideas and of course there's a
rich diversity of possibilities there
and whatever your interest your skill
however much time you have I think we
really need to step up to the climate
challenge or as i like to say at the
climate challenge and the clean and
efficient energy challenge which is
really humanity's grand challenge at
this moment in time and i urge you to
think about how important this is in
your life and in future lives of your
children and the people you love and
just take a step even if it's a small
step it's important to take that step so
i generally like to end with this quote
because i think it epitomizes what we
need to do and so this is a quote from
Margaret Mead which is never doubt that
a small group of thoughtful committed
citizens can change the world indeed it
is the only thing that ever has and I've
really seen that
think through my association with the
Loma Prieta chapters climate action
campaign there really is a thirst for
action on global warming and I think by
people stepping up we have a chance of
addressing this really fundamental
challenge so I think I'll leave it there
thank you very much thank you very much
Julia for the very informative talk I
think we have a few minutes left there
if there's any Q&amp;amp;A questions and I
invite also people who are interested to
talk to the loma prieta chapter members
over lunch thank you
it's definitely one way to reduce carbon
dioxide they're actually been some
studies at Stanford which course if you
didn't if you it if I'd our latitudes if
you plant a tree yes you are absorbing
more carbon dioxide but if you're really
talking about a forest scale plantation
generally the ground is brighter then a
tree is so you actually by planting say
a large force a new forest you would be
changing the reflectivity of the ground
and in fact you end up absorbing more
sunlight so there are people who worry
about the the budget in fact the people
who do these studies for example at
Stanford they've said okay if you do
this in the tropics a the amazon
rainforest you can have a net impact a
really net positive impact but if you do
it at our latitudes planning an
individual tree is great because you're
really not affecting the reflectivity
much but if you want to plant
large-scale for us there's a little bit
more issue of whether there would be a
net benefit when you look at the solar
absorption and the co2 absorption and
then you said that most of them
individuals footprint is generated by
air travel can you elaborate on that so
well what okay so in the case of our
participants because our climate action
team development training series really
was engaged Sierra Club volunteers who
were passionate and can care about this
issue they had already done quite a bit
in their lives to reduce their footprint
and clearly they were able to even do
more through the suggestions and our
climate protection actions menu but you
know they've done what they could at
home but then their airplane travel a
few of the members were really just
shocked by how big a component that was
of their footprint and of course there
are ways to offset that there's no in
the case of short trips you might
consider taking a train perhaps it's
more relaxing and of course governor
schwarzenegger i think it was yesterday
signed on to the high-speed rail system
which would in fact reduce the carbon
footprint of travel between here in LA
so there are especially in the future
there will probably some very good
options for going between you know 500
miles say
instead of taking a plane flight
obviously if you're taking a trip across
the country there aren't too many
options right now alternative options
especially given that we all lead busy
lives but of course one opportunity
perhaps would be to offset those
emissions through what are called carbon
offsets say subsidizing the development
of wind power subsidizing the
development of solar power subsidizing a
solar power system in your community
their new types of offsets now that are
being created which really focus on
taking the money from an offset and
applying it in your community so you can
see what your money has done thank you
thanks for the question well thank you
all for actually participating
appreciate it I know this is a week when
lots of people take time off because of
the vacations ending and it's really
nice to see a turn out here and
appreciate your interest and hopefully
you'll follow your passion if you have a
passion you really want to step up the
humanities grand challenge you will do
something even if has nothing to do with
our chapter it'd be great if you
participate in our effort we have a
whole we have a dedicated and passionate
group of people already working and we
could always use more people because
this is a magnitude of the challenge
requires decisive action by everybody
now so I guess that's it
