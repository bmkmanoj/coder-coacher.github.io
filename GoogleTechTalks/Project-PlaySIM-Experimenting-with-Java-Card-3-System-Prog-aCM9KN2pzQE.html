presentation on Wednesday at JavaOne
we're changing things up because
Sebastian happens to work on the spec
for SIM cards for Java card so I think
it'd be a good occasion to have him talk
about that so just to start the quick
intro so the point with play sim is to
provide an open platform to experiment
with sim cards the key thing for us is
it's not an emulator it's something you
can actually touch and play with and
we're looking at trying to figure out
how we can allow people to experiment
with the cool stuff that's coming up in
sim cards today you'll get to hear some
of that it was a project initiated by
Eleanor who if you don't know those
numbers are real took them off there so
feet offense Donna that we have they
actually come from Telenor and so
there's a fairly large carrier so this
is the basic agenda so what is a sim
card
Java card that you can reduce as well as
I can't sell I'll skip that part and
I'll switch it over to Sebastian thank
you
so the sim card is probably one of the
things that most people don't really are
aware that say helps us in their mobile
phone basically you have a mobile phone
and you only when you insert a SIM card
you can really get access to the to the
network it's a salt cod subscriber
identity module it gives you secure
access to the network it provides you
basically with a security to roam from
one network to the other and ensures
basically all the roaming mechanisms and
and security mechanism says that an
operator needs basically in his network
to charge you with your calls and not
with some calls from some other people
so it's a pretty important thing for an
operator to enable its overall business
so and it's very interesting of platform
because it's a high secure platform its
doors user credentials security data and
user data
fully managed secure platform so an
operator can over-the-air
manage basically every bit and byte in
your SIM card and they do this they if
you talk with Telenor for instance or
with other operators its relative really
impressive for how much they manage on
these cards and on a regular basis
basically you typically don't are not
aware of this but it's a very important
thing for them to do so
SIM cards are basically in the gsm and
in the UMTS and LTE networks since the
beginning so basically the first
networks GSM networks came on air in
1992 and since then we have SIM cards
basically in old phones so it's a pretty
large number it's a huge market
we started with relatively small cards
and these cards are getting bigger but
one of the phone sons point of view of
course most important things was the
introduction of the java technology for
the sim card
it turned actually the sim card into a
secure application platform that is
inserted in every mobile phone so that's
actually one of the interesting things
you have see application platform ins of
in the phone itself and the application
platform in the card and both together
can basically be used to implement very
interesting services so the ability is
selling the companies who are producing
these sim cards are very specialized
companies they're selling billions of
these cards per year typically several
more than one card per subscriber is
sold per year so it's really very big
numbers and it's a very nice business
actually if you are on these cards so
SIM cards are basically smart cards as
they are more widely known and you can
basically use them in a mobile phone in
a in a GSM UMTS modem or basically in a
desktop environment or in in a setup box
for pay TV
so it's you have basically a pretty big
range of different application
potentials they enable high secure
services so it's a very secure connect
secure platform and lots of basically
developments goes into making these SIM
cards very and smart cards high secure
they typically come with very
sophisticated cryptographic capabilities
for public key authentication public key
cryptography AAS support and all kinds
of other cryptographic functionality so
services that are implemented today on
the smart cards are very often security
related so for instance one time
password generation to get access to
wireless LAN hotspots that are managed
by operators one-time password
generation to get access to banking
accounts mobile banking accounts in some
developing countries for instance to get
services are very popular for money
transfer from one card to the other so
there's a lots of sins other services
that are implemented by the operators
are simply there that you don't see as a
normal users they're just there for
quality assurance that say no basically
in what kind of terminal are is this
card is inserted what kind of problems
are coming up to make sure that you are
stay in certain partner networks for
instance so what is the technology that
we are using today with with smart cards
and SIM cards so smart cards have came
to life roughly 25 30 years ago very
small processors very small devices so
everything what is what you have in the
smart card technology is strongly
standardized by ISIL and it's basically
targeting very small devices so you have
just a single thread running in the cart
you have a very simple master slave
protocol you have messages
the application layers that can be
maximum to 155 bytes long you have a
very low speed and the clock and the
power comes from the card so there's no
as soon as you pull out the card from
the terminal nothing is happening in the
card anywhere right you have a square
prompt so that's pretty slow write and
write cycles today mainstream is 32 to
128 kilobytes of SQL prompt and
relatively small ram 8 to 16 kilobyte so
we have in the gsm and UMTS networks we
have a very special protocol sim toolkit
protocol to overcome some of the
limitations of these platforms but it's
very very specific to the telco market
it is very difficult to program and you
read a lot of domain knowledge basically
to get your application up and running
and working correctly so Java coupon
dekes is already around basically since
1998 so I started to work at Sun for
Java card and since then stick to this
platform it is defined for very
constrained devices it's basically the
smallest Java card or Java
implementation we have the target
platform was basically a 1/2 kilobyte
ram and 4 kilobyte of non-volatile
memory also basically 4 kilobyte of
escape rooms that was our first target
for smart card so the Scout that you
have today are pretty big already for us
so we it's again it's a Java Virtual
Machine it is a split VM we have no
strings no integer no float support it
is single threaded has basically follows
the limited communication capabilities
of the of the current standards but we
sort of more than 6 billion of these
cards are today in the field so it
basically is the most widely deployed
Java cobbler platform in the world so
through the introduction of javacard
basically operators became a platform in
their hand to develop new applications
and they have done this really have
picked us up and develop the lots of
applications and basically with this
Java platform that we have today we
basically push the limits of the current
technology to its maximum we can today
basically with the current technology we
cannot really go beyond what we can do
today we have basically - we want to put
more and more sophisticated services
into the cards we want for instance to
use NFC that is a near field
communication short-range radio that is
basically a second interface into the
card and if you have several interfaces
into the cards and single thread it
becomes basically an issue we want to go
for USB because we want to basically get
out of the very proprietary smart card
interface technology and hook on onto
this mainstream into the physical
interface and we want to have an tcp/ip
stack inside the card to better
integrate into the all IP networks that
are coming LTE the next generation of
mobile networks is basically in all IP
network with flash card with flash
memory we can basically go now to
several megabytes or gigabytes of memory
so we can think about much more complex
and much more beautiful applications we
get 32 bits CPUs into the markets that
are based on arm7 processor so we have
basically suddenly a platform that has a
capabilities from the hardware point of
view of a mobile phone eight or nine
years ago right so Moore's law also
applies to smart cards that's the good
news
actually and people our companies are
really heavily working on this so we
have companies who are putting a GPS
sensor onto the cards or we have cards
already in the fields that have an
accelerometer sensor in the card telecom
attire is experimenting with ZigBee
interface to the cards
so we want basically to put all kinds of
new interfaces and sensors on this part
additional network interfaces
short-range communication interfaces so
for this we basically need a new
software platform to basically deal with
all these new capabilities another issue
with the sim cards of today it's
basically a very closed environment
typically
the operators eat up all the memory in
the card very very easily with their own
applications they cannot really open it
to other other developers first of all
it's they have security issues and then
second it's the cards of today that you
the mainstream cards that you have today
in the markets are simply too small so
but this is changing right with a new
memory capacities that we have we get
more memory we can put more applications
and operate us see basically at the
moment a business opportunity to open
the card and to allow for instance
payment organizations like Visa and
MasterCard to come in to the card or for
ticketing and transport purposes that is
at the moment what something what is
very hyped in in Europe they want to
have basically collaborate with public
transport like in Paris or London or in
Germany to put basically ticketing and
transport applications into the card and
the interesting thing is basically
really is a combination of the security
capabilities of the card and the
networking and user interface
capabilities of the mobile phone that
really make can can give us basically
the possibility to make very interesting
applications so the SIM card basically
becomes more and more in computer ins of
in the in the phone and can drive
basically much more and more interesting
transactions so the SIM card is
basically is a computer and this is a
new way of thinking in this market so is
to basically better deal with all these
capabilities we introduced basically
Java cops robotics there is a new
platform and we released this well
basically we moved forward with it we
keep back what backward compatibility
that is something you have simply to do
in the mobile market otherwise you are
dead and it's a much more powerful
programming platform it's basically
based on Co DC it has a built-in circuit
container and servlet API is it as a
subset of the servlet API 2.4 it has a
generic connection framework everything
from CDC 1.1 and a few other API is that
we thought they are useful so it would
take a couple of hours to go into the
details of this but so we have now a
multi-threaded CID C 1.1 we have
supports for multiple hardware and
logical interfaces we have a building
server engine we have strings and
notation generics so basically jdk 1.5
language features support SSL TLS
support generic connection framework you
can now integrate java card as a secure
multi-application car platform into the
IP networks and that was one of the main
purposes of c java 1 this year where we
showed some demos in this direction and
you can basically now get out of the
proprietary
smart card protocol niche and
communicate with a card via HTTP and/or
tcp/ip direct tcp/ip communication so
the card really becomes a secure server
in the local network and that opens up
lots of new possibilities and how we
want to enable these possibilities
so um it turns out that Telenor had a
few interns hanging around and they were
playing with sunspots and people have
found sunspots pretty interesting and so
they're trying to figure out how could
we do something with sunspots so we
could get some ourselves and so this is
basically how this project came about so
I'm gonna go into a quick overview of
what is a sunspot so it's basically a
platform built to inspire people to
build stuff my boss's job in life is to
a goal in life is to turn software
people into Hardware people and hardware
people onto software people and for
those of you have heard this story
before I'm sorry but my boss is very
happy because he believes he's managed
to achieve this goal so I'm a software
engineer and actually I did this
yesterday I've been programming since
I'm 15 I can't say I'm a software
engineer since I'm 15 but I've been
programming since I'm 15 so I do
software hardware is something that I
either break or use those are my only
options well I called my boss up one day
and I said Roger I need an oscilloscope
the usual response when I buy something
is yeah right
and this occasion he jumped up to in joy
and said yes so he's achieved his goal
so he was very happy about this so um
there's a big push in community with
sunspots
everything is open-source and to show
you to what extent it's open-source we
had a Chinese company ship us sunspots
that we had to make two modifications to
on our software ran as is so the
Gerber's so when I say everything I mean
the hardware the software everything is
out there so it's it's um it's a big
deal
so the Sun SPOT platform is the software
that runs on top of the sunspots so for
us when we started doing sunspots there
were no real devices that provided the
capabilities that we were looking for
and so we basically built our own device
now if you look at the market today
things are different however the Sun
SPOT still provide an interesting what
we call the out of box experience
we're not Apple so it's kind of hard to
say that from I'm being recorded let's
just start
so come with driver platform common
services say just to Krita parlous
sensor network devices is where we
wanted to get into now obviously being
Sun creating more data and processing
more data and store more data is a very
useful thing for us and we think
actually is a very good thing for
everyone else to try and figure out what
they're doing so the intent of the
platform was to build it to various
devices now initially we started with
what we used to always call the sunspot
but now we call the east bot because we
just added the national instrument
CompactRIO
to the family and that is the controller
if you can see my shirt on the video
it's 2009
of first championship so first robotic
competition has the compact wheel and it
is now running Java that's what we just
announced at JavaOne well no sorry we
announced in April we presented about it
at JavaOne this week and in fact Brad
Miller who was sitting there just when a
dude's Choice Award for providing Java
tooth first okay so the sunspot
platforms Java VM so this is my baby and
I like to go into a lot of details here
but I think people will want to go to
the toy to the man that's grinning over
there
I love VMs my brother's basically
introduced me to computers with a
Commodore pet 2001 with 8k of RAM and
basically they saved up for an entire
year to buy up 24k and it took us a long
time to realize that yeah you could use
up 32k but I'm still stuck in that
mindset I find it obscene what we do to
machines today and since I'm at Google
some of these concepts that I do in my
VM for resource constraint devices I
believe strongly apply in a server
environment as well because I believe
that if you assume that you're in a big
iron box and that you own as much as you
want you're gonna run into exactly the
same kind of problems you do on a small
base CPU so there are leverages on the
server you can have like you can have a
cache that's a you know few gigabytes in
size you know in RAM and and live with
that so yes but the processes themselves
you need to think differently than you
would and this applies here
so to show I'm also to show another
twist aside I'm a small talker at heart
I can't believe I do Java for a living
today but it turns out that Java in is
more conducive to people doing embedded
stuff because they do so much see they
really so this works so coming from
small talk we worked with squeek where
the VM is written in itself we do the
same thing so the traditional VM well in
our part of the world it's actually
starting from as close to the metal as
possible everything is done in Java now
it's kind of interesting here so I've
got a Java VM that's written in Java so
there's a bit of a chicken and egg
problem here so in in in VM pilots we do
a ot so ahead of time compilation so
desktop VMs do jets just-in-time
compilation now that's just a fancy way
of saying that we take the Java code we
generate native source and I'm very
specific here we don't generate native
code I don't believe that you know our
group can recreate what a complaint
optimized compiler for your target that
we can do that so the intent is to
generate target source such that you can
leverage the compiler but to go further
than that I would like to be able to do
things like FPGAs so those are not
sea-based you know they generating
native code for things like that is not
necessarily impossible so there's
various levels of why we want to do on
native source generation this is just
telling you again I can talk about my VM
for two hours just on its own it's a
split VM meaning that we are trying to
be we're dealing with resource
constraint devices here so we want to
minimize how much ROM and how much RAM
that we use and split in Java land means
in order to be a fully certified Java VM
you have to be able to load byte codes
verify the byte codes because there's a
whole security model implied in being a
Java VM
and being at Sun I don't have any
at google other places the little java
brand actually matters to my manager and
to his and you know let's go up the food
chain and so what we did is that yes you
need to do all these things but how what
can we do to push and I think dalvik
does something very similar on Android
so it's not something new on the end on
the on the Google side but so this is
what we call a split VM the Sun SPOT
platform library he's got some
interesting drivers for some of the
generic devices that we want to offer
I'll just go through the what the actual
sunspot is so did I lose oh that's
another noise sorry it's three cards ID
two cards in the battery the main board
is pretty beefy so it's 100 megahertz
arm9 half an egg of ram and the key
thing to take away from here is that
it's it's really running Java on the
metal the OS is Java on this device and
again another one of my boss's goals is
to it's kind of a anyway the phrase is
due to power management what Java let's
do this everyone again do the same to
power management as Java did to memory
management and so what's interesting is
because we own the box what we can do is
very simple things so also all threads
are waiting on some event to occur which
is likely an interrupt or some going to
sleep for a certain amount of time why
not shut the CPU down and then we have
actually on the sunspot we have a little
micro controller that's burning it sits
around 24 micro amps and basically we
set an alarm on it to say hey wake me up
and even though the CPU may not support
deep sleep or you know a form of deep
sleep that little micro control is the
one that's responsible for waking up the
CPU and we start up again and we go and
so we're trying to make it so that when
you write applications
you worry about your applications and
again the sunspots if you look at the
next slide here it turns out the sensors
we have on here are not
she the Sun SPOT are not intended for
production release they are intended to
allow you to build your solution and not
worry about the limitations if you never
you have ever done embedded development
before where you have to scratch for
every single bite every single bit just
to get that one last that's great when
we're trying to optimize price and you
know you've got the whole thing built
but if that's just one piece of the
puzzle why not use one of these we were
at Maker Faire two years ago and this
guy was talking about this pool sensing
device that he that he built it cost him
ten thousand dollars to get up to a
point where he can actually test this
system and work with it and we gave him
a spot kit he came back the next morning
and was almost in tears going where can
I get more of these things because it
was actually cheaper for him anyway to
distribute these things but you get the
idea I think so the one of the key
things like I said early on the Sun SPOT
is the out of the box experience is
important to us so we actually tried to
include things that were interesting
light sensor temperature sensor push
buttons LEDs and so one of my jobs so
that I like to crack jokes so I was
doing a show at M EDD mobile and
embedded developer days where the guys
did a bouncing ball demo we have a
bouncing ball demo on the sunspot I'll
show you afterwards and I like to call
that Java effect someone 8x1 display I
found it funny it was it was quite
interesting I know what I don't know
what my management would think of that
but they're not here I already went
through this the fact that everything is
is open-source to hardware the software
these are data cards that we've built up
over time again everything is available
so sunspot worldcom is where the main
central site is and the code repository
for everything is that spots dev
java.net and there's quite a bit of
information there you can go look at my
VM at squak dev java.net there isn't
quite as much documentation because the
entire squak team is sitting here
where's Derek there Derek white back
there is
is and I are the squat team so okay so
project structure so initially place
them started out as one single project
and it turns out that we came up with
three things that are kind of
interesting
there's Java card 3 running on sunspots
by itself looked like something that
could be very useful for for other
scenarios there's the placement board
itself and then the eg SM daughter card
which I'll show you it will show you at
the very end and everything again is
open source we had intended to check
everything in before Java 1 we were
still writing code the morning actually
the hour before our presentation in
terms of debugging some things I'm
overly optimistic in some cases and we
ran into an interesting bug which you
will see what if we get a chance to demo
so Java card 3 on sunspots so this turns
out to be was a fun project because
we're trying to figure out the Sun SPOT
platform we're trying to be as
expandable as possible and we were
trying to figure out are there other
places within Sun that we could leverage
this so that we could take this
prototyping platform and get it used in
other places and it turns out that Java
card being targeted at small devices was
actually not a bad place to be so I need
to do the usual I think I'm I'm Sun this
is not a compliant Java card 3
implementation ok so and it's you know
I'm gonna reread that again no it's ok
the thing that was really fun so this is
where I got into a bit of trouble but
the the advantages I have access to some
of the licensing engineers without
having to pay for it there was I
actually was able to add Java 5 support
to so to backtrack a bit I went a little
too quickly squawk and sunspots support
Java ME Java micro Edition iymp
information module profile for those of
you who don't deal with Java everyday
Java standards everyday that's basically
Java ME mid P - LCD UI so it's the same
Java that's on phones just take away LCD
UI okay so that Java happens to be stuck
it doesn't support Java 5 syntax so it's
one point two syntax that's I just have
to keep remembering I'm being recorded
here so what's interesting however is
the specs give you a binary level of
compounding what API you must support it
doesn't say anything about what the
original source that generated that
bytecode must look like okay so I
actually went through Java licensing
engineering people and asked them that
direct question can I get in trouble
here they said yes but not from a
licensing perspective so the biggest key
is to stay I I have to say I have to
stay compliant so that brand if I don't
stay compliant I lose that brand and
that's what my boss pays me for okay so
it turns out that the way they did the
Java 5 stuff is if some of you who may
not know this they actually retrofitted
they made that stuff actually work under
1.4 except that I guess at the last
second somebody made one or two little
changes that stopped it so that you dots
you'd have to run on a new VM and that
is they change their load constant so
you could actually low class constants
and they added a new bike code which I
am bleeping on and it turns out there's
a tool called retro Weaver which was
used for Java EE to take Java 5
retrofitted to 1.4 and then be able to
run on on an older tomcat container
there is also one for Java ME but it's
called any polish but you have to pay
for it and it's based on something
called retro Weaver which basically does
retro weaving of the new style to the
old style and it it has a few bugs
and didn't work as well as I would like
but I was able to tweak it to make it
work and that's this was the really fun
part um it's it's it's not completely
done yet I still have to rerun the TCK
so there's yeah let's skip the java part
to get to so it does run will shoot if
people are interested we can show it to
you afterwards it will get through the
talk this was supposed to be like insert
demo here and show you that Java card is
running instead you've got to log and
trust me or should I'll show you
afterwards I'm gonna hand it off to the
guy with the fun toys so this is
basically the placing board which we
made and it is an add-on board to the
Sun support platform and basically what
this add-on board allows you to do is to
take your own SIM card insert it into
the placing board and then you have
telephone and basically it allows the
sunspots to become a SIM card so the
idea here is that on a standard SIM card
we run the authentication algorithms so
that your phone gets access to the GSM
network and then we put the Java car
tree applications on the sunspot and
then we use simple to connect the racing
board to your standard mobile phone
so the idea here is basically that of
course on the standard mobile phone the
standard SIM card you just use your own
SIM card to get access to the mobile
network on the transport we have access
to sensors and communication interfaces
and then we can make java quadtree
applications that take advantage of
these sensors and basically allow us to
to emulate very advanced sim cards that
have for instance embedded sensors and
embedded the communication interfaces
and what is the what why is it
interesting to have embedded the
communication interfaces inside the SIM
card for instance if you have the Wi-Fi
radio inside the SIM card it would mean
that you could have SIM cards talk to
each other directly so we have basically
a secure platform where we can have you
know peer-to-peer communication without
going through the mobile network and
when they couple this with you know MEMS
technology and embedded sensors it
becomes basically a very powerful
platform so um to make this work in
order to get the mobile phone to log on
the mobile network we have a state
machine running inside the driver for
the placing board on the sunspot and
this state machine basically determines
if we should send the command to the
real SIM card or if we should handle the
command locally inside the sunspot so
there is basically a master/slave
relationship between the mobile phone
and the SIM card so the phone will
continuously execute commands on the SIM
card and what you do is basically that
inside the driver on the sunspot
he basically intercept all the commands
that the mobile phone is trying to
execute on the SIM card
and then we determine based on our state
and what kind of command the phone is
trying to execute we determine if the
command should be executed on the SIM
card or if you should have let locally
on the sunspot so for instance when the
phone asked to run the gsm
authentication algorithms which requires
a secret quickies stored inside the SIM
card then we forward that command to the
real SIM card but for instance if there
is some proactive command in order to
for instance display a message on the on
the terminal or for instance to send and
receive SMS messages in order to for
instance to trigger the opening of a
browser on a mobile phone then we handle
that by the sunspot and this basically
enable us to you know allow students to
take their own SIM cards put into this
platform and basically have complete you
know freedom to to play around with with
the capabilities of the mobile phones
and what they can do with these SIM card
interfaces so this is a little bit about
the background for this platform so the
problem now is that the Java card tree
enables sim cards are not yet widely
available they are available only in
very limited numbers and of course with
the standard SIM cards you have the
problem that it's not easily easy to
hook up sensors to a standard SIM card
that is embedded in plastic but with the
Sun SPOT we have basically a platform
where we can hook up any conceivable
sensor like a GPS or almost you know
there is very much possibilities for
what we can do and we can make our own
Adam boards - to extend this platform
with whatever we like another thing here
is that we want to be able to do rapid
prototyping so basically when we have
this platform that allows a lot of
freedom for how we can
back together different boards with
different sensors and different
communication interfaces we basically
want to do live user studies so in the
field we have really user groups having
mobile phones with the sunspot and the
placing board stick here onto the back
of their phone and we can basically
pilot and try how this you know would
work in real life and this is not
possible if you're just doing a
simulation on a on a PC another thing
here is that this platform allows us
also to have additional storage so the
next generation of sim cards they have
actually embedded flash memory so
there's actually two physical chips
inside the sim card one is the main
processor and the other is is external
flash and then you can have actually
gigabytes of flash memory in a standard
sim card and we also have a new
communication interfaces so in in Norway
we are experimenting with embedded the
Wi-Fi directly inside the SIM card and
this will basically allows SIM cards to
talk to each other directly it will also
allow you to use your PC to connect to
your SIM card directly using the Wi-Fi
and that is very nice because on your
sim card you will probably have a lot of
services that you access from your
mobile phone but some of these services
may you also may want to access them
using your browser on your normal
piecing that would be possible if you
have embedded wireless LAN in the sim
card so of course we cannot think about
everything that can be done with such
the platform so I use a team of students
basically to to have the freedom to play
around with this and come up with new
and exciting services and IDs so we want
to have a cooperation with universities
we have a lot of cooperation with local
university in in trondheim they already
play around with some sports
so they don't they can just get our new
Adam board and put their or or other
work through the sunspots they already
own and they will be up and running now
we will also want to cooperate with SIM
vendors then also any developer that
want to participate so we have defined
the java.net project there is of course
as you heard no content yet but we will
check in our designs both software and
hardware
quickly but quite soon and we will
hopefully it not too long time be able
to sell this this boards online and they
will not be that expensive because there
actually they are there are not that
complex actually so maybe we have a demo
there is no camera here so we can
probably just
no actually no it's it is only a TV
network actually here I have another
wireless seat bar now let us see the
shaking this so probably take some fun
because was
we've run into this isn't working in
progress so Cuba if you put the sensor
board on top there these are stackable
on the spot there seems to be additional
issues and when you're on stage with mr.
Gosselin so basically this so Sebastian
told you about the possibility for
having a servlet engine on the sim card
in Java Khatri so you basically use your
browser or a Java ME application on your
mobile phone
to access the services on the sim card
and this is really nice because the
interface that you used to interact with
the sim card today is called sim toolkit
and it's very limited you can display
text but it is it is not very fancy so
basically with Java quadtree we have the
optimal possibility to actually actually
access the services on the sim card as
web applications and they can contain
pictures and other other things and then
actually we need the high speed
interface in order to be able to
transfer pictures and me
then back in back and forth with the
card so we also want to add the USB
support to this this platform in order
to be able to fill a experiment with the
java country the platform you also want
to experiment with how the api on the
service book should be be designed so
basically how students can you know have
easy access to you know menus and these
proactive commands on the on the mobile
phone this this card can also be used it
has a USB interface basically this
placing card and the USB interface can
be used both to upgrade the firmware on
this device so that you don't need an
expensive jade tank programmer but it
could also be used to communicate with
the PC subacute in this theory run the
complete Java card tree environment on a
PC and use this just as a
man-in-the-middle with auto sunspots so
we could actually use this as a
communication tracer so that students
that are going to learn about SIM cards
they can use this platform to actually
look into what is going on between the
SIM card and their mobile phone and we
also want to add support for while islam
and why is that well as you probably all
layered in other way we are
experimenting with wireless LAN and I
will SIM card and we want to use this
platform also for experimenting with
wireless LAN connectivity on the sim
card and then we actually have to make a
new add-on board on top of this which
has wireless LAN embedded radio so we
made more hardware basically when we
started to play around with sunspots
we're also looking into this kind of
what should I say it's a it's a
basically a GSM phone in in the module
we thought it would be quite cool to add
the gsm connectivity to the sunspots
so we basically design another atom
board to to the sunspots and maybe eric
has demo so i'm here to present you yet
another one and we call it spot phone
what do you think and what's even cooler
about this is the user interface happens
to be one of these things but you know
what's generic about it is the fact that
I guess I should step back on here is it
can work from any phone so if you want
to make a call you simply send it in an
SMS message I could call me or call
someone else or if you want to answer
the phone just send it an SMS message to
take answer
and guess what to hang up what do you do
now you remember the pet 2001 story and
somewhat of an old fart at this point
you can also say hello Aliza and it
replies responds back and says hello how
are you
if you ask about your mother's is what
do you think about your family we were
trying to figure out some interesting
stuff to do with this obviously we had
too much fun with it so there is a demo
that we would like to do because we
actually worked on it last night there's
these sim cards and what we said earlier
the sim is really becoming a computer on
its own one of the things that's really
interesting about this is on the machine
to machine scenario imagine that this is
your deployment platform right the CPU
the application everything is inside
this the sim card does all that and then
this gives you the radio aspect of
things so putting this in Coke machines
electric meters might ring a bell
you know this becomes very interesting
when you can do that with these things
but there's also much more practical
practical sarong term there are other
interesting applications one can apply
so we have a branding demo imagine that
the branding for the phone and your
identity was in one in the SIM card that
would mean from a carrier perspective
you could take your SIM card plug it
into any phone and instead of being
stuck with the ATT branding or t-mobile
or you know whatever bindings are around
there it would pick that up from the
phone I from this SIM card okay so this
is where the storage capabilities become
much more interesting in terms of what
you can do so yes people will think I
can store my music on the SIM card but
you know there are some actual practical
applications especially from an
operator's perspective where you don't
have to wait for someone to come out
with a specially branded phone that's
for you the for me the carrier it's look
the phones built generally get its
personality from the SIM card and rock
on okay so we would like to I you guys
okay with the demo let's see if I can I
need to go into mirror mode here to do
this let's see um might help if I yeah
hold on system settings let's do this
the hard way and I understand there is a
screen up there but my eyes are pretty
bad and blurry but not as blurry as that
screen is so I'm still gonna do this
an arrangement I believe okay okay
King connect removed so what I'm gonna
do here I'm going to try to do this as
quickly as possible and tell you
practiced I understand it takes a bit of
time to run unfortunately so I can
explain to you what it's actually doing
a little bit shabby I got to bring up VM
let's just see let me take a second if
you guys let's do this if you guys have
got questions for Sebastian or V tough I
will take a minute or so to set it up
and then I'll show it to you I think
that would be that the safest thing to
do so there's a hand lifted it's it's
somewhat it already does that today it's
Java card is running on the sim card
already and there's more capable there's
a more capable version of that coming
out and that's already being deployed to
phones and will be deployed to future
phones as well so there already is a
Java platform you can deploy
applications to today but you can do
that you so what the sunspot brings to
the picture is that the more capable SIM
cards are not available yet in a high
enough volume right so to be able to do
tasks and there's also the fact that
building some of these new SIM cards
although fun likely cost a lot of money
so what you'd like to be able to do is
find out which ones are likely to pan
out right so and I think Sebastian is
itching to say something so go Sebastian
yes dear
but I think going is so one of the
reasons he's asking this question is the
flier and by the way I made up that
caption and I made up six of them and
that was the one that was chosen the new
distribution medium for Java
applications so what we're trying to do
here is let you know that there is Java
ME on telephones there is a Java on the
sim card which is in most cellphones and
that that Java is now becoming as
powerful as Java and me was when it
that's really what this is about
we should speak into the mic to make it
worthwhile for the recording but did I
assume that did that answer your
question okay so I'm going to do this
demo you have it trust me we'll have a
chance to talk some more while the demo
is running so if anybody understands the
concept of time boxing it's something
that I I need to practice a little bit
more I'm more like a dog with a bone I
get a problem I will keep at it until I
solve it except that in this case I
actually have to give my presentation an
hour later and the bone had to be let go
for a little bit and there seems to be a
networking issue with so the sunspots
support HTTP outbound I just added MSO
server based sockets so you cannot share
the sunspot opens a socket on the host
that has an appropriate tcp/ip address
and for some reason I've hit a snag
where if I'm trying to pull the data off
my socket it seems to be timing out and
I can't tell where because there's a few
moving parts that I've never dealt with
I'm the VM guy I like writing software
but I do have
so this is a base station which allows
any sunspot to communicate to the to the
internet through this base station out
through the work station okay
so what's happening here is this spot
that's the log that you see over here it
says card ready that's I can show you
it's actually running on the sunspot but
and it's communicating through this to
say open up a server socket then when I
say launch see if I can do this yes you
can see over here that you're getting
debug statements coming out this is
fresh off the press and after they get
packet four there will be a pause that
get packet two and I haven't been that's
it right there so that will take roughly
ten seconds to twelve seconds for every
HTTP request and the the little test
application that we have makes a couple
of HTTP requests so that ten seconds is
very painful if you're trying to demo to
people but what we're trying to show
what we wanted to show here where we
were at the booth was that we have these
the reason we had that big SIM card
plastic folding thing of the plastic
thing that you saw we were gonna tape
that on the back of a sunspot and
pretend you were plugging that into your
phone and we have one that says Telenor
and one that says D juice and show you
that the the same phone go unquote boot
it up with a different SIM card would
have a different look and if the gods
are smiling on me which so far I guess I
shouldn't jinx it so there is some
really cool debugging stuff you can do
with sunspots so it's got its got wild
remote debugging which is really cool
however when you try to debug the
wireless aspect of things it's a little
more difficult and I'm a little bit
annoyed debt and I have to take this on
myself that I didn't do the USB based
debugging then I could at least do by I
couldn't by USB based stuff but I could
at least debug so anyway so what you're
seeing here is all this branding
information is actually coming through
from
thus the sim card which is this sunspot
I wish that my sticker on there but and
yes it's taking a long time it's not
intended to be that way and that's one
of the reasons why the wireless
interface is interesting to us for doing
this this SIM card with a real phone is
that the communication channel between
the sim card and the terminal today is
painfully slow right it's nineteen six
you said earlier and with the USB
interface coming up this is where these
things get interesting oh there you go
and there's the theming and everything
is coming from and if you had the
patience I would show you the deegeu
sunspots and it would show you a DG's
brightening with you know different set
of images and look and feel okay
we showed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
