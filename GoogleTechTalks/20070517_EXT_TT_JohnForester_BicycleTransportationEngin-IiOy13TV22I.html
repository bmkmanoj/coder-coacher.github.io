author of several books involving
bicycle transportation engineering with
several other areas of engineering
background some of the aspects of
cycling are not necessarily obvious and
he has become a bit of a controversial
figure in the cycling community we are
delighted to have him here today and to
talk about things that need to be done
engineering to for cyclists in America
John Force are welcome thank you thank
you I'm going to talk about what I will
call the management of bicycle
transportation which is the part of
bicycle transportation that is most
poorly done in America or many other
places too for that matter but here we
are Silicon Valley nice to live here
Olivia for a long time don't leave right
now all right I'm going to start out by
pointing out that the shape of cities in
large urban areas has always been
directed and limited by the type of
transportation that is available to them
you can't grow a city if people can't
get to the hours end or get from the
countryside where all the food comes
from into the city you have to have
transportation and therefore to a great
extent the shape and composition of
cities has been dictated by the
technology of transportation that has
been available some of you may not like
it some of you may think well we should
stick with a bicycle age will that be
nice wouldn't it but we can't
unfortunately the modern city
started out of course in medieval times
or even way back before that we're
talking about horse travel for weights
and foot travel for people by and large
but the first assistance to this aside
from waterways which were very important
for those places that were on a waterway
and many of our cities if you notice
started out life as ports I the ocean
ports or river ports but a aside from
the water which was a very restricted
resources only available some places why
the first assistance to transportation
came in the form of rail first steam
then electric diesel whatever now rail
has particular characteristics you have
to put a lot of money into building a
line which has high capacity if you can
find the traffic for it which means
therefore that rail lines got built
along the best places for lots of
traffic which made sense but they did
not go everywhere America tried to send
rail lines all over the Middle West the
farmer lines the grainger lines and
they're all dead and gone because it's
not enough traffic in agricultural
product to support a great number of
very closely spaced rail lines and then
when you got the city's rail carrying
people even at the start of the steam
line you also had horse-drawn streetcars
and later on 1888 and later you had
electric streetcars into urban lines and
things like that but even so the capital
costs were high so that the number of
lines was restricted and they all had to
go someplace that was useful so they all
went downtown
so you had a radiating star-shaped
pattern of rail lines well that worked
fine because people grew up with it and
the city develops around it to get from
one branch to another branch you went
into the central city and came out again
on a different line lots of people had
to do that on occasion but didn't do it
every day and between lines you still
had first horse storm traffic and later
motor traffic and of course right the
for motor traffic you had bicycle
traffic and that traffic which was
slower than trains but it filled in the
gaps so that you could ride from one
branch line to another branch line by
bicycle and it was good transportation
or you could live somewhere that wasn't
directly served by the rail line and get
onto it and you go downtown to where
your job was then the car came along and
upset that whole pattern because the car
could go anywhere and streets were much
cheaper to build and maintain the rail
lines and the cars could use streets
essentially without immediate charging
forum you paid for him in the end but it
was all distributed so the car went
anywhere just like the bicycle did
trouble is the car went faster it could
carry more things or more people and
therefore it became suitable for general
transportation use and once that became
true suburbs grew up and people traveled
by car will be to work for Social
Affairs or educational affairs or
whatever anywhere they wanted to in the
city and as a result of that
the import economic importance of
downtown dropped and for many of the
services you found them growing up in
the suburbs so you had suberb to suburb
travel going all over every which way
and you know that's what you have today
here except of course San Francisco Bay
has this great big hole in the middle we
called the bay and so everything is sort
of strung out in a like a necklace
around it that changes things a little
bit but not all that much so you have a
situation whereby free path travel is
the norm but it is made up partly of
bicycle travel and unfortunately more so
by automotive travel and that has
spurred the development of the modern
city and you'll find that something like
eighty percent or more of America's
growth since the start of the automobile
lyric became very popular shall we say
started suburbia in 1950 if you want to
look at that way that's not the earliest
date though but something like eighty
percent of the growth since then has
been in suburbs which cannot efficiently
be served by mass transit and therefore
your two choices are car or bicycle
that's what amounts to well there's lots
of value in riding the bicycle but you
cannot expect that bicycle travel is
going to take the place of very much of
the automotive travel that's being made
now you all know that you're making
trips that your neighbors think or silly
they flew too far too dangerous whatever
and you know it can be done therefore
you know that quite a few of those
neighbors could make trips and indeed
it's worth you know persuading them when
they can but you also find that a whole
lot of them make trips that you just
really can't do
by bicycle and they get involved with
families where they have links trips in
other words it's not this average trip
distance is only three and a half miles
the statistic it you see it's because
you get a whole bunch of three and a
half mile trips and you end up before
you after work before you get home with
the kids they're having driven 16 miles
or something with a load as well so
there it is bicycling is going to be a
method of transportation that's good for
those who can and those who want it's
good for your health it's good for lots
of things it might even be cheaper to
you know considering the price of
bicycles these days that sometimes one
wonders but there it is and bicycles
will last a long time to my oldest one
is the oldest one I ride regularly is I
bought in 50 55 I think and it's still
going strong but you know new wheels new
hubs new cranks new everything almost
enough to to top tube broke that thinks
that all right so what has happened to
bicycle transportation in these years up
to the 1960s the motorists didn't worry
about bicycle travel it was kids and
they could be you know looked after by
their parents they didn't vote anyway
too and they didn't ride all those
places strange places and beside which
the car was the coming thing bicycles
were outdated and along comes the
turmoil of the 1960s when due to what
happens you got a new suburban family
they moved out to levittown in 1954 with
one car an elementary school kids now
they still got only one car but they got
high school kids who have social lives
and they start riding bicycles I mean
they've always had bicycles but now they
started using for transportation to get
around
and then you got the political turmoil
Vietnamese Ward all this stuff and
people trying to stay in school longer
and and do various other things which
prevented them from learning a whole lot
of money so there they are riding
bicycles for more years than everybody
else had expected so by the late 60s the
motorists thought they looked at this
graph it was called the bike boom graph
and the bike boom really lasted only
from nineteen sixty eight to nineteen
sixty nine and a half or something you
know but still they called it the bike
boom they looked at this exponential
curve and they said my god they're going
to fill up our roads they didn't realize
of course you see that the prerequisite
to having all that many cycles filling
up your roads could only have occurred
in bedrooms some 20 years earlier and it
happened not to that quantity so it was
it was utterly pointless but they got
frightened and they decide what to do
about it we'll keep these guys off to
the edge of the road decide which
they're incompetent they mostly kids and
they don't know how to write anyway
don't know how to drive properly so
we'll shove them off the side of the
road and California invented the first
bike lane systems designs in in America
not quite the first in the Western world
but the first ones that as a result of
our agitation against them started to
have as much science as we could apply
to them and get rid of the worst dangers
but there it was the motorists invented
the bike lane system and they invented
it for their own convenience on the
excuse that cyclists were too dumb did
you know did you know that here you are
Stanford graduates and all that did you
know that straddling a bicycle destroys
your brains it turns you into children
who don't know how to drive yeah no no
well so
then comes the environmental group and
they believe all this stuff that the
motor has been telling them about being
incapable or riding in traffic and they
said all these bikeways they weren't
invented to shove us aside keep us out
of the way the motorists they were
invented to make cycling safe for
beginners and at that point we cyclists
lost the battle because it was
overwhelming political force came along
and said bikeways that's the way to go
well is it what advantages were claimed
one they made cycling safe or much safer
shall we say you can't say safe
arbitrarily you look at the accident
pattern and at this time we first
started getting decent statistics from a
man named cross in Southern California
and he showed that the straight-ahead
cyclists being hit from behind by the
straight-ahead motorist was in his first
study 0.5% of all car by collisions that
was Santa Barbara County and then he did
a national study and by the way that
Santa Barbara County you will never see
a copy of it I have a copy of it because
I was in the meeting at which cross
presented it and like a fool I got up
and said John I just said this doesn't
this is the case against bikeways hence
no further copies have been available to
anybody now anyway he got a contract for
a national sample for different states
representing different parts of the
nation and more representative of the
country and there you might look at the
figure there might be two percent or
something like that depends whether you
want to count daytime ones only or
nighttime ones as well with their other
complications or whether you want to
count rural ones which are different
from urban ones okay small number so the
other claim was there especially
suitable for beginners now when you ride
on in the city with a bike lane system
you're still going to have to ride on
streets they don't have bike lanes so
you still need all the skills that's not
only part of it when you are writing on
the street with a bike lane on it you
have to have all the skills that you
already have for writing on a normal
Road and then sometimes and inevitably
there are places where ever you put in a
bike lane system there are some places
where it really shouldn't have been put
in but it was put in just to make
continuity so people don't get lost or
whatever and those places you have to
outwit the designers so you got to know
how to do that in addition to new having
a normal Road skills well and the other
one was that oh this is anti motoring it
will reduce motoring even here I'm going
to say that I doubt whether you have
reduced the motoring intake into Google
by 1% I doubt it but maybe wrong okay
but I'm going to say is that it's
unfortunate that motoring is not going
to be significantly reduced such that
you're going to save significant amounts
of oil or do away with significant
that's a highway or whatever as a result
of the amount of bicycle transportation
being done it just doesn't have that
capability so we are stuck now for those
people who choose to ride because it's
good for them either their health their
money or quicker or whatever or perhaps
they work in a place where you can't get
cars in like many campuses okay people
who write it right because they want to
and because they also we're talking
about America you find that many people
say oh yes Dutch bikeways are wonderful
Dutch bikeways they got a forty fifty
sixty percent bicycle mode share in
Amsterdam well sure they do it's a
medieval city it's a pre automotive
obsolete city and then that word
and who are motoring is extremely
difficult well you can't park your car
at home because there's no place to park
it you got to go find your parking place
wherever it was then you get through
narrow streets and cramped slow traffic
to get where you want to go and you
can't leave it there either so you go
park it somewhere else then you walk
back well shorts it's easier to get on
the bike and trundle along at six miles
an hour because that's faster than what
you've been going by car yeah sure
that's not going to work in America
because in America your competition is
not hoping to be faster than walking
it's hoping to be not so much slower
than motoring that it's going to stop
you from doing it so by and large speed
for many cyclists is important you're
really short range probably doesn't make
much difference but if you're going to
have to travel the same kind of
distances that I've had to travel lemon
miles or more each way and sometimes a
thousand foot a climb well it makes a
difference to how well you do it and
you're trying to do it fairly fast you
want good roads you want good traffic to
be with you and that ought to be
organized on a rational basis what's the
rationale basis well traffic on the
roads operates according to the rules of
the road for drivers of vehicles you can
say in shorthand some respects the
traffic laws that's not exactly true but
the traffic laws have been written and
worked over so they try to represent the
legally enforceable way of stating the
principles by which traffic operates
except for a couple of them like if
there's a path along there you can't
ride on the roadway that's not one of
the standard traffic rules because if so
there'd be 18-wheelers over there knew
they wouldn't want that would they so
that's not the right kind of general
rule that we're talking about we're
talking about the rules for drivers of
vehicles
and those have been worked out now you
can say that they're fairly simple and
I'm going to give a quick run through
its if you're using the road you're
entitled to use it first come first
served so that if you and that includes
your stopping distance ahead of you now
you know a little bit of space around
you so that when you're rolling along
the street is protected by stop signs
motorist kick it's not allowed to come
right out in front of you okay so you
run into him it's not allowed okay next
one is you right on the right hand side
of the road right in the left hand side
of the road all kinds of horrible
troubles and every once in a while you
read of a motorist who gets the wrong
way on something and there's big head on
smash well you might not end up in the
head on motor to motor smash but you
aren't you're like seeing those head
lamp shining at you okay then between
intersections you're going to Jin
general you right you're slower than
most other traffic so you try and now
stay right let the fastest traffic go by
but you don't stay so like that so far
right that you endanger yourself and now
that depends on the kind of wrote some
roads have just terrible ragged edges
you can't stay away from that some roads
have nice curbs some roads have nice
smooth gutter pans although most aren't
I can remember the years when paving
wits restricted because of the World War
two we wrote on the gutter pants because
the concrete was smoother than the tire
which hadn't been maintained for years
of course that got fixed later on you
know and now we generally stay off
gutter pants okay then when you are
approaching and Nas it when you are
entering a roadway you have to yield to
traffic on that road way particularly if
that roadway is a bigger one than the
one you're on protected by stop signs
yes or just simply when you're coming
out of your driveway which is
things really big compared to the street
you have to look both ways and yield
yielding means looking to see that
nothing is coming so close as to be a
danger then you can move and that works
true if you're moving laterally on the
roadway to you look over your shoulder
look ahead oh yeah they are and lastly
when you are approaching an intersection
you figure that things are set up so if
people want to turn right there over by
the curb the people want to turn left
there out by the middle of the road and
if you won't go straight year between
the two okay you follow those and those
rules are easy to comprehend and easy to
follow traffic cycling just like traffic
motoring is not difficult now the well
throw a whole lot of stuff in your motor
vehicle driving examination about what
do you do buy a green painted curb and
the yellow painted curb doesn't matter
to you you know and it's not one of the
driving principles anyway I worked out
those six principles because I was faced
with the job of teaching children for
adults they never work it out it worked
that way but they never said so but I
can teach eight year old children to
ride properly on two-lane residential
streets following most those rules they
don't need the multiple lane rule okay
and fifth graders they can write any
kind of street except some of the very
peculiar places we get high speed right
hand curves on you and things like that
because those rules are simple to follow
simple to understand and anybody who can
play a game of soccer has got the mental
and physical equipment to write in
traffic up to the level 0 which their
maturity allows ok so children do think
a bit now
that's the way cyclist should operate
but our government and our society has
opposed it they've opposed it because
the motorists wanted safety for their
own children who they did not teach to
ride bicycles and they wanted
convenience too and it's hard to
separate you know self interest from
other interests it's hard to separate
they're all there though so for motorist
convenience and the safety of their
children who they kept ignorant they
wanted to have a system set up so that
people who didn't know how to ride
properly could ride safely and they
never achieved it they did things like
teaching children to make left turns by
riding along the road of course smash
bang because they have looked behind as
a result of me saying for years the
cyclists could look over their shoulder
one of the safety organizations of
government let a contract to see whether
that was true or not I mean can you
imagine spending money on a research
project for such an obvious conclusion
but the government did that just tells
you what society thinks okay so we've
got this system whereby the a bunch of
people and a lot of people who would
like to see more cycling and less
motoring say we need to have more of
bike lanes bike paths etc and they want
more of a system which was invented by
motorists to discriminate against them
on the basis that they were incompetent
that's not a rational way to run a
bicycle transportation program
a rational bicycle transportation
program will be set up on the assumption
that we can teach cyclists or at least
most of them one way or another we can
expect that they will obey the rules of
the road and if you notice there are no
rule traffic laws that contradict the
rules of the road some of them like
saying we don't let you ride out
anywhere except right next to the curb
or we won't let you write on the road at
all we irrelevant that path but the
traffic experts knew they wouldn't ever
dare write a law that said cyclists have
to collide with motorists by doing
something different so okay we we've
always therefore legally expected it
even though socially we didn't well
that's the tangle that we're in what we
need to be able to do is to convince
government and the motoring
establishment three is a shorthand term
that they should really expect cyclists
to operate according to the rules the
road and they should provide roads which
are suitable for that activity depending
on how much of it there is around I mean
after all we none of us here are
expected to write it up and down 101
right because it's a freeway and because
there are plenty of surface streets
around on the other hand you cross
Donner summit nowadays particularly in
winter when you can't go over the old
road because it's all snowed in they
don't plow it out anymore you go over
considerable sections of i-80 but
they're out in the country and you just
riding along on the shoulder doesn't
matter same thing in the Salinas Valley
coming up from san luis obispo there
quite a few places where there are
really the nearest farm roads they don't
go the same direction as the highway
deals you have to go to Ziggy
tagging and get lost then they let you
ride the highway shoulder okay that's
fine but by and large government should
expect and it says it does expect the
cyclists will be found on any road and
that means to say things like parallel
bar drain grates go in the wrong way I
have seen a few of those in the last few
years in Southern California mm-hmm but
I thought they were all gone you know
because people knew they were dangerous
these were new construction to sue and
and there were lawsuits as a result
somebody fell in them and then you have
just plain smooth surfaces you want
traffic lights that work for you you
want more right turn only lanes because
right turn only lanes get the right
turning motorists off to your right
before you get to the corner where they
turn across you so people say oh well
don't like right turn only lanes well if
people go in cars are going to turn
right they're going to turn right it's
better to have them merge right with a
safe flight way to do it because they
can go ahead of you or behind you then
to turn right across you so more right
turn only lanes I would say more left
turn lanes with protected left turn
signals the highest frequency motorists
cause car back collision is the left
turning motorist hitting a straight
through cyclist and if that motorist has
a left is waiting for green arrow he
won't get that green air until you've
seen a red stop sign and you stopped and
same way if you want to turn left when
you make a left turn with that left turn
our you know you're protected too so
more of that kind of cyclist useful
traffic improvement is worth getting
government to do but they tend try they
don't want to do it for just cyclists
particularly pleased they say oh yes B
is supposed to be over here on the bike
lane and then they quote all enormous
numbers of people who say oh yes haven't
you seen this review why 72.3 four
percent
of the people who answered this question
said yes they would ride to work if they
had a bike way I mean you know it's art
you see these all the time and not one
of them makes a nice any statistical
sense at all so we need to have in
addition to that legal and governmental
action we need to have rational social
acceptance of the fact that any person
who's going to be mature enough to write
a bicycle on the streets can also be
trained to do it properly I'm not
talking about four year olds now I had a
four-year-old daughter and she had a
pedal car but it and she wore the tires
clean off it because she was wild but I
wouldn't let her on the street with a
pedal car you understand but on the
other hand six-year-old and seven year
old children my children and others I've
taught them to ride properly I've taught
classes of students third grade
therefore they were approximately eight
years old some a bit younger you know
but it was summertime they either just
left the third grade or they were just
going into the third grade some of each
and I can teach them in 15 class hours
at a pupil teacher ratio 127 I have a
bunch of assistant lady cyclists mothers
mainly to teach mrs. up a nut mountain
view just what's the next place north of
Palo Alto mental mental park is a mental
part and we taught kids of that age and
we also sampled in different groups we
taught kids of in the fifth grade as
well and we taught them so they could
write on any two-lane residential street
age of eight and they would operate
better than any group of adults general
populace adults I've measured in any
city I've been in and I've measured
quite a few of them fairly easy to do
it's like a driving test you know
and only you follow them along in a
bicycle and instead of this thing here
which I have here it you have instead of
tape recorder with a little button so
that when you see see somebody riding
along and you want to come in on it make
a comment you push the button then you
take off then you push the button you
can do eight hours of research and you
come out with 40 minutes a tape that's
practical you know and you write the
scores down afterwards so it can be done
and if we have a combination of rational
social policies and rational government
policies with respect to proper cycling
you'll probably get more cycling which
is good because you know kind of force
people to do it people are going to get
into it because they find it's good for
them that's good and you will have fewer
troubles and you'll probably have a
lower accident rate so that's what i'm
saying is necessary to be done to
significantly improve bicycle
transportation in the American scene in
the modern city question say the know
you have barely
apparently complicated structures
before devices have gathered some flight
paths and so on which are far more than
any I've seen us would that is that
deserve all with that okay the question
is the classic comment you'll have to
repeat the questions for what's going on
the question is the classic comment that
they have much more cycling in places
like the Netherlands particularly and
some other northern European countries
then they have here now the Netherlands
all the cities there were started
medieval times or before narrow streets
designed for horse-drawn traffic and not
a whole lot of that either and they have
grown up they became rich in their
colonial era spice trade and things like
that and you got lots of fancy buildings
and things but still on the same rather
cramped walking scale distances and then
by the time the cars start the cars be
starting to become popular in America
Holland was again a poor nation motoring
didn't come to Holland on a mass scale
until 10 or 15 years after the close of
World War two so they suddenly had the
problem what to do with the cars that we
can now afford and want but they also
found that in the older cities car
motoring was very difficult and there
are two sets of stories once set says
yes we know there's motoring coming and
our streets are very narrow and all that
but motoring is the coming thing so
we're going to push the cyclist aside
and the other one says oh these cars are
all going to be terribly dangerous so
we'll have to make facilities to save
cyclists frankly I place a little more
faith in the first explanation in a
second in any case you have a place
where you have short distances slow
speeds
and there and we're not simply slow
speeds we're motoring but as I've said
the actual effort to earn the ax
required to make a motoring trip in
Amsterdam it's just very complicated
because your car isn't where you want it
and what you can leave it is not where
you want to go so the competitively
speaking cycling is much much more you
they consider cycling to be better than
walking which is quite true it's faster
than walking and in that climate in
another place in that distance it is not
all that much sweat making or whatever
so it works for them but I will say that
the rural paths in Holland they were the
first bikeways built and they were built
to accommodate the rural farm workers
who were going to slow down the
intercity cars the cars on the rural
roads and of course what happened what
happened in America Wilma with Ford's
Model T the farmers all bought it
because he lived out in the country
needed it same thing happened in Holland
so now we have pads which are wonderful
for touring but they're not used by the
people that were designed for some of
your question yes I'm 73 years
after I dim sum
cycling here I don't think it's safe
enough that I cuz I that we haven't
addressed the safety aspect too much in
terms of know people is going to get
after it last unless it's a that
precedes
and I have to say the traffic response a
you have buses on all the sides of the
Viking roads from the other side because
people
oh yes yes yes yes you a question is
refers to the intensity of traffic in
America being unsafe recycling well yeah
I mean stay out of the door zone you and
don't run into double parked cars just
go around them but I agree with you San
Francisco is an extremely congested city
for motor traffic however here is the
point there's nothing practical that we
could do about it that would improve the
situation for cyclists there's no extra
room for bike paths on the Amsterdam
model and if you did have them cyclists
will be as it with the traffic there
they have to go slow and be easy now
I've written quite a lot in San
Francisco and I lift up in this area I
lived in the bay area from 1942 1998
mostly not entirely and I've written all
over these places and is not if you do
it right it's not as bad as you say and
what I'm saying as well the supposed the
improvements end up making it worse
rather than better which is a shame now
I agree that traffic could be better
behaved in San Francisco sure I agree
with that
what is slowing down traffic so spoken
for exactly in inner city of in stone
I making Garland's narrower and more
typical evidence means people sold out
england is bestest much private party
network and everyone is safer to slower
pitch what is practical things which can
be done and i don't see that these other
person's being taken just say that cycle
should be here on the road in san
francisco that's all coming up improve
my safety with the matter of narrowing
lanes versus speed is definitely
unsettled some people that some measure
will show it does slow motor traffic
some people say it doesn't but in
America you got except for places like
San Francisco you tend to have much
greater distances and people are moving
faster simply because that is the kind
of distance they've got now we had some
other questions back there your rational
principles for slightly
yield but ever since stop signs of liver
the content and the police have turned
into a bunch
stopping and stuff it's like you know
fundamental thing you enjoyed the
bicyclist like yes I understand the
perennial stop sign question okay now
you speak to any traffic engineer who
knows his subject and he will say those
damn politicians that make us stop signs
every place where they shouldn't and
they're referring to political pressures
for doing it I cycled 1500 miles in
England 1985 my lady friend and as I
recall we saw two stop signs in 1,500
miles yield signs in quite a few places
and you speak any traffic engineer who's
responsible and he knows but we've gone
stop sign crazy and as a result of that
is the California stop which is treat it
like a yield sign and you see motors
doing all the time even in times when
they shouldn't which is unfortunate yes
I had a question about bicycle
pedestrian safety in particular moving
and bicycles into the same separate
roadway never ah yes you see so your
camp trail you know where that is it's a
poet this alongside Crystal Springs
reservoir there's a little sign up there
saying it's a beautiful road by the way
this was a public road from 1840 18-49 I
think on until nineteen ninety-five or
sometimes some date like that it was a
public road and now they got signs up on
it because it's no motor traffic because
it part of the part of the park and they
have I the you know the skyline freeway
I forget 280 along there have it a speed
limit sign 15 miles an hour yeah yeah
and I there's a very famous trail
alongside it was a railroad route along
the northern edge of Lake Washington
which is just behind the lake that's
behind seattle and it's why it's sort of
in the same sense like like like the san
francisco bay with marin county on the
torque and in san francisco where
seattle is or the other way around
anyway so all the way around that the
north edge of that water they had
railroad tracks which got abandoned they
had a few houses beachfront houses so to
speak but not very many of them because
not many people want the trains they're
all that so there's almost no cross
traffic they turned that into a bike
path burke gilman trail and it feeds the
university of washington a bunch of
other things very famous and they have
speed limit signs on that league of
american wheelman held their annual
convention there oh about nineteen
eighty one or something I forget now and
we on the board we're up there going for
rides and saying oh this is where they
the organizers the local organizers the
scheduled rides so we went out and
started coming back along there and well
you see they all said oh it's marvelous
absolutely safe and all that
so I got out and tried to proceed it
quite safe speed you know um 22 miles an
hour shall we say on the road no trouble
at all not at all and they they probably
even afterwards there hey was it you
should not have ridden so dangerously I
said I wasn't riding dangerously I was a
true I was very careful but I wasn't i
was being much more careful and much
more alert than I have to be on the
roadway I mean yeah all those damned
pedestrians will not get down yes the
need to educate cyclist about the motor
vehicle code if we educated cyclists
everybody would you say for putting
seems that one of the principal
it's a popping strike program and having
bicycle lanes is that it educates
vehicle traffic there could be a bicycle
on this road I cycle in San Francisco on
the bike weighs following the motor
vehicle code because they're safer on
those roads because those drivers have
been a little more sensitized to the
fact that there could be a bicycle pay
attention when you turn right in your
very large SUV I will ask you have you
seen oh yes yes great question bike lane
sensitize motorists to the possibility
that they might have to avoid a cyclist
I will ask you have you ever seen any
scientific demonstration of this claim I
never have I don't think it exists well
the bike lane proponents of which you
may be one or so have advanced this
argument for 35 years and they've had
some hundreds of studies published on
sort of related subjects and they've
never demonstrated a hoot worth a solid
evidence that any of the claims which I
have mentioned happens to be true if
they can't find something in 35 years of
quite a lot of money whereas people like
myself who for no money at all have and
very not all that much time and simply
applied standard traffic engineering
principles and our own cycling
experience and the cross statistics
which we were paid for by government
until they learn better why if we come
up with different conclusions I think
it's highly unlikely that any further
effort directed to finding scientific
support for bike weighs in general
whichever kind they are is likely to
turn up enough evidence to reverse the
balance of evidence that now exists
I'm sorry on educating drivers no you
should do the best that you can for that
yeah oh okay no I I think that society
should be alerted to the importance and
the ease and the results to be expected
by training cyclists to operate properly
as I said 15 class hours even for young
kids and they will ride on any street
that you think they might be suitable
for writing and do it better than the
average adult pop you touch better than
the average average adult population
today if you can get that through and
you can get the organizations that would
support that I'm not saying the public
schools they got too much on their minds
and it this is a specialized thing not
general public if you can get the people
who are interested in cycling to operate
that kind of class and persuade people
to come that's very good the best thing
you can do sorry one moment yeah yes oh
thank you um I was wondering if you'd be
able to compare rates of cycling on
populations in the US with traditional
bicycle infrastructure facilities that
have shown a significant increase the
number of riders I'm thinking in
particular of Portland Oregon and davis
california and compare that populations
who participated in bicycle safety
courses like you mentioned in menlo park
oh yes the perennial question do
bikeways demonstrate increased he quoted
davis well the catch about Davis is that
the cycling population has gone down no
here's what happened to Davis Davis was
the agricultural experimentation station
until nineteen sixty-five or some day
like that and then this the statewide
university plan was to grow that to a
standard campus of 20,000 students in
this little town in the middle
the Sacramento Valley yes they were
greatly worried and indeed they got lots
of cyclists but they would have had lots
of cyclists anyway regardless of what
they did a bottom and there again two
stories about that yeah you speak to bob
summer and day a lot and they say oh we
were all out for for protecting cyclists
against this influx of motorists coming
in with the school and you speak to
people who hang around city politics for
a while and they said yeah yeah we were
really worried about having our streets
all clogged up with all those student
cyclists both sides the story but ever
since the installation of the free bus
service around the Davis UC Davis campus
cycling is dropped regardless of
facilities and here's the point when you
are a student in davis and you can't
park your car on campus how are you
going to get there you're going to write
a bicycle or take the free bus nowadays
but before that you wrote a bicycle they
didn't matter in davis of all places
whether there were special facilities or
not so and a couple of those facilities
are very weird but that's beside the
point and I there was another city
mentioned Portland Oregon and nobody has
ever demonstrated that their citywide
program for reducing motoring and
increasing cycling has produced the
result it has which is true there are
some result there but nobody's ever
produce it was the bike ways that did it
rather than all the other things that
they were doing no you know it was too
many confounding causes question back
there
extra-wide on the second lane to the
right but no actual stripe of em up
another half that was on an actual bike
lanes worst writer I really appreciate
the fact that I have more rooms are
leading out of hard to avoid
door is it just the stripe on the road
thank you yo Jeff two words in the
action captain County more room in the
right hand lane
well yes the question is versus white
outside lane vs. bike lane with stripe
well you said you had more room all I
will say to you is you got the room you
use just ride along and you got that
room when the motorists will go around
you because they have to they're not
going to right smack over you and risked
all those possibilities might scratch
their paint too you know but but the
point is that the stripe confuses
people's minds about what's right to do
whereas a white outside lane which is a
technical name for what you were saying
the white outside lane does not
introduce this extra element of
confusion and it indicates that which is
true even if the stripe is there you
still need all your smarts so the stripe
is bad because it decreases the
propensity to learn how to do it
properly at the same time as making
people confused if you understand me yes
question
that's very likely
to say we need every two spars where's
say Oh heat or brothers
I'm sorry i I'm trying to think of how
to phrase your question so it gets in
through the microphone and and I don't
really understand it I'm sorry Oh takes
the responsibility of way
oh okay all right he's talking about the
relative responsibility of motorists
versus cyclists regarding their results
of their behavior first place the if you
look at the standard way of cataloguing
car bike collisions you find that more
than half of them have been caused by
motorists I'm being caused by cyclists
less than half of them by motorists if
you then start to looking at what kind
of evasive actions could be made or what
kind of secondary causes there were in
you realize that there are lots of
things that cyclists should not have
done or could have done to avoid it and
this results in what I'm going to term
the accidents per mile rate for
different groups of cyclists the general
average population rate per mile I
forget exactly what something like a 113
accidents by one way 4,000 miles or
something a hundred thousand miles but
in case the ratio i dunno and that's
this that when you consider people who
are much more likely to ride properly
because they have been schooled by their
club cycling friends or whatever and had
more experience you find the accident
rate goes down by 75% regarding car back
collisions and that indicates that
regardless of who's causing it the
cyclists have the ability to avoid three
out of four and i think even though the
exact values are not all that exact i
think the ratio is so overwhelming it
indicates the value of skill
assuming we we follow your basic
principles and educate the cycling
populace to the sufficient extended to
decipher populace to call the timing
welcome to describe how do we then
mitigate the next problem i would see as
a big girl which is you know this
morning I commuted him with 202 people
we were essentially i should say taking
claims inappropriate you know driving as
a vehicle has colombo three bikes but at
more than one instance we ended up with
a car behind us we wanted to receive
accidents with Gaddafi given brooklyn
conditions it was borderline violently
opposed to our position in the road what
political forces what social forces what
how do we have we influenced the
if you will of the motoring cottage okay
a question refers to the greater
tendency perhaps as postulated of
vehicular cyclists to delay motorists
and others the question I will ask you
sir is were you writing in line or
breasts to the three of you understand i
would say that in the kind of situation
in urban writing where you are i would
ride alongside a buddy only if i was
pretty sure that there was plenty of
room from other traffic to get past this
otherwise I single up which helps some
and of course here's the point it
doesn't matter whether there's a bike
lane that stripe there or not because
there you are you taking the space
regardless so I see that it doesn't make
that much difference but again if
society starts to adopt a rational
thought about cycling which says you
should operate according the rules of
the road and you're legitimate doing it
then they're going to accept a moderate
amount of this delay that's not forced
on them gratuitously if you understand
what I'm saying and sure it's public
relations but we all need that one too
but the public motorist has that belief
because he's been trained that cyclists
should never be in this way see and you
got to go overcome that another one
a question is the extent of law
enforcement activity in the education of
the driving public I will say that they
really don't have that kind of function
traffic laws are not written to educate
people they're written to be enforceable
the job of the traffic police is to
even-handedly enforce the real traffic
laws and not the couple of nasty ones I
mentioned we shouldn't be on the books
and against all people who disobey them
and that is their function you can't
expect enforcement officials to be any
good at teaching they aren't trained
that way and the words they use don't
work we need to wrap this up now John
thank you very much for coming and
