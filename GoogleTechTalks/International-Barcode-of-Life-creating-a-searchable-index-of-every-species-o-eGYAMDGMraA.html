the
with Star Trek the original series and
when the crew wanted to determine what
kind of life-forms were available on a
planet all they had to do was whip out
the tricorder and they instantly knew
everything they had to know in the
pocket regress quickly here on earth
things have not progressed as quickly
two thousand years ago we had Plato
talking about his featherless bipeds and
300 years ago
Linnaeus moved taxonomy on a little bit
and today we've got about 1.5 million
out of the ten to maybe a hundred
million species classified but it's
taken us a long time to get here and now
thanks to these gentlemen we finally
have our tricorder we have the ability
to take this little machine put some
sample tissue in and get a unique
species ID out they've done 30,000
species so far and have a proposal to do
500,000 species over the next five years
and note that that's a third of what
we've accomplished in the previous two
thousand years and so we have our
tricorder let me introduce you to our
Spock and Kirk I'm not I'm not quite
sure which ones which but Dan Herbert
who proposed barcoding in a 2003 paper
is a chair of zoology at the zoology
department at the University of Guelph
in Canada a fellow of the Royal Society
of Canada and man many other honours Dan
Jensen it's Adam or a professor of
biology at UPenn National Academy member
winner of the Einstein and Kyoto Prize
and MacArthur Fellow and among other
honors and they'll be here to tell you
today about all about barcoding of life
but before that in addition to Spock and
Kirk in the tricorder there's one more
thing you need to explore our planet and
that's the away team and Google has
proposed in with the help of these
gentlemen to do our own away trip to the
jungle in Costa Rica and that'll be on
the weekend of March 28th and we'll be
able to take about a dozen Googlers so
you'll be the red shirts and and don't
worry historically at least half of them
back alive and if you're interested in
that in going into the jungle and
learning about the biodiversity there
you can sign up in Jonathan Rosenberg's
office from 2:00 to 3:30 today so stop
by there make your case for why you
should get to be the redshirt and now we
bring you Dan Herbert and Paul who
written dan jensen thank you
thanks very much Peter well it's a real
pleasure to be here and I want to thank
you for the introduction and Jonathan
for the invitation and our emissary to
Google Brad slotnick who put a lot of
time into helping us have a chance to
speak with you the last three billion
years or so organisms have relied upon
analog radiance to recognize the life
forms around them decide who's friends
who's foe who's family who's enemy and
so if we look at this kaleidoscope of
life here you're recognizing the
differences by looking at an analogue
gradient using site we're proposing that
system works rather well with small
assemblages of species but as the number
of species that one is dealing with
Rises it runs into problems and that we
have to look at creating an
identification system for life that's
based on a digital character set and so
here you see a DNA barcode a 650
character line of DNA sequences and for
the balance of my talk I'm going to be
focusing on the evidence that this
approach works and just talking to you a
little bit more about the problems and
the opportunities that come with
creating a DNA based identification
system for life
so DNA barcode what is it it's a short
system it's based we're trying to
develop the most parsimonious system
possible to tell organisms apart a
single DNA read is the cheapest currency
in the in the width in our business and
650 base pairs is what current
technology will deliver standardized
it's critically important that we focus
on a single piece of DNA across the
spectrum of life if not you've got to
know if you've got a beetle in your hand
or a fish in your hand
before you could select the gene region
so the idea is to standardize on us
drive a single genic railway gauge
through life and of course we'd like
that standardized sequence to enable
species discrimination in a large block
of life wouldn't be magnificent if you
could walk to the seashore and that
mollusk that cnidarian that algae every
one of those organisms you could gain a
species identification simply by reading
a small slice of the DNA in the
organism's genome see here's an example
a wood duck honeybee yes you can tell
them apart those are their barcodes you
might argue that well can I tell them
apart just look at the color spectrum
along there you can see there is a
shading difference right a wonderful
thing about these 650 base pair
characters of course is they can be
automated they can be read with
automation the basis for the idea behind
bar coding lies in the simple power of
combinatorial sand the fact that DNA is
basically a digital DNA string we're all
familiar with the basic bar codes on
store shelves 11 long 10 options at each
a huge number of combinations but DNA is
a combinatorial string as well there's
only four options at each position those
are the four nucleotides that go to make
up DNA the four different nucleotides so
you can read along this string and of
course four characters at each if you
even read just 15 different nucleotide
positions you get a billion different
combinations so it seems like we might
not need to look at much DNA to
recognize the different life forms on
the planet so the power of combinatorial
DNA is immense long string in your
genome if we were to count the
nucleotides there are seven billion of
them we could actually take this to a
very high power if we headed to but of
course taking it to a high power would
mean lots of DNA sequencing and great
expense so this is a bar code for this
little fly legs away for DNA one leg
came off this fly the fly is still
intact you don't need much of the
organism in order to gather about
could in fact you need just touch it and
these are difficult words to pronounce I
will have to say they're even worse than
pronouncing some of the names of Welsh
towns I would argue 650 letters long but
they're simply codified and then is
where one didn't get a character read
there was a sequencing problem we
shouldn't show sequences like that
should we that's the harsh reality you
always can't read the sequence perfectly
why should we really care about the
ability to inventory life on our planet
there are a lot of social and economic
reasons why we might want to do this
invasive pest California had an invasion
of the Mediterranean fruit fly a few
years ago and spend 150 million dollars
eradicating it because that pest had got
a fairly strong foothold
zebra mussels got into Europe through
the from Europe to the Great Lakes 500
million dollars damage in the 20 years
they've been there in our country and
it's spread down through the states and
large large billions of dollars can be a
single invasive species can cost that so
it's an invisible task attacks on
society and in a world where with
globalizing trade where climates are
changing we're going to see a lot more
species invasions a good bio
surveillance system will allow us to
stop these organisms at the beachhead
and SAV vast amounts of money if you go
to a restaurant and have a fish meal at
least in New York City you've got about
a 20 percent chance of not getting the
fish that you paid for
it's always an upgrading a low value of
fish will be substituted for a high
value fish and not that many people can
tell a fillet apart on a plate the FDA
is looking at using barcoding as the
method to surveil foodstuffs in the
marketplace United States 62% of the
emerging diseases that are affecting our
species use another organism for
transmission they're zoonotic li
transmitted a number of organisms attack
humans including the malaria that that
mosquito might be injecting are you
carrots as well and would be a DNA
barcoding could give you a fast
identification of them fungal diseases
parasitic worms that are not trivial in
much the developing world and then
here's a specialized application if
you're in today into aircraft design
it's often useful to know what size bird
ricocheted off your aircraft and
caused a dent in the aircraft it might
cause you to shift the flight pattern or
it might cause you to change the design
of the aircraft so that the the bird
didn't come through the aircraft
fuselage and the FAA is supporting
barcoding because they got tired of
looking at smears of red on an aircraft
and trying to reconstruct what the bird
was from the blood but of course with
barcoding that straightforward and we
live in a planet where humans are don't
always treat the environment kindly and
it's important to be able to monitor the
environment it's often very difficult to
identify the organisms that are used in
bio surveillance programs and so both in
Canada and in the United States the EPA
are investing in barcoding as a new
generation tool to surveil environments
and of course this is just the front end
of this approach it can get we can begin
to use highly sophisticated bio
monitoring look at the planet just as
Canaries were dumped out mines in the
19th century we can survey a lick planet
not just measure wind speeds and
temperatures but the life-forms at each
spot on the planet the other thing that
is really I think a moral responsibility
65 million years ago a hundred meter
diameter meteorite impacted near the
Yucatan Peninsula and took out 75% of
the species we're on the planet at that
point in time and of course the
dinosaurs hadn't planned on it didn't
recognize what was happening today the
situation is rather different we as a
species are pre-empting 25% of the
primary productivity on land today and
most of the people in my business
believe that we could be responsible for
the loss of 50 to 75 percent of the
species under planet surface within this
century unless we change our behavior
patterns these are fellow-travellers for
millions of years and to think that we
would be responsible for eradicating and
with no record is I think something
that's not a trivial issue these are 36
of the 37 members of the cat family on
our planet there's only one of them
that's not threatened with extinction
the domestic cat it could be the only
cat species in the wild by the end of
this century that's just one biological
microcosm
there every group of life on land is
highly threatened so let's jump back in
time let's jump back 250 years because
this is the quarter of millennial
celebration of the scientific
registration of life on our planet
Linnaeus began this task in Sweden in
well well before 1758 but the 1758
Edition the 10th edition of Systema
naturai is when biologists say we began
to register species in an official
fashion and Linnaeus in that document
registered 5000 species and in the case
of butterflies and Moz he had about 500
species of butterflies and moths ready
he thought he had half the job done he
felt there might be 10,000 species on
the planet
well the Peter mentioned it's not 10,000
species today we're at a count of 1.6
million species registered and many
specimens residing in museums
collections like this magnificent
repositories of life but we know the job
isn't done it's very likely that they're
in the tens if not hundreds of millions
I can't give you an order of magnitude
closest estimate after 250 years of work
a few years ago I joined in a bio blitz
in the Great Smoky Mountains National
Park that's one of the best studied and
most visited parks in the eastern United
States and these are the sites that
people assembled to collect and this
particular mission was focused on
learning something about the Maas and
butterflies of the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park
oops these are the people that came
together to do it 30 individuals
assembled to a special understanding of
different groups of moths and
butterflies for three days
there was a powerful bio identification
force on the Smoky Mountains and then
they all dispersed and the capacity went
back to zero and of course that team
could not deal with the multitude of
other groups of life it's extremely
difficult to deal with the diversity of
organisms with the traditional approach
of morphology in fact it's this
disconnect that's made rather graphic
here our planet home to somewhere
between ten and a hundred million
species and the human CPU
able to deal with perhaps a thousand of
those species so if you decide to devote
your life to something important like
taxonomy as opposed to googling well of
course we'd like to see a confluence of
taxonomy and googley you might be able
to get to the point where you could
discriminate a thousand species but it
probably will be at only one life stage
just the adults not all the larval forms
so just a segment your life 1,000
species this vast disconnect is why we
need to look for a new approach we need
to do what the other sciences have done
which is bring technology to bear on the
fundamental particles of their
discipline and that's what bar coding is
all about
so we're engaged in the early phase of a
mission that seeks to carry out a
horizontal genomic survey the big
genomics projects you've heard of in the
past focus on assembling information on
all of the genes and specific species
our own species 2001 was the early
closure of the human genome this is a
very different enterprise this is
orthogonal to traditional big genomics
projects we want one gene in fact we
want one gene region from every species
on the planet we want to build this
reference library to get connecting a
sequence to every species on the planet
this looks a bit like a stellar image
well it is a stellar image but it's not
a space image it's an image of an animal
cell this is the cytoskeleton it is in
red the nucleus the huge block of DNA is
sitting there in blue 7 billion base
pairs in the case of our own species
sitting in that big circle and these
little green dots these are mitochondria
these are the powerhouses of the cell
and the interesting property about
mitochondria not only is this high copy
number but the fact that they've got a
little loop of DNA as a relic of their
bacterial origins and that little loop
of DNA because there aren't
sophisticated repair systems and there
tends to evolve very quickly see if
you're looking for a piece of DNA with a
lot of signal mitochondria are a very
good place to go not only a lot of
signal but lots of copies so it's
relatively easy to recover even if the
fish has been cooked or the DNA has been
degraded in some fashion
so we have targeted the mitochondrial
genome as a point of first entry into
barcoding and this is the mitochondria
genome it's a little loop in all animals
about sixteen thousand five hundred base
pairs long so it's tiny in comparison
when the nuclear genome and it turns out
that well as I mentioned were ambitious
we would like to create a dentin system
for all nucleated life it turns out
there are thirteen protein coding genes
in that loop but only two of them
cytochrome oxidase one another gene over
here are present in all eukaryotes in
fungi and protists in plants just two
genes we focused on one of those genes
cytochrome oxidase one and we focused on
a six hundred and fifty base pair bit
near the front end because humans like
to begin at the beginning rather at the
middle of something and so that's the
the region that we are designated as the
barcode system for eukaryotic life the
middle of the circle there's no such
thing as the middle of a circular
there's a start point okay what do we do
there's a start to a gene there's a
start to a gene when it gets transcribed
it rips off in a particular direction so
what do we do it's a pretty simple
analysis the Human Genome Project craig
Venter just got finished and that was
seventy million dollar project we can
give you a barcode for two or three
dollars today so this is a lot cheaper
this is why it can be done in scale so
take a specimen take a fish take a tiny
piece of tissue so tiny you can't see it
do this from 96 fish put the little bits
of tissue into a block like this extract
the DNA all of the DNA in that cell and
then amplify this up PCR polymerase
chain reaction amplification basically
allows you to Xerox copy you've got
these seven billion base pairs and you
can jump in and Xerox copy one
particular piece of it got to do that to
get the barcode so we go in amplify up
that piece of DNA and then it just jumps
into a sequencer a capillary sequencer
gets read the same way genome sequencing
has been
in the past sequence record trace files
and sequence record the other thing we
do is gather the collection data where
was that organism collected when
photographic create a specimen page
today barcode analysis you're interested
in doing it we built the world's first
barcode factory in in Canada and Guelph
where I'm based we have a team of about
35 people there that devote their life
to trying to make this easier and faster
less expensive use robotic intervention
micro fluidics capillary sequencers
there's an informatics team and this
little building can process five hundred
thousand specimens in a year a million
sequences and if we had five or ten of
these scattered around the world if we
franchised this little facility we would
be in a powerful position to register
life on this planet in short order one
of our challenges is informatics we're
generating quite a lot of data we need
to gather those sequence files together
with the specimen information and that's
what this database is doing it currently
contains information for about 35,000
species that's a tiny fraction of the
ten million but it's the start this is
what one of those files looks like the
taxonomy the location data where you
could find that specimen if you're
interesting looking at it again images
of the specimen an on-board GIS system
that shows you where that specimen was
collected and here's the other part of
each record the sequence information the
trace file and the sequence record
itself
that's one barcode record this is
something that you're familiar with
Google er is the magnificent thing to
link our data into and here we're
zooming in to Costa Rica to a CG where
Dan Jensen works and Winnie Hawks and
here you can see zooming in then to this
one locality and seeing two specimens
were collected just off map here 60,000
records available if the ECG today
imagine when the whole planet is like
this and there are millions or billions
of records
and you can dive into anywhere in the
planet and see the life that resides
there this really becomes a digital
Bioscope if you like does barcoding work
we've tackled 37,000 species so far and
it works with startling clarity I would
say I don't have time to show you lots
of examples but our planet is 75% marine
so marine seems a good place to begin
and Great Barrier Reef is not one of the
less pleasant places on the planet so
some of our early bird could work was
done with CSIRO and Australia and here
you can see the sort of this called a
taxon ID tree and I don't want to spend
too much time looking at this but two
percent divergence add that and add that
and perhaps you get about 10 percent
divergence those that is the sequence
difference between the two most closely
allied species in that collection these
lines that are straight if you see a
straight line no variation among members
of a species little bumps tiny amounts
of variation within a species our own
species every person in this room we
sequential as you walk out there won't
be more than one base pair difference
between any person in this room it was
thought that humans were a bit of a
funny species the so called
mitochondrial Eve hypothesis it turns
out every species we've looked at so
shows this same sort of pattern of lack
of variation within it deep divergences
between it now it turns out these fish
that you're looking at here there are
two people in the world that could tell
those fish species apart morphologically
with barcodes everyone in this room
everyone on this planet could tell them
apart I don't want to show you more
examples but I'll just say that the
startling thing is whether you're
looking at a fish in the ocean or a
crustacean or a jellyfish floating
through the water you will see the same
sort of pattern if you jump onto land
and you look at birds if you look at
bats bees frogs Odin eights ants you
will see the same sort of pattern of
sequence variation the resolution is
extremely high
so we're now engaged in in building this
reference library that connects
sequences to all of the known species on
the planet
and what we're going to get from that is
a master key to life that anyone will be
able to open and look at the diversity
of life on our planet the other nice
thing about a DNA is genders are the
same when it comes time to barcode
region if you're looking morphologically
genders often look different the
identification czar cheap $3.00 today it
will be a few pennies before long two
hours today it will be a few minutes
before long and the other nice thing is
that DNA barcodes are constant
throughout life so in the case of this
little marine crustacean the adult which
taxonomist can tell apart connects to a
whole kaleidoscope of larval stage that
look hugely different from it think
about cat egg caterpillar pupae and
adult butterfly this transformations
through life complicate morphological
taxonomy but not a DNA based approach so
based in these early results what are
the stages of now activating is the
international barcode of life project
and it seeks to gather information on
five million specimens five hundred
thousand species in five years for 150
million dollars that's a tiny price in
terms of big science projects
fundraising three models central nodes
canada united states and europe playing
a heavy lifting role and i'm happy to
say that canada's indicated that it will
commit fifty million dollars towards
this project but we need international
partners will gather the speech species
from charismatic sites Great Smokies
mountains Banff iguazu falls in
Argentina magic places to capture the
attention of the public the ECG in Costa
Rica we need help on informatics and
data display that's a big challenge for
us here is the future in terms of
technology go to a tree frog the tree
put it in a blender create a slurry
amplified the DNA in that
put it on one of the new generation
sequencing machines that sequence
400,000 sequences in a day and read the
life go to Amazonia where the forests
are being slashed fog trees in each of
these areas and read the life make
decisions that are scientifically based
on which areas to protect we can't do it
today
I wish we had the tricorder we don't
that's what you guys are gonna create
for us no this little device is what our
holy grail we really want a handheld
device it's not going to be just point
I'm gonna have to touch it gonna have to
wait minute but that little slot there
touch the Frog what they put the piece
of paper in that slot PCR amplify
sequence match against the reference
library identification link heal a began
are you holding a purple starfish in
your hand are you on the Great Barrier
Reef no issue if you're in the Caribbean
and you encounter this thing it's
invasive reality check we had a meeting
in June Canada
75 people came together from 21 nations
we can do it so this is what the
international barcode of life project is
about imagine a world in which you can
know the name of any animal any plant
any fungus any organism on the spot in
an instant anywhere on our planet we can
as the society do this in five years
with a very modest investment the end of
this we've created a global biotin
system this is biologies answer to
Global Positioning Systems Global
Positioning Systems revolutionized our
ability to put ourselves in a point on
our planet this approach will allow us
to position ourselves in taxonomic space
in the organisms around us it's
going to be critically important for
life on our planet we would develop this
approach so with that we can do our best
to protect organisms and then finally
society should be very engaged in to
helping to pay for this but because
we're going to save society through the
interception of a single pest species
more than the cost of this whole project
so that's my entree into the project
Dan's gonna jump up now and I'm sure
give us a very interesting different
perspective or allies in this
we have about a hundred thousand years
of knowing about biodiversity and
forgetting about biodiversity as a
species it goes back further of course
but India's conscious human beings let's
call it we've been thinking about it for
a long time there's you that is an
individual right now and of course
there's about ten million species whoops
where's the pointer on this guy's in the
middle in May there we go there's about
ten million species out there and your
problem right now is you want to know
the name of that frog because he just
stuck his finger in your eye
I don't just actually that frog stuck
its finger in my eye when at 1961 in
southern Mexico and I wrote my first
scientific paper about what happened any
eight-year-old today will tell you how
you get the how do you get the name and
understanding of that frog it's just to
go to google and type it in no problem
you're all done well the real problem of
course is how do you know which of those
which of those ten million species goes
with that frog and you just heard Paul
talk about it okay that's where we're
headed that's how I see it as a user at
the bottom end of this fooding chain
feeding chain with paul sitting up there
and his barcode factory in Guelph at the
other end so this is the sort of dream
slide which says in one slide the same
thing you've just heard from Paul and
that has its origin in thinking this way
the idea of course is that there are
seven billion people in the world it can
pull something out of their back pocket
that costs what this cost and is as
available as this is to do this job that
we're talking about that is really where
we're trying to head
now you say well yeah you know I can get
some tax on Imus to tell me the name of
this frog and so on I am standing in
this photograph in the middle of a piece
of Costa Rican rainforest and those of
you who go with us at the end of this
month will be put in that forest there
are 400 species of plants in that
photograph everyone has had a name for
50 to 100 150 years and there is not one
human being on the earth who can stand
there and identify more than one or two
of them you can collect it send it off
six months later get a name but if you
have any reason whatsoever to want to
know what the name of that plant is
nobody else can do it unless you pay the
salary of somebody come and stand on
your left hand and he will only know
about two or three or four impose this
is the level of our understanding of
wild my diversity this is your visual
this is what you see when you look at
wild biodiversity and we're trying to do
something about that now let's take it
right down to write down home pragmatics
this is your arm somewhere we all know
what's going on there now what is your
reaction to this well that's your
reaction to it okay now you've done that
and you wonder could it have been
carrying malaria could it have been
carrying yellow fever could it have been
carrying sleeping sickness or some
Trypanosoma or some other horrible thing
or was it just an inconvenient it the
only way you can know is have a
barkhurdar take a leg off that and go
through the same process that paul was
just talking about this is not a
photograph it's not an exaggeration this
is the world in which we are now
developing we're joining the most
primitive down to nature with the most
advanced technology that humanity can
put on the table but it's got this
problem see there's no little hole in
that gadget right now to put a piece of
the animal that he's got and standing on
after he just shot it we all intersect
with wild biodiversity at some time in
our lives for some reason not all the
time that's the professionals who do
that
the seven billion people just now and
then need to know who the species are
you thought you ate lobster for dinner
last night how do you know as Paul just
indicated it wasn't Nimal that you ate
for dinner last night well
with the iPhones which feature you can
zoom in on pictures
there it is there's the barcode right
there
now if we drop down into the real world
let's take a look at real complexity
that you get confronted with when you're
not out here in a city park in Palo Alto
a little yellow lump right down there is
Costa Rica and you can see it's relative
size up against the map up there the
same number of species are in this
little lump down here is there isn't all
in North America so I'm saying is you're
really packing species into a little
tiny place and so there was a whole lot
of them every time you turn around
that's where that piece of forest was we
were looking at earlier now if you apply
a bark order to this kind of complexity
how really accurate is it how well does
sequencing work for this kind of
indication well right now in this place
we have done 3,000 species of moths and
butterflies 700 species of flies and 600
species of parasitic wasps but I have to
add these are all things we have reared
so we know their whole natural histories
we know the animals very well and out of
these numbers of species seven didn't
work two didn't work and six didn't work
that's the error term in this gadget now
furthermore they didn't work in a
peculiar way those two right there it
isn't that they're confused with anybody
it's that there's two species you can't
tell apart this one but they don't
confuse with any of the other 700
species of flies that's what I mean by
it didn't work the point is it's
extremely accurate now let's look at the
world you know in the relation to this
kind of thing and this flicker which you
guys all know and I put a name of a
butterfly that I happen to know into a
flicker right there and I immediately
get these these photographs let's look a
little closer there's the picture of the
butterflies feeding on a rotten banana
in British Honduras some tourists took
this picture put it up on actually
professional photographer tourists and
put this up on on Flickr hey crowd you
don't see my butterfly and some tax
anima said to him yeah that's Larry's
proponent he actually wrote it on Iran
it's actually proponent Larry's but that
doesn't matter so I put that butterfly
into your search engine and there it is
and you've got 638 hits so here's a
block of information about this
butterfly notice no no bark order
involved here
a block of information about this
butterfly straight out here search
system you know wow we have a firehose
worth of information about this
butterfly
well I've reared these things so I
barcode them when you barcode them
that's the butterfly right there with
his wings open here's the caterpillar
that grid from and your barcode him you
discover there's one group here these
are all individual butterflies and
there's another group right there and
they don't have the same barcode and
then when you look at this group you
discover they're all eating one family
of plants and these are all eating
another family of plants that's two
species and there is not a taxon amidst
in the world who can tell them apart and
they've had that name for almost 200
years every single one of those 683
pages in Google is wrong because you
have no idea which one of these to any
given set of information goes with
because they completely call it curve
soup otherwise lived side by side same
one one meter apart they can tell each
other apart
but nobody else can except somebody with
a bark order now I use Guelph as though
I'm carrying it around in my back pocket
okay this is nine species of flies who
all have the same name that names a
hundred and fifty years old everybody
thinks that's all one fly it's in fact
nine we know that because we rhythm from
do they're all parasites of caterpillars
and we've written front when your bark
on they all have different berkos the
only way you can tell them apart
is with a bark order there are ten
species of butterflies in this box all
from the same place all reared we know
all of them six of them have had names
for more than a hundred years four of
them are unknown to science and there's
not one living human being on the planet
who can look at that photograph and
identify them and there never has been
yet with a bark order two dollars and
fifty cents apiece you can uh nearing ly
identify every single one of them the
point is we need a bark order to find
out what we already know and then when
we barcode what we already know we
discover that we didn't actually know
what we thought we knew so the world is
more compliments
excuse me then we thought so where do
you get this information I'll take you
right down to the ground level where
does the sequence come from these are
what I call para taxonomist the word is
borrowed from the word paramedic who
drives the ambulance she is a hazel is a
the wife of a school bus driver in
Norton Northwestern Costa Rica sir he'll
was a taxi driver up on the Nicaraguan
border we plucked them out of these very
working-class jobs
taught them the things you teach a good
graduate student and they're out there
being paired taxonomist gathering
specimens explicitly to create barcode
library what what sir he was doing is
blowing up a plastic bag to put a moth
in it it gets a close fit on it goes in
the freezer comes out of the freezer
gets dried on a put it on a spreading
board goes into oven is dried comes out
looking like this buck butterflies and
mozz on a pin on pins excuse me
each one of them gets its own individual
license plate about your code that goes
with it they photograph it they build a
record and a database for it that all
goes on the web of course one leg comes
off goes in a little tube right there
the boxes could be FedEx is to Canada or
in this case a mule takes them to Canada
they get to Guelph Lake comes out of the
tube goes through the fancy robots comes
out as sequences now we have a barcode
library building who's gonna do that
we have you know 20 people doing at
Northwestern Costa Rica and there's
people who great Smoky's doing it a
little bit and so on and so forth but
who is really what's the army of people
we can do it if you suddenly put
gasoline into the motor to get 10
million sequences for the world it's
easy excuse me the sequences from 10
million species for the world well there
are a very large number of people who
for one reason or other deal directly
with biodiversity that is the only human
being in the world who can identify one
big set of flies for example well they
occur in very large numbers in fact why
my off the back of the napkin
calculation there are about a hundred
thousand people out there who deal on a
daily basis with species for one reason
or another
who can be enlisted to be part of the
army who gathers this whole barcode set
it isn't that I or Paul or one graduate
student have to go out and then spend
the next 2,000 years doing it the army
is out there these are all experienced
biology biologists or biodiversity
managers or people using biodiversity in
one way or another and they will in fact
do it if they have the right
administrative structure now what does
it look like when you actually get these
results back from Guelph you know they
or us we we send this leg off when we
get this we get this tree back with
information on it and right there is one
that has no name at all I don't have any
idea what it is why looking at it and
it's sitting way out in its own little
branch how do I get this linked back to
whatever it is we know about
biodiversity I'll show you actually how
we do it the first thing you do in the
old days was to take that specimen and
airmail it or hand carry it to the
British Museum and it sits there for six
months and people look at it and maybe
out comes a name today you send it to
the equivalent of that in Costa Rica by
taking its photograph attaching his
photographs an attachment to an email
message he goes off at 7:58 in the
morning at 8:08 in the morning you get a
reply back this is the Gino this is the
family maybe somebody had Sarah knows
the name of the genus or species and two
hours later you'll get back the species
name where it lives how many specimens
are and so on the point is that's the
old-fashioned way but speed it up now by
all the internet and other kinds of
things that we have notice it was a
barcode or only had to put its finger on
it and said this is a problem it exists
and we as the old-fashioned way of
getting to it and finally they send us
the photographs of the Thai specimen and
a Google map that shows us the places
where the thing has been found before
now multiply that by ten million okay
now here's a very practical example of
this this is the watershed of New York
City the black that you see right there
there's Long Island there and New York
City is very worried about the quality
of the water that flows in that
watershed these are all the little
streams in that watershed so they pay a
lot of money to monitor the biodiversity
of those streams by diversity means all
these little things that live on
and these are the streams themselves red
means that they're in really bad shape
greens means they're okay and how do
they how do you how do you classify a
stream as good or bad well you make a
list of all the species that are in it
and one set of species represents
somebody's been dumping their laundry
water into it and another one means it's
a pristine stream well how do you
actually get that information today in
today's world this is the way you get it
you go out and you sample you got liters
of insects out of the stream and you sit
down a whole lot of undergraduates and
volunteers and some paid labor and they
sit there for hours and hours and hours
and hours and hours morphologically
identifying the bug one by one by one by
it might make a long list and literally
you can spend a whole they can spend
that team like that can spend a whole
month doing one stream that whole thing
replaced with one part quarter
these are 372 legs off of Nome bar coded
samples so you know what the bar codes
are these dump him in a sequencer and
you're done it changes the whole way of
going at this so where are we headed now
the year 2020 we know about this world
it's got Google up in this corner put a
bar quarter in that corner you've got a
laptop in everybody's hand down here and
you've got the human genome which loves
to teach yourself things we all know
that when you were 2 years old you
learned
let's give me we're in second grade
you'll learn to teach yourself a lot of
things well what happens as soon as you
have that you've got all these other
things begin to add on to it AOL which
has been talked about came out yesterday
or today in the universe you'll get
instant messaging you get Facebook pages
you'll get all the written documents the
way alone out there in the public domain
which you guys are busy doing all that
stuff works together and it isn't gonna
be long Paul skipped over this but I'll
say it won't be very long before the
organisms themselves are gonna start to
transmit their own bark orders or their
own sequences their own bar code in the
sense you'll be able to pick it up so
what's the hurry why not just let the
process go and 100 years we have a bark
order and we have a sequence library
growing that's the way we've been doing
taxonomy we've been doing versity well
it goes like this if you can't read
what's out there in a forest in the old
days it was the enemy so we pushed it
aside grew our crops all right then more
recently we think of it as a if you
can't read the forest it's
you'd eat up and turn into firewood and
today where it is right now it's bio
fuel ethanol biofuel I'm not worried
about corn at all of the is the worst
enemy we have of the remaining living
biodiversity on the planet at the
present time we don't have time anymore
now who are all these people that are
being impacted you think is that us here
in Palo Alto there are six billion
people out there that live day to day
face to face with wild biodiversity it
matters to them now they need this thing
in their hands right now
and imagine what it would how it would
change politics education medicine the
whole pie agriculture the marketplace
everything if these people can know what
they actually have in that wagon behind
those oxen what that mosquito was who is
nibbling on your arm what the beetle is
it's eating your bean plant in Nigeria
bark order it's the first time in human
history we can put all 7 billion people
on the planet and all this have been
billion wild things on the same team
working together that to me is true
democratization or my alliteration as
I'm claimed to say now what are these
things have in common you all know what
these are we hit right now they were
hitting Google down here at the bottom
what do all those things have what's one
thing that they all have in common
there's something in it for everybody we
are not talking about something for
academics for the graduate students for
the wealthy people for any particular
poor person we're talking about
something everybody now this slide van
Thanh loaned me as a slide that was put
together with respect to the EO Wilson
Foundation which I'm very familiar with
and he pointed out that this is Google
is dark green stripe right across the
middle here is Google and in an indexing
right down here of course that word is
exactly what you guys are busy doing to
all the human created things what the
Barker is talking about doing it till
the the wild things so I'm gonna close
down here by pointing out that the the
database for this entire information
ecosystem from teachers and students is
kind of up to Public Health and
conservation law is
billion people barcoding all the species
on that's the real bottom the real
platform of this thing so in the end
this is what we end up with and that's
really the information ecosystem that
Google is right a stripe right across
the middle of and the bar Carter is the
thing which is actually producing the
raw information down there and available
to everybody in this whole system thank
you
any questions
we decided eukaryotes would keep us busy
for a little while so the question was
what about prokaryotes which lack
mitochondria
we've decided to just stand aside and
focus on the ten million or a hundred
million eukaryotes as the first line of
business but the idea of standardization
of genomic targets and and focusing on
as little information as possible are
principles that we could apply to
prokaryotes and interestingly the same
gene that one finds in the mitochondria
of you carrots of course is present in
many prokaryotes so that would be a
friendly place to begin and occasionally
bacterial or archaea colon jumps up when
we're doing an analysis on eukaryotes
that's a good question let me add
something to that though the concept of
barcoding we're focused technically on
the seoeon gene because that's that's a
technical target but the concept of
having a signature sequence applies to
anybody and the medical world is already
there I can say freely this is public
information that Canon is developing a
gadget that you put on your guests it'll
cost you five thousand dollars your
daughter comes home from school she's
got a fever she there's not in touches
the x you have mumps that that's where
it's going and the minute every doctor
has one in every desk of course you're
going to want to have one in your own
kitchen and so that they're focused on
all the human diseases and for obvious
reasons and that is of course mostly
bacteria and viruses so the whole point
is that the concept is just done with
different sequences that's all
so first of all thank you for a great
presentation when listening to all the
numbers the number of species cetera I
couldn't help thinking how hopeless
you're the problem you're working on is
in trying to solve it but I was the
thing that struck my mind is where do
you reach the point of diminishing
returns like in Costa Rica you're feel
workers and that one picture you said
there are a thousand species out there
so every plant every butterfly they're
sending back you're able to catalog
because you've not catalogued it but
after a while every sample that comes
back might be the same sample that comes
back you already had the DNA how do you
get to the species that is very hard to
find that people don't see that's in
some remote corner of the earth there
are a couple of points a couple that are
relevant I think first of all I guess
what we're most interested in developing
is an identification system for
organisms that you actually do encounter
so the ones that you don't encounter
aren't such a problem it would be nice
to just be able to identify the things
you do find the second thing is the
strategy for the first 500,000 species
is to focus this effort on a rather
small number of groups so when it comes
time to terrestrial life we will try and
be very comprehensive with butterflies
and moths with ants with earthworms but
many other groups of life won't be
primary targets in the first round so we
will build up species coverage but there
will be whole domains of life that are
sitting there waiting for phase 2 and
phase 3 of this project and I think the
other point is as sequencing costs drop
as technology advances it's going to be
possible to scan immense numbers of
organisms for the cost of the first
phase of this project let me add more to
what Paul just said as the person I
spend my life finding those last ones
that that were just referred to and the
fact of the matter is that when you get
the sequence you get more than the
sequence you get the Natural History
information that went with the thing
that gave you the sequence so you begin
to a build a set of information that's
collateral to the sequence so you build
these natural histories all of us who do
field sampling quickly begin to see all
right we've got the natural histories
for the things that live here in
dreams but we haven't got the ones that
live in marshes so now we stop sampling
the streams we go sample the marsh then
we got the ones in the marsh but we
don't know the ones and tree holes on
tops of trees so now we go up the trees
and get them there and you you work your
way through the world getting all the
different pieces yes there are a few
species that may take like forever to
find but if the barcode is in place when
you put one of those new ones in then
nobody found it's gonna say to you
oops this is not in the library would
you please take a photograph of it will
you please send us the collateral
information that goes along with it
would you collect it all this sort of
saw that the rare things that aren't
found first but eventually I do get
found those will get in the in the
sample as well but when you're doing
sampling to get the library you break
the world down into pieces and you don't
just wander around and get ten million
of these and one of those and you do
strata what we call stratified sampling
across the system and you gradually get
more and more and more a higher
percentage of what's out there
you guys have sort of a kind of a graded
mind of how you would build various
kinds of our quarters with technological
milestones that you need to achieve yeah
what are the steps in moving from
technology today where we need a room
full of equipment that cost perhaps two
million dollars to Dan's one dollar back
pocket bar coder and I'm sure you're
correct if we look at most other
technologies and certainly cell phones
would be a very good example weighing a
few kilograms costing a few thousand
dollars in 1983 but performing basically
the same service is a modern cell phone
but weighs 76 grams and costs nothing
except a subscription I think we will
see the same transition I am sure that
we will see a desktop integrated device
and that will be phenomenally useful to
people at border points phenomenally
useful to biodiversity scientists
phenomenally useful in educational
settings where students move into the
field to do field work courses so yes
my guess is five years now sadly we
won't have the back pocket device but
maybe Dan do you want to be bolder and
predict back pocket in five years I
predict by the way I see things going
but I'm pretty naive I guess I see the
back pocket in five years because I
think what will happen is that when you
get the one that'll fit in a backpack
it won't take somebody very long to say
you know I could make my billion dollars
for my life me personally myself is life
by inventing the one that only costs $1
because then I'll sell seven billion of
them and everybody will lose one every
three weeks and they'll want another one
it's like razor blades who are like
ballpoint pens the sort of thing that
you know there's just a billion of them
out there and I see that's the direction
it's finally going to go and the world
is going wireless literally I mean the
Costa Rica that I live and work in now
is going while the country is going
Wireless so I in a very short
time you won't have to carry all the
damn library around in your cone you
just read off of its of a signal and and
be connected to you guys like that
our concept is that the barcode is
public domain like words like English
words and Spanish words and so on and
then what people want to do is take that
and build it into various package
formats for various people specialty
uses and all that that's fine that's
proprietary just like we do with words
today but for us the barcode the basic
word is public domain so it's from this
little snip of mitochondrial DNA can you
get more information such as
evolutionary relationships between
organisms or is it really just an ID -
yeah that's a very very interesting and
important point and it is extremely nice
to say that we gain a lot of additional
information about the array of organism
that you're dealing with so as an
evolutionary biologist I'm fascinated by
the fact by carrying out these large
horizontal surveys we don't just get an
identification but we get a sense of the
age of the species involved we get a
sense about the factors this gene is a
sentinel to everything that's going on
in the in the mitochondrial genome and
often in the nuclear genome so you learn
about rates of evolution it's and of
course the other thing we get through
the barcoding process the end of the day
is a total DNA extract and we plan to
conserve these with care so when
individuals decide to do tree of life
studies that will undoubtedly require
additional genes that DNA extract is
there so we're working on very close and
friendly terms with tree of life
projects that want to burrow down and
look at deep relationships barcode of
life is really decorating that tree of
life with its leaves but let me add to
that - in that when you as a user okay I
send all these sequences up they're both
from Paul's processes and they come back
to me in these big trees these big trees
that show this is one thing and this is
another this is another this is another
when you get used to reading these tea
leaves what you discover very quickly is
that groups that we classically call
related end up grouping together they
have similar barcodes and so that what
happens is that there's a lot of what we
call phylogenetic signal in them but you
can't rely on them 100% well they tell
you a lot in a signal sense to say
oops this thing is up here and in or
morphologically ought to be down here so
it caused you to go back and look at
this one that's up here barcode wise and
see that maybe morphologically we goofed
in putting it down here sometimes that's
the case sometimes it's not the case but
there's is signal but you can't rely on
it which is one of the pushback we got
all the time from the phylogenetic
people who deal with genomes saying yeah
you can't use a wheel we showed twenty
years ago that you can't use one
mitochondrial gene to construct a
phylogenetic tree true you can't if
you're a scientist you want everyone to
be in the right place you can't but it's
probably 90% of that trio in fact II
where you get it if you use 15 genes
next one of the interesting thing is you
add more and more species to an analysis
single gene analysis like that character
stats that were not phylogenetically
informative become phylogenetically
informative so there's actually a great
value in increasing species coverage
do you have a feel for the loss rate and
the production rate of species as a
function of time during say the last
million years or yeah that's a very
interesting point well the fossil record
suggested that most species had a life
span marine species had a lifespan of
about four million years and those deep
divergences that you could see in the
trees we can apply a molecular clock to
those and estimate from the sequence
divergences how old those species are
and the answer is most of the species
that we live with have been
fellow-travellers with us for millions
of years
so species are old there are some
settings where we can show that species
have radiated explosively the African
Rift Lakes the cichlid fishes in a
matter of 10,000 to 50,000 years
hundreds of species have been born these
are complex cases for barcoding these
very very young species but that's a
rare situation most species are old and
worth preserving I would argue because
of that
prokaryotes viruses does that something
you looking to do in the future do you
feel like they're not from efforts
there is a huge amount of money being
directed towards prokaryote genomics and
we really feel it would be mission creep
for us to try and move into that turf we
think the job before us is quite a
substantial one and mobilizing the
workforce and the resources to do this
job well will keep us occupied and we'll
look forward to colleagues pushing
forward on the prokaryote to front but
you are correct to indicate that because
there needs to be a joining of these two
highways somewhere not too far down the
road because every time we put a leg in
to Guelph or into a tube in a freezer
whatever it is of course it's got
viruses in it it's got bacteria riding
on it and they every bug has got a gut
full of them they're all they're there
and and at the time we go to the effort
to get these things to get there they're
bark on our guitar barcode sequence
there's no reason at all why that same
effort shouldn't then result in the
material that the bacterial and the
viral people get their raw material from
and these very same plants that we're
barcoding right now in Costa Rica we're
doing in fact a plant virus barcode
inventory of them yeah
forgive me if I miss something but every
time you do a barcode reading you have
to pluck a leg or something and it
ingest it into in order to get the
reading on the specie I just have a
question about a scale on this if you
have 7 billion people on the planet who
have one of these things and are
plucking legs or wings from creatures
doesn't that begin to interfere kind of
with the biodiversity on the planet over
time or I mean no there's just too many
of these creatures to to make it a
problem five leg dancing there right now
but no okay I mean I'm just asking the
question because you get seven billion
people doing something that's gonna have
an effect and you know if you're
potentially putting something in the
hands of 7 billion people kind of what
is what is the outcome of that that's
all there's two kinds of people doing it
one kind is collecting the sequences for
the library that's of course a trivial
amount of sampling right and then
there's all the people who actually
don't have a barcode in the back pocket
so what do they do today all right
there's a beetle eating by me I'm in
Niger
there's a beetle eating my bean plants
why kill it I nuke it right all right
you pull the bar Carter out and you take
a leg off one beetle and stick it in
there says oh that's such-and-such and
that's not gonna affect your bean plant
at all or this has wait a minute yes you
shouldn't have this eating your beans
and you better spray now you know yes
there's gonna be their action but we
have that reaction right now it's just
so we don't have the accuracy that would
go with this well I think what I'm
saying is that at some level you're
creating a new toy and so people may be
using it not to find out the bee the
beetle that's eating their beans but
just you know for the because you can
yes that's true you know we do that with
reading too I mean but there's a down
I'm sorry with reading yes exactly you
take two you take second graders and you
teach them to read you don't ask what
are you going to do with the capacity of
being able to read and some of them will
use it for preciously some of them will
use it to damage the world they'll be
interacting with inanimate books
basically and then maybe acting in the
world but here you're interacting with
sort of certain issue that is concerned
us and when you start talking about
vertebrates tearing bits off of a frog
to identify it is something right would
definitely be very unfriendly and it's
not necessary you simply touch the
organism and for the you know it there's
absolutely no question if you simply
stroke an ant or a caterpillar skin you
will get more than enough DNA to
identify it I mean at the moment the
bugs on a pin taking a leg off but yeah
it's very important we have these votes
your specimens but when people start to
go out and do this in a naturalist
context I don't see them necessarily
pulling organisms apart that's the
beauty of pressure it needs almost no
material all right that feels better
thank you very good
yes legal issues as you go around
sampling things such as pregnant arrange
to see water sampling around the world
arrested as countries for taking samples
do we expect any legal problems arising
from the Convention on Biological
Diversity and moving specimens out of
countries and the answer that is we're
building a deeply international
coalition this is a project that can't
be done without international
collaboration and in some nations the
Costa Rica model of material moving to
out of country analytical facilities
will not occur in India and Brazil
analytical facilities within country
will carry out the analysis and the
results will be deposited into a web
web-based system where the data is
reposed with the specimen state within
country we will certainly operate within
the boundaries of the Convention on
Biological Diversity and and since the
craig Venter sampling was brought up as
an example in the Costa Rica that I work
with when he came to Costa Rica and took
his marine samples the Costa Rican
government was exceedingly upset with
that exceedingly this same government
that has written into my collecting
permit that you may collect samples for
DNA for DNA barcoding any time because
everybody recognizes that this little
snippet of mitochondrial DNA has
basically no commercial value and so the
government has gotten to a point where
it recognizes this is something that we
don't care it's a public domain we're
not worried about it so I won't care
whether the sample sequence is taken in
guelph or whether we do it in Costa Rica
or wherever we do it it doesn't matter
that's the level of understanding of
biodiversity genetic stuff which we're
beginning to see emerge in many many
tropical countries it takes a while took
