University of Texas Austin I guess more
important I have my PhD from Carnegie
Mellon since half the audiences and
maybe Pierre you're from Carnegie Mellon
also know okay well a good percentage of
the audiences and if you put me in the
crowd then there are three Carnegie
Mellon people versus to foreigners of
some sort and so the Carnegie Mellon
thing I guess has benefited me by having
a audience so I'm going to talk about
Edward and Adsense and some of the
research were doing at kearney at non
current email that you can see on these
subjects and I'll also mention a little
about work that we're doing with one of
the large advertisers of Google one of
the people pay big money to Google and
discuss you know just briefly some of
the issues that they face and how we're
trying to work with them to enhance the
value they get from google so that's the
picture of things now let me start by
mentioning that we're also customers of
Google one way we try to figure out
what's going on with Google is just to
become customers and advertise our
research center so we have the keyword
research and electronic commerce and we
bid on that in terms of both Edward and
Adsense to see what's going on and
although i should say that the amount of
money we spend is not really significant
contributing to the revenue stream at
Google but it makes us better understand
what's going so here we have our website
where we have all our papers on various
topics and we were one of the first to
publish I think we had the first book
out on on e-commerce was called
frontiers electronic commerce which is
probably published in 1996 so it's a
thick book of about 800 pages that
discusses all sorts of issues in
e-commerce and it's probably out of date
well it's definitely out of date doesn't
mention google so that marks it as so as
dated so here's a kind of a picture of
how we see things we have google in the
center of the universe because that's
the way we look at things that Google is
for us an extremely innovative company
and then poses a challenge almost like a
mystery to figure out how Google works
and so we pursue that mystery and we'll
try to show you how we have figured out
how Edward works and then we have some
ideas on how Adsense could work always
from the point of view of Google
maximizing revenue so we look at
everything from Google's point of view
because we want to uncover the mystery
and we're always viewing Google as an
entity that maximizes revenue within the
framework of what they're doing so
Google is in the middle and we have
advertisers with a dword and in a way
Edward and Adsense interact with
advertisers and publishers so Google of
course is a publisher and then it has
this big network of publishers that it
it provides advertisers exposure
and we're going to or I'm going to
emphasize the idea of exposure rather
than just focusing on the links on the
google page because i think that the
idea of exposures a more general idea
and Google is well it generates a lot of
revenue now or most of its revenue from
the google pages that over time when
there's the greater interest development
wireless today there is a big conference
on apple and wireless the notion of the
link as a focus of the ad may become
less important and it's just exposure in
exposure in various contexts and various
locations that in whatever environment
you're and seem to make sense so we have
video the question is where does the
exposure get the greatest attention on
the wireless screen where it is a video
where does the attention span go so
these things have to be calibrated and
you know that's what we are we're
looking at so we are focusing first on
Edward i'll talk about edward and then
go on to adsense so we had a paper in a
journal decision support the system is
2006 where we showed that Google's
advertising model was far superior in
terms of the auction structure to yahoo
so we showed that yahoo was defective in
the auction model and believing in our
own research i went and bought some
Google stock actually we had the results
in in late two thousand four so it it
turned out over the years to veo okay
and we have a much more elaborate paper
coming out and information systems
research
so that's a leading journal in the
information systems field so the thing
that google has come up with in terms of
auction theory is actually a new auction
model so in the in the information
systems research article we describe a
fundamentally new auction model that
somehow google has discovered and that
model has a much higher expected revenue
generation or let's say higher revenue
generation than the traditional auction
models so it's very performance-based so
in in Google as you know the advertisers
pay based on click so that's what is
called in the in the auction business
unit price auction so they're very
different than ebay auctions or other
traditional auctions so Google uses
information on the bidders potential to
generate revenues for Google and I'll
show you how that works and how we would
adjust the bids to take account of the
characteristics of the of the bitter the
advertiser both in terms of the ranking
rules because Google has certain ranking
rules so you bid on us on a keyword a
certain amount of money which is the
amount you pay on the click and that
then is the basis for google assigning
you to a particular link on the Google
site but Google as they say adjusts your
bid based on past performance or some
other things are not explicit and we
have explicit ways that one would do it
and so in terms of the theoretical model
we may
get clear and the auction Google assigns
advertisers to links or slots and each
advertiser can get one link in the
bidding system and google has something
unusual which is that each advertiser
bids and they then are signed two links
as against bidding on each link so
there's some research that shows that
that's equivalent those two things
equivalent so Google has in some way
simplify the auction model and it
doesn't deteriorate the revenue that
auction model generates so it's a pretty
good way that they either guest or
worked it out mathematically I don't
know but it turns out to be perfectly
fine with Google doesn't it makes a lot
of sense but you know we had to figure
it all out actually it's very
complicated to to show that that's true
so it's kind of amazing that Google
people know these things so the way
things are set up here in the Google
world you have in a prominence of a link
so the first link or the first slot is
the one that people think has the
greatest attention and then the next
link in the next link and I have had a
student at UT who now works for Google
and Beijing who did our thesis on
experimentation to show that this is
actually true that people look at the
first language and some go on to look at
the second third so if you're an
advertised you'd like to get to the
first link so we have a measure of the
prominence of the first leg
the second and the third and then we
have what we call the quality of the
advertisement or the quality of the ad
or the advertiser which is the
indication of how likely they are to
generate more or less click throughs and
we believe that Google estimates that
based on past performance of the
advertiser with respect to that link and
that's one basis for just saying the
bids and then another parameter or
what's called an economics type is the
quality of the advertisement which is
the information the advertiser knows and
how likely they're going to get a sale
from a click so a conversion factor so
in terms of information Google will have
an idea on the the quality of the
advertisement and and then they're well
on the potential for the advertiser to
generate clicks and then there's this
quality level which is probabilistic ly
known by everybody so we have some
mathematics here but I'll just try to
talk through the math I you people
probably not interested in the duties of
the mathematics although aegon probably
is interested in but I'm not going to
talk that much of that level so what we
have is in terms of the economic model
we have an auction model where there are
various there are two types of
information that the bitter knows one of
the pieces of information Google
estimates
and the other is just known to the
advertiser and then that creates a new
kind of auction model with two types so
the slots or the links are sold through
a weighted unit price auction and the
weights are the things that we suggest
google uses to adjust the bids based on
your past performance so in our model
which is again trying to model Google
Google with us would score a particular
bid so b is the bid and w of theta is a
kind of a score that Google would come
up with that woulda just a bit based on
your past performance and then the after
the scores are determined again based on
your bid on your best performance then
you would have an assignment to a
particular link so that's the way it
would work and then what we just saying
here that what we do is we find waiting
ski and how the waiting is determined
how advertisers would different click
through potential match in equilibrium
so what we're showing is that because of
this weighting scheme Google matches
better the advertiser and the customer
so Google is really in the center
between somebody's going to buy a
product a customer or potential customer
and an advertiser and Google matches
these things much better than yahoo did
until yahoo adopted or try to adopt a
google auction model so for years yahoo
was mismatching advertisers with
potential customers which meant that
potential customers you know who are
interested in finding information out
about products they want to buy we're
getting
mislead on the Yahoo site well Google
site has a tightly match and I think
that's why Google just took off and just
beat down Yahoo because they had a
faulty auction model basically just use
a conventional auction modifying a
textbook so you know it wasn't uh and
also google are just minimum bid so as
an advertiser is a minimum bid and that
minimum bid is adjusted by again your
past performance so if you're if you've
got bad past performance your minimum
bid is raised so it's kind of keeping
out people who are not that really
properly matched you know let's say you
have a keyword paris hotels and you want
to advertise dog food you know with
maybe the idea that somebody's going off
to paris in the last minute that you
figure they get to get some dog food so
they buy some dog food from that link
but that link isn't generating much
revenue for for google only occasionally
somebody remembers they got to get dog
food before they take off for Paris so
what you want to get in the paris hotels
connected with the keyword you want
paris hotel advertising for the keyword
and that's this matching idea that
really is underlying the google auction
model so you want to match but you're
going to let people reveal the
information that they have in this
matching environment meaning the
advertisers really put forth the ads
that are most relevant if you knew all
the information and you could set it up
as an operations research model using
some integer programming optimization
but you can't do it that way so egon
polish couldn't step in here because you
don't know the information need the
economic ideas
get you the matching so that's the
so here's just some comments on the
keyword if any of you have any questions
just you know fire away at some
questions so the last bullet here you
know for you people interested in Google
is that we show that this revenue
maximizing weighting scheme which is
what we're developing in the model in
differential minimum bid policy and
generate higher revenue than standard
fixed payment auction so there's
auctions let's say from from ebay and
things like that but they're in a
different class of auctions so Google's
auction model is unique class of
auctions both first price and second
price that that they have or could have
and they generate higher expected
revenue than if you were to use an ebay
auction so Google in effect has
uncovered a new option model and least
the way we model it so
so there is some related literature
there was a paper in the American
Economic Review which looked at things
from a totally different perspective not
from Google's perspective with some
perspective and economics like
efficiency which means you take account
of social welfare things like that which
we didn't think was you know really a
focus of Google so we didn't bother to
go in that direction and they made
various assumptions which it didn't
really in our view consistent with
reality but they were successful in
getting a paper in the top economics
journal so from an academic point of
view there they get full marks but
otherwise they left the field open to
really look at it from the point of view
of Google's interest in maximizing
revenue and again the you know we're
summarizing our starting point as
advertisers may have different potential
to generate click throughs which is what
the potential customer the users of
Google is really saying we're interested
in the information that you're providing
on these links you know we'd like to
pursue that so the click-through really
describes the interest of the customer
and the satisfaction of the customer
going to the google website to find
information with respect to had keyword
you know people weren't clicking it
means they went and looked at the links
and the links had particularly no
relevance to what they were interested
in so it would be a big negative I think
in the long run for Google which is
again what happened to yahoo the people
said hey we're just not getting anything
that's interesting here and you know
let's go to Google where we get
systematically get relevant advertising
you know so targeted advertising which
is really the key to this whole field
is the focus and great success of google
and i think a relative failure at yahoo
in the sense they went on for years with
this improper auction mechanism so you
know google had a chance to run ahead of
them now they're you know they have
something which presumably is much
better but I I don't know the details
and we don't really look at Yahoo so one
of the things that you see with the
Google model is that Google is looking
at advertisers in a dynamic sense so it
looks back in some way that I guess as a
google secret and sees what took place
in the past when this advertiser came
and put it on put an ad on Google with
respect to that keyword and if they
generated lots of interest by the
customers or potential customers of
people coming to the google site to find
information to find relevant products
then let's look at them as the kind of
advertiser we want with respect to a
keyword so in effect it's kind of a
dynamic process and we looked a little
at the dynamic time a dynamic process
now as I said we've been looking at
things from the point of view of the of
the advertiser and working with one of
the large advertisers of Google and try
and understand you know how things work
from the advertiser's perspective and
again Sarah yeah from google Beijing did
experiments to see how people react to
these various links the first second and
third link and how much search people do
which then gives an advertiser an idea
on where
are they hope to place their ad because
not everybody well only one advertisers
and get the top link you know then the
next link in the next link so it may
make sense depending on situation to put
in a reasonably high bid but not what
you think is the highest even with your
adjustment from google because it may be
the third link is pretty good in terms
of the products you have and the amount
of people are going to search and you
may be able because the sum of the
google keywords become pretty expensive
you can get keywords a twenty five or
fifty dollars one more when we did we're
paying fifty cents because there's not a
lot of competition among advertisers who
are doing research and e-commerce maybe
some other universities and you know
they're not spending money in that way
it's not a conventional thing for
university research group to advertise
on Google but when you get to other
things then the prices go up you know if
you look at let's say asbestos ads I
think there we found a website that had
the price they collected price
information of someone had two hundred
and fifty dollars a click so there if
you are a lawyer with these asbestos
claims you want to get people to come to
your site fill out the form you sent it
into the collection place and you send
them a check and you keep your share as
the lawyer so it's a it's a it's a just
a completely competitive business the
whole lawsuits been settled all you're
going to do is facility people
collecting their money from the asbestos
suit so it's the key to your business is
just getting more customers so these
the winning top link would be let's say
two hundred fifty dollars because that's
the whole basis for your business it's
so you know it's a nationwide or most
like a nationwide business and you know
what are you going to do is no point
advertising a in local newspaper so
Google is it and the bidding is then
very aggressive so we're trying to look
at the issues of location and pricing
and how i price my product I'm a price
my product lower if I go to the and get
the third the third link so there's a
whole sort of broad strategy of of
issues so one of the things that a
advertiser is concerned with is how do
they eventually get a customer to buy
their product now sometimes a customer
let's say for a laptop their laptop just
broke so they want to replace it with
another laptop so they go to keyword
laptop and then they may refine that
down so there's a sequence of steps of
the customer does and so if you're
looking at the data from an advertiser's
point of view they're collecting a whole
sequence of data as people come to
various websites that they have that are
more and more specific if let's say
you're just thinking about getting a
computer then you start out computer
desktop laptop whatever so there's a
decision process underlying the
customers process that the advertiser
wants understand and to place ads to
move that customer in their direction so
they may
get some clicks from a particular
keyword but get very little conversion
because it's leading them to another
related keyword that's more specific
that eventually leads to something that
converts so the question for them or for
us as working with them is how do you
bid on keywords that don't seem to have
much conversion for them but they are in
the sequence that leads to a keyword
that converts so I don't know if that
make sense to you that the advertiser
has a more complex challenge than just
bidding on a keyword because they want
to understand the decision process and
they have classes of customers people
who just want to replace a laptop or you
know some other particular component
versus somebody thinking let's go and
get a computer for my kid or grandkid
and let's just start there and just go
through and figure out what we're
looking for and they're going through a
whole decision process so i don't know
if you have any comments on you you
mentioned your interest from the
advertisers point of view
kind of impression style adds
yes
yeah you know the advertiser we work
where they're saying you know look we're
spending huge amounts of money on on
Google we've got to figure out how to
you know increase the value from that if
we can you know they also have channel
conflicts meaning that they're selling
products through not only themselves and
their online site but through channels
so they would like to get as many
products sold but they would prefer in
the end that somebody buys it from their
site rather than from a channel within
reason because again if the channel
stuff dries up they lose channel
partners and you know so in certain key
words of bidding against their channel
partners you know which is hard to say
their competitors in some sense but
they're their partners I think they
would work for further term partners so
you know how do they handle that where
they are just spending a lot of money
competing with their with their partners
and you know in some sense get google is
benefiting from the competition so I
don't know if you run into that where
yeah yeah yeah but so okay so we
indicate that you know we want to model
that process
so let me just talk a little about
Adsense so the the the Adsense seems to
us while it's still relatively small at
least when we understand from the
industry in terms of revenue for Google
potentially could be a huge growth in
revenue because of the developments in
in other kinds of media the the YouTube
where you have video and you have to
figure out the context of the ad and the
video you have wireless growth where
again the Google Site may show up it may
show up in a different form and then
you've got all these worldwide site so
here we really focus on exposure so
we're saying Google is going to sell
exposure and on Adsense you can talk
about as an advertiser you can either go
you can go and really look at things in
terms of exposure how much your bidding
for a certain amount of exposure at
least the way we we see Adsense and so
what we've done here is well talk about
exposure and give some reasons why
exposure of an ad is a more natural
concept and a slot so if we have lots of
different publishers including Google
you know you don't want to be allocating
the advertiser to the first slot and
every site that has this kind of
structure of course lots of sites don't
have this nice structure so the exposure
idea seems to be a good way of looking
at it so what I'm going to talk about
now is an idea we have on how Adsense
should
work where we're going to have people
bidding on on packages of exposures what
we call slices of the total amount of
exposure that Google has in a certain
period of time and then we're going to
show how to optimize that we're
introducing some optimization with
respect to an auction model so we have
an optimization and within that we have
advertisers bidding for exposure with
respect to a particular slice structure
and then we're going to look at how to
vary the slice structure to maximize the
total revenue for google so it's a it's
the way we think Google make more money
if they're not doing it now of course
you don't really know how they do it so
it's an idea for making money here in
terms of Adsense and it combines both
auctions and optimization so the auction
gives you an idea how people will pay
for particular slice of exposure so
let's say Google has 10,000 exposures in
a certain period of time the first
package could be 500 exposures an X 1
300 and things like that or it could be
5,000 exposures so the package of
exposures that people bid on could keep
varying and so if Google understood the
demand for exposures it could then
figure out the optimal packaging and
that would be the way to make maximum
revenue so it's a exercise in what's
called price discrimination second
degree price discrimination with respect
to an underlying auction model so it
combines two things in economic auctions
and price discrimination to come up with
a
AKA come up with a way of really making
lots of money so here and this is one
thing which is unclear to us I know if
anybody has any ideas on it and
auctioneer say Google has a total amount
of resource which is just call it one we
just normalize the one could be 10,000
exposures and then it's going to come up
with this share structure which will be
a package of exposures so the first
package will have the largest number of
exposures the next package the next
largest and so forth and they sum to 1
which is just as total include some to
10,000 if we didn't we didn't scale it
so just a scaling factor the thing
that's really unclear to us is that the
total exposures in a certain period of
time is not really fixed I mean it keeps
varying so then how does Google handle
that that is does it say okay we only
got eight thousand exposures fill the
first X as the exposures come in we
first give them to the top slice s1 so
we fill up that slice and then we go to
the next slice so do you have any idea
how they do it yeah we have this rain is
but then you have to Alec I don't know
here are you knowledgeable in this area
but me
yeah so it's so we're just assuming that
it's fixed the number is known but there
must be a way of dealing with this
uncertainty in any small period of time
you just have a rule that you allocate
in some way let's say we see the
exposures coming in at a lower rate that
we anticipate so we proportionally
reduce and each each slice we proportion
reduce the number of exposures because
the odds are weighted according to this
yeah over time we could work out but you
know then there may be some advertisers
are more keen on getting a precise
number they have to let's say a
marketing campaign so if they're getting
a slice that has say 3,000 exposures
they want to get pretty close to that so
they're willing to pay more money to get
more assurance so risk-averse kind of
idea and while some other people say
well we'll take a lower slice and we'll
pay a lot less and if there's anything
any exposures we'll grab them if not
well what the hell you know like we as
academic advertisers we could get a low
price and there are any exposures left
over we take it if not well we didn't
pay much anyway and you know it's not
it's not the end of the world if we're
not we're not exposed on Google yes jay
is that a fixed number or is it it's a
fixed number in our model but I'm saying
it really shouldn't be is it really that
s FJ wants to have more than a sub J
plus 1 so right being for 3,000
exposures
bids for twice as many exposures as the
next level and that as long as the ratio
is maintained well I would be another
way of doing it that would be another
way of doing it so it would be kind of
an equal scaling back versus not really
knows how many clicks or having exposure
just exposures right time right it's
just that that whatever it is generated
you need to maintain the ratio between
the different lips quality or exposure I
have a more general question I guess I'm
not that but we're taking food products
time which ones are based on quick ruse
and which ones are
well see as an advertiser you're
interested in getting a customer who buy
a product so ultimately you want what's
called conversion meaning that the
customer clicks they see the ad they
click on it think about it and then they
you know the next thing you see is a
credit card so that's what they want the
advertiser wants business so the
question is how do you get business well
you start out with exposure and then
that can be often correlated with a
click so in terms of Google are willing
to let you talk about exposure or click
because they could be you know highly
correlated and then the advertiser
itself or themselves they see the
conversion Google doesn't generally know
how many people pull their credit card
out and buy the product that's the
advertisers knowledge so in the end the
advertiser got to see business from this
process but at the Google level you
could have exposure or click through as
long as I correlated you can go back and
forth between the two is that a
reasonable
and impressions so that's that's not
harder yeah but you can say that we've
given you exposure meaning you know 30
seconds on youtube in certain contexts
yeah right right but and so again this
theory we can develop in terms of clicks
we just when you when you go to Adsense
they talk about exposures and clicks so
yeah but if all you did was was just
counting on exposures I don't know
there's a way to get feedback to google
on yeah the quality of the ads yeah so
we could just use exposure at
click-through in the head sense yeah so
there you don't even get imagine that
you don't get the conversion but of
course yeah yeah but then when you go on
the wireless you know and then the
restaurant yeah they know we're you know
a vending machine Google's going to have
it in the wireless location will say
well the next you know walk 30 feet take
a left turn knock on the door and you'll
get your your can of coke coca-cola I
mean so you know the location thing you
know really again as a whole new world
which you know will have I think
fantastic implications for revenue
generation in in this google world but
you know we're you know for us it's just
a word click or exposure we could talk
about clicks or packaging clicks of
packaging exposure so it's
but the problem is that well we could
just use use so the advertisers just bid
on their willingness to pay for a
particular slice and again you know you
just have this allocation of slices here
I just have some mathematics that what
is really saying is that you can look at
the advertisers expected revenue based
on their bid so here we had as say is
the the basic of the second price of the
bid so what it's saying is that the
expected payoff from an advertiser is
that expression where they have a
certain value and they put in a certain
bid and then the auction is revenue is
this and so what we're able to do then
if we have an idea of the bidding
functions and the auction you know we
can then determine the optimal slices so
the idea is to slice things up in
packages that generate the maximum
revenue for people's you may have a lot
of advertisers who want to have big
slices so you have quite a few big
slices and you charge high prices for it
or you have some lots of the advertised
just want small slices and so you just
go in that direction and so depending
it's like an airline you see a lot of
people coming who let's say they look
pretty wealthy and they want to go to
Middle East somewhere so you reconfigure
the planes you have lots of first-class
seats and generate more profit that way
so it's the same thing here it's just a
form of price discrimination a lot of
people
going to bid on on big slices there you
know heavy hitters then you just make as
many big slices as possible and you
really ramp up the price as you would an
airline you know you start charging
$25,000 for a first class seat because
that's what people want or vice versa
you know people flying to other place in
the world where it's not so affluent so
so this is the basic idea that we're
proposing is using price discrimination
to package things together and here were
just going into some mathematical issues
on how to compute these slices this
so-called monotone hazard rate in terms
of the auction model so I'm going to
just skip through this plus you know I'm
running out of my a lot of time one of
the things that you find is that you
have these different slices and some
slices may be the same size what you're
just going to still charge people more
money for the same slice in terms of
this price discrimination because they
they were bidding higher they were more
anxious so we have these first class
seats and we put them up for bid and
people are going to pay their bid so
somebody says you know I'm not going to
I got to be in wherever and I got to be
in a first class seat so they bid
tremendous amount you just take their
money and there's still other people
bidding for first class seats for the
same product but they're bidding less
and you still have first class seat so
you let them sit in the first class seat
so busy extracting as much revenue as
you can for everybody and that's you
know the economic model here that we
show that you can have the same the same
resource but people are going to pay
more or less money for it so you group
these common slices together
and of course in a plane you'd have you
know first class seat and then you'd
have business class c DH and you know
Premium Economy Plus so you have these
different groupings of seats to extract
the the revenue from people so this is
the idea of price discrimination you
squeeze a customer because you're
getting from the bidding their
excitement by getting their hands on
that product so you leave as little
amount of money on the table as possible
by the price discrimination method so we
we study a lot of different ways of
squeezing the customer that and and I
mean this is not just us but other
economist do that too so this is just
more discussion of this whole squeezing
business
no this is a business term isn't it you
want to squeeze your your advertisers
you know get as much money as you can
from isn't it the idea here yeah I'm
going to be careful this is going to be
on YouTube so yeah but but if people are
very happy you want to make sure that
they leave amount of money that reflects
a happiness with you yeah I mean they
could learn that the happiness can be
achieved with bidding less but again
they don't know who's going to be
bidding against them again so they take
their chances on that so this is all
sorts of mathematical features of this
of these issues here okay so you know
the main result here is that depending
on the demand function you're going to
have different slice structures as you
would expect you know as I illustrated
with the discussion of the plane and
filling up the plane and maximizing
revenue which of course is a big thing
for the airlines now given they have
this huge fixed cost of fueling up the
plane they have to squeeze everything in
you and you have that feeling when you
go on a plane they are squeezing you for
all the revenue and they can get their
hands on so you know this is the same
idea in a way that what we're talking
about here is just making sure that all
the money you can get is and this
literature and economics on
discriminatory pricing and uniform price
auctions and
so here are just some conclusions that
we have so we're just trying to identify
the issues that would lead to the proper
allocation of these slices or
collections of of exposures or
click-throughs that you can offer across
the the google adsense network and the
structure depends on the demand function
in various ways that are are mentioned
here depending on the structure or which
what we will call price elasticity the
price versus the number of people are
willing to pay for exposure or clicks as
that varies you're going to have
different structure so we say here the
advertisers prices ellesse this year
demand for exposure so the you know the
just discussion things that we have you
know what's the future direction in
terms of auctions on slots or exposure
as we move into this wireless world
Google is ambiguous in their auction
they don't specify precisely how things
work so an ebay you know exactly how it
works so we're trying to figure out what
you call the effect of ambiguity in the
auction on the revenue generation so
it's again a research topic of why
google has ambiguity and presumably
since everything else that Google does
generates more revenue presumably it's a
way of generating more revenue so it's a
research topic for us and then I
mentioned this is uncertainty of the
volume of traffic
in you know in the in the Google Network
I mean it's just not clear how much
traffic you're getting for a particular
context so the click throughs exposures
would vary you know suddenly you know
the massive denial of service attack
across the world the click throughs
exposures refer particular context would
would fall dramatically so how that's
handled you know I don't know then we've
looked at this area of advertising
exchange you know because Google has
bought double-click and we can't seem to
figure out how these things fit together
do you know how they fit together
yeah but see it seems like you have all
this potential but you have one way of
doing it which is the auction models
were you know Google is managing all
these sites in sort of a one-sided
market and then you allow advertisers to
exchange so it seemed like they're not
totally in harmony I have the I have a
two-sided market and I have a one-sided
market and they're both operating and
how do they fit together yeah
if we start switching to
yeah but then how does a advertiser
decide whether they want to go to the ad
exchange and i'm not sure what they're
exchanging there they're exchanging
locations just any put something here
but yeah yeah so it seems not clear and
you know we've asked the people who work
with and they're not clear oh it is ok
ok well there any other points worth
discussing we could go back offline
discuss Carnegie Mellon I could tell you
more stories about the good old days of
Carnegie Mellon before was called
Carnegie Mellon
both ways you know we get this tradition
country I've been here different
according to fitters versus optic
designers and we could also look at that
energy from your option designed
reversers all their auction designers
yeah yeah yes that's right yeah and I
think it's a good point the so we tend
to take the point of view of Google
meaning we know that Google wants to
maximize revenue their profit maximizing
company so they seem to do everything
from that point of view as we can see it
so we're sort of asking the first
question if I want to maximize my
revenue as an advertiser as a as a as a
auction here then do I make things
precise or do I leave some ambiguity for
example Google doesn't precisely specify
how it makes these adjustments you know
how much it uses past behavior how it
uses past behavior in terms of clicked
river they must have some for me because
as Google's all automated as i
understand i mean there's nobody sitting
there adjusting things well I mean you
know you don't have to have a million
people it solve the unemployment problem
in the US hiring all these people making
adjustments on every keyword so it's
presumably all automated and so there
are formulas they are that they're using
to automate the process but the formulas
aren't made public which would then
allow a advertiser to figure out how to
do things like me or frequent flyer
points you know it's really discounts
for the future passed on based on on
what you've done the past so you're
buying stuff from America and or
whatever and you're getting these points
but you know explicitly you look on the
table although there is ambiguity on
whether you can actually buy something
with those points so there really is
ambiguity with the points as well
because you don't know what they're
worth so I guess when you look around
you see ambiguity because it's not a
commitment when I gets a 20,000 miles
it's not a commitment that I can get a
round trip ticket to New York or
something like that it just says you can
give it a try and maybe the only thing
to do is get a ticket to you know
somewhere in Kansas City or something
like that even though you want to go in
New York so the whole thing is not clear
I guess is the point and which maybe is
done for lots of reasons but it's an
interesting open research topic to
understand why eBay is very explicit and
why google has this ambiguity so we call
it strategic in a sense that it's done
with some purpose in mind but maybe
maybe it isn't maybe just that's a way
it is and nobody bothered to say let's
make it explicit
they may close it all up there well you
know ebay is a is a different model of
me lots of people come in they may not
go to a particular ebay auction ma is
very diffused ebay you know people
looking for rocking chair they get it
next time they want to buy a laptop but
ebay just has a standard second price
auction so Eve a didn't innovate in
auction and Yahoo was using a kind of a
second price auction they didn't there's
there's a
it's chaotic I guess is not a steady
state because somebody may wait until
the last minute I mean they'd just a tie
bit more than we did last right that
that's pretty awkward to do in any kind
of steady state right so you want to
come up with a way where people tell the
truth people say this is how much I'm
willing to pay I mean it and then oh
yeah well actually we have examples
where the Google auction doesn't give
you truthful necessarily truthful
bidding you could be strategic if you
could figure out what to do while on
eBay in theory because as the second
price auction it should be you should be
bidding at some point your value right
there is a sequential it's sequential
the the google auction is a sealed bid
and you just put in your bid and that's
it and ebay there's this sequential
process yeah good but the Norfolk come
back right they're going to they're
going to start going back with lower bit
of it
well you know Google you do adjust I
mean on your site you do adjust they bid
and you'll be adjusted up if you've been
a good customer so no that's that's
that's what it says on the website and
so we have it built into the model and
we show that that's a key to increasing
revenue right right which also means
that the people who are coming to the
site looking for relevant ads will be
disappointed right and that's the idea
of the matching that Google has is very
powerful matching well you'll have to
calibrate where the position of the
image is in terms of the prime spot the
next prime spot which means that you
know this I mentioned this work of Sarah
yeah when she was doing just the
straight the google site so people
presumably in Google or other places
will have to calibrate the location on a
wireless device or images like on on
YouTube where people's eyes go to first
with respect to the kind of presentation
you have so that's you know a whole
challenge for Google and for the
advertisers who want to make money off
of Google and of course with Google to
survive the advertisers have to make
money so but you know the old way of
advertising this lack of targeted
advertising is of course causing a shift
of money to the Google even with the
economy in a slow period now the Google
presumably is still getting more
business while the traditional
advertising places newspapers and
magazines there you know they're really
having trouble
if we can reduce the number of ads
someone has run to get their customers
but they're better off right right
that's a targeting I mean you're you're
showing as some people are really
interested in getting a product so
they're not going to use a tivo on
Google they're going to Google because
they're thinking of buying a tennis
racket and that's the ads they want you
know versus watching a TV program where
you know you have no interest in tennis
and they're just constantly placing ads
on tennis rackets so I mean they try to
connect these things but it's you know
it's a mass audience and so they can't
do it that well
so I guess
seem to be at the end so well thanks for
coming and showing the school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
