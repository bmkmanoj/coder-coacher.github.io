are the winners of the 2008 juicy ideas
competition they've done an excellent
job they're going to show us today how
they created their bike out of water
bottles and they're also going to show
us the version 2 point 0 and how they
plan to make it a reality so what we're
going to do first is show their video so
you can take a look at that and get an
idea of how the process went and then
they're going to do their wonderful
presentation so here we go
for this competition we wanted to take
plastic bottles which are one of the
more abundant recyclable items we use
every day and translate that into
something we felt was really important
in meeting our current needs for being
green we found our answer in a bike
which not only reduces the usage of cars
and therefore carbon dioxide emissions
but as an economic and eco-friendly mode
of transportation we already know
there's numerous use for plastic alone
why can't a community be
self-sustainable by reusing their
recyclables for affordable community
bikes we ventured the idea and found the
possibilities
working hard
you
you
you
alright alright so I want to introduce
now Ryan Spenser Andrew and Justin all
right just to reiterate we want to thank
everyone for coming out and listening to
what we had to say we're from boone
north carolina i don't know if that's
familiar for you guys but small town in
western north carolina fifteen thousand
or so students at our school and we're
all members of the industrial design
program i'm ryan clinger I'm Spencer
price I'm Andrew Drake all right um
before we could even begin to evaluate
what we wanted to do for the competition
we had to orientate ourselves around
what a plastic bottle was through its
lifecycle physical properties and his
actual role in recycling after that we
could begin to brainstorm some ideas we
came up with well first of all we had to
we wanted to do something
environmentally friendly sound and
responsible how could we give back to
the community such as a bicycle
commercial viability was something that
we wanted to focus on and um generally
something that solved issues of over
consumption and since we're product
design related we really wanted to focus
on an actual product and not an idea so
we came up with green transportation you
go through the ideas some of the
original ideas that we were just thrown
out during our brainstorming session
where things such as park benches that
the community would be able to use would
be able to have out in a park or
something a different community park
products different water purification
systems maybe a gutter system to collect
rain what's going on with rain
collection a spaceship you know can't
can't dream too big and finally finally
we decided a bicycle was probably the
best option because not only does that
get the recycle bottles out of the
landfill but it really gives back to the
community it's a form of green
transportation it cuts down on co2
emissions and all other sorts of a
missions from cars and I am it's healthy
riding around on a bicycle this is just
some of the day-to-day process that we
had to go through first day was really
just brainstorming bottle collection day
too it was a bunch of trial and error of
things that we were running into
problems it we ended up not being able
to build it the way we originally wanted
to the next day we had to search for a
decommissioned bike that we could
recycle an old bike as well and take a
few parts from it like such as the
wheels and the crankshaft that we really
couldn't figure out a way of making out
of plastic at the time especially day
four we took a little bit of break and
throughout the rest of the time we were
really just constructing the bike and
filming I'd have to say that we spent
probably a total of forty hours each on
the bike throughout the 10-day process
so we put a lot of time into it talk
about personal challenges we had not the
child the challenge now is getting yeah
yeah
oh yeah yeah the at the first day that
it started was the day that you actually
found out what recyclable material you'd
have to use so there was really no
preparing for it or anything it's just
all of a sudden we found out that we had
used plastic bottles to make something
of use yeah in terms of challenges the
whole competition was a pretty big
challenge because we we're not we
weren't very informed on bicycles in
general you know we're not huge bike
enthusiasts or anything like that we
obviously never made a bike before let
alone out of plastic bottles so we came
into you know a few problems here and
there like we didn't really know how we
were going to secure all the joints for
the frame stuff like that obviously when
you're making hollow tubes it makes it
slightly difficult when it's not out of
one entire mold to make all the joints
work and have a functional bike so that
was one of the big problems that we
faced when we were building the bike and
using the crankshaft to be a hub for two
of the bigger joints was also a problem
that was that was the more challenging
of the joints okay well in terms of our
company ideal and its services what we
have here is our company is dedicated to
being a leader in product innovation
through use of sustainable materials we
strive to provide commercially
beneficial and responsible products
through creative reliable and green
solutions in terms of a plastic bicycle
we chose the plastic to be polyethylene
which is the more common of all plastics
that are out there in the market almost
any plastic product that that you come
in contact with is polyethylene so when
you're producing a bike in actual
manufacturing the idea of using a mold
it reduces production and labor costs
significantly as opposed to steel or
aluminum bicycles and when when we say
that it's a completely recyclable frame
a good a good
example for reference would be when we
were in the lobby of building 43 we had
a tour guide who was talking about the
cork flooring and how once it's worn out
its use it can be sent back and
completely recycled and put back in
again well that's exactly the same idea
with taking it a step forward with our
bike which is if it once it's worn out
it's used or if it breaks it can be
completely recycled and sent back to the
user not to mention it's also 18 the
weight of mild steel in comparison with
other bikes we've mentioned before that
it reduces co2 emissions obviously
because it's it's encouraging people to
use bikes other than then driving their
car to work or things of that nature and
you know like i said recycled plastic is
one of our most abundant resources so
you can't go wrong when it's so readily
available and it's almost asking you to
find some way to recycle it and put to
use and another quick note just to add
in is that it's projected that the cost
of metal is about to go up significantly
which really makes plastic an ideal
material to use for something like this
exactly
our marketing plan is really just it's a
recycled bicycle that could be Immelman
implemented in several public and
community commute excuse me commercial
niches do the physical properties
beneficial warranties and customer
incentives can be established I mean
even here at Google you'll have bikes
laying all around campus that you can
pick up and ride off and if the bikes
are offered for even cheaper do the fact
that it's made out of recycled plastic
it's just a great idea I think some of
the incentives that we have our
corporation sponsors such as a coca-cola
for instance because coca-cola bottles
end up being one of huge problems and
the source of it and if coca-cola gets
in on it then they could have a
coca-cola bike that really shows that
they are down for recycling the material
that they're causing such a waste of
university sponsorships there's a few
college campuses around that have the
trust issue that they leave bikes around
campus and students can write it from
one class to another maybe even
personalize designs you could go online
and pick out a design from a certain
template and we could ship the bike to
you personally community transportation
plans cut down on driving the car all
around we took a trip to Chicago
actually last semester and I mean cabs
are really expensive especially for
college students and we're even thinking
that if they had bikes laying around
that maybe you could pay a few dollars
to renting right around all day and you
return it later that night that'd be
great product warranties like we
mentioned before do the fact that the
bikes would be pretty much completely
recyclable if it breaks you send it back
to us weary break the bike the plastic
down remould it and ship it right back
to you and then there's even
possibilities for discounts for discount
Awards in exchange for a cycle plastic
piece recycle a certain amount of
plastic bottles then you can get a
discount off of a bike that you purchase
so those are just some of the plans that
we have um in tuc bestest run yeah this
is a this is a conceptual laws version
of the product we feel it could be
implemented in this in this scenario
this would be a an injection molded
piece split down the middle like if
you're looking at the top you can split
vertically and the inside would actually
contain ribbed engineer structure so
when the injection mold would actually
make the two halves and you would
plastic weld it together um very sorry
did you hear that or should I repeat
that okay yeah so this this is our
second version the majority of the bike
is uh has the capability of being
recycled some some components that we
feel might not be able to are the actual
crankshaft where the pedals go through
the bike and the possibility of the
handlebars just the downward pressure of
a rider but other than that we the
wheels and the frame all have the
possibility and we actually have a
generalized quote from some that does hi
machining and injection molding the mold
itself would be upwards of two hundred
thousand dollars but the bikes
themselves could be made for less than
eight dollars per frame so that puts you
at a thousand bikes to to bring back
that mold cost and then then some and
the bike is called the recycle yeah
we got we've got google's logo on the
mainframe if you can see um this is just
a this is just another rendering trying
to use Google's colors once you guys get
a good look at it these are some of the
sponsorship opportunities that we were
talking about with University in
coca-cola I mean coca-cola could buy a
bunch of these bikes and sell them on my
coke rewards com or give them away and I
mean not only is it great for them to
say that they're recycling or whatever
but I mean it's great advertisement to a
bunch of people are running around on
coca-cola bikes everyone's gonna see it
in want one and then the other version
is our school logo and mascot and this
is a surprise for for payment Royce is
just a special special thanks sure and
uh we just threw that together made a
quarter scale model of what the bike
frame would actually look like this is
made out of a particle wood but of
course the actual might be made out of
recycled plastic so I'll go ahead
anyone have any questions yes in this or
the one we made out of plastic bottles
in the video in this it could be a
similar process where it could be two
types injection molded and put together
or on another machining opportunity is
basically cnc machining where it will
just take a tool running on a computer
program so they can also be made out of
recycled plastic hmm um yeah you
characterize your learning curve over
the 10 days innovation doesn't happen
all at once you trial there all kinds of
learning could you give a rough you know
hand wavy sketchup how much I learned
day 1 day 2 day 3 the days of the break
originally we the way we planned on
doing it was taking the heat gun to the
bottles and melting them together
actually but then we realized that
polyethylene does not bond to itself
unless it's completely shredded up in
melted down to a liquid which we didn't
have the means of doing so that was one
problem and then we talked about the
joints were a problem and we had to do
every single joint in a different way
and seeing that we only had ten days we
didn't have the opportunity to figure
out the best way and then go back and
redo the whole thing so I mean every day
we learned something new and better if
we had I mean obviously we could make
something a lot better now unisex or
female
thumb the one yeah the one downfall to
the to the female bicycle is you know
they do offer that lower central tube
and there are structural issues um so it
would just it would have to be
determined in time whether that kind of
frame could be implemented but it's
definitely engineer able yes and oh yeah
of plastics welding yeah um I don't have
an honest answer for you but
there's there's two opportunities
polyethylene and polypropylene
polypropylene slightly more rigid um
there's a number of ways you can go
about doing it whether it's having a web
structure that snaps it in place inside
or it's strictly by plastic welding so
there's there's also the option of
reinforced polyethylene which other
stronger plastics can be impregnated not
definitely recycled plastics all
plastics are recyclable but polyethylene
is most abundant so you guys in this
competition and spend your 10 days
making do you have managed to apply it
to your school that the school gives you
some class credit or worse than any of
your instructors any of that we learned
about the competition through idsa which
is industrial design Society of America
so there was a little bit of regulation
and a specific time for us to meet up
and pin up our ideas and brainstorm and
talk about it so it went through the
program
44 when we did it in the video it
probably wasn't it probably wasn't very
safe for maybe it'd be the same
emissions as the recycled plastic
bottles with polyethylene omit it
doesn't work in what in what sense like
if the bike road I'm just confused sorry
if if if a flame is applied to it like
if something's got if I can they take a
flame to it then it'll eventually heat
up and melt away but I mean if it's just
sitting out in the Sun nothing's gonna
happen to it it's just the same as any
other injection molded plastic part a
lot of a lot of car components bumpers
non painted bumpers are ABS plastic for
example and they've similar heat
chemical properties
yeah they're um yeah the the color can
fade but yeah a lot of it I think is the
idea of making it more available I mean
because there are so many people who
would love to ride bikes or we're help
out the environment but they might they
might not have the means to like to be
perfectly honest I can't afford the
bicycle that I would like to buy but I
feel like if this was in the market I'd
have I've had it had it had them more
available to me and it would also be
available to ship out like overseas in
the countries that aren't exactly is
privileged and don't have the
opportunities to buy a bicycle I mean
this would be a great way to for them to
have transportation close to place is it
is there any opportunity making pad for
a moment collapsible or something she
gets hard back together I mean I've i
would estimate it at being 15 to 20
pounds which probably be at or below the
standard mountain bike as for like
folding options I I don't see right now
I don't see an opportunity for it except
for the that it snaps together
vertically down the center so there's
just a structural issue the cost of my
advice on how much positives brain
versus
other components to get sent to whether
that eight dollars is a massive
reduction difficult the main cost of a
bike is usually the frame because the
labor costs of it because with the lumen
and everything they have to go in there
and weld every single part to the other
parts where is with this you just have
to do it right down the center which
would be a lot faster and then the other
parts like the pedals and everything and
the crankshaft you could porter those in
mass if we're not producing them
ourselves and get a highly reduced cost
for it which would be fairly cheap the
entire bike would be able to be made for
well under fifty dollars I can tell you
that a foot long maybe half inch
diameter piece of aluminum would cost at
least eight dollars in terms of the
price the rising price of aluminum right
now so
um cost issues yeah cost issues and no
college students a little bit of a
little bit of engineering help for
exactly um how the interior would be
engineered so we can we can cover the
the design aspect and obviously the the
modeling aspect there's a there's a
computer program that allows you to test
structural aspects through applied
materials so we would go through that to
prototype it so you wouldn't necessarily
need to make real prototype before
production so the injection mold itself
is them is the main initial cost groups
of people work together in ways that
foster innovation so I'm wondering over
your 10-day intense period if you as a
team found ways to work better than
dealing with the unknowns and dealing
with surprises did you actually make
progress and how your team dynamics work
the communication anything like that you
care to comment on I'd say so we really
didn't know each other before we started
this so and we really kind of came
together and made it happen so we figure
out we figured out who is better at what
and put them at that position but
transferred around a little bit just
doing trying to get everything done it
once with such little time hey we were
making the bike up until the night
before that the video was due so it was
really down to the wire long
were there any kind of like breakthrough
moments at Eureka moment or was it all
just kind of incremental like homie oh
yeah the Oh the way we actually made the
tubes was a real breakthrough moment um
they were really structurally sound and
I think we were all impressed and
there's a few other applications that
could possibly be implemented there just
the way when the plastic got to a
certain temperature it actually became
really really strong and rigid right
before the point where it would actually
break down mechanically we found that if
you cut the gatorade bottles a certain
way they really just snapped right into
each other pretty well and and then
after that you know what's related other
bottles on top of it they just shrunk
down and that added the strength so that
was I mean there are a lot of Eureka
moments when we're just really ecstatic
and then five seconds later we realized
that something else wasn't going to work
just hit another brick wall and then it
is definitely a roller coaster
throughout the week yeah the innovation
process is pretty much the whole time
I'd say what did it teach you about
innovating and entrepreneurship like
what is this process at a foster in your
mind that you might not about enough
that it doesn't happen in 10 days
we took the trip to the Chicago
collegiate entrepreneurs conference and
that was a big eye-opener because we we
actually SAT through a business pitch
competition and we never really thought
about our idea as anything more than we
originally thought about it and then
after that point we realized you know we
have an idea we can pitch it and then we
just got motivated in an entrepreneurial
sense yeah yeah yeahs appstate got
behind the competition said uh ask the
the judges to pick a winner from
appalachian state and that they'd send
the winning team on an all expense trip
paid to chicago for the polly job and I
mean we were walking through the lobby
and we're like you know what this bike
could really turn into something and I
mean up until the night before our
flight yesterday I was in one of the
labs painting that model trying to get
it all ready so I in 10 days definitely
isn't enough we've been working on it
since then and we'll hopefully be able
to continue onwards yeah the whole the
whole process brought on a lot of
initiative that we really hadn't
explored before you know it's like we're
sitting in class doing what we gotta do
doing our projects focusing on that but
you know at the same time we can be
doing these other things to further
prepare us for the future so yeah I mean
am i right and our studio class right
now we're actually working on a refugee
design project where we have to design
something for refugee camps over in
Africa and I mean these would be cheaply
made we could ship them them over to the
refugee camps and they have a faster way
of getting into a town to buy something
that Nate they need an Packer into town
debt or into a towards the creek to pick
up water for the nail because a lot of
the times they waste a lot a few hours
of the day collecting water and going
back and its really dangerous from them
to leave the camps and with a bike would
be a lot faster so
you had a question
there's there's only so much we can do
right now we we need to all sit down as
a team and learn the computer program
that I was talking about they can test
structural aspects and talk to some more
people that specialize in molds that's
almost all we can do until we can take
the next step which would be to to
actually make a prototype and we wrote
up a business plan with the help of the
our entrepreneurial department hopefully
you guys will enjoy it yeah um his
name's Matt Clark and he's he's in
Southern California and he actually
developed a prototype with Paul Hughes
polypropylene what he didn't do was he
used an existing front fork but he did
um create the whole frame and it was it
was he wrote it um he has a he has a
patent pending a provisional patent on
his design but the way he did it he
machined his parts and he used a
four-piece frame which was basically the
two outside components and then the two
inside structural components but the way
we're looking at doing at it her doing
it is is to make it just two pieces and
take the two outside pieces and make
them one so
until we until we know what the mold
will be and until we know that it's just
tough to say and my older brother is
actually studying to be a patent lawyer
at Virginia law right now so um he's
actually been a really big help to me so
far and he's more than willing to help
us out and with whatever he can so he's
helping me up us out with that a little
bit your logo and angle your company to
12 design comes from our are to no it's
not homage to our roots it's 212 is our
studio number at appalachian room 212
integral into 12 yeah
any other questions we're hoping you
guys put this on the homepage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
