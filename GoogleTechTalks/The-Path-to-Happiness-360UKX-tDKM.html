teacher of spirituality yoga and
meditation
he received his degrees in engineering
and as well as management in from walls
talk renowned Institute's like IIT Delhi
and I am Kolkata sought for after
landing a top corporate job he renounced
his professional career to advance on
the path of spiritual quest Swamiji is a
senior disciple of jagad guru Sri Balaji
Maharaj
so this is all about swami McCune Ananda
G now I would like to invite him to say
on the path to happiness which we are
going to implement in our day-to-day
life for which I think everybody can
persuade her I mean happy life on their
path so let's welcome so I'm bananas
divine souls I feel privileged to have
been invited by the IGN to speak to the
highly competent professionals of the
Google corporation at Googleplex and I
do appreciate that you have taken your
time out during your lunch to come and
attend this talk of course this Nick
means that you will need to do
multitasking eat and alongside hear what
I have to say I have no doubt in your
competence in your professional field
whether it is IT finance marketing or
whatever however are you equally
competent
in managing your own life whenever I
speak to managers I like to bring up the
adage manager manage thyself when it
comes to managing there was a very
powerful concept that was popular in the
times when I was doing MBA this was
called management by objectives it's not
much talked about nowadays but the
concept was that first of all you define
the objective of the entire corporation
and then break it up into sub objectives
those sub objectives are then to be
broken up further into different
objectives until each person in the
organization is very clear what his or
her objective is this concept would
enable the utilization of all the
personnel
the finances resources the information
of the company in the direction of the
goal determined fight if we were to
utilize this concept in our own lives
our lives would then become more
meaningful and directed in the direction
of our ultimate goal so what is the goal
that you have determined for yourself in
life you are working here in Google if I
ask you why are you doing it somebody
may say well Swamiji it's a very
lucrative job I get a lot of money think
more deeply you are not working here
only for the money there may be people
who get more lucrative offers elsewhere
however you do not wish to leave this
company which has amongst the highest
employee satisfaction ratings in the
world
well yes I prefer this job because it
gives an opportunity for creativity
somebody says there's lot of scope for
career growth somebody says I like the
work culture somebody says it's
well-paying if we were to consider each
of these answers what ok it gives you
scope for creativity but why do you wish
to have this scope it will give me
satisfaction happiness that means your
ultimate goal is happiness let us say
somebody who's totally materialistic who
says it's the highest paying job that I
could get why do you want to earn money
well with money I will get the things of
the world that I need so why do you need
these different things of the world it
will give me happiness in other words
all these different answers merge into
one answer ultimately we are all looking
for happiness that term happiness can be
referred to in different ways somebody
can call it peace somebody can call it
inner contentment and satisfaction but
that is the underlying goal of your life
just yesterday on Wikipedia I was
reading about Joshua Liebman he was an
American rabbi who wrote a best-selling
book
that was on the New York Times
bestseller list for many years this was
peace of mind so in this book he says
that when I was in my youth I made a
list of the different things that I
wanted in life I should have such a
carrier such a wife such children such a
house and then he says I went and
consulted a wise person in my
neighborhood to go through my list and
give his comments on it whether my
objectives had been defined properly so
this wise person went through Joshua
leave man's list and he said all the
items that you are cherishing are fine
but there is one thing missing in this
list what is that
peace of mind and without peace of mind
all the other things that you
have mentioned they are all useless so
basically all of us are looking for that
peace of mind you may call it happiness
you may call it bliss or satisfaction
and everything else that we hanker for
is because it will give us happiness can
I ask you one question
we have come to this conclusion that we
all want happiness can I ask you why do
you want happiness is there any reason
for it
Aristotle 2,500 years ago and said we
choose honor wealth and prestige because
they give us happiness but we choose
happiness for itself and never with a
view for anything further I will come to
the reason behind this desire for
happiness a little down the line in this
lecture however although we are all
striving for happiness this entity
called happiness still seems to be
eluding us you have been running for it
when you were a student you thought if
only I can become a high school pass I
will be happy you became a high school
pass you found that that's not enough
for happiness you thought if I become a
graduate I will be happy you became a
graduate happiness was still not there
you thought well if I couldn't get a job
I will be happy and you got that job as
well but still you did not become happy
you thought well you know if I can be
placed in Google
indefinitely it'll be my dream job and
you came to Google as well are you happy
well you know the level at which I am
there is no happiness I have to go to
the next level then I will be happy
so this running for happiness is going
on and on and on in this regard there is
a very beautiful story in the Quranic
Indian scriptures in the olden days
there was a king he was walking on the
terrace of his palace by the side of his
palace was the hut of a poor family
sounds of laughter and mirth were
emanating from there the king was
astonished that how can this poor family
be so happy and I the king of the land
and miserable
he called his minister and he said
minister what is the reason for the
happiness of this poor family
the minister said O king I will give you
the answer but it will cost you 99 gold
coins the King said that's a small price
he arranged for the ninety-nine gold
coins
the minister tied them into a bundle and
he threw the bundle in front of that
poor family's hut now in the morning
when that family woke up they found this
bundle in front of their door at first
they were apprehensive who has placed
this bundle then they picked up the
courage they opened it and found that
there was yellow metal in it they were
delighted so far we had only seen gold
through the glass panes of the jeweler's
shops today
on this gold God has been so merciful
let us count and find out how much gold
do we possess so they started counting
that their gold coins and they reach the
number of 99 they became discontented
they said what kind of a number is this
if God had to give us he should have
given us a hundred gold coins you know
like many of you would be familiar with
the game of cricket so the star batsman
Virendra Siva gets out on ninety nine
all of India goes into mourning for two
minutes why could he not hit one more
run and complete his century
so this family decided that all right we
have only ninety nine never mind we will
earn the hundredth one ourselves they
made a plan every month we will save
every day we will save this much now
when they started leading their life in
accordance with the plan the day they
could not save a fight would start at
home the wife would tell the husband you
have not earned enough today the husband
would scold the wife you spend too much
it is all your fault so within one month
the peace in the house vanished
the king was again walking on his
Terrace when he found sounds of fighting
coming from that hut he was again
astonished such a transformation in just
one month's time he called the minister
and asked him what has happened to this
family they were so happy
the minister said O king this is called
the trap of 99 this family has fallen
into this trap of
Denine they are thinking what we have
today is not enough to be happy because
all we have is 99 if only we could have
100 we would be happy but this story
doesn't it relate to the pattern in our
lives as well all our energy and running
is for that 100th gold coin forgetting
that we could be happy right now so we
are all running for happiness but
happiness seems to be running further
and further away the Vedas say this is
like the Marigny krishna or the mirage
in the desert the deer in the desert due
to the reflection of the sun rays gets
the illusion that there is a puddle of
water in front and to quench its thirst
the deer runs but the more it runs the
more the mirage recedes away from it in
the same way we seem to spend all our
lives running running running or
happiness and yet we do not find it so
what is the proper way of becoming happy
to come upon this answer the Vedas say
analyse your quest for happiness why is
this desire for happiness within you did
somebody teach you to be happy just like
you had to learn so much to become
qualified to be employed in Google you
went to school college university then
you acquired the qualifications required
for this job did you go to a university
thirsty to learn to make happiness as
your desire did you have to be taught
listen you must make happiness as your
goal in life it should not come about
that you start running after misery this
instruction was never given to you you
did not have to be trained to embrace
happiness everyone irrespective of the
country irrespective of the creed
irrespective of the social status
irrespective of their different
mentalities and temperaments they all
have one slogan give me happiness give
me happiness otherwise there is so much
of variety in this world no two human
beings look exactly alike no two human
beings have the same DNA forget about
the DNA they don't have the same thumb
impressions this little thumb has been
filled with such variety that seven
billion people on the planet Earth all
have different fingerprints they even
have different voices when I came to USA
somebody rang me up other Adi namaste
suavity I said namaste who's speaking
please guess is this a video conference
call
how will I guess no no guess from my
voice that person is confident that
Swamiji will guess from my voice because
my voice is distinct from everyone
else's voices we all have different
voices not only that our bodily aromas
are also different a dog recognizes
through the nose it's got
very strong nose you are going to
somebody's house who's got a bet dog the
dog looks at you and he doesn't
recognize you he starts barking and when
you come close the dog comes to sniff
you and remembers oh this smell is
familiar to me I know this person he's
in my file what I wish to say is that
this world is so full of variety no two
leaves of a tree are exactly alike
however in this matter we are all alike
in our desire for happiness and not only
that everything that we do throughout
the day is to fulfill that need for
happiness you have forsaken other
possible activities in your lunchtime to
come and sit here and hear me are you
experiencing happiness well you know
just for my satisfaction you could smile
or nod and say yes family but supposing
I became terribly boring what would
happen I have to get up what happened
you were sitting for happiness
you know this lecture has become so
boring I am getting happiness in getting
up the activity has reversed but the
pursuit is still the same earlier you
were sitting because it was giving you
happiness now you are standing because
it's giving you happiness in fact this
pursuit for happiness began the moment
we were born what was the first thing we
did when we were born we cried every
child cries and the child doesn't cry
the MA
cries OH seems to be stillborn why did
we cry because in the process of birth
we experienced pain and by crying we
revealed our nature
I don't want pain that is not why I have
entered this world I want happiness you
give me happiness and since then till
today everything that we have done at
every moment in our life is in pursuit
of that goal of happens and this is the
universal common factor not only to all
humans but all living beings and in
spite of that inherent desire for
happiness our pursuit for it over the
last 25 30 35 40 45 years is leading to
nowhere
so the Vedas tell us that the reason is
you are not understanding where this
happiness lies you are running for it in
the wrong direction like for example if
from California from Bay Area you wish
to go to Seattle and you are going
towards LA so you are getting further
and further away from Seattle in the
same way our pursuit for happiness is
not in the right direction so if we can
understand where why do we desire
happiness that knowledge will be very
helpful to us the mirrors tell us there
is one Supreme Being
you can call him by any name different
traditions around the world have
referred to him by different names
Bhagwan God
la Ahura Mazda one supreme entity from
whom this whole world has emanated that
supreme entity is an ocean of unlimited
divine bliss hence the name for God in
the Indian tradition is such it Anand
Anand means bliss that entity who is
eternal full of knowledge and full of
bliss Satyam Hanuman on thumb Brahma
this word Anand comes again and again
your source your Creator is an ocean of
unlimited divine bliss and you are his
tiny part you are his tiny fragment the
fact that we are his tiny fragments has
led to this desire for happiness what
logic is that it's just like the logic
of gravitation you have the earth and a
small part of the earth a little mud
wall now this little mud ball is pulled
towards the earth it was always getting
pulled but Newton thought about it was
the Apple falling down and why not
falling up and he discovered law of
gravitation so this the earth by this
force of gravitation is pulling its
little part to it towards itself
similarly our source that supreme
creator is an ocean of unlimited divine
bliss and our desire from this is
because we are tiny
parts of him now in the world also you
do experience happiness in your own
different ways everybody has their own
likings somebody gets happiness from
playing golf on Saturday somebody gets
happiness by doing extra work in the
office on weekends everybody has their
own concept of happiness however all
this happiness that you get is not
sufficient to satisfy your soul why is
that there are certain deficiencies in
the happiness you are getting from the
material realm firstly it is temporary
when you have that object you experience
the happiness and the object is
separated the happiness goes so your
experience of happiness is coming
temporarily
and going away like somebody says you
know last weekend I had such a great
time what happened oh there was this NBA
game going on and I went and watched it
with my relatives and we also had
something nice to drink and eat and it
was a gala time and what happened this
weekend this weekend my car had broken
down and I did not have time to withdraw
my salary I was just sitting at home
getting bored
so that happiness went away right so the
waiter say the happiness that your soul
is looking for is not of that kind which
will come and go it is such a happiness
that once you get it it will remain
forever the American philosopher Emerson
Ralph Waldo Emerson had also stated the
same truth he said every suite has its
hour
but in divine bliss is beyond it the
sweetness of it cannot be tainted by the
least tinge of material misery secondly
the happiness of the material dimension
is finite and hence it does not contend
you fully let us say that you get the
promotion that you cherished and you
reach a certain level now you look at
the higher level and you say that person
is ahead of me now this again makes you
discontented so the Vedas say again the
happiness that will really satisfy you
should be such that it is unlimited in
extent plus once you attain it you have
got it forever
that is the happiness of God who is your
source now at this point we will be
passing around a guestbook and if you
would like to get some information from
us about the website over 200 youtube
videos and our regular newsletter etc
then do fill in your details and we will
keep you informed of all our further
programs as well in this Bay Area and we
will send you information about our it
websites etc and we do keep the
information confidential so we'll be
passing around the guestbook and you
fill in your details and pass it further
ahead so we have reached this conclusion
that the happiness our soul is looking
for will be attained from God in other
words it is from the spiritual dimension
however
does this mean that we need to negate
everything that is of the material
dimension
can we not experience that happiness
while still continuing with our worldly
duties and responsibilities definitely
we can that in fact is what is called
Karma Yoga Karma Yoga is a very strong
tool given in the bhagavad-gita for
continuing with your profession and yet
experiencing divine bliss by changing
the consciousness within you this to
experience that divine bliss what is
required is not a change in the external
but an internal change of our mind and
our consciousness for example when you
work you do so in a certain
consciousness
somebody's prime objective is to get
money
somebody's prime objective is to rise
higher in other words we are doing it in
a fruitive consciousness and that is
preventing us from experiencing the
divine bliss the Vedas a change that
consciousness through your work as an
act of dedication to the Lord then you
change this consciousness your work does
not suffer in any way you are doing the
same things as you were doing before but
the change is internal when you are
doing it in divine consciousness you
rise above the dual
these of success and failure and you do
it for the glory of the supreme if you
see the history of the world the best
literature's particularly in the Eastern
cultures particularly in the Indian
culture the various literature's have
all been produced as an act of devotion
to God the most sublime architectures
they have also been created as an act of
glorification of the Supreme the most
wonderful songs that were sung were also
son as an act of dedication to the
supreme so if we can learn to do
everything in that divine consciousness
then that is called Karma Yoga which
means you do your karma and you unite
yourself internally to that supreme this
word yoga has come into the mainstream
in the Western Hemisphere as well as
yoga there are yoga schools and classes
and studios mushrooming in every city of
every country of the world and people
practice physical postures and say well
we are doing yoga some people say I am a
yoga teacher qualified for this word
yoga as it exists in the Indian heritage
is yoga not yoga and that Yoga means
union or to unite very simple it refers
to the union of the individual soul with
the supreme soul now this union is not a
physical thing it is the you
mewn of the mind the union of the
consciousness so to bring about that
union we endeavour to dedicate all our
activities to the supreme however this
requires working on our mind just like
people work on their body to sustain or
maintain physical health somebody who is
conscious of the old saying health as
wealth
along with their daily work in Google
they also take half an hour to go to the
gym or to practice the yoga sans or
whatever because they know this is
important to maintain the body however
we simultaneously need to take some time
out to nourish the mind and that is our
spiritual practice tending to the garden
of the mind
so the Vedas give us many tools to bring
that about for example we have the tool
called meditation now you all realize
that your effectivity at work is
dependent upon the consciousness your
level of consciousness of the mind if
your mind is full of positivity you are
able to more effectively relate to your
subordinates and your bosses etc so when
the mind is so important to improve our
own lives we need to work on this mind
as well and if we don't do that then the
weeds of negative emotions they start
growing in the mind and they destroy
this garden of the mind
so the wave hours tell us that on a
daily basis you take time out and in
that time you engage in meditation
engage in devotion in whichever way you
have learned or have it are habituated
to to unite yourself with that divine
consciousness and when you do that your
mind will start getting elevated and
when that happens throughout the day
although you are doing the same
activities as you were doing before you
will start enjoying and doing them in
the spirit of dedication to God
and when you start doing that you will
experience the Bliss of the soul that is
within you so very briefly we have
discussed this path to happiness I would
like to invite some questions from all
of you anything that you would like to
ask yes
well you see when we are we've got two
different languages then the problem is
of inaccurate translations so that is
the problem that when you say Arnon then
you say bliss and happiness
it's not a matter of language but
nevertheless just since you have asked
the Vedic concepts of happiness or the
different kinds of happiness so there
are twelve levels of happiness mentioned
in the material realm and also it's
divided into three categories
Thomas Socratic in Southwick
so Thomas SiC is happiness in the mode
of ignorance that is happiness you get
from drinks from addictive from laziness
from anger let's say somebody has
irritated you and you become angry and
vent your anger it gives you happiness
so that is thomas ik rajasic happiness
is happiness that is obtained when the
sense objects are given to the senses so
that is happiness in the mode of passion
and then there is sattvic happiness or
happiness in the mode of goodness this
is happiness when the mind becomes still
when divine qualities develop when one
starts engaging in the mood of service
to society etc so that is there
sequentially higher than each other
however even that is not sufficient to
satisfy the soul and then finally we
have the bliss and that bliss is the
bliss of God which is unlimited in
extent so that is the happiness that we
are striving for
absolutely the reason why we feel the
need for happiness indicates that we
have been created with this urge and
this urge for happiness is taking us
true perfection like you have toys they
are wound
the key is wound and then the toy starts
moving so similarly all of us are doing
various things and the key that has been
given to us is that desire for happiness
and the reason why that creator has
fitted us with this is so that we reach
that goal one day or the other I'm
reminded of what Saint Augustine had
said that our hearts were made for you O
Lord and they shall continue to remain
restless until they come to rest in you
now the way they say you I wot that su
come now pay sukemasa t your desire for
happiness is not wrong it's bonafide
it's genuine you don't need to feel
guilty about it just try and understand
where that happiness rice whom we call
the great Saints they were also running
for happiness but they were running for
it in the right direction
the Swami Vivekanand had said these
great prophets were not unique they were
men as you and I they had attained super
consciousness and you and I can do the
same the very fact that one person
attain that state means that all of us
can attain that state and that
ultimately is religion and the words
religion
our spirituality teaches us all how to
perfect ourselves to attain that goal of
happiness
well people are so busy running that
they don't have the time to stop and
think why they are running okay so if
you can take away this message they'll
let me think why am i running what is my
goal ultimately it is to be happy and
then you analyse have you got happiness
have you not why this desire for
happiness wherever will I get that
happiness forget about the answers just
take the questions with you I think that
will be a strong takeaway
okay just like we are looking for
happiness the others are also looking
for happiness now the problem is that
their decision of where happiness lies
may not tally with ours however if we
can understand that they are also
seeking happiness we will have a more
lenient and tolerant view towards them
and if we wish to help them we can only
enhance their understanding or help them
find higher revenues for happiness so in
that divine light we see everybody is
looking for happiness so we don't keep
any resentment towards well engineers
are habituated to think in logical
compartments I agree with that that's
why I try to make a logic representation
logical flow of this now there is
nothing wrong with having different
objectives I was just trying to take you
one step further and to make you think
that why do you have that objective
you cannot do away with the desire for
happiness that is my claim
it's up to you to agree or disagree my
claim is that nobody can do away with
the desire for happiness and I've tried
to explain to you why that desire arises
if you can understand that then you can
divert your desire for happiness in more
productive ways to make your life more
sublime but you cannot do away with the
desire for happiness is there an exact
time limit at 1:00 o'clock its till 1:30
oh I thought it was one o'clock okay
okay my own journey you see the Vedic
philosophy says that we are all
continuances many likewise so we have
these Sun scars or tendencies so I
remember even as a little child I used
to think and I used to meditate I would
get books from here and there when I was
doing engineering there were so many
questions in my mind that science and
technology was not answering for example
we were being taught laws but what is
the reason behind the laws in other
words if there is a law of gravitation
and Newton discovered it that the law of
gravitation that's fine but my question
was why is there a law of gravitation if
the world was created by a big bang as
one scientific theory propounded then
bang creates chaos and we should have
had a chaotic world there would be no
reason for laws to be in existence but
we find a perfectly structured universe
full of laws which made me believe that
there must be some creator behind it and
there was no information in that being
given to us as a part of that
engineering course then when I went on
to do MBA now we were taught so many
humanities subjects sociology and
psychology and organizational behavior
and economics and in each subject I was
finding that so many different theories
were presented for example a wish to
study society you have one social theory
you have the second you have the third
you have the fourth none of them can
claim to be perfect they're only good
approximations so this only increased my
curiosity that what is the truth after
all
Who am I and why do I want happiness and
where is this happiness what is my
purpose in life
so while studying
that management course these questions
became very strong in the mind that was
the time when I read the Vedas the Vedic
philosophy and then the conviction came
very strongly that yes there is an
absolute truth and then I started
practicing that spirituality as a
consequence of that prowess the mind got
more and more attached to God so I did
complete the course and I did take up a
job however that job was not satisfying
because in that divine light then life
had become more meaningful and I did not
feel it sufficiently meaningful to
dedicate all my energy to increasing the
profits of a company I said if I do have
to serve then why should I not serve God
himself but my own benefit and for the
benefit of the others so then I gave up
the job and took to this full-time
but it's been 27 years and I've never
had any regret about
sure this is also very connected to the
desire for happiness just like I
explained that the reason why we all
want happiness is because we are parts
of that one supreme being who is
unlimitedly happy
similarly we all innately love divine
virtues honesty truthfulness justice
kindness the attraction of the soul for
these virtues is innate it doesn't have
to be taught and if somebody says well
you know there are so many people who
are inveterate liars they may be but
even they a person who lies wants other
people to speak truthfully to him
if somebody tells him a lie he objects
this is called honesty amongst thieves
you have a gang of dacoits and the
leader of the gang wants others to speak
truthfully to him if anybody says a lies
is you have the guts to tell a lie to me
so we want truthful behavior from the
others let us say a person is a thief he
has stolen from somewhere and come and
he's very happy that he's got a big
booty today now he counts it and goes to
sleep at night another thief enters his
house and steals from there so the first
thief wakes up in the morning he says
what somebody stole from me does he not
know who I am if I meet him I will not
let him alive
so you should be happy you are a thief
your party has got doubled though I will
steal but nobody should steal from me in
all of us naturally one such behavior
from others we want truthfulness honesty
justice because these are divine virtues
so that desire for goodness is because
we want those divine virtues and the
guilt is just an indication that we are
not as yet where we want to be it is
God's Way of telling us that you still
have to reach further you have still not
reached your goal so it is a signal that
is coming from the divine indicating to
us that your present condition is not
enough you need to do something about it
just like if you put your hand in the
fire the hand burns and you experience
the pain through the nerves now the pain
is not a bad thing the burning is a bad
thing the pain is helpful it is letting
you know that your hand is burning and
you must extract it similarly we all
have this conscience and that conscience
is telling us that we our original
desire our original nature is to be pure
is to be truthful is to be honest to be
just to be kind and until we reach that
destination that conscience will not let
us rest
okay this before people leave let me
announce that we have a program every
day and the sunnyvale Hindu temple which
includes yoga meditation and the
spiritual discourse this is continuing
till Saturday so we have Flyers there at
the back if anybody's interested and we
also have a retreat coming up in the
Memorial Day weekend so if anybody is
interested in participating in a retreat
you can pick up the flyer for that as
well yes so you are asking about the the
comparison between the Eastern religions
and the Western religions right so
Western culture spirituality is there
everywhere however it is more of a
materialistic culture where the goal in
front of everybody is material
development and the Indian culture that
I am familiar with there God is the
center of everything whether it is arts
whether it's crafts whether it is
dancers whether it's music in other
words this was a culture where God was
the center for example Western culture
the epics that fashion the culture and
the Greek civilization were the Iliad
and the Odyssey
now these no mundane love themes and the
epics in the Indian culture were the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana now these
two are totally immersed in God
consciousness
to literature's so we have this culture
it is totally which is more spiritual
and we have this culture which is more
material so this yoke also is uniting
you with God so that has been pulled out
into the West and the external yoga
sense other postures are being done
somebody is doing it for physical beauty
somebody is doing it to keep old eight
away however the original idea of those
teachings was to you like God so there
is a difference in the cultures
definitely however I don't wish to
distinguish between religions all
religions are taking us to its God okay
thank you all very much thank you so
much so lastly on behalf of hygen I'd
like to thank Swami mucuna energy to
come to Google and have such an
enlightened talk and I think everybody
would have enjoyed and everybody would
have liked it so thanks everyone also

session thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
