dock and today we have a real astronaut
we had Mike Mullane here and we had den
brush here we had our own ed Lu here
they were astronauts they are you know I
currently retired astronaut this guy
here is actually an austere so and he's
a physicist he was a mission specialist
on for space shuttle flights he logged
in enough space flight time to go 35
times to the moon and back and do 17
times the duration of the EBA of the
Apollo 11 so he has some experience in
working in space and I think it's
important to hear from people who have
actually done something in space because
the way I see it we gotta go to Mars
sooner or later and for you Google at
politics people please leave your
questions for the very end if you are
here in the audience I know we had some
discussions on the world we should go
next so please welcome astronaut jim
newman and give me a warm walk
just do a quick Mic Check can you hear
me okay in the back okay oh very good
thank you let's say it is a pleasure for
me to be here today just to point out
the ringer that I know in the audience
that is a blue a blue raise your hand ed
Lu is your astronaut and I also know
that they're probably some of you in the
office in the audience who know some of
this stuff better than I do and if you
have a correction or something feel free
to correct me in real time I'll just say
okay thanks and but also since we're a
small enough group i didn't i didn't
curse it to make it a conversation a
dialogue so let's do that as we go Boris
suggested that I keep it technical that
you're a technical audience and that
you'd really like to hear some of the
technical side the way I'm going to do
that is I'm going to combine that with
some of the stories from space flight
there's not enough time today for me to
tell all the stories that I'd like to
share with you I know you all are busy
too so if you need to get up for any
reason and go that's fine i do encourage
people to vote with their feet I only
guarantee that I'll stop talking when
the last person leaves until then you're
fair game what I want to do is just to
frame the talk today and then also to
give you an opportunity to help direct
it so if you do ask questions if there
are things you want to know about even
the hard questions the political
questions feel free to ask those two we
get a little bit of media training and
we'll see if any of it is stuck over the
years so I'd like to think that we can
at least have an honest discourse on
whatever topic it is you'd like to talk
about but I want to cover or few
concepts and we'll start with knowing
your bra bureaucracy and what is worth
fighting for and since I've never been
here before I just threw that up there
because NASA is known as a bureaucracy
and then I got here and I was getting a
little too around and then some certain
things came up like about how hard it is
to get a new project plugged into the
network and and about the security so on
so forth I realized you have your own
bureaucracy here it's big enough that
you're undoubtedly in a similar
situation at some level there's a huge
emotional cost
in certain bureaucracies for innovation
I'll describe a little bit out on the
technical side and this also something i
call the weight of experience every time
we have an accident every time anybody
has an accident we all do something
about it to make sure that won't happen
again and on the shuttle give some
examples on the Russian Soyuz I'll give
some examples and then just sort of
integrating your minds and how does that
does that mean anything for you here now
because innovation is the only thing
that's going to keep us moving forward
situational awareness why we call it
that and that has to do again with the
technical side of things in particular
critical operations rendezvous prox ops
robotics these are all very technical if
your orbital mechanics kind of people we
can go in as much detail as you'd like
and also spacewalks I'll tell you this
will come up again why in critical
situations in space usually and we tell
this to the new space walkers in
particular the slower you go the quicker
you get there it's often true in
critical situations on earth too of
course now if you're a space Walker and
we call it space walking does anybody
think we actually walk around in space
though right what do we do in space
crawl if you're lucky you might get a
ride on the arm but most of the time
you're crawling space crawled doesn't
sound very sexy we call it space walking
if you are a space Walker be one with
the suit if you fight to suit the suit
will win okay so there's a very very
real lesson there as well given the
amount of time if we have time towards
the end I'd also like they'll touch on
Hubble Space Telescope in addition to
being on the first assembly mission for
the International Space Station on which
ed Lu lived for six months I also got to
do a Hubble Space Telescope repair
mission the most recent one in 2002 they
getting ready to do another one later
this year also fascinating Russian
approaches to technical things are they
cultural differences or is it just to
thinking out of our box can I tell you a
little bit about the Russian Soyuz
Russia the Brawn which looks astonishing
like a
space shuttle and then finally I have
some slides on exploration and the
current administration's plans for the
future some of the slides I threw a
bunch in there and some of them are just
there because it's a visual experience
so I'll just bomb through some of them
if you see something you really want to
go back to let me know but something I
just want to give you the visual flavor
for what's going on but first time I
start off with the test your technical
people perhaps some of you have gotten
this female has anyone here gotten this
email already i'm teaching orbital
mechanics at the Naval Postgraduate
School and I should stop I appreciate
the introduction I got I'm a civilian
all the way through just like a blue
there's a bunch of military guys in the
astronaut office to Thursday more
military third of the source of straight
civilian I came out of Dartmouth and
went down to rice university since I'm
from California originally five years in
the Bay Area my dad's marine biologist
down scripts I ended up leaving and
going to Houston with some trepidation
wondering if I could live in texas and i
discovered after that i could and so i
did my PhD in physics down to rice
university in houston texas then went
down in NASA I worked actually as an
instructor for a couple of years before
I finally got into the astronaut program
I had the interview four times over six
years and finally started in nineteen
ninety it showed up in 1992 as I recall
95 sorry he's a little younger than I
thought and and I got a story for when
Ted and I first met and worked together
on campus at the NASA but this was a
little bit of my background I'm teaching
local mechanics now down to Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey and as
people who are technical people I wanted
to share this with them I think it's a
fascinating photo and and this is what
comes in it comes in on an email from
some friends of mine who like to send
out emails a senior will probably never
get see probably because they mean that
most of us aren't going to get to the
North Pole we know that there's with you
know that global warming it's making it
you know less and less ice I wouldn't
wear as more and more mountains but now
this is the sunset at the North Pole
with the moon at its closest point
you'll also see the Sun below the moon
amazing photo okay and so anybody cared
a set for my ringers up here anybody
care to hazard a guess as to to this
photo and when it was taken and we're
okay in the back if you're at the North
Pole then he would be right okay well I
maintain if the mountains are that close
it's got to be like Greenland right so
you're not really right at the North
Pole because that's just a bunch of
water ice go ahead so you're just zoomed
in you know thinks they get bigger in
the picture when you zoom in on what he
said was that the disk of the Sun and
the disk of the moon are the same size
and and that's true the apparent size of
the Sun that parent sized the moon
saying we just had a lunar eclipse right
and this would be a solar eclipse we
just had a lunar eclipse which means the
moon's on the other side on februari
20th so there's a real problem you're go
ahead the Sun cannot be below the moon
when viewed from the North Pole does
anybody believe that is that true what
is the okay the plane of the ecliptic is
the orbit of the earth around the Sun so
the Sun is in the plane of the ecliptic
however the moon has some obliquity it
has some of liquidy so could it not be
above or below in fact it must be above
or below except when you have any clips
so I'd maintain that isn't what
distinguishes this okay but good you're
thinking and basically that's what we're
here to do is we're here to think a
little bit you see a picture like this
and by chance I showed this to moval
mechanics class yesterday last night i
got an email that said guess what in her
email showed up this picture should she
write back and disappoint the sender
well because but still there's a
question when was this picture taken
when this assumes that it's a current
era right because the moon and the
what's happening to the moon as it goes
around the earth it's getting further
way so every year the moon's a little
further away so how many years ago could
this picture have been taken okay whew a
couple of billion okay we're suspecting
that that's not the case but so this is
a fraud photograph that's my only point
you see something that looks really cool
engaged brain brain says what's wrong
that's awfully small supposed to be the
same size as that so on and so forth and
I'm sure the guy was sending it out he's
I hope he's laughing as he sends it a
scene you'll probably never get to see
right I agree
this is a class of astronauts that
showed up in 1990 and I'm one of the
tall guys the nice thing about the
shuttle program as it allowed Americans
up to 64 to be selected in the program
in the Apollo age was about 5 6 2 5 11
guys are exactly at lose height and as I
was growing up I was learning to slouch
because I wanted to be like yet Lou okay
fortunately they developed a shuttle
program and it goes from the fifth
percentile short American woman which is
50 to the 95th percentile tall American
male which is 64 so there were a few of
us at that kind of close to the upper
limit they've only ever measured me at
six to question what are the Soyuz
limits these days very good question we
put some money into the Soyuz to try to
expand its envelope and in it it goes
from I don't know the short side of it
ed might know 54 55 sort of things are
that but to probably ok on the order of
52 he says on the height size it depends
actually on a complex combination of
your sitting height your torso height
your leg length your foot size my feet
are nominally to large size 12 is the
largest you're supposed to have I got a
size 13 I got a man-sized foot what's
the problem with that you know but so
they have some issues I I am considered
too tall and if they did because I know
when I got in without a suit into the
Soyuz I was head to head the but without
the suitor the liner so I probably be
too tall for the Soyuz but it's close to
that size it's close to 61 62 tall us
probably 30 agility
61 baby if you mentioned Sergei krikalev
I'll also mention later interesting
fellow okay and then also just so in 23
of us just to point out Eileen Collins
the first woman commander of a space
shuttle she was a commander twice and
ended up flying the shuttle and landing
the shuttle it's interesting that the
pilots and I'm not saying that there's a
division between pilots and mission
specialists or any kind of Union but the
pilots they are the commanders and they
fly the ship okay and the most important
thing thing they do on the shuttle
flight is to land it on the ground at
the end of the mission when you're not
in space but that's a very important job
and we're glad they're there because
they don't trust autopilot I on the
other hand have a little bit of faith in
computers there's too valuable to go
outside on spacewalks most the time too
so guys I get and I have to go do the
spacewalks one of the things you want to
do when you're an astronaut is to be
able to do your job regardless of how
you feel now guys who fly jets all the
time they sit in the front seat mission
specialist will sit in the back got a
full set of controls and the guy in the
front seat if he ever says watch this do
you know what to do if a guy in front
seat says watch this tighten your
seatbelt okay you got a five-point
harness so couldn't tighten it down
because something's going to happen and
you want to be ready for it so he
doesn't smack these things can roll it
720 degrees a second that's twice every
second and if you do that then you can
smack your helmet or his if you catch
them unaware against the side of the
cockpit there pretty quickly next slide
let's go on you learn to do a whole lot
of stuff we have life rafts we have
parachutes we've got what you need in
order to survive let me that brings me
to my first point of the weight of
experience what happened in Challenger
we lost the crew we lost a teacher those
in 1986 and the first thing we did after
that that was during a scent when the
solid rocket boosters had a fatal
problem in it resulting lost the crew in
the vehicle they gave us life rafts
pressure suits which I'll show you
pressure suits life rafts parachutes
helmet so you can survive and if some
that would happen again the thought is
we'd be trying to jump out okay and
you'd see parachutes coming down instead
of just debris we added also a slide
Pole so we added a lot of weight a poll
that you could open the hatch hook up
your parachute to jump out open up so we
added all this weight we added all this
extra procedures and they fixed the
problem with the solid rocket boosters
and we've never needed any of that stuff
but we still have it we use it we fly it
every mission then after Columbia what
happened in Columbia that came apart on
re-entry because a piece of foam had hit
them on the asset had cracked open the
reinforced carbon-carbon and so the hot
gases were able to come in and so we
ended up losing that vehicle and then
after that they said well what are we
gonna do about that it's an unsurvivable
scenario so they want to inspect and
make sure all the tiles are good
everything's wet so they put an
inspection boom on the this big massive
thing they put in a lot of procedures to
take photographs spend a lot of time the
weight of experience and again the
product the idea is that with something
is expensive 5 billion dollars a copy
you go and you fix the problem and then
you don't have that problem but you
still have that weight so we're now
actually born down by the weight of
having made these mistakes in the past
and now we actually have less pehli
capability less time on orbit capability
and stuff like that so it's how do you
balance risk against performance against
loss it's a fundamental question for
organizations that deal with large
quantities of things when you're betting
your entire space agency every shuttle
flight we had thought we'd be shut down
if Columbia were to have happened and
that was the way we went to work every
day if something like this happens again
we're going to be shut down but because
we are an international program building
an international space station we
actually couldn't abandon it right away
so the Space Shuttle still flies and
will fly through 2010 in order to
fulfill our international commitments as
probably the only reason it's still
flying so it's again very very
interesting
on the one hand technical risk on the
other hand NASA is an instrument of
national and international policy and is
certainly used as such by every
administration spacewalks are a lot of
fun there are a lot of work
in training a big swimming pool it's 40
feet deep deep couple hundred feet long
Shamu from sea world would be right at
home and it's a little bigger than his
tank one of the things that we do is we
get to make our own patches and I'll
show you a couple of those this one was
my first flight it turns out that these
four guys are the military guys on the
flight and I was the token civilian I
was there to kind of keep an eye on them
and Carl Waltz is a mild-mannered air
force officer but you give him a
microphone and a little bit of music and
his collar goes up and he turns into
Elvis so I have actually seen Elvis in
space okay just wanted to make sure you
knew that as far as I'm concerned Elvis
lives he sang at my wedding at the time
I was a single guy and before my next
flight I got married and he sang at it
Elvis is alive and well we do hide
things in patches too by the way which
I'll share with you in a minute question
Ryan here the extensible purpose for the
question is why do we have Orion and
there is meaning to just about
everything in a patch this is the German
ultraviolet telescope that we partnered
with the Germans on advanced
communication technology satellite using
ka spot beaming instead of just
broadband k you and then Orion
ostensibly represents the constellations
and stars hot gases that this ultra
telescope is going to look at but it was
also because Frank Culbertson was a good
friend of the Challenger crew it's also
you'll notice there are seven stars and
there were seven crew member on
challenger so it was a tribute to the
Challenger crew as well just to share
with you launch day and again this is
just an anecdote nothing technical here
but on launch day you'd suit up in these
special suits now that we have I don't
know did anybody here happen to follow a
year ago there was a little incident
where one of our people had a little
problem in Florida so it's no surprise
everybody knows that we wear diapers ok
so under these big forcing you know the
big baggy suit you can't really tell my
feeling about the diaper is that if you
aren't familiar with it
ask your buddy next year i'm sure they
followed the news but you're sitting on
your launch pad for up too many hours
and for me it's like a parachute you
want to have one you just don't want to
use it okay why do we have them well you
go back to Alan Shepard they put that
man on a rocket our first American to go
into space they put him on his back they
left him in there and then they started
working the problems one after the other
and the other and he was in that place
on his back for like many many hours he
was fully instrumented with biometrics
is they're going to measure everything
about this first human American human
going into space what happened well he
had to let loose and that electrolyte as
it flowed she's on his back it shorted
out a bunch of those biometric sensors
they didn't get quite as much data as
they thought they were going to time to
go there's always some senior astronauts
to come with you some management folk on
the way off the launch pad is you drive
off the launch pad you notice that it
gets pretty deserted pretty soon you're
the only people on the road pretty soon
you're the only people within three
miles you think about that that's the
blast damaged area the thing just blows
up on the pad just about can take out
everything out to about three miles
that's as close as you're allowed to get
the on the way out there the senior
astronaut least I did on my flights i
don't know about Ed's but on my flat
that senior astronaut said with some
amount of respect and again it's a
multicultural organization but they said
we just like to have a moment and say
the astronauts prayer we're on our way
out to go into space on a 5 billion
dollar vehicle often with a billion
dollars worth of payload the whole world
is going to be watching the astronauts
pros were simple we bowed our heads the
first time I wasn't sure what he's going
to say but I was very respectful and he
said dear God don't let us screw up very
simple concept and so we appreciated
that and then the manager who was there
senior manager said that's all fine and
good but now I'd like to share with you
the managers prayer for the astronaut
and so we looked at him and we noticed
he wasn't bound his head he was looking
us right in the eye and he said god help
you if you screw up
is very clear which side of the law he
was on one of the first things I got to
do when I got there this is in 1993 I
was select in 1990 I'd already had five
and a half years in NASA so I knew some
of the system what we have here our
laptop computers and at that time they
were running dogs 1993 right these were
386 s I know there's a lot of young
people in the audience I think that's
great but I see there's a few people
might remember 386 as well okay it was a
great thing at the time the interesting
thing about a space shuttle is it runs
on a computer that is directly derived
from nuclear submarines anything nuclear
subs nuclear sub space what I have in
common radiation environment what does
radiation due to electronics it can
cause upsets now that I was personally
acquainted with this because I'd heard
stories in the office before I flew and
I've been told that sometimes if you
close your eyes right before you go to
bed you'll actually see a little sparkle
light when it's completely dark and they
said hey that's your optic nerve getting
hit by cosmic rays and I said okay great
i'll look for that i didn't see it on my
first flight but i finally got to a high
inclination flight in high inclination
flight and high altitude to get more
radiation and one night before I went to
bed before I was fully asleep a dark
adapted all of a sudden I see a bright
flash of light in my eyes they'd been
closed and so not only does radiation
upset the the hardware it goes after the
software too okay and so you can
actually when it stimulates that optic
nerve so that really made a believer out
of me before that it's the effect that
scene of radiation was in these laptop
computers we actually at night we'd
right ones and zeros to the memory and
then we have a little program that we
just went back and read them all night
long and I did it on the ground just to
assure myself of what it meant and there
were no upsets for three weeks of
running then
the bits that were changed I got in
space every nine hours approximately on
average it would find a bit flip so
radiation is real it's a real part of
your life there and of course it's going
to play a big deal into going on to Mars
some day you wouldn't want to trust your
life to a 386 computer but there's a
whole lot of things that can do that
will help you and that's called
situational awareness we actually on
this flight where the first time we
actually managed to connect our
computers to the space shuttle computers
as a listen-only data port the shuttle
computers at that time had 128 k of ram
the program is written in how
appropriately named and is the best
software ever written if anybody does
software you've heard of what is a CMM
level 5 it is the type of stuff they use
in nuclear reactors and and the space
shuttle the code is huge and they
actually know their process so well that
when they do a new software release they
can tell you how many bugs to expect
within quite tight error band and if
they don't find as many as they expect
they know they've missed some and they
go looking their processes are that well
known there's no way we were going to
get in such a it's very tight and it's
actually five computers running for
computers running the exact same
software and one computer that's
actually running backup flight software
written by a different vendor just on
the off chance that these four could
have a software glitch that would result
in a potentially fatal problem so the
command has a little button you can push
which will actually result in this
backup computer taken over the whole
space shuttle so there's when you're
working with that kind of money that's a
worthy sort of thing to do so you end up
with this very tight computer very
difficult to upgrade very difficult to
change the software but we finally let
him give us was a data feed because all
of the data the telemetry from the
shovel goes down the ground they had
mainframe computers that would d
commutated and plug it in to the flight
controllers workstations well there was
a guy who had written some software in
assembler that could do the same thing
in a three
86 computer that they were using doing
on the ground so I found that guy found
a data port got some guys to give us
some money and we ended up with our own
little mission control center on orbit
which scared the hell out of the flight
controllers so if you've ever worked
with bureaucracy now flight controllers
are in charge of the space shuttle and
the data the flight director is actually
the boss of the mission the commander
thinks he is and he is when he's
upstairs he's the the on-site
representative and he's responsible for
our safety but we all have a boss and
and that person is the flight director
they were actually scared to give us
that data because they they want to know
what we were going to do with it they
figured nothing good just anything we
needed to know they could tell us the
first thing we got on here actually one
of the first things we got was a feed to
the world map of the state vector the
state vector is your position your
velocity in your time why is that
important well if you ever look out the
window of a space shuttle and there are
some people who can actually see a bit
of dirt on the ground and they know
right where they are over the earth I
cannot okay but if I have a map with a
ground track on it and it shows them
over South America I can tell you where
i am and when you're talking to the
press to the public affairs people it's
always handy because they always ask you
where are you right now and so one of my
commanders once said over over Africa I
looked at the world map and said
Australia okay so it's a handy thing and
saved us from typing in all that data
just to tell the computer where we were
but it's a fascinating things because
bureaucracies they move they have
procedures and they work and they don't
want to change them and if you're
working in that environment innovation
is hard and there's a huge emotional
cost to pay I took so many arrows and
Spears trying to get this capability
because it was clear they knew what we
were going to use it for we were going
to actually try to get enough
situational awareness that it might be
possible someday to not need the ground
and maybe maybe go back to the moon Iran
and they were having none of that not
with the space shuttle okay so is very
very interesting from the point of view
of growing our organization to be ready
we ended up actually using it for some
very useful things if you've ever done
any orbital mechanics you know that if
you're going to rendezvous with the
International Space Station the first
thing you do if space station is going
around when the plane of the space
station basically goes by goes over your
longitude when it goes overhead you got
to launch your shuttle into it because
if you're in different orbits you can't
ever get there there's too much Delta V
velocity change required so on a
rendezvous you want to get in and you
get behind the space station at some
distance and then you want to be in the
same orbit ah but now you're you're
behind it how do you catch up well you
probably know that if you slow down in
space you speed up on average so you
slow down to catch up and you speed up
put you in a higher orbit longer period
slow down on average then you slow down
to fall behind so we have to do these
things and it's not intuitive like the
first guys who did a rendezvous in space
found themselves in big trouble they
almost didn't make it back to the
rendezvous point so they got off in a
certain quadrant was really hard to get
out of that quadrant has a name now
Cooper squadron or something I forget
but so these are situational awareness
tools that we can put on computers that
allow us to understand our environment
better I just like to share with you on
my first flight I had the opportunity to
go on a spacewalk and so I was standing
out there I am on a spacewalk there I am
on a foot restraint so I'm not crawling
now I've crawled over there I've gotten
my feet in and I'm standing there and
what I'm doing is I'm testing some tools
for the Hubble Space Telescope repair
mission back in December 1993 they put
the specs on the Hubble and finally got
good vision and we were testing those
tools and techniques this picture went
down to the ground my older brother saw
it and talked to the local newspaper and
he told them I was space surfing I did
grow up in California in San Diego and
so I saw this newspaper article and it
said when I got home I saw it and said
newman his space surfing like you know I
talked to my brother because I knew me
that wouldn't
up and I said yo bro I never said that
and he said you haven't made a good
story so a few months later Surfer
magazine called me up and I don't know
what your class rank was in high school
okay but I was I was not they give
letters for academics these days they
didn't when I was going to high school
so I was not a letterman but in any
event I talked to my PA o public affairs
people and they said well we don't
normally do interviews with surfer
magazine and so I said with a straight
voice I have a straight face and a calm
voice because I really wanted to do this
interview I said but it's a serious
interview and they said oh okay go ahead
and so I got to be interviewed for
Surfer magazine and in march of 1995 on
page 93 case anyone has an old copy I
made Surfer magazine I'm sharing the
page okay it's a little nerdy title but
hopefully that doesn't go over poorly
here brains who surf was not my choice
but I'll go with it I was 36 I'm sharing
the page with two men of real
distinction two Nobel laureates Donald
cram and kary mullis a friend of mine
from high school wrote me a letter he
said Jim I I heard you to become an
astronaut I'd graduate from high school
eighteen years earlier he said I heard
you to become an astronaut and I thought
that was ok then I saw you made Surfer
magazine and I had to write
congratulations
I think we all know that our high school
peers are probably our harshest critics
so I was actually elated I tell people
when i go to talk to high schools and
other places not to peek too young but i
do point this out when you do peek at
least acknowledge it i peaked on that
flight my first space flight back in
1993 and it's been downhill ever since
because i haven't made it back to Surfer
magazine what is that anybody care to
guess re-entry yeah and it's actually
not even all that long and exposure
because the shuttle goes bomb and by
this is a shuttle reentry when
everything works right shuttle comes in
glows really hot like a shooting star
bombs across the sky early morning
Houston this one and ends up landing if
the Kennedy Space Center or out at
Edwards those of us working there knew
that reentry was dangerous especially if
you'd look out the window because what
you see out the window is a hot
plasmaglow surrounding the space shuttle
and then coming together in the tail
behind you the world found that out when
Columbia occurred now what's hidden in
this patch for example first of all I
will give a patch and everyone so I have
to actually do this when I'm talking to
third graders everyone so they'll
actually know what constellations these
are okay this flight was STS 69 69 so we
hid that in the patch and you have to be
a little careful of that number but what
it really is is I don't know what you're
thinking but this is a hurricane or a
constellation it turned out a hurricane
actually caused our Space Shuttle have
to roll back from the pad into the
protection of the Vehicle Assembly
Building two months before our flight so
we ended up delaying by a couple of
months and then these are a couple of
constellations that do have meaning
anybody care to hazard a guess Pleiades
no
okay again I've told Ted the audience so
now math and public I'm going to throw a
math and public question at you in a
minute so be ready for that one as well
if you know this one hazard a guess feel
free to come up later we started off on
the first assembly mission with five
crew members and then they finally
figured out oh we're partners with the
Russians aren't we so Creek love got to
go unfortunately Creek level was added
like three or four months prior to
flight and so I didn't lose one of my
space walks because he was hot after one
of my space walks and unfortunately was
added so late he didn't get it otherwise
I think he would have creakle off is the
fellow who was up on the MIR space
station on his first spaceflight his
first spaceflight was to mirror for five
months happened to be in what was about
1990 1991 and that little problem over
there on the Soviet Union kind of
disintegrated became Russia the story
goes a couple of different ways but one
way it goes is they called them from the
ground and said Joe the Sergei some
trouble down here would you mind staying
an extra five months so his first
spaceflight went from five to ten his
next space flight was another five
months and then he had a shovel flight
so he had 15 months of space flight
experience when he went with us to help
start the construction of the
International Space Station means to say
he'd been in orbit for a while the
there's the NASA logo that's zaria in
Russian Cyrillic there's proton there's
an American flag on a Russian rocket a
very neat site to see that put the first
thing up there we went up there in the
space shuttle a couple of weeks later
and rendezvous with it here's all the
flags of the organizations involved and
their Sergei Sarah gave since that time
has been to the international space
station twice six months each he's got
over 800 days in space he's the human
with the most space flight and people
say you know how does that you know
we're on a person okay and my
understanding is that he's fine when I
meet him he looks fine from the women
who've met and they tell me he looks
fine so I guess it's not hurting him any
here's that the math and public question
this is a sunrise or sunset if you're
going around low Earth orbit it's about
90 minute orbit give or take a few
minutes that means every 45 minutes you
got daylight and 45 minutes you're
behind the earth so you got dark 45
minutes day 45 minutes dark so every 45
minutes there's a sunrise or a sunset
they're beautiful okay they go by really
fast but it's okay if you miss one
because there's another one coming right
up how many sunrises and sunsets are
there in a 24-hour day how many sunrises
and sunsets are there in the 24-hour day
if anybody cares to to do math and
public feel free to 32 anybody else I
heard another 30 something out there
okay in the back how are you today 24
hours solar day 24 solar hours not side
aerial 32 it is yeah good job you get 16
orbits in 24 hours because there now and
a half so 16 times an hour and a half is
24 hours so you got to sunrise sunset
each every time so a good job what's
that yeah yeah yeah if you have just the
right orbit if the Sun if your orbit is
actually basically face onto the Sun you
might never have sunset but if you're
basically in a cause I normal orbit then
you'll get some period of dark that's
how we left it smiling work to do just a
quick one here now this is again this is
a little bit of a physics lesson if
you'll permit me to add this in here and
that is this is the control block it was
a little more crowded when you were
there I think right I kind of used it
for storage as my understanding but when
we got there was this long corridor now
the concept is this position and
momentum angular momentum and momentum
and energy they're all conserved right
we know that those are conserved
quantities his position concern
no if you take a cat an example of that
is if you take a cat and hold it and I'm
not saying I've ever done this but if
you hold one upside down and you drop it
okay it's going to it has no it's not
rotating it's still he says no angular
momentum you drop that cat it will
somehow flip over and land on its feet
but it had no angular momentum at any
time in there so that means it had to
kind of shift its body around in such a
way that it could change his position
without any angular momentum into a
cannon out turns out that there's
actually a minimum height you could drop
a cat from okay and it wouldn't have
time to actually land on his feet but
that's a different experiment so it
turns out that if a cat can do that then
a person can and what Sergey did is he
did two things this is a long corridor
there's Sergei and Sergei said to me he
said watch this ok so I got out of the
way he positioned himself on the aft end
cone there and he pushed off and he did
the Superman thing all the way down that
quarter and didn't touch the sides all
the way down and he said now a medic on
ski you try ok now he'd had a lot of
time in space and I'm thinking they
didn't actually do a lot of science on
the MIR space station ok because he was
really good at that and he knew his
geography really well too which tells me
he's been most of his time he knew
American geography better than I did he
spent a lot of time looking out the
window ok there was only two of them on
board the mirror for some of those long
duration two or three and and they just
you know had a lot of time so I took us
a little bit of practice but weird soon
doing the Superman thing too and as soon
as we had that under control he said ok
now try this and he turns out Sergei is
the Soviet Union aerobatic champion ok
for small airplanes so he does the
Superman thing down there and then he
does this really funny role with his
stomach and his arms and the next thing
you know he did a perfect 90-degree turn
and he's going sideways not touching the
wall he does this role thing again and
he's upside down
he does it all the way around 360 okay
and that was a little bit harder I won't
tell you our success rate on that but
then i realized that i could try and
experiment and I said Sergei come help
me please this is Nancy curry she is 50
so she just made it in she's an army
helicopter pilot as well army helicopter
pilot 50 what kind of sense of humor do
you think she had but she is willing to
do experiments in space Sosa Nancy we
want to try to do a scientific
experiment so I took her with Sergey and
we very carefully put her in the middle
of this it's called the node the
cornerstone of the space station we put
her right in the middle and we let go
over very carefully so she wasn't moving
at all so it'd be like taking someone
here and putting you right in the milk
and then we let going backed away what
do you think happened to her she had
nothing with her she was stuck she
couldn't touch the walls you can't swim
cuz there's you need bigger paddles you
can't really swim effectively and
blowing that's not that's not going to
work either so she was stuck there for a
couple of minutes we have this on video
okay she did the cat thing as well that
didn't help because it just turned her
around it didn't get her any closer but
we hadn't done a perfect job there was a
little bit of residual velocity so she
slowly kind of drifted over to the side
and finally grabbed a hold of the
handrail and I said to her we'd like to
try again cuz we thought we could do
better and she wouldn't let us
it was in the name of science it grew
and grew and grew and that's about what
it's like now let's see when Ed was
there that was it right a little bigger
a little smaller than that little bigger
than that somewhere in the middle now
it's huge been doing a lot of work on it
it's going to have one more it's going
to look like that one more solar ray we
got the European module up half that
European module is American by the way
because we launched it they built that
we launched it so half of its ours same
thing with the Japanese module you can
go outside and see the space station
sometime now just equipment onto the
Hubble flight in the interest of time
I'm going to press on it's very
difficult to get crews it used to be
when there weren't very many show fights
they get him to agree to put your your
mission number on the patch for a while
there are rules against it people didn't
like to do it I really wanted to have
our mission number which was sts 109 on
the patch and some of the crew didn't
want to do it I finally convinced him
because he's a technical guy and the way
I convince them was I said well what are
we doing we're going to go fix Hubble
what does hub will do it looks at the
Stars looks at galaxies and who is
famous for making that a popular thing
to do who really popularized a lot of
astronomy who's that Carl Sagan what did
say can say you see that's not a
straight line is it
that nine is up a little bit okay and by
hiding 10 to the ninth with all only a
scientist or an engineer can really
appreciate he said okay we'll do it okay
so there's the the representative
billions and billions and there's the
billions right there so we got it in
there there is also some other things
hidden on this patch in particular in
Florida and Canada but you'd have to
have a high-res version to see it and if
you were to do so I would be glad to
take few minutes and explain to you what
else is hidden there we enjoyed putting
Nancy right next to scooter she didn't
seem to think it was funny but we we
liked it the spacewalkers on the outside
these are the military guys the military
folk who were responsible for the fly in
the shuttle by getting us there getting
us home just a quick mention of scooter
has anybody here seen just a curiosity
that movie Top Gun okay how many of you
were shocked as I was to learn that Tom
Cruise wasn't actually flying those jets
okay I mean my understanding she was
getting paid a lot of money but he
wasn't actually flying those Jess turns
out there were four young Navy
lieutenants who were flying those jets
and scooter Scott Altman was one of them
and he had done that back in the movie
was filmed if you ever watch the movie
he told us where he was in the movie
because when that when the young and a
woman instructor was instructing that
bunch of rowdy pilots he's one of the
pots that walks in and gets to sit down
in the back and so he we watched the
movie together I actually brought it to
space with us so he could watch it on
our off time and and he pointed out when
he was on the movie he enjoyed it by
chance it turns out that Tom Cruise has
anybody seen the 3d imax space station
film ok 3d imax space station you ever
have a chance to see that it is worth
watching it's fantastic Tom Cruise
narrated that and this was before he did
the jump in on the couch thing and
you know clearly a little bit out there
but he's a very hard worker it's very
professional he came to NASA in order to
learn about NASA's do a good job of
narrating that film and he came and
visited us before our Hubble flight
while we were training in the simulator
so depending on the time I've actually
got a little film clip I can show you a
later about that but Hubble I'll just
here's a photo montage this is Columbia
in 2002 this is the last flight before
its final flight in 2003 that's
colombianas way to the pad just to note
because i'm going to press i'm going to
go looks like perhaps a little late if
people have the time and interest i'm
going to talk some about the Russian
program as well and contrast some of
what we do with some of what they do
what are cultural differences what is
just different ways of thinking about
things if you look at how we do things
we clearly integrate in the vertical and
then we roll it out on this very special
roller which had actually the Apollo
moon rockets on it many years previously
you want the launch pad to not get
immersed if the tide gets really high
during a hurricane or something so they
build the launch pads up plus you got to
get rid of all that exhaust so they
build these flame pits as well so this
thing here this this is I think without
fuel in it it's only about three million
pounds they had about a million pounds
of liquid fuel to it once you're out
there so this only about three million
the whole things about 11 million but
you can't really afford to have this
thing going back and forth because these
these are the nuts that hold the bolts
that hold the shuttle to the mobile
launch platform and so from an
engineering point of view just look at
the size of the nut and obviously this
is half of it because you have to
unscrew this thing really fast okay when
you want to launch so very difficult to
do that any way except using
pyrotechnics so I'll talk a little bit
about
how we do that as well and the question
for the engineers here why is there so
much metal there clearly the
pyrotechnics takes up a whole bunch of
that that Phil there so you clearly
don't need that much metal it's really
heavy and things are supposed to be as
light as possible when you go into space
so I asked the engineers one day why
they're so heavy think about that for a
few minutes and we'll get back to that
at launch time and if I forget to just
please remind me so this thing is going
up you can't afford to have it tilting
so they actually keep that platform
perfectly level as it goes up that ramp
so they have some hydraulic actuators in
there to just you know beat the band
this thing actually has a top speed of a
mile an hour I've driven it full speed
it uses a laser docking system to get to
within a quarter of an inch on the
launch pad of where it's supposed to be
each each flight okay there it is it's
time to go and up we went the any anyone
care to hazard a guess why these things
are so thick but feel free is oriented
so that strong part is taking the
forward backwards loads the weak part
aside
okay that's actually a great idea I
don't believe so okay over there well
turns out this much this little skinny
bit of metal here is enough to hold it
down because it holds it down because
you have to fire the engines first you
actually fire your main engines on this
baby first just to make sure they're
working that day so you got your three
main engines you got your solid rocket
boosters on the side the three main
genuine is giving about a million pounds
of thrust the whole staff weighs four
million so you're not going to go
anywhere with you light domains who are
the solid rocket boosters those things
on each side there those things put out
two and three-quarter million pounds of
thrust each so when those things like
you're gonna go somewhere you just hope
it's up okay and you want these things
to release really fast okay they say if
one of these doesn't release the shuttle
is going to just strip it they say if
two of no release is still going to well
it might leave a little pieces on behind
on launch pad but it's still going up
somewhere but some will get left behind
so why does this thing so thick life I
couldn't figure it out i'm not a mech e
guy and into go ahead so what we come
for they actually encapsulate it so it
won't be thrown at all they put it they
put a encapsulation of around it so it
won't be fought you don't want it flying
around this is stainless steel okay this
is stainless metal is really strong
however you notice there's two parts
where it's blown they have two Pyro's in
it well redundancy says you got to have
to redundancy says it needs to crack
even if only one blows so the whole
reason for this is to transmit the shock
if one of them blows it transmits the
shock around to the other one and cracks
it if it was thinner this thing might
just clam shell open and then hang up on
the threads so that's though that's all
so they're thinking those guys are
thinking about this when they build this
stuff you're welcome to come up
afterwards you and take a look at that
if we went while we were in space it
turns out on my first spaceflight I told
you I had flown with Elvis and I'd also
flown with a guy named
dan burisch they flew together again on
their fourth space flight and they went
on to the International Space Station
they were what at expedition for and
they were up there for six months
actually their return was delayed their
commander urea know Franco there's on a
Franco there there's Elvis there's radar
he liked to take pictures and he liked
big cameras so was i think that's 800
millimeter with doubler or something
total ed probably knows 400 double or
total of eight hundred millimeter and it
turns out if you're up there you can get
pretty good at matching the rotation of
the earth and some of the guys get like
meter resolution kind of shots of the of
the ground and Yuri was taking a picture
one day and he caught this shuttle
launch of some guys on their way to
Hubble and there you can see the
contrail once we're above the clouds and
the shadow so they were going by it
about 240 the shuttle program still uses
English units everybody's familiar with
a nautical mile right you know how many
Newtons the slug is right okay so we're
up at the station up about 240 nautical
miles about 400 kilometers the Hubble
Space Telescope is up about 320 nautical
miles about 600 kilometers so the Hubble
is up about fifty percent higher so 1.5
and you know that the area of things
gozes r squared so if you're up in a
Hubble altitude you actually see twice
as much area of the earth as if you're
down low like at a station altitude I'm
not saying it's bad at a station
altitude but the view is actually much
better at a Hubble altitude and I'm not
saying that it's a competition with my
buddy dan burisch okay but we could see
all of north america in one shot on the
on the station flight sergei krikalev
that guy had spent a whole bunch of time
up there he pointed out Antarctica to us
which you can just see from a station
flight but we could not see it from
Hubble so there's this and that and the
other thing
so in Hubble I was responsible for
putting in the advanced camera for
surveys if anybody has a digital camera
we put one into the Hubble 16 megapixel
digital camera in 2002 cost 70 million
dollars and weighed 800 pounds and our
digital camera and we you know in zero
gravity pick it up slowly eight hundred
pounds eight hundred pounds and you'll
squish your pinky okay if you run that
thing into something but then just move
it over carefully the whole idea was to
be able to do our jobs without breaking
anything question in the back put it
always thermal insulation when you're
looking at the Sun it's kind of like a
hot fire on a winter's night when you're
looking at the Sun you get really hot
when you're looking at Deep Space you
get really cold so the suit is actually
spectra like plus or minus 100 degrees c
plus minus a couple under degrees
Fahrenheit so you have to be able to
operate in those environments when
you're looking at the earth it's kind of
neutral warm but you don't always spend
your time doing that so they have to
have the right kind of insulation on
these things in order to keep the
temperatures right and all these things
up here this it's also multi-layer
insulation it does two things one of the
things it does is it protects against
micrometeorites another thing it does is
to give you thermal conditioning
micrometeorites has anybody heard of
phorbol debris okay well you know a
couple of large countries have recently
made some orbital debris we argue that
the orbital degree we made won't last
very long the orbital debris that was
made by another country about a year ago
is going to last for a long long time it
comes home to you when you if you look
at the communication satellite of this
communication dish it has a lot of
digital data they're called pictures
that it needs to send to the ground so
it has two of these k you banned dishes
you know their dish about I don't som
like this big on that order made out of
fiberglass kind of material with the
right kind of coatings on it and one of
them has a neat little hole punched in
it about the size of a silver dollar
okay right through the dish and it's
like wow when did that happen if it had
been over
2 meters it could have gone right
through the telescope and we'd had no
more Hubble so there is debris in space
and it does hit stuff we were really
glad ok because we didn't screw up that
day so this is after our space walk my
space walking buddy Mike Massimino we're
wearing our our thermal underwear it's
got the tubes of water sewn in it and it
keeps us warm keeps this cools us off so
we can work outside just a quick story
you never know how your teachers are
going to affect you in your life okay
and this was actually a touching moment
because this is at the end of all five
spacewalks and we had fixed the Hubble
it was it's still good it's still going
six years later now and it's got to last
another just about a whole nother year
before they get to it and then refurbish
it to last hopefully another 5 or 10 and
so we've done five spacewalks
back-to-back which is a lot of work and
these guys John and Rick were saying the
thank yous to the whole team because the
people on the we have famous jobs but
nobody knows the people anymore unless
they do something nutso and it and so
they were saying thank you to the rest
of the team the people who had on the
ground had supported us all and the
bottom line was John did a great job but
then Rick had a short and kind of
telling thank you he said he wanted to
dedicate the flight to one of his high
school teachers food once told them that
all he'd ever be good for is taking up
space
something about having the last word and
something about doing it on national
nationally broadcast radio television
sleeping in space okay everybody does
that in space there's the Hubble after
we left it landed I'd like to get to
Russia although I'll just touch briefly
on the pictures you're probably aware
that anywhere you look even if it's
really dark like near the Big Dipper
where there aren't any stars I mean yeah
near the big different near the North
Star Polaris there are no stars in that
direction you're basically looking out
of the plane of the galaxy and so on and
so forth and so the director of the
Hubble Space Telescope put the Hubble
Space Telescope and pointed it at a
direction which nobody had ever looked
because there's nothing there to see and
what he did is he did that a number of
years ago and he was widely criticized
until the results came back which were
galaxies nothing big galaxies anywhere
you look in the sky its galaxies so as
you probably know 100 billion stars in
our galaxy a trillion galaxies in our
universe so there's a bunch of stuff out
there and that new camera was doing it
in in record time okay just a quick
photo montage there's a lot of science
in these that people study in order to
understand things like how Lakes shrink
the aral sea it's a way worse than that
now it's a whole lot less water there oh
that this is an interesting border
senator you recognize that border there
Egypt in Israel yeah this is the dry
side the Egypt that's the green side
Israel interesting didn't recognize
those your first light you always got to
look for those okay pyramids egypt and
mount everest that was that first one i
didn't really spend a bit a moment on
they teach you how to look for Mount
Everest from one of these two here I
forget which one yeah okay so you can
learn a lot about it now if anybody
doesn't believe in impact craters the
reason we're here today really is
because of 98% species
sanctions that occur every 65 million
years or so okay on that kind of time
span and and there's one of those impact
craters that is clearly visible from
space quick overview of the Russian
space program difference in how they do
things they integrate in the horizontal
by and large they have a few rocket said
that payloads that they'll do in the
vertical but they're human spaceflight
program integrates in the horizontal
they used the same launch pad that
Gagarin launched on both you'd be
hard-pressed to find John Glenn's launch
pad the Cape they roll there's out on a
train there's the train there's the
rocket that's how I had Lou into space
after the Soviet Union collapsed they
were broke some of the people didn't get
paid for months I guess if you've always
been paid very little you know how to
live with very little but can you
imagine if your company went broke you
just kept going to work and launching
things into space anyhow and maybe some
day they'd pay you they did that in
Russia and this is in Kazakhstan and
Baikonur you can see they're a little
bit is we call it deferred maintenance
okay as long as the price oil is above
eighteen dollars a barrel they're making
a profit so they're making a big profit
right now and we're starting to see new
paint on the buildings in Baikonur
they're coming back so that's how they
get to the launch pad pretty
cost-effective I think pull it behind a
train I saw this this is one of their
acronyms that's a que a Russian b and o
+ + m and so I said to one of the
Russians I said you know in English we'd
say kaboom okay the Russians are very
superstitious people and he immediately
assured no no no no no that stands for
the
general machine building company okay of
Kazakhstan or something like that but I
said but look here it even looks like a
boom okay and he insisted no no no no no
okay that's not it they're very
superstitious people what they do they
continue to do if it worked for example
on his way to the launch pad Gagarin
anticipating the possibility of an
extended wait had the bus pull over to
the side and ed Lu confirm the veracity
of this or not and he stepped out behind
the bus and did what you might want to
do before you're going to sit down for a
long time with no access to facilities
every flight stops at the same place
every bus going out to the launch pad
stops at the same place and everybody
does the same thing even our women even
their women they flown I think two women
on their two or three women on their
Soyuz yeah right two women and I think
we've now flown just one but we'll fly
some more on there so so so basically
they don't fly a lot of women we've
flown almost as many of their women as
they have we've flown one on the our
shuttle and they've flown two or three
total in their whole program so it's an
interesting but they do that every
single flight it worked they're doing it
again OSHA doesn't work in Kazakhstan
what works in Kazakhstan is common sense
the first thing actually is it true in
Russia to one of the first things they
tell you is that your common sense plays
an important part in your personal
safety you do not have the right of way
on the street the cars do the bigger
cars have more right of way in the
little cars ok and all the drivers know
that if a car decides to drive on the
sidewalk don't just look at it get out
of the way ok and and it actually they
do drive on sidewalk when they're in a
hurry they parked on the sidewalk that's
the part I liked I'm okay with parking
on the sidewalk that was a great thing
there they are the same people doing the
same jobs for many many years they get
to know them they're held accountable
held responsible if this guy gets hurt
he's
out of a job might not have insurance
it's kind of socialized medicine and you
don't want to go into their medical
system they raise their Rockets they
launch them this is when colleague of
ours Leroy Chiao went into space they
have a media circus right before launch
we at least give the crews little
privacy they report to the state
commission they get on the bus they
report to another state commission they
go out they do their thing they launch
up and away for them landing is in my
opinion barbaric compared to a shuttle
landing because a shuttle you land on
concrete in 45 minutes after you land
you're out and a few minutes after that
you're in the hot showers back at crew
quarters visiting with your family they
send helicopters out because you're
going to land in a capsule somewhere in
these 10 miles of Kazakhstan and they
kind of know where those ten miles are
if they're wrong well that's another
story we don't have time for today
they've been wronged and recently too it
usually is land a few hundred miles
downrange if they go in a ballistic
trajectory and then they just search and
rescue actually does their job and goes
and tries to find them it's apparently
an eggbeater of a reentry ed it's an
eggbeater nothing like a shovel this is
apparently one of the most provocative
reentry's you can a provocative means
you haven't been in on the ground so
that some a circular canals you've got
with the fluid at the bottom down here
that fluid floats around you actually
grow more cilia in there so you're
actually more sensitive to motion then
before you went then you come back the
gravity comes on the jeez come on is you
start slowing down the fluid goes whoop
you've turned the gain on high a little
head motion so all sorts of things can
happen there's those who adapt to space
well and those who don't there's those
who adapt to reentry well and those who
don't okay and there's those who tell
the truth about it and those who lie
okay so let's admit there's some readapt
ation going on in both directions
especially if you've been up there for
six months so that's a very provocative
environment after they've egg beach'
that bring you down and of course you're
going to hit the ground and you know you
you're going to hit the ground
they have these soft landing Jets they
call them but they give you a seat that
strokes okay like that in order to try
to take up in some of that shock because
you could get hurt then they actually
come out there with the medical a
portable medical tent because they found
you out there somewhere they set up
inflate of medical tent the helicopters
land it doesn't matter what kind of time
of year really because when it's time to
land is time to land and just happen to
be snow one quick story on their weight
of experience and that was they once
overshot their landing site and ended up
in the Ural Mountains in the winter in
the snow in the mountains and the crew
and to get out of there cockpit out of
the capsule and there's wildlife in
those mountains and included wolves and
the Wolves appeared to be hungry so they
got back into the capsule okay and
waited until the rescue forces showed up
and so after that they said gosh of that
sort of thing would happen you guys need
to have a gun okay so they gave them a
sawed-off shotgun that doubles my
understanding that can tell you the
truth that according to popular lore it
doubles as a shotgun or as a flare
shooter so you can shoot flares with it
or you can shoot bullets of some sort or
another is that fairly accurate a very
here in case you land in the jungles of
Burma which could happen you can land
you wind once you're under a parachute
and in a capsule you don't need concrete
so you do have more possibilities for
where you can land I'll give them that I
can you mean like our nuclear pump to
death ray laser I doubt it but I don't
know after they land get them out it's
also turns out once they get them out
there's the soft landing Jets digging it
up it's good luck for the natives the
locals cause ox to find these returning
you know beings from the sky and it's a
considered good luck to go and visit and
to say hello so they the modern horse
actually is a is a Toyota pickup and so
we have seen that out there
at times as well this is his his
daughter was born while he was in space
that particular American again right
after you come home they end up
subjecting you to this media circus and
it's like just leave me alone but smile
for the camera okay there's his daughter
who's born while he was up there they do
the traditional bread and salt ceremony
of welcoming people back to earth again
tradition just quickly this is their
shuttle now some of the Russian files
have been made public and one of the
neatest entries that I've seen
transcribed is when they were designing
their brawn I'm going to go to a picture
of a braun there's a picture of a braun
and just for comparison I'll allow you
to contrast it with the picture of a
shuttle now and in the minutes of the
design bureaus meeting and says can't
improve on Americans design will use as
is okay and why would they do that well
did a whole lot of testing we've proven
it works it flies in space why does the
shuttle have such large wings does the
space shuttle need such large wings it
needs a pretty good-sized tail because i
went to re-enters it kind of has to come
in like this and so you need a pretty
big tail to to get the air flow onto it
at about Mach 2.5 dual Mach 5 you need
some air on the tail but why do you need
such big wings NASA is originally in a
partnership with the military and the
military put in a design constraint that
said you need to have 750 miles of cross
range so if you're going in that
direction you're going to land in that
direction unless you have some really
big wings to push against the air and
let you get out 750 my nautical miles
cross range from your down track which
is huge okay I don't know that the
Russians needed that in fact I don't
think they did but hey the design work
had already been done so you think about
reverse engineering and you think about
well sometimes it makes sense just it's
a lot cheaper just to do
that so they they put their as you
notice I just bomb through there but of
course you have to launch in the
vertical but they do their integration
in the horizontal you hardly get high
enough off the ground for it to be
exciting as opposed to a space shovel
where you're working hundreds of feet up
off of the ground and again the safety
issues that go with that I'm not saying
the way they did they do it's better but
it is different they integrated there in
area in the horizontal they put their
shuttle on top of it one story though
just to let you know engineers the
engines Russians are pretty good
engineers if you've ever been on their
Metro you'll understand that we're
seeing the stuff they can build this
building had turned into a museum and
they had a braun sitting on top of an in
area after they went broke because they
weren't able to spend the money to fly a
shuttle only america has been able to
afford that because it's very expensive
to fly a shuttle the engineers
determined that the building the roof
the building was structurally unsound
and that they needed to go ahead and
reinforce it so the other whoever the
contractor was loaded all of the
building materials up on the roof in
order to start fixing it and the route
promptly collapsed okay so unfortunately
it collapsed right on top of this one of
the flight modules of the / on so they
actually they go out in the horizontal
as well so they was too big for one set
of train tracks so they just put two
train tracks next to each other which
turns out is a little cheaper I think
perhaps than the way we do it they then
I'm not saying NASA is a jobs program
but if any of you are interested in a
job ok we're looking for good people all
the time so keep that in mind the the
two train tracks they haul it out there
they raise it up you can see the little
can't believe are things there that'll
raise it up and then it's time to go
they launched in air ghia with the Brawn
on it once it launched once before that
and it went up in a way they had a
different philosophy than we did we put
a couple of guys named young and Crippen
on our first shuttle flight the first
flight of an untested rocket rockets
will typically blow up in their first
minute or make it completely to orbit
challenge or even fit
76 seconds so about the first minute
rockets tend to blow up in their first
minute or they're usually good all the
way up so they said well you know
Rockets can blow up we're not going to
put people on ours so they flew their
first bar on unmanned it landed it
unmanned as well so they had an auto
land system that worked in the steppe of
Kazakhstan and is a real threat to the
pilot Union in our country I'll tell you
that now we're into the political
questions what do we do with our space
program NASA had I know what I felt like
in the shuttle program because when I
grew up I was watching people go to the
moon and I'm thinking that's the job for
me I you know I gotta work for a living
most likely but what a great way to
combine science and technology and doing
something useful for the country and for
the world is my opinion of it and so I
decided to go in the space program of
course in the shuttle we were just kind
of going around the earth you know
finally building the space station but
what do we really want to do there's an
asteroid out there with our name on it
we hope for some gravity tractor's we
hope for some neat ways of moving those
things out of the way you know but until
then you know don't have all your eggs
in one basket you want to live on earth
living in space is great but it's not
like living on earth some things are
easier in space some things are a lot
harder if you're typing on a keyboard
what do you have to do you better strap
yourself down because you're pushing on
the keyboard which pushes you away so
you strap yourself down or hook your
fingers under the keyboard of the
computer strap the computer down hold on
the computer type of way sneak your
thumb up for the space bar every once
awhile sort of thing so things are some
things are easier some things are harder
in space and earth is the place you want
to live this is a great place to live
it's fun to go into space as soon as
Branson gets his hotel in space save up
a lot go it's definitely the thing to do
I've strongly recommend it but we need
to be somewhere else most likely so we
can recall a nice earth after that
asteroid hits if we run successful in
moving it out of the way simple as that
there's going to be a new couple of
vehicles
Russian model our previous model had
always been launched the crew with their
payload but now we're separating our
payload from our crew and there's the
escape tower enough of this kill an
astronaut's thing okay it turns out that
there are plenty of astronauts willing
to take that risk so in all truth and
honesty what is the problem with losing
a few people how many people do we lose
on our streets every year what's the
value of life okay it's huge you can't
replace it we find it we considered very
valuable however people are willing to
risk that in what they feel is a good
cause whether it's your fireman your
police officers your military whoever it
is doing it your astronauts it's a good
cause we're willing to take the risk
politically it's unacceptable for some
reason and especially when the vehicle
the Space Shuttle costs five billion
dollars to replace and they're not going
to even let us do that it turns out
though that if you take care of the
hardware if that's five billion dollars
if you build the systems to make sure
that the hardware gets home you get the
people home too okay so that's one of
the things to think about it should
build things politically you can't
tolerate losing people the truth is
we've always lost adventurers and
explorers and it's always going to be
that way anybody who ever tells you that
going into space is routine they're not
living in our time as long as we are
using chemical rockets to get into space
it's going to be a very challenging
business we really need some people to
come up some better ways to get into
space please do that this is what is
important on this this is an extraction
rocket it'll pull that capsule off of
that stack and get it down range under
parachute away from the problem the only
time that this has ever been used was by
the Russians they were sitting on the
launch pad one day Tito I think was on
that flight and this young engineer
named Sergei krikalev who hadn't even
been selected into the cosmonaut program
yet
what they would do in Baikonur is some
of the young engineers they had sneaked
out okay into the well the blast damaged
area really close where they weren't
allowed to be and he snuck out there
with a couple of others and and they
would watch the launches from really
close he said it was really cool okay
and in one day they're sitting out there
watching sitting down in the step you
know pretty close to the launch pad and
they see a fire erupt at the base of the
Soyuz launch platform and apparently
what happened was and and and may have
more details than I do even but this is
the way I heard the story from Sergei
was they couldn't manually eject
themselves because their radio com to
the ground the ground said there's a
fire they couldn't eject their capsule
the ground control the fire had burned
through the cables so the ground
couldn't deject them manually either so
some smart controller as the things
getting ready to come apart bounces a
radio signal to a receiver that was able
to command separation and so blammo the
extraction rocket works they land down
range a couple of kilometers that night
the cruise you know toasting with vodka
they're alive okay and their program
since it's an assembly line they fixed
the problem they move on well this is
happening there's three young engineers
realizing that something bad is going to
happen okay and one of them panics jumps
up and runs what comes from an explosion
a shockwave where do you want to be as a
shock wave rolls over your position
behind something so so Sergei jumps up
runs after this person tackles them they
get behind some berm or something just
in time as the shock wave goes rolling
overhead so it's been used but once and
it worked so we're going to have them in
the future too we're gonna we're not
going to use fuel cells any more
interesting liquid oxygen liquid
hydrogen not going to use them going to
go with solar cells first thing you'll
do is talk with International Space
Station we're going to be five years
without our own capability to get to
space we're going to rely on the
Russians we buy seats from the Russians
right now the cost is 30 million dollars
if you're a tourist you used to be about
20 million but you know the dollars not
doing very well overseas the euro is
doing pretty well we negotiate long-term
contracts and we want the best price we
can get we used to trade flights shuttle
flights for Soyuz flights ed was
originally scheduled to go up on a
shovel he's going to come home on a
shuttle he went up on a Soyuz came home
on a so those part of the international
agreements but now we have to buy him
because those are finished and the
Russians they're very good negotiators
turns out there's some stories to tell
you about that too but we want the
government price and they want the
commercial price we don't call them the
evil communists anymore we call them the
evil capitalism they are taking us for
as much money as they can get and
they're good at it same capsule may go
to the moon set up moon base he comes
here's a schematic as it comes apart it
reenters the earth's atmosphere like a
capsule basically safe your worst
ballistic entry is survivable from orbit
well you could go so steep that you you
know just over G it but if once you get
on a relatively nominal reentry you're
going to be able to survive it we're
probably going for water because that's
easier the Russians are actually as
disappointed as we are that the Space
Shuttle is going away the nominal cost
to orbit that we agreed upon national
prices international prices are ten
thousand dollars a pound twenty-two
thousand dollars a kilo does it cost
more or less to get things home from
space turns out it costs a lot more the
shuttle is the only thing that can bring
large equipment home from space so it's
a real truck it's thirty thousand
dollars a pound three times as much to
get things home as it is to get things
to space by international agreement
because we're the only ones who can do
it basically the Russians can bring home
a few kilos in their little capsule and
that's about it nobody else has
capability from rain
home so it's a and that's going to all
go away so it's going to be very
interesting time in 2010 if you want to
go see a shuttle launch I'd go soon
that's it I'd be happy to stay and take
questions you all have been a great
audience I really enjoyed chatting with
you today thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
