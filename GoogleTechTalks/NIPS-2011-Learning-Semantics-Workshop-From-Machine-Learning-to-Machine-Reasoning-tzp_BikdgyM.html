so let me start by saying that this is
something very funny when we do
statistical machine learning resume with
models your statistical model because it
is an input space in our space family
function with some parmesan sub space
can be small or large and try to fit
another living examples now you can want
to discuss research in these systems in
fact they are basically fed up with your
question must discuss the models our
fascination for her death you must
discuss the most functions asymptotes
inconsistency where they went to do with
such examples you must discuss the Roman
army women's of your tomorrow because it
is with an inverse discuss
generalization in fact we've actually
said that this has been done isn't
unique I say essentially because our
city needs to do but it was a thing that
they're not going to be massive changes
Thomas and the mesolithic daughter
welcome their subject and i'm just going
to outline my time is now because we
should use correctional statistical
models each one together with an
algebraic structures unites them
basically connects the models and the
realization is important and describes
how to transfer knowledge across
wonderful enjoying the nice convenient
structure each exactly prep them to a
particular order this can be able of the
algebraic structure is the group and
need to focus on the group because the
clue is relativism so so I'm going to
find freedom this is the older prepare
the first part muscles yes dust and
their own what is the second and third
parts are busy exams the surface because
a single amusing to see and promising
models tickle they connected you can't
read the other way around you would
order one doing these things ballistic
models the fourth player is 20x and mr.
Wizzle me at large and then salon
obsidian tasks so I'm going to start
with the problem shut up quite a while
ago you want to solve it be here over an
application no problem something like
wheezing chefs so the boots are images
of chance you output is an amount guilty
better stripper craft their trust an
amount a single number as if you have
examples of this you cannot stretch
does a single water body maybe exam but
you would require so many examples and
so much computational conversation that
we found 33 so we go to when we face
such a problem the natural upsides to
use our engineering space engineer it is
the near the machine guns so for
instance that you can identify
subproblems we want to look at the
amount here you want to send out the
characters if you want to work on either
of the characters then translate the
character screen now and none of these
problems which is very trivial so that
each separately defined such a model to
be very complicated for which model so
are you nearer than of the segmentation
communication models just a few HR 7 and
then you can have to never give up all
these things most of them your work on
your river is not too expensive yeah and
you try now if you try and guide you
actually have a lot of training
strategies the simplest one is in
different training you collect data for
each some other you'd rent the second
one does it better 2nd chakra me you
basically friendly a small them which is
the local the feed vocation to the case
then you run it and you see examples of
fields and you rather them as good or
bad and train I'm sure you label the
fields by proposing segmentation is
segments let me try to segment the water
then you get segmented images then we
travel through now sir and you go that
way in a second show and when we do this
is we better hurry but then we can think
well in my segmentation model as a lot
of thresholds will help demise
Rachel maybe I should go two thousand
threshold as a in order to maximize the
performance of the policy's cash and
i'll take you to the next ID which is
the payroll training you pretend already
begun and then they take you whether you
equals shaking angles and given our
differences are also addresses a single
thing and we just random up to the male
model i will give me problems there are
issued there so like the structure of
the global number change with the better
you have to mention prophecies have to
do things like that and the composition
of supporters can be nonlinear laughter
is this little Mary Harris problem but
the big thing here that minerals the
other flag but we know how to become
that way so and does keep blowing so
here is my simplified view the problem I
know its inception food water but that
goes via with three train with six and
shellfish if Ava's training we collect
off into the sub model and we training
another superb as well and then when
it's done with you need some local
fremming and we look at the mask
yourselves and be happy and does any
similar to work eat here very similar to
a very special training and let the
global friend to me the only difference
is that in the engineering in the
engineer approach all the tasks when
understood as being part of the forum
like like engineer a solution while in
deep longing the tasks are very issues
Justin sugar has something you put them
together you get something so when I
quit the diplom you surprise is that
well you don't need to carefully select
the sub dust to be something that makes
sense
Thank You Jamie consumer gossiped a
squadron were quite well and the well we
wanted to have babies and see ambulance
just who thinks what is it so as fast
engineering with your insistence is
easier than with other now the verizon
is going to go here I'm chicken as well
that's comparable to using really
cheaper x1 x2 applause explanation ya
novels that many interesting lovers
personally that person who knows because
we chose into space tienda and Sparta
supervised long does so in the end what
we have is that we train me foxy oh it
does you should be give up the price of
Legos in punished us lots of interesting
tasks that the words are wanting to
solve and the levels are scarce because
if the rubbers are abundant and is equal
them it has we believe that valuable and
your classic I'm also interesting the
painful happens like Justin with these
levels are closing monogatari whether
they're closed the ID is that in the
vicinity of some interesting task for
the lab and severe there are no from our
less interesting task which signals that
we can do to the views so tangible I
learning is just one of them with
trigger guards so okay when you look at
it this way it's interesting because
things I've deep learning or submissive
about learning or transfer running they
become three concepts of the same thing
and that's a good education is good to
see in that way so let me give a few
examples so the first example which are
found frank-walter delightedly is a
festive traditional example that was
three thousand two thousand six so I'm
thirsting for them is the four way we
want to recognize the faces one minute
dozens and the dimension of horses I'm
gonna novel image dr. something we get
I'm not so me there is a related but
less interesting program our two first
images representing the same person and
you have a lot of examples for that for
web team if you see two faces in the
same picture they are likely to be
different person okay the two sections
he knows nudists but you can somehow
culturas now if you see faces in
successive friends they are more likely
to be the same person than faces and
completely different movies so in the
end you can build a system like this
that takes two images apply some
pre-processing the same one to
instruction face features and then the
distance measures are going to say yes
no once you have this you can just take
this pre-processing who dis sumwhere
other classifier tryna waiting and you
get a classifier and you know that by
doing things like this at least
professors all of the thoughts in the
digits after having a new glass here is
extremely easy on the pre-processing
directly
so I'm the examples I 52 or not go to
bed the interesting programs are
standard Olympic diving tasks so what
are some people's lives in death and the
relative but less interesting problem is
the following we don't want to say that
the positive examples our legal sentence
signals signals of legal sentences and
then we're going to cut your baggage by
age 52 tea in the central walk replacing
it by something random and we say so
niggas ibiza user ranking us so so
here's an example the other sentence the
cats are in the mat but each digital
world by something crazy then we are
going to represent each one in seven
space and machinery has meant to say
this is medicinal food you want that
when she's delusional work yeah that's
certainly not issues through the high
school when its random work is critical
swap data for this is abundant and
whatnot training wikipedia Chris Brown
was a patrol on 1 billion watts or
soccer was let me take this
pre-processing move yours if you tell me
sometime they didn't machine the region
one hand in dinner yes one bigger was
you put them in some cookie also machine
you're out lost of this one you see to
other species each I mean we're saving
forever in your even passing and we try
that and worse by far so well we had
another picture with us do but that case
if you have something Admiral
descendants the demons but Cena so you
see the values worse yeah you see the
past with guys you see the chunking you
see the Lenin supervision so in
recognized sinner which is the name of
the software so
which means it's not self-aware yet
there were 39 for me under the bus you
have a characterization of quantum for
men who made to that will be made up
manyone descendants and well I don't
know what pnc all these windows and 21
stretch you are good even straightest in
me and the red is demonstrate animated
segments on and the thing worse would
really like so what's interesting though
is this what kind of representation we
have here and we are going to look at it
is too thick a word look at the
representation does this and look at
what how the coolest words that's this
one I like is this reddish that is close
to finish breach in each parish brandish
brandish brandish one ish civil Mirage
and a couple of us under so this best
clearly captures something that's not
somewhere between sin tax and CMV so
that I speak my student thought ship it
this was an idea Bob Seger tasks and
other can use basically sort of view we
salute supervised learning diplomas on
transfer running through the same rules
so lemony circus notice but this is what
I introduced examples I took little
devils orders were composed of our news
videos and I assemble them a right hand
rubs way
me first of all for the training of
these things we can look at then with
the third base in class suppose that is
a military would you this nigga will
ruin things apparel transfer
distributions and steady one we train
this oxygen dust there is no clear
across failures are going to factorize
three distributions you know they are
techniques to project or stereos in fact
OSS so after training have a
distribution here that were presents
this part below monument what he knows
and what he doesn't know i can drag it
there and that was the poster you're
here because the prior year so it's a
capacity from four to be completely the
fact based around and start to write
nicely let them tell you everything
except what matters which is that
doesn't say which transfer strategies
are going to work best now if I
democracy loved the writing you can
consider the writing operation when I
take my values now why them as an
algebraic operation and what's
interesting that it operates in
Tennessee in two spaces you grumbles the
mothers being a function as I ate rice
and you are so calm poster for the
realization which is the mother's very
strength and two so we transport both
the functions in the hammock position
and that induces another a given
structure on the heart interspace that's
necessary in order to make sure that the
statistical models match their
organizations but this is a complicated
when you say that when we take two
mothers with two different set of
does the global set of characters the
concatenation parameters of balls and
that you cannot comment are sharing and
these about and more interestingly in
units there is an integrated secure in
the space of questions of interest in
that case it means that each of these
models a preference this thing here sea
castle wall is the model that takes as
input to the edges and output to
decision about representing whether they
be sent us a lot that's the question of
interest not so interesting the
depression embarrassed this one is a
question of different natural take an
image say who is in the image as a
different question and by rewriting and
what you also connect the virus
reference so basically this algebraic
structure is an expression of the
semantic and in fact the secret algebra
is pretty much the same as the semantic
equation models that were this
background 2002 cosine T book and so in
terms of semantics as algebraic
structure the secrets is more causal
done to our nation and because we are
correlations asymmetrical when you have
modules that have an input and output
that you connects all of the wrong way
on others I never said so
because the object wavesecure is the
reflection of the synergies well we can
enrich the semantics by and reaching the
algebra group picture and the complaint
that's time alone to enrich and a gr8
secure is to make it recursive so let's
do that in fact this beam unloggable app
is being known by jordan for initiated
with the receiver to associative
memories and judging turn at the paper
that was rock climbing parts in home 13
bak'tun both at the same time she was
the same kind of hobbies so the elements
are representation space I don't see
what it is doesn't matter what it is
only thing that matters of the algebraic
properties there is an association
module that takes to regulation pep
talks between the metal produces only
one and association module text from
your presentation vector and produces
two and it goes to be the opposite of
the other words there is an alliance we
know that association of the Association
reconstructing so forth sense we can
take two words work at map then you to
some organizations face associate them
to have a representation of the complex
their cats and associated to get the gap
and then if you have something wrong
with it sat on the map and associated in
buying this way associated in various
ways and we can serve the sentence now
the important thing is that now you have
to navigate the sentence if you filled
this representation here you can apply
the association module to split it
between the web and health and go down
bro app basically this is
so if you ever one of these electricity
velocity memories it can represent an
early death project if it exact is the
same as the list of electrons garcinia
except the representations best to pick
anything now of course if the represent
of space is just a miracle thing like a
repeal our handler they're going to be
numerical accuracy issues when you're
going to start to induce these 2d and
reconstruct between you lose something
so you'll need to construct something
that's not exactly what you have at the
beginning and the glam like that if the
n begin in the resolution space makes
sense the dissociation won't you will
restrict our pepsiman Sanders something
very new and something two numbers and
sense of too complicated erp something a
couple numbers but when we were
constructed we will construct something
that cielo
so now let's look how you take a
sentence and knit or something and
associate and run this and there is a
mechanism I clone a new descent parser
if you push to other things you request
a modular record the salad this saliency
score 70 motive blue sugar skull and
less going to tell me where the
representation here is a good
environment but you would want or not it
means are these two objects that are
associated object the ocean okay
together or not and requires a
short-term memory to the two bars
believe it even when I said text or an
email or whatever you have two
operations to the schedule the first one
is taking an e-book put in the short
memory the second one is taking to the
visitation records will shorten my
associate then it isn't and Mac here the
vision is how to stick you a multitude
which tool and sending you want to get a
very high 70 box talk over with our
values approximations to do that if you
can stretch these are the start form you
get stuck myself at any rate are now the
domestic thing that is not that is that
it's one they stood behind your chunky
that you forgot about this 5 plus on
these two concepts that we can remember
five plus or minus to the practice meant
to what 757 personality
so the question is what Andres puppy
sized chunks things are thrown back
together and this is what we she does
not come with question 26 so we have to
supervise training and I think we shall
socials plenty of examples of that each
other basically it works so al-shabab us
training now what we can do it exactly
the same spirit as the quarterback
example we keep it well suppose you take
a call from segments of acceptance on
the mat we associated using the AUSA
moving on steroids you apply the silence
is golden living good now you can relax
in other words by something crazy and so
this ring is wrong and some of these
days I wanted will have scholarship you
should expect to be back because these
things do not associate to get once you
have this will be fine ranking goes the
plan gets on it what kind of do
something well I think we did that
lonely world bluegrass NFL then suck if
there was an internal you listen and we
wish acabas gotta mow and we keep it up
a set broke every day we were seated to
just 1000 watts is can you start small
all pairs of the 500 most frequent words
were not into their own commercial space
which in this case was for just a 50
mention vector so if you take the point
in disguise that represent the city and
you look at the ones here one of the
presents the closest pairs of words all
possible pairs of words you can go down
the job to be late just take the country
two men free mentor mentee she went
cancel so the first one mark is up it's
not quite good your second room ibiza
it's awfully syntactic with three men
for men is all the same thing you know
the White House and the web and the
German house not the same thing is the
same category Mifflin and the reason why
is not the 70s as a few lots of Raymond
says this morning is some ground there
is not one and you can keep and reaching
the sea facilities you can add more
things one thing that's interesting is
what was natural languages understanding
that is this so we want to be with
cillin things we want to be with
understanding and that in natural
language processing I was donated by the
Boomer program trust me which is to say
let's forget about the 17 for now it's
too complicated let's look at the syntax
and how much of the sentence is
networking evil Christ and ethics and
let's do top single like that but
in further their occurrence before that
and body pillow go structural
linguistics and that below the
atrocities and when the lane method
listen for opiate on grandma's so if you
look at the past three it's a structure
within the sentence what Harris was
doing was having considering the space
of older sentences and consuming
operators between sentence
transformations you can transform a
sentence into all the sentence by word
you can
operation the first role as an
Associated semantics you can read a
sentence the past you can add an extra
10 I was going to give you a Salesman
our movies and so this over 80 grand
masti large corporation representation
station is best all sentence and has
some algebraic structure that's English
there is a book where describes hold
your applause you need to disrupt
English is you you could do that much
space as long as you have the right idea
by Scripture we can repeat of course
with lyrics are going to count you when
it's too deep of two in the sentences
are dugan place you're going to be exact
but i'll save you now you can also go to
watch russell energy that you can add
specialized modules for variable
bindings and 20 files that we initially
approached us warranty 90 and you can do
that by having would use that do
instantiation so positive vibe advanced
button or replacing the subtree very
variable and manipulate your
presentation that way it's complex the
imaginative ideas which are closer to
language like having good juice boxes
that will face an anaphora resolution
which tree not represent our 7th ed or
do what I call respected endowment is
these three and instance of this order
three which is a trying to a way to have
a kind of its kind of relation between
revelations but you can blame this
focused approach organization based in
the English so that I guess to a quick
we're going to put this on pause and
stop being a tourist in models in niche
of advertising models is in part of the
city and that feels important to
understand how their word
cell fragments so first of all why are
pro wasted models appealing I'm not
going to yield submission down there is
that the ratleys result and serving a
program pinterest we will solve the
movie our program i sent in your step if
you want to classify patterns use the
pure classifier like svn purifier up
into class just for class I mean that
dozens go fish but we might want
something more complex which means that
we shouldn't happen no we should not
serve a more general program as an
intermediate step but we sure that what
sort of problem that simpler than what
we want now if you distorted models you
can easily handle balance of the problem
interests at four instances th can a
Christian model which is Felicity
language models policy let them together
with raised wooden and how to speak of
emission system is going to do so and
the 23 as an important sporting law
because describes how to manipulate or
ETS and together to make a semantic as
replication what it means to combine
abilities from expanding our business so
let's look at the graphical models of
regular director of injustice you can
look at this with the padre y plus you
can consider the family of all
conditional distributions in- that also
do x tu an external annex warp you
excuse me miss weeks where 0 is 0 that
would be of any value given any other
buyer possibly not and you have
algebraic operations
then the marginalization goes to the
proper address are prepared from
dysfunctional institutions and powers of
us get some of them on the basis of all
these are the rest of the modern
realizations because I speak about
Olivia's you gotta come into possession
at all our squash we have independence
assumptions basically we restrict the
family by saying that p of x community
so nice to us a clue the same as good
excuse one that's in the balance the
fastest insurance okay actually happened
now what about the carnage possession
and i think i think the sentence is for
money c'mon this is all about 30 meters
so in a graphical model the
privatization is puffins often in visit
when you carry induces the logical
structure the modernization of the
motors but in fact if you look and put
up device language describing on
intimidation and if you're such a
language or something very similar to
the sickness you are classic model can
be assessed for models another gr8 group
that connects all the models and
generalizations examples sometimes you
confuse place to make the diameter and
essex kisses like for instance you have
this table model which is excellent good
why they are heat why is conditioned by
X if you write it that way we say
Moulton empowerment about the
characterization you can also write it
this way when you make the exams
explicit in public as explicit and
that's the way you should write if you
Whitney advancing because when you see
that way you have nine lives in
background it tells you how to use this
new parameters as usual remover language
like for instance in touristic Russian
on models or relational dependency
networks these are language defines the
Bayes net that encompasses all examples
like there is a nice example that put
some moving and jetsam and int B which
is about predicting the receipts of some
movie I've never graph the graph the
movies with the Act also spelled in
which in business all and what the
system is doing that creates resnet own
structure we share with us the movies
the local visa describe this movie is
the same parameters as a centimeter
share our meters with the rubber piece
of the movies so when you extend if we
movies or new things you asleep come
together scale so another one hour na
commercial networks and this time you
doing at the business and magnetization
using a first order model president
Markov evidence based on logic programs
generate business market logic and
military markov congressional so I don't
know I didn't so
the seventies of discipline which under
seven seconds we're at the right
structure on the space of modern
civilizations it's inducible secure the
special questions of interest and this
language they find the trash so what I
met with the color black women here is
absolutely actually use of graphical
models of the recent models people have
to invent external register that s
practice relationship how to won't only
connect the realizations from the rig
but also connect the models so if i
compare circular super realistic models
that were on estates family recipes from
others i'm generating population that
work into space the special fancy car
models and mr. civilizations with the
included securing our meter space and a
sufficient interest just adding extra to
have different like puristic models
wonder would you like a sickness like 78

is a force equal division of reasoning
I've been record in an agreement an

the project with link living these

probably stick with a native operations
cause i was reading resume about
interventions if i believe is going to

mechanic cyclic quite interesting you
have a brownish programs that work for
having point masses or pendular members
of the middle another program to the old

I see a different part of the same scene
but this condition are two different
models and the answer
what you see from report electronically
it's unnatural perforations that prepare

presidency well so sure reasoning it's
about maybe trying to understand
something from the point of view or a
person and also rest on these examples
of drizzly weather like asking for
jean-georges complicated easily when we
try to understand the future using
internet but in it on the surface it has
been form of a reason that he is not
very good maybe doesn't have a very high

computational aspects and another one
thing bothers me that I can see three

the true value of a person move then
together listen you can leave that in
the light blue 20 files you can confirm
that i'm going for each close to give
its true value as a function of the free
variables of the universe 7 25 miles or
you can do it with the simple trick and
representation space so we have safe
with Association Association provides a
way to define play decades and
expressions and hesitation left you have
to get the machinery and refers to the
quite close the third one is radically
different because it also contains in
which represents and expressions so when
I said before that when we see a sin or
