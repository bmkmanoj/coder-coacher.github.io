i'm a member of the talks at Google team
here in Google's Los Angeles Venice
office we're very pleased today to have
all raised a nadir here to speak about
coping with a nuclear rising Iran ally
is a senior international policy analyst
at the RAND Corporation in their DC
office and we're very happy to have him
to speak here and give the floor Valley
all right well thank you very much good
afternoon I'm going to briefly speak
about Iran for about 20 to 25 minutes
that I would like to open it up to Q&amp;amp;A
but specifically I want to talk about
the Iranian nuclear negotiation
specially the talks that were just held
in moscow and also talked about the
internal political dynamics within Iran
and then conclude with US policy options
toward Iran what do we do from here
where do we go the negotiations in
Moscow which concluded on the 19th
overall didn't go very well my contacts
in Moscow told me that there was a lot
of tension between Iran and the p5 plus
one at the p5 plus 1 being the UN
Security Council plus Germany and in
fact after the talks there was some
speculation that the negotiations
process with Iran could actually
collapse Iran and the p5 plus 1 haven't
set up a new negotiation location
they're supposed to meet an Istanbul for
technical talks but the political talks
the serious talks between iran and the
p5 plus one right now are on hold and
this carries some dangerous because if
talks with Iran fail then the chances of
an Israeli or US military strike against
Iran increase and then we can have a
major regional war in the Middle East
before the Moscow talk there's a lot
more optimism specially in Washington DC
I was one of the analysts that was
cautiously optimistic about the talks
especially when they restarted in
Istanbul in April and then the following
toxin Baghdad and there were signs
coming from Tehran that Iran was more
serious about the talks this time around
and they're a couple of major reasons
for this the first one are the internal
dynamics within Iran there are
indications that Iran was becoming more
serious about negotiations and the
second factor was the sanctions being
placed against you right now in the
effects on the economy the first factor
the internal politics we saw that
Iranian officials start talking about
the negotiations in a very positive
manner before especially since 2009 Iran
did not want to talk about the nuclear
program or are possible concessions
everyone wanted to open up the
discussions on a number of other issues
historical wrongs and grievances but
this time around Iranian officials
started talking about the negotiations
in a positive manner they said that Iran
was in a good position that the p5 plus
one the United States was ready to
negotiate with Iran so there are
indications that Iran was trying to
portray the talks are successful and
trying to get the population in the
political elite ready for a possible
deal so the tone from Iran changed even
Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei praised President Obama from
stepping back from the brink of a
conflict a military conflict with Iran
and hominy said that Obama had exited
from his delusions and one of the
reasons for this are the changing
dynamics within Iran in 2009
ronen the p5 plus 1 were actually pretty
close to reaching a deal on the nuclear
program Iran and 2009 would have sent
its stockpile of highly enriched uranium
abroad and this during it would have
been used to develop nuclear weapons and
in exchange for the uranium Iran would
have received fuel for its medical
isotopes at the Tehran research reactor
the deal fell apart for a number of
reasons in 2009 you want to experience
major protest as you remember a lot of
Iran ians went into the streets because
they believed the presidential election
in 2009 to be fraudulent and so the
system was really divided against itself
Iran had it hard time coming together to
negotiate a deal and President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad at that time faced a lot of
opposition from the left side of the
political spectrum on the right side of
the political spectrum a lot of his
opponents did not want Iran to reach a
deal under aunt Medina jaws presidency
since then at Medina jawed has really
challenged a supreme leader Ayatollah
Khamenei who is Iran's ultimate
decision-maker he's constitutionally
empowered as Iran's ultimate religious
political and military leader in April
of 2011 and Maddie nejad fired his
minister of intelligence and common I
told him not to do this he challenged
his order he skipped his cabinet
meetings for 10 days and this was seen
as a public rebuke to the Supreme Leader
the elite within Iran especially the
conservatives turn against aunt Mattie
nejad and even would we thought were
what's his support base within the
government the Revolutionary Guard
started really criticizing him so since
2011 a mighty nejad is a much diminished
figure you don't see him on CNN or
television as much he's not as assertive
anymore he's not a key decision-maker
within Iran comedy has basically
sidelined him and also earlier this year
we
parliamentary elections in Iran and
Khamenei's Allies won the elections so
essentially whereas in 2009 Iran didn't
speak with one voice regarding the
nuclear program now we can argue that
Khamenei has consolidated power and that
Iran speaks with one voice the Iranian
nuclear negotiator with the p5 plus one
has been titled as a personal
representative of hominy the supreme
leader the second reason for the initial
optimism regarding the talks are the
effects of sanctions on the Iranian
economy Iran has gone through four
rounds of UN sanctions but the UN
sanctions against Iran didn't do as much
damage the current sanctions specially
sanctions passed by the US Congress
against your own central bank have been
much more effective a lot of countries
now refuse to do business with the
Iranian central bank which is really the
mechanism for you ought to receive
payments for its oil exports and so
therefore Iran's oil exports have
decreased significantly according to
some reports by forty percent and in
July in a couple of weeks really less
than that actually the European Union
will stop buying oil from Iran and the
European oil embargo will also have a
major impact on the Iranian government's
ability to earn money from its oil and
natural gas exports so the pain of the
sanctions have brought Iran to the table
of Iranians in Iran tell me that prices
have increased dramatically the Iranian
currency the rial has appreciated by
fifty percent and the population is
becoming more restive and Iranian regime
especially considering the 2009
elections and the unrest is very
cautious when it comes to popular
dissatisfaction its wants to make sure
that the sanctions don't create
instability so that's one of the reasons
Iran has come to the table and there's
an expectation
I think from the United States and its
allies that the pressures against Iran
the pain the regime is feeling will lead
to concessions and that was expectation
going to the Moscow talks that the u.s.
is in a position of strength visa vie de
Islamic Republic but we also have to
look at Khamenei's mindset and political
interests as Iran's supreme leader what
kind of a man is commonly how does he
view the United States and the nuclear
program and what are his ultimate
intentions yes his regime is facing a
lot of pressures but how does Khamenei
view these pressures and how does he
plan to respond to them I would argue
that hominid is a very rational man he's
a careful decision maker he makes his
decisions based on cost benefit
calculations he's not irrational and
overzealous but at the same time he is
informed by a particular ideology
hominid it's one of the founders of the
Islamic Republic and a leader of the
revolution he was in the Shahs jails and
he really resents the United States for
the support the United States provided
to the shop before the Revolution and so
he sees the United States and very
ideological terms when we listen to how
many speeches and read his writing he
consistently states that the United
States wants to overthrow his regime
hominid believes that the United States
is not just opposed to Iran's policies
particularly on the nuclear program but
that the United States is opposed to the
very essence of the Islamic Republic and
the hominid has stated this very
explicitly that the u.s. opposes the
essence of his regime harmony has stated
that the u.s. is only after excuse is
that the nuclear program is an excuse
for the u.s. supposed Iran if the
nuclear crisis is solved Khamenei
believes the US would look after other
excuses perhaps human rights and other
issues so it's not just about the
nuclear program and in fact according to
hominid the United States
and his regime are engaged in an
existential battle and either Iran wins
or loses and comedy at the same time
also believes that despite the pressures
and the sanctions and the Iran's
international isolation that time could
be on the side of his regime he believes
that the u.s. global power is waning
because of the financial crisis
specifically that the u.s. is not the
super-powered used to be and he also
believes that US influence in the Middle
East is also decreasing in the last year
and a half we've seen pro-american
regimes where the Arab world being
overthrown and replaced including an
Egypt Yemen there's been a very serious
uprising back rain and how many sees
this as an indication that the u.s. is
failing in the Middle East we called the
Arab uprisings Arab Spring hominy calls
it the Islamic awakening and from his
point of view the Arab populations were
inspired by Iran's own Islamic
Revolution of 1979 and comedy I think he
uses this for political effect and
rhetoric but I really do believe that in
his mind he thinks that the Arabs are
overthrowing us power in the region and
they're following Iran's model despite
contradictory evidence no other analyst
or serious analysts would argue this
outside of Iran and outside of the
Iranian regime we can talk a little
about this later on but nevertheless
this is how how many views a situation
in terms of the nuclear program Khamenei
may view Iran's nuclear capabilities of
the form of deterrence and for him and
his regime Iran doesn't actually have to
assemble and test nuclear weapons it
could have a virtual or Layton
capability in fact Khamenei has stated
repeatedly that his regime does not want
nuclear weapons he thinks her
anti-islamic but
nevertheless Iran could be pursuing a
nuclear weapons capability even if it's
virtual or Layton for deterrence
purposes the regime in Iran has seen the
u.s. overthrow Saddam Hussein and the
Taliban in Iraq and Afghanistan with
relative ease and Iran's own
conventional capabilities don't match us
or Israeli or Western military
capabilities in addition to the
deterrent effect in nuclear capability
could have how many views the nuclear
program as a source of pride despite
Iran's isolation despite more than three
decades of sanctions Iran has build this
capability and it follows hominids
principle of hood cafe which means
self-sufficiency he wants Iran to become
self-sufficient in all technological
fields including the nuclear program so
for his regime the nuclear program and
Iran's uranium enrichment program is a
point of pride and prestige and Khamenei
may see it as enhancing his regimes
power and influence across the Middle
East but not everybody necessarily sees
the situation like harmony there are
reformist figures within Iran and less
ideological figures who think that the
nuclear program also has very high costs
in terms of isolating Iran and damaging
his economy Iran's economy it's not
clear how the Iranian population feels
according to surveys including a survey
on conducted on Iran in 2009 Iran ians
broadly support the civilian nuclear
program meaning uranium enrichment but
they don't necessarily support nuclear
weapons in fact I would argue that the
majority of the Iranian population
probably does not support the assembly
of actual weapons that there's a
difference for them between the civilian
program and the nuclear weapons program
this difference is viewed differently of
course in Washington DC and other
capitals we're primarily concerned with
Iran's nuclear weapons and tensions but
not all Iranians necessarily believe
that Iran is after nuclear weapons and
the regime I think to some extent has
successfully portrayed the program as a
civilian scientific program i mentioned
that not everybody within the political
elite agrees with comedy despite his
consolidation of power the reformist and
more pragmatic figures disagree with
them but he has effectively sidelined up
from power especially since 2009 and now
he's really relying on the Revolutionary
Guards to maintain his authority and the
Revolutionary Guards are also a driver
of the nuclear program but even within
the Revolutionary Guards are indications
that Khamenei support is not monolithic
that there's opposition to his
leadership a former high-ranking member
of the Revolutionary Guards the man who
created the Revolutionary Guards Navy
and the Persian Gulf the same force that
would fight US forces if there's a
conflict wrote a letter recently 10
Iranian newspaper implicitly criticized
in harmony his letter was explicitly for
the shot and he asked the Shah a number
of questions including if the Shah had
not suppressed his people would he be in
power if he had not met his people's
aspirations with force would he be in
power but in reality the general was
talking about harmony and everybody near
on understood this to be the case there
were demonstrations against this general
but he got away with that the number of
other people actually came to his
defense another former Revolutionary
Guards officer even criticized comedy on
television and said that if the supreme
leader doesn't answer his people's
demands then he should resign which is
unprecedented in the last 30 years of
Iranian history for the supreme leader
to be so explicitly criticized so this
shows that there are divisions even
within the top of the elite that
sanctions have the potential to
to exacerbate some of these decisions
because the Revolutionary Guards in Iran
are the premier power broker and the
main economic actor in Iran and if their
economic interests are hurt by the
nuclear program and sanctions
conceivably they could apply more
pressure against hominid so having said
all of this where does that lead us in
terms of US policy to date the US
government especially the Obama
administration has built a very broad
and deep international coalition against
Iran to impose sanctions and this
includes our European allies our allies
in the Middle East but also a lot of
Iran's traditional economic and
commercial partners even countries like
India China Japan South Korea have
decreased their purchase of Iranian oil
even turkey one of Iran's main economic
partners in the Middle East looks like
that it is decreasing some of his
activities regarding Iran so far the US
has been successful in building this
coalition to pressure the Islamic
Republic and this is important because
as i stated harmony has said that his
regime does not want to weaponize the
nuclear program so we want him to offer
it operationalize his fatbutt or
religious ruling and by increasing the
Casa weaponization there is a
possibility that you Ron won't cross
that red line that it will maintain a
virtual nuclear weapons program without
assembling and testing nuclear weapons
however if there's a military attack
against Iran if there's an Israeli
strike against Iran then the chances of
Iran crossing that's this red line would
actually increase and the event of a
military attack against Iran the
international coalition that has been
built against Iran could crumble easily
one of the reasons countries like China
and India reducing commercial ties to
Iran is that they maintain Iran is not
moving
necessarily toward a nuclear weapons
program that Iran can be dissuaded from
pursuing that path that that program
according to a lot of Chinese officials
is civilian in nature but if there's a
conflict in the Middle East in which you
want is attack then the remaining regime
can claim that it has been unrightfully
attacked that it is exiting from the
nuclear proliferation treaty that it is
kicking out the IAEA inspectors from
Iran and then with more determination
the regime could actually weaponize the
nuclear program I think that as strike
against Iran would also solidify support
amount around hominid and his regime and
it would rally a lot of Iranians to the
flag that the a lot of Iranians because
their country has been attacked by a
foreign power would momentarily choose
to overlook the regime sins and support
the government in Iran and when we look
at Israeli military options against Iran
Israel's ability to do damage to the
nuclear program it's arguably rather
limited Israeli officials and
policymakers have even stated that
Israel can delay the program three to
five years that it can't destroy Iran's
nuclear facilities because they're
dispersed underground and hardened so
the military option has many more
drawbacks than benefits ultimately I
think US policy toward Iran should be to
contain the regime's power across the
region and I believe sanctions are doing
this through engagement we can even
bolster our sanctions regime against
Iran and ultimately the best weapon
against the regime and really the
solution to the nuclear crisis is real
democracy in Iran I believe that as long
as comedy is in power in Tehran and
makes decisions we will not come to any
sort of accommodation or rapprochement
with Iran that the nuclear program and
the crisis will not go away and if they
do then we are going to face
future crises with Islamic Republic
ultimately I don't believe that the
Iranian people want to be isolated from
the world they do not want a state of
hostility with the United States or
Israel for that matter and a lot of
Iran's people are sophisticated and
educated and want to be part of the
broader world and so US policy should be
based on facilitating democracy in Iran
and an attack against Iran would hurt
this us objective and I think this
should be even the Israeli objective
toward Iran because a democratic Iran
would not be as hostile toward Israel so
in the short term coming back to the
nuclear negotiations no nuclear
negotiations with Iran don't look very
positive right now this short term
prognosis is negative but in the long
term I believe trends within Iran and
the broader Middle East leave me with
some hope that we can reach a solution
to the Iranian nuclear crisis thank you
I got some questions as a devil said to
play devil's advocate Oh a few few
questions first of all if Iran doesn't
isn't isn't continuing their nuclear
program what's to prevent Western powers
us-israel other countries from going in
under the pretense of weapons of mass
destruction or what and invading Iran is
part of that nuclear proliferation
treaty and according to the MPT Iran
can't assemble nuclear weapons it has to
withdraw from the treat again it has to
give six months notice so right now what
you want is trying to do is basically
bend a treaty to develop what we suspect
to be a nuclear weapons capability under
the treaty it hasn't broken the treaty
it's generally in violation of the
treaty but it hasn't necessarily broken
the treaty per se so I think that
provides some cover for Iran not
to be attacked militarily but at the
same time Iran had to prove to the
international community that it is not
after nuclear weapons there have been
reports of Iran experimenting with
weaponization at one of its major
military sites is called patching and
the IAEA wants access to patching so you
can see for itself whether Iran has been
working on nuclear warhead design and at
the delivery system so what if that's
one of the major points of contention
right now not just Iran's enrichment of
uranium but actual experiments if you
want to call them with weaponization so
for now I think we're in this this state
of uncertainty because the talks are
ongoing there's really right now no
justification for the United States or
out it's a light to conduct military
strikes against your own but if the
talks fail if Iran moves toward
weaponization if US intelligence detects
that Iran has decided to weaponize this
program US intelligence right now
assesses that hominid has not made the
political decision to weaponize but if
we see that Iran is moving toward that
option and if there's a broad
international coalition that supports
strikes against Iran then there's more
justification in terms of the military
option right now we're not there and I
don't think Israel is there either that
doesn't have sufficient justification or
international or even really us support
to strike Iran militarily all right
thanks um next question I heard do you
have any update on the status at it
because I know that the it sounds like
the economic sanctions have been fairly
successful so far I also heard that
there were some I guess basically
hacking things done right like the
reactors spent too fast and break down
and also um
some spy attacks against some of the
scientists who were working on the
project right bombs attached to their
cars and things like this you have any
update on that and charlotte so there
there been a number of attacks and
sabotage against Iran's nuclear program
five Iranian scientists have been
assassinated Iran suffered the Stuxnet
cyber attack some time ago against the
Nets hands facility which is the main
enrichment facility and several hundred
if not more of Iran's centrifuges were
damaged or destroyed Stuxnet set back
Iran's ability to enrich uranium to some
extent as have the other acts of
sabotage but it looks like that cyber
warfare the assassinations the flame
virus which was used to gather a lot of
information on the Iranian nuclear
facilities according to watch the news
report I think last week the flame virus
was developed by Israel in the United
States so all these activities have set
back Iran's program but they haven't
necessarily stopped its ability to
enrich uranium in fact since 2009 Iran
has enriched more uranium that started
enriching uranium up to twenty percent
and from twenty percent it's relatively
easier to enrich it up to a higher
degree for the Assembly of nuclear
weapons and Iran is estimated right now
to have enough enriched uranium at a
lower level to create five nuclear
weapons their suspicions that iran is
trying to reach a breakout capability
that it wants to amass enough enriched
uranium and master tech the technology
so when it does develop a nuclear
weapons capability it won't just have
one or two bombs where maybe 10 15 etc
so yet these activities have slowed down
the program but they have not stopped it
as far as we can tell Iran has developed
a technology and the knowledge base to
create a nuclear weapon okay Oh final
question um from I turn to look at it
from
neutral perspective on what makes it
okay for countries like Israel and I
nuclear weapons and not countries like
Iran is it based on alliances or is it
based on political stability or
perception that's a great question so at
the Iranian regime says the same thing
basically it never explicitly
acknowledges it that it is working on a
nuclear weapons capability but you're on
it officials often say that why should
Israel have nuclear weapons and why
should Muslim country countries in the
region not have nuclear weapons so this
is one line of argument Iranian
officials usually talk about nuclear
technology rather than weapons and their
argument is the West and Israel have
nuclear technology we don't and that's
not fair one issue however is that Iran
is a signatory to the NPT that it is
obliged under the NPT not to develop
nuclear weapons and so what it is doing
is bending the NPT it's it's bending the
rules and it's seize the rules as being
unfair and there's some substance to
that argument but nevertheless Iran has
agreed to go along with the rules so
that is a major issue as well that Iran
is in violation of the NPT and could be
experimenting with nuclear weaponization
but when we look at Iran situation it
also lives in a dangerous neighborhood
there's a lot of instability in the
Middle East Pakistan next door which is
unstable and a Muslim country but it is
unstable has up to 100 nuclear weapons
so Iran's national security concerns
also shape its development of potential
nuclear weapons capability it's not just
a matter of pride or prestige there's I
think a real deterrence aspect to Iran
pursuing this sort of technology all
right thank you sharp
okay thank you for coming and and your
presentation so my question is really
about US policy and maybe what we can
expect in the coming months leading up
to a presidential election right so
you've outlined the Obama
administration's policy toward Iran can
you give us like a quick sort of pressey
of like what the sort of right wing I
guess perspectives are and then should
romney be the next president in the
coming election what would the likely
sort of policy be that would be
implemented so right now there's a
guessing game in terms of the
possibility of a strike against Iran a
lot of analysts including myself would
rate the chances of an Israeli strike as
being low to medium before the election
and one issue is that the United States
does not want Israel to attack Iran
right now and there's really very little
appetite for a US military attack
against Iran given that we've been in a
state of war for more than 10 years in
the Middle East and given that a
military strike against Iran could have
very many negative consequences for us
influence in the Middle East there's
really very little appetite for US
military action until November I would
be somewhat surprised if there is
military conflict with Iran because I
think for the next five months we'll
still be in this process of let's give
sanctions time let's give negotiations
time they're not going well but we can
schedule more negotiations perhaps I
think whoever becomes president in
November is going to face the same
constraints with Iran whether he or she
is whether he is a Democrat or a
Republican if we look at the Obama
administration's policies toward your on
there really a continuation of the Bush
administration's policies in terms of
ratcheting up sanctions but also
pursuing a path of engagement with Iran
to solve the crisis peacefully there
have been some voices
in the United States calling for strikes
against Iran and for some observers and
commentators and analysts this may
remind them of the situation in Iraq in
2003 when we invaded Iraq a lot of
people believe that the u.s. didn't
really consider all its options that we
move too quickly toward military
conflict and then we'll find the same
path regarding around but I think the
situation is very different than 2003
because there's a real reluctance a lot
of opposition to the israelian US
military strike against Iran but I think
at some point because the Obama
administration has said that its
policies not to contain a nuclear-armed
Iran but to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran
if the talks collapse then we could find
ourselves in a situation where we have
to consider military strikes against
Iran thank you the question I have is
how strong is the evidence that West's
intelligence services have that syriza
weaponizing current one and two their
Iranian nuclear program and the context
for the question is that the bar for the
evidence must be yes really really high
because you saying their leadership
Iranian leadership is denying that I'll
try it that there's no public support
for a potential weapon as a nuclear
program and giving the historical
background of the United States getting
and having it so wrong and in Iraq you
were just I just barely ten years ago so
how strong is he added on speed have
that the reefs weapons ation is going on
that's a great question I the bar is
high like you said because of the
mistakes that were made in Iraq the
United States invaded and occupied Iraq
on the assumption that Iraq was
developing weapons of mass destruction
and that was not the case so I think the
US intelligence community has been very
cautious about characterizing the
Iranian nuclear program because of the
experience in Iraq but when we look at
the Iranian program yes Iran has a right
to enrich uranium
for energy purposes for civilian
purposes but you can make the argument
the very strong argument that Iran does
not need this big of an infrastructure
why enrich so much uranium when Iran
doesn't have existing plants nuclear
plants there's one Iranian nuclear plant
in Busia and the Persian Gulf I was
built by the Russians and it is under
Russian safeguard the Russians are
providing the fuel for Bashar so the
uranium Bing being enriched in Iran
right now will not be used in Bushehr
Iran claims it's building additional
plants for the enrichment but logically
it should build the plants first and
then enrich uranium so that creates a
lot of suspicion regarding Iran's
intentions and Iran did not declare its
facilities in 2002 they were revealed at
Bayern Iranian opposition group called
the mko the Mujahideen ahaab
organization it's widely believed that
Israel provided the intelligence to the
mko so they could reveal it to the
public in 2002 so Nats hands the main
enrichment facility that has been placed
under ground was not declared in 2002 it
was publicly revealed and so that raised
a lot of suspicions in terms of Iran's
intentions according to that
international atomic energy agency in
its latest report a few months ago it
details reported Iranian experiments
with weaponization and it's very
detailed report I encourage you to read
it if you're interested in the factual
evidence but there's a lot to suggest
that Iran does have a parallel nuclear
weapons program that is not destroying
them enrichment but that it is working
on nuclear warhead designs and working
on a missile that could carry nuclear
weapons so when you add all this up then
you have a good argument for Iran
developing some sort of nuclear weapons
capability i think the bar is high and
we should be careful on how we judge the
evidence and i think
skepticism and doubt is important when
you make these sort of decisions because
they have such major national security
implications but at the same time the
Iranian regime is doing a lot to make us
suspicious and it's not a laying our
fears it's exacerbating them a very
close to full automation do you think
this bar has been met so far for such
evidence for the military attack by the
West against Iraq yeah unfortunately or
maybe fortunately a lot of the
information on the Iranian nuclear
weapons program is classified and the
reports provided to the IAEA have come
from IEA countries and the Iranian
regime has said well these are
fabricated that whatever country is
making these accusations to the AE has
political motives and that may be the
case to some extent but I think there's
enough circumstantial evidence that has
been revealed publicly to suggest that
Iran is after at least a virtual nuclear
weapons capability again that doesn't
mean that the Iranian leadership has
made the decision to weaponize the
program but it is building the
capability to do so i'll give you one
really good example so iran's has built
a new enrichment facility that is inside
a mountain and it can't be destroyed by
conventional bombs the US would have to
use perhaps dozens of bunker busters
it's called a massive ordnance
penetrator that would drill into the
mountain and destroy the facility and
Israel does not have the capability to
destroy the Mountain facilities called
Fordo it's near the holy city of Qom in
iran so therefore the israelis believe
iran is reaching the zone of immunity
that when it reaches the zone that
conventional attacks can't damage the
program say this planet itself it's a
cause for anxiety and iran says well
it's using this plant the mountain side
plant to enrich uranium but to twenty
percent for medical purposes but it ron
has surpassed
the need for this much uranium that's
enriched up to twenty percent so why
would you have a civilian program that
is inside a mountain basically
surrounded by anti-aircraft weapons so
do it mean there's really no smoking gun
I can't bring a document to you and say
Iran's supreme leader has signed off on
a nuclear weapons capability we don't
have that we perhaps we'll never have
that but I think there's enough evidence
to suggest that as working towards this
capability another the law question talk
to build up on giving circumstantial
evidence but even assuming the worst
fears that the United States and the
West have to work intentions and nuclear
capability of Iran so giving all the
worst here that that we have here what
is their direct danger to United States
itself even Douglas that's and that's a
great question i'll start with israel
first the israelis are particularly
worried that iran would develop a
nuclear weapons capability and would
really deter them from undertaking
military actions in the region that
would basically promote their national
security so right now Israel is a
strongest conventional and nuclear
military power in the region it doesn't
want any other states to have that
capability Hezbollah to the north is on
Iranian ally the Israelis are worried
that if Iran develop this sort of
capably they couldn't fight Hezbollah on
their own terms basically so it
constrains Israeli behavior and ability
in their region they're also Israelis
worried that the Iranian regime is I
don't think this is the case but its
messianic that it's irrational and that
if it develop a nuclear weapons
capability or nuclear weapons for that
matter it would nuke Israel and Iran's
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has talked
about wiping Israel off the map there's
some argument over the translation of
what he said but regardless Islamic
Republic as a political system as
opposed to Israel and Iranian leaders
have consistently said that
Israel is a passing phenomenon so this
creates a lot of anxiety in Israel's a
small countries vulnerable so those are
the threats to Israel I made our major
ally in the Middle East in terms of the
threat to the United States I don't
think the worry is so much that Iran
would nuke US forces in the region but
that an Iranian nuclear weapons
capability would make Iran more
assertive in the region specially the
Persian Gulf that Iran would start
bowling around regional countries and
given the situation in the Middle East
since 2003 the sense of competition
between Iran the United States has
really increased the Ronettes become
more influential in Iraq and Afghanistan
and for a while look like it was in some
ways d major power in the Middle East
setting things that changed quite a bit
in the last few years but the worry is
that you're on will become more
assertive and then basically it will
achieve its ultimately perhaps stated
goal of pushing the US out of the region
and they'll use this nuclear weapons
capability to core coerce or allies
especially the Arab countries of the
Persian Gulf but also ultimately Iran
developing nuclear weapons would really
undermine the NPT which is one of the
foundations for global security if the
rest of the world sees that Iran has
undermined the NPT n bend the rules and
develop this capability than other
countries may be enticed to develop
their own capabilities so the
proliferation risk is also great
especially in the Middle East if you
want develop and develops a nuclear
weapons capability then countries like
Saudi Arabia Egypt Turkey may also
consider their own a nuclear weapons
capability some Saudi officials have
said they will develop a capability of
Iran does so it's not guaranteed but
there's a risk and I think the greatest
danger is of Iran has nuclear weapons
and Israel has nuclear weapons and
there's ever any sort of conflict
between the two countries or their
allies or proxies in the region this
could escalate into nuclear war and Iran
and Israel do not have direct
communications with each
they're so it's not like the Cold War
where we could communicate with the
Soviets and pick up a phone and talk to
them that doesn't exist and that really
I think increases the chances of an
inadvertent nuclear war if Iran develops
as capability so giving all that
wouldn't just explain how unjustified
Iranian leadership being rational mmm
according to you how justified they are
to believe that it is about United
States and the rest of the west of
changing their government let's it this
is an explicitly US policy toward Iran
we don't have an explicit policy of
regime change toward Iran but if I place
myself when they are on inside we're
doing a lot to undermine the regime
sanctions not only have the effect of
destroying around four weaponizing the
program they're hurting the regime there
are increasing internal instability so
the Iranian regime is convinced that the
u.s. is after the overthrow of the
regime and you can't really blame them I
think comedy on that issue has a right I
don't think the US wants overthrow the
regime but there are a lot of people in
this country and abroad especially in
the Middle East and within Iran that
want the regime to ultimately go away
and be replaced by more pro-american
regime so I think when it comes down to
this the issue is not just a nuclear
program in the nuclear crisis it is this
competition between two diametrically
opposed forces in the Middle East the
United States and the Islamic Republic
how has a spring affect the u.s. foreign
policy and is a beneficial or
detrimental to us I think it's both it
before their uprisings we supported
authoritarian Arab regimes like Hosni
Mubarak's regime in Egypt and a lot of
our influence was based in these on
these authoritarian regimes but in the
past year and a half the situation in
the Middle East has changed so much
popular politics
and public opinion is very important now
so we can't just base all our influence
and access on the middle east on these
regimes that are on staple for example
just I think yesterday was a Sunday just
yesterday the Muslim Brotherhood
candidate in Egypt was declared to be
the president Morsi his name is and I
think the u.s. actually encouraged the
Egyptian military to allow Morsi to
become president there were some
indications that they would go back on
the elections and install their own
candidate the former Prime Minister
shafiq and the Egyptian military has
also dissolved parliament so it looks
like that there's a counter-revolution
going on in Egypt and the Egyptian
military's rolling back a lot of the
reforms so I think it was right for the
United States to emphasize that the
Egyptian military should let the
democratic process play out because
going forward I don't think the United
States can just rely on these
authoritarian regimes when it comes to
Iran specifically I think there's been a
hesitation on the US side not to
pressure Iran on human rights issues
specifically because we want to reach a
negotiation and the settlement with the
regime there has been as a hesitation to
emphasize human rights for example I
would argue that we should emphasize
human rights toward Iran and toward the
other countries in the Middle East the
broader broader Arab world and that
human rights should become a central
focus of u.s. foreign policy because a
lot of things have changed in the Middle
East if we're seeing as basically
supporting the old order in the Middle
East this will have a lot of negative
consequences for our influence in the
region this will be kind of off topic
and you can skip if you want but but
what does Iran think of Syria right and
what would Iran do if
there was a intervention in Syria it's
not off topic I don't I think it's
actually central to the major issues in
the Middle East Syria's Iran's major
ally in the region and its really the
gateway of Iranian influence to the Arab
world specially the Levant Lebanon if
Bashar al-assad falls in Iran loses a
lot of influence of the region its
physical access to Hezbollah the main
hsieh party and Lebanon could be cut off
and essentially Iranian influence with
shrink and this is why Iran is
reportedly providing a lot of support to
the Assad regime in Syria it's giving
his regime advice on crushing protests
and the regime in Iran is good at this
because of its own experience in 2009 it
has reportedly provided the Syrian
regime technology to monitor the
internet and track the opposition it's
giving it major funding and also
Revolutionary Guards officers in Iran
have even admitted publicly and I think
accidentally that they're providing
military support to crush specific
uprisings in Syrian cities so Iran is
doing a lot in Syria because it doesn't
want to see its major ally overthrown
and it's on the same side of Russia and
China in this matter Russia and China
have their own reasons for supporting
the Bashar al-assad regime but you have
Russia China and Iran on one side and
then the US the Arab our Arab allies
European countries on the other so I
think it's a very interesting situation
it just shows that there is this major
divide between Eastern powers if you
want to call them and a lot of the
Western powers one last question if I
may so I'm beyond I guess rhetorical
statements that Iran has made about
supporting
they're well supporting those who rose
up for the Arab Spring what sort of
substantive things has Iran done too I
guess support those who have raised up
not a lot besides Syria which Iran is
actively aiding iran hasn't been able to
do very much for example when the
uprisings in Bahrain took place Bahrain
is a Shia majority country and the Sunni
monarchy is viewed by the Shia's as
being repressive and the sonys in the
region especially Saudi Arabia but of
course but the Bahraini monarchy accused
the Shia and Baterina supporting of
receiving Iranian support when you talk
to a lot of Arab diplomats despite
really no evidence that claim Iran was
behind the battery an uprising I don't
think this is necessarily the case is a
local phenomenon but i think that
uprising a bearing with somewhat
embarrassing for the ryan regime because
they couldn't come to the back Rainey's
aid Saudi Arabia and the UAE ended up
sending troops to Bahrain to crush the
uprising and the only thing you Ron
really did was to offer rhetorical
support Khamenei and one of his speeches
I remember said if we wanted to we could
have interviewing which we chose not to
but Iran hasn't done very much I don't
think it is really capable of shaping
and directing the forces in the region
because of really the 2009 uprising in
Iran when the Iranian regime crush those
uprisings and killed dozens of Iranians
and arrested and tortured and executed
hundreds more the region's population
saw that the Islamic Republic was also
force of oppression like their own
regimes before Iran opposed Americans
supported regimes on the basis that it
was really the only independent
political system it wasn't beholden to
us imperial standards but in 2009 it
showed that really it wasn't very
different than a lot of these other
regimes and with the support of the
Syrian regime has shown that like a lot
of other
James that it criticizes it also
interferes with the Democratic
aspirations of the region's people so
the Iranian regime is not only a force
of oppression within its own country but
the region the broader reach and I think
this is really her disability to come
out as the winner of the Arab uprisings
I think it's one of the primary losers
with that I think we'll wrap it up thank
you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
