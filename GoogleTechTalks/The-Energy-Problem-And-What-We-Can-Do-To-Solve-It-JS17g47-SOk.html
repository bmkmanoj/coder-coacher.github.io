Steven Chu he's a directly director of
Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and
professor of physics and professor of
molecular and cellular biology at UC
Berkeley he has a long and distinguished
career working in physics research
including work on the cooling and
trapping of atoms using laser light for
which he shared the nobel prize in
physics in 1997 so please join me in
welcoming him he's going to talk about
the energy problem and what we can do
about it thank you I know you know you
all know that I'm not Larry Page but I
just have to share a little joke i just
gave a talk at the triple AAS meeting in
San Francisco and Larry Page and I were
the two keynote speakers and Larry
wanted to switch places so so so just to
tell the audience I he was supposed to
talk on saturday i was supposed to talk
on friday he wanted to switch places
with me so i just wanted to tell the
audience that i wasn't Larry Page that
Larry this is what Larry looked like and
and you can find by googling Larry you
get thirty two thousand images of Larry
in tenth of a second but having couldn't
resisting I wanted to compare myself to
Larry so I googled myself and so I get
150th the number of hits more than one
ten-thousandth of dollars so so so but
the reason is why was I there so Larry
had written me an email and and said I
want to switch places with you who knows
to keynote rebellious I'm speaking on
Saturday and you're on Friday night and
he wants to swap so I said why do you
really want to swap for several reasons
because i had a boot meeting at stanford
on saturday so i gently said dear like
thanks for the he gave my wife and I
ride to Davos and back and according to
you see rules i have to write them
check for the cost of to coach fare
tickets so it could fly in Google air as
for the requests while I'm willing to
switch this is a gentle hint there would
be a lot of people who were arranging
their schedules to hear you that would
be greatly disappointed to get me and he
didn't get the hint so he writes back if
it's all the same do i would love to
switch I'm sure people would be very
seeing you than me and so yes this
sounds like Larry you're saying yourself
and I'll get all the smart people who
want to go to your talk thanks so so I
said okay Larry if the triple-a s guys
can do it then it's ok with me this is
like two weeks before the thing and and
the key nostro you know three or four
thousand people and and it's all printed
up so then John whole-grain who is the
president of the triple-a s actually was
was very good so I checked overnight for
those in the triple-a s management whom
I considered have their oxen gorg have
been gored and in my position is that we
should do whatever is necessary to pull
the switch without dissent or
elimination very poetic but I think
there were some people angry at me and
so this is really the deflect the anger
to Larry so so with that let me let me
talk about something that I have become
not only very interested in but also
very concerned about and that's the
energy problem and so this is a bad news
in a good news i want to spend most of
the time talking about the good news
because the recent documentary Oscar
Award winner talked a lot about the bad
news it says Al Gore's movie but but i
think the energy hits in many sectors
it's intimately tied to national and
international security economic
prosperity and of course the environment
particularly climate change just one
little tidbit that you might not be
familiar with the United States spent
250 billion dollars importing fossil
fuel in 2005 in terms of the federal
budget this is encumbers like the
deficit that's 750 billion in terms of
the federal
there's only a couple of things that
exceed a couple of hundred billion
dollars that's Health and Human Services
Social Security Medicaid defense I think
there's not much else there's three or
four things and then after that it this
is this is number four or five so this
is a huge amount of money and in the
long term it will increase even more
because we're importing roughly sixty
percent of our oil and we're
increasingly importing more and more
natural gas so it's some economic
consequence I drove very very briefly
what is the evidence that the climate
change is caused by people now the IPCC
report says the probabilities between 90
and ninety-nine percent that the climate
change we're seeing is caused by humans
so where does that come from so this is
a sampling the red is that the actual
measurement of temperature and the hash
is a climate model where you fold in
volcanoes which change how much sunlight
is absorbed if you stick this particular
and sulfur dioxide in the air natural
causes solar variations anything that we
didn't cause you stick into the current
models and you find this gray hash that
doesn't seem to follow the red line
which is the measurement of the
worldwide average but if you stick in
what we know to have been caused by
humans since the Industrial Revolution
because the amount of co2 guns kind of
goes like that enjoyed shooting up the
amount of nitrous oxide methane caused
by the Industrial Revolution then you
start to get a reasonable fit so this is
suggestive that perhaps it's caused by
humans then then there are correlations
that we're beginning to notice this is a
correlation between in the Atlantic
Ocean the severity of hurricanes and
Atlantic and the temperature of the
water in the Atlantic it's not just the
correlation because below a certain
temperature of ocean surface temperature
you won't get a hurricane and so we
understand a little bit of the physics
of what actually feeds these hurricanes
but
this correlation is i would say seventy
percent probable that the correlation is
real it's not 99 percent because you can
imagine putting up hog future prices and
other things that might not be directly
correlated with hurricanes and you could
get some similar things because if you
notice it's only this last little tidbit
that's indicative of something ok so
again suggestive not proof and so the
great concern that i've had over the
last four or five years is really what's
going to be happening to our predictions
of climate change and and so i have to
remind you of something the greatest
american philosopher of the 20th century
said about this that's Yogi Berra and he
said many wise things but he said in
this particular case predictions are
hard to make especially about the future
and so the prediction you just saw of
climate change over the last 150 years
is predicting the past and as we go
forward we need to get more more
refinements on what happened in the past
because that is a good warm-up to
predicting the future so but there are
predictions there are predictions of
increased damage with floods and storms
population displacement a combination of
the sea level rise and the increased
severity of storms it's not just the
slow cville sea level rods that we're
afraid of it's it's that combination and
so you want to imagine if Louisiana and
particularly New Orleans gets Hut hit
with another category 4 hurricane in the
next five years well there will be
serious questions about whether you want
to rebuild given those predictions
there's all sorts of things increased
species extinction diseases that are
depend on temperature and moisture
things like malaria dengue fever and
other things the malaria specially is
predicted to rise to the death to the
malaria are predicted to rise due to
climate change
because a lot of towns villages whatever
are trying to stay just out of the
mosquito belt so these are all sorts of
things but I want to talk about one
prediction that hasn't actually gotten
that much discussion yet but it's
increasing and that is a water shortage
so this is a paper taking from the
proceedings National Academy of Sciences
2004 and it takes to climate models be
one is a very unaware miss clément
model you have aggressive control of
carbon dioxide emissions you reduce them
and you see what's going to happen a one
is a business as usual which means a one
percent increase in energy efficiency /
GDP but no real attempt to control
carbon dioxide emission okay and so this
is what's predicted to occur in
California in this century in the least
one of the least most lease alarmist
models thirty to seventy percent
decrease in the snowpack 50 75 percent
decrease in Alpine subalpine forests so
this these two are a major part of our
water sort you know as you know it rains
beginning around October to mid-march
and then after that it doesn't really
rain much if at all and so the snowpack
and the moisture captured in the forest
and the snowpack is a major part of the
water storage is not just the dance and
it's that slow delivery of water over
the next several months that helps us
with our water supply so those of you
remember droughts where the decrease in
snow pack was twenty or thirty percent
for two years in a row I had some nieces
and nephews there were little toddlers
that were told not to flush toilets even
number two and for two years and they
had to break him of that habit several
years later that's a trivial thing I
don't know what we like if we're missing
fifty percent of our snowpack in and
continuous basis and that's the that's
the mid-range the least alarmist model
or one of the lease alarmist models and
and the more alarmist means that you you
have to migrate from California all
right at the very least you secede from
the Los Angeles area which usually
brings applause in Northern California
this is not only true in California this
is also true worldwide this is the
average glacial thickness change per
year so now it's roughly of scale meter
decrease per year worldwide and as you
see it's accelerating this is the the
solid lines the integrated decrease in
snow particularly worrisome is the
Tibetan snow and glacial range if you
will and it supplies ten of the largest
river basins roughly half the world's
population gets some of its water from
this from these river basin so this
includes most of Pakistan the Ganges and
all the river basins in India the Yellow
River the Yangtze River in China all
supplied by the steady melting of
glaciers and snow in the Himalayas and
so this is actually more than a meter
per year now of melt the Yellow River in
northern China is now sometimes running
dry in the summer and China is now
thinking of shipping water north by via
aqueducts but the whole water supply
system again is threatened because
because it's the slow steady melt that
is a lot of the water storage this has
not gotten that
now he's coming so Larry you miss all
the jokes about you so anyway so so so
these are some of the issues that I
think in fact the water storage and the
water supply problem is I'm guessing one
of the things that will hit home
earliest in terms of the economic and
social impact but we'll see again it's
prediction there's another thing you
should know about if you don't already
know about it suppose this is the co2
emission and suppose in the next couple
of decades we actually get hold of it
and then greatly decrease it what will
happen we sequester that co2 from
natural causes from natural processes
and the answer is we don't really know
this is one prediction so so what
happens is a burp of co2 sits there and
continues to integrate and then then you
see this slightly gentle decrease this
is due to natural sequestration
processes and the land in the ocean that
eventually lead to mineralization of the
carbon or a long-term sequestration
either in some Tundra or quite frankly
in fossil fuel deposits like cold the
debate is whether this natural process
is a few hundred years time constant or
a few thousand years it's not going to
happen in 20 years or 50 years okay so
that's the debate so what we do today
and for this century will could have
lasting impact unless we figure out some
very clever way of economically sucking
the co2 out of the atmosphere as well so
something to think about so as as this
co2 is up there and slowly beginning to
be sequestered the temperature will
continue to rise the reason the
temperature is still rising is because
there's a lot of deep ocean mixing and
there's the oceans a huge capacitor and
in fact the general feeling consensus
among the climate modelers the is that
we have about point six point seven
degrees centigrade today
even if co2 emissions dropped to zero
tomorrow so then there's still glide
upward so those are things we should be
concerned about so I think the dual
strategies we've got to maximize energy
efficiency use it in a smart clever away
and not waste it and of course develop
new sources of energy California has
over the last 30 or so years been
essentially flat in its energy
electricity consumption per person the
rest of the United States if you take
away California which is 11 or so
percent of the population has gone up by
sixty percent and so and then california
is now wanting to drop this down but but
in any case there is an example in
existence proof that the economy doesn't
really have to be killed if you use
energy more efficiently there there's an
inflection point here there was a
high-energy physicist at Lawrence
Berkeley Lab and also UC berkeley art
Rosenfeld who was a Rico Fermi's last
student a very distinguished high-energy
physicists in the first oil crisis in
the 70s he said he just completely left
physics and said what can I do to help
with the energy problem and he decided
the best thing he could do was to help
in energy efficiency and a lot of ideas
flowed out of art grabbed by others this
is one thing that art did personally he
went into an appliance store and noticed
that refrigerators could vary by factors
of 2 and 4 in energy efficiency for the
same size refrigerator and the same cost
so you don't have to be a refrigerator
expert to realize that it the first
factor of 2 is for free and so what he
did is he then convinced California to
put in increasing refrigerator standards
of efficiency first labeling voluntary
labeling Energy Star efficiency type of
labeling then but then increasing
a nerds so this blue line is the call
the energy consumption of refrigerators
it's gone down by a factor of roughly
four and a half since the middle 70s
meanwhile the size of refrigerators has
gone up from the average size of 18
cubic feet to 22 cubic feet it's
asymptotically approaching what you can
get inside of a standard kitchen door
and the cost of the the
inflation-adjusted cost of refrigerators
initially when the manufacturers were
faced with this is so no no no this is
going to be terrible there cause the
refrigerators and double all this other
stuff and what happened was it actually
went down by more than a factor too now
one of the surprising things is why did
the efficiency increase a couple years
before the standard it's because
industry was warned the standard was
coming so after they stopped trying to
fight it they started thinking this is
also true of the Clean Air Act for
sulfur dioxide nitrous oxide emissions
after they stopped trying to fight it
for a decade or two they started
thinking the cost was a very very small
fraction of what they said it was and it
and and the electricity bills when i
think i'm not sure but I'm guessing you
know within five or ten percent of the
same so we see this over and over again
if we ever want to get a carbon cap and
trade or call us on this give them some
time and then give them a 15-year ramp
up but you just get got to get rid of
the loopholes
oh the lawyers are always more money
without a doubt okay and and in the long
run the it's not only that the full cost
if you include all the health it costs
the the cost of Agriculture and force
and Fisheries the acid rain issues the
actually the acid rain also rots out the
infrastructure bridges buildings roads
much faster if you fold in all those
costs it's it's it's like 110 or more
it's it's it's not even close and the
same is accepted with climate change it
sent a totally different scale and a
totally different cost but it's it's a
summer thing so now what what about
refrigerators this is a big deal or not
well this bar over here is what the
electricity consumption would have been
had we stayed with 1974 efficiency the
average efficiency and this is what
we're using today so this is the amount
of electricity saved even though we went
from 18 to 22 cubic feet so it's not
Adam you Nisshin and lifestyle I just
want to emphasize this this is often
confused this is all the electricity due
to hydro in the odd states this is
nuclear twenty percent of electricity
generation the United States just
refrigerators is some reasonable
fraction a couple percent three percent
of all of electricity there were less
spectacular gains but equally important
gains in in heating systems and HVAC
okay of scale fifty percent sixty
percent so efficiency is is really big I
want to emphasize that this is how we
consume energy in the United States
these two down here are what we spend in
energy in commercial buildings and
residential buildings in commercial
buildings seventy-five percent of this
energy is electricity it's not heat
transportation which gets a lot of
coverage is about twenty-seven percent
of the total energy need in the United
States so there's a lot more wasted here
than here actually
these are these are this is how much
energy per year that we heard this is
the distribution of you know transcript
oh no transportation this is all of
transportation trucks trains cars
airplanes and oh no no no no no no no no
this is this is these are separate lines
I got I understand the question out it's
not cumulative okay okay and things like
compact fluorescent light balls due to
electronic ballast so that is the energy
oscillates between the plasma and the
light bulb and it used to be a magnetic
field and a thing that was actually
invented suggested by our Rosenfeld and
that was developed at Berkeley Lab and
this is is beginning to transform
lighting in the United States because
you can get this is four or five times
less energy than incandescent and you
can depositors now look like they like a
lot of people don't like daylight they
like that red orange glow that's fine
you can actually make them for a little
bit more money you can get the red
orange glow of incandescent and slowly
wean yourself to daylight so this is
what's been happening this is a time
lapse picture of energy consumption
United States relatively flat in part
due to as a function of gdp so this is
yearly changes plotted as GDP per person
per capita and primary energy use per
person in this very funny unit billion
joules of energy per year and so we're
the price leader we're the richest and
we use the most energy and other
countries are catching up the European
countries are roughly a factor of 2 less
than us but Australia Canada or shooting
up and then the real question is what's
going to happen in India and China where
there are 1.3 and 1.1 billion people
respectively so we're about twenty five
percent of co2 emissions in the world
with 600 million out of the end the
denominator 6.5 billion but let me tell
you about this the units because
gigajoules per year is not a unit that
you're really
us too and in fact physicists don't
really know what that means so I decided
to convert into something that we all
understand now before the Industrial
Revolution the person's wealth is really
defined by how many servants or slaves
they had working for them right usually
it's none and and so that's a baseline
but if you gotta you know fifty servants
you're pretty wealthy and you can also
throw in the amount of cows and horses
and other things so so let's convert it
to that wealth and so while what's a
person consume well person consumes
roughly 2,500 calories per day 2000 to
sustain life three thousand of your real
athlete type and but you know just takes
a middle ground and so this corresponds
to a thousand energy servants per person
in the odd states that's why we actually
we enjoy a good standard of living we
have a thousand people working for us
the average person China has a hundred
okay now the rest of the world wants to
get to a thousand let's say in and is
this actually possible so I did a low
calculation now the peak population in
the world is now predicted be something
on the order of 10 billion people this
is incredibly good news within this
century and maybe slightly into the next
century the population will peak and
then start to decline not folding in
some gross calamity just just natural
stuff is happening what's the natural
stuff well I don't really know but it's
been observed that when societies or
within a particular society when people
get richer they have fewer kids my
personal theory is that it's because of
late-night-tv but but that's speculative
but in it but it cuts across all
cultures all sub segments in the United
States if you will and in the rest of
the world and so Europe for example has
negative growth and
and many countries in Europe are giving
tax incentives to have more kids and
it's the oh it's a developing countries
that are have lots of kids but as the
economic wealth continues to climb it is
now predicted and this number it
actually goes down with each succeeding
estimate so let's say we consume 10 to
12 kilowatts per person Europe contains
five six but suppose we get the
equivalent of three or four kilowatts
and current energy that's not to say we
should be puttering around in in
sweaters and things it's either getting
more efficient or getting energy sources
that less co2 emitting and either one
will do this okay so so this is point oh
four percent of the Earth's solar power
hitting the earth in order to give
everybody the same standard of living
that lets say the middle class enjoys in
Europe yes yeah yeah well within a you
know that I'm not going to quibble
thirty percent it doesn't really matter
okay but because you can quibble about
whether you want 400 energy servant or a
thousand or two ten thousand and so so
the I the idea here is can the u.s. get
down to here and Europe and Japan and
others want to get down here you notice
France is already almost down to there
because it's about seventy eight percent
nuclear okay so so this is not really
kind of crazy but but so but what we're
really afraid of his China is going to
follow in the odd States footsteps and
then and then they're going to decide
when they get about hear that oh my gosh
we should be down here for a lot of
reasons like economic prosperity because
you you know you want to consume energy
in a very efficient way whereas it's
going to it's going to take a lot more
work for the United States to get down
to here because we have an
infrastructure a city suburban sort of
thing that's a little bit different so
this is known in economic circles as the
kuzin its curve this is time advancing
society maturity whatever this is
anything you want to
be from number of kids per family to
mercury pollution to co2 emissions to
anything you want and the fundamental
idea is you're going you're up your
hairy area you're going higher and
higher you say oh my gosh the Industrial
Revolution is killing people right left
and center as it was in the late 19th
century in England in the US and then
you start to clean up the air and so the
question is can China and India be coast
to to leapfrog past these mistakes and
go to here and that's the sixty-four
dollar question if they don't we're in
deep doo-doo but it's to their advantage
so that's the good news so when I got to
Lawrence Berkeley Lab two and a half
years ago one of the reasons why I took
the job is well if we can get some of
our very best scientists and it's a
pretty good lab those who don't know
Lawrence Berkeley Lab it's just in a
site overlooking university California
Berkeley it's a National Lab it has a
budget of about a little over a half a
billion dollars a year it in its history
it's had 11 Nobel laureates but more
better than that is nine of them
actually did their work at the lab as
opposed to me and opposed to some of the
Ivy's who get the Nobel laureates after
they've done their noble Lord in fact
there's a couple of them who did their
Nobel Prize work before they were made
faculty members and then they say hmm
maybe we should make this guy professor
this happened a couple of times and a
whole bunch of National Academy members
that route and right now it has three
percent of the membership of the
National Academy Sciences at the lab so
we were thinking is it possible to
capture solar energy and convert it into
more useful forms of energy the most
valuable form of energy by far is
transportation fuel for this variety of
issues having to do with energy
independence it's the most costly form
of energy all sorts of things and
because of that you don't have to be as
good in order to get economic value you
can also perhaps create a new generation
of photovoltaic cells into electricity
once you have electricity there is a
energy storage problem of how you can
store it and then convert it back to
electricity on demand in an economical
way or whether you can convert
electricity in a much more economical
way to first split water make hydrogen
and then possibly go further to make
methane methane is good because once you
get methane it's a good feedstock for a
whole bunch of things from fertilizer to
plastics to everything or you can and
you can store it more easily than we can
hydrogen and we have a distribution
system natural gas pipelines and so they
know if you go so these are a variety of
ways in the long run one wonders whether
you can make artificial photosynthetic
systems that would ultimately be better
than nature now that is something that
while I have a lot of respect for nature
and these couple billion years of
engineering design testing redesign in
the end you're not as constrained as
nature is and the simple example I have
is that when people first wanted to
learn to fly they start to try to
imitate large gliding birds they would
strap wings to their arms they would
jump off a cliff and hope for the best
and even the Wright brothers first plane
the way it actually controlled his
flight was due to wing war p naught
flaps because there was a lesson learned
from birds of although their propulsion
had nothing to do with a bird you know
this propeller and in the end the 747s
actually do work better than Eagles in
terms of transporting people because
there are no longer constrained by
materials and everything else yeah but
to be fair 747s don't reproduce
well so but anyway they are better for
what we wanted them for and maybe maybe
we can develop a photosynthetic what is
photosynthesis is capturing sunlight in
making chemical energy and can we do it
better okay some targets for solar I
think there's a bruh flea a factor three
you need before most of people not the
more environmentally conscious people
but most people will think of slapping
it on the rooftop or where you would by
its very nature sticking on the rooftop
of a building because it's economical to
do that but you need about a factor of
10 I think before you it's wide scale
deployment why this factor of three it's
because right now you can sell
electricity back to the power companies
at retail costs until your your
electricity bill is zero but that's
about a factor of two and a half less
than it costs to generate the
electricity so that is a written that's
an underlying subsidy that you're asking
the power companies to buy back at
retail and and what it costs to
generated wholesales very different
because they don't have all the other
stuff the accountants the lawyers the
power lines probably in that order well
no the lawyers first then the parent so
so that's the other issue this is a huge
gain if we can get some sort of slope
and photovoltaic or solar thermal
doesn't really matter and it's not clear
what's going to win but in any case this
is how much of the desert land you would
need in order where it sits there's a
lot of cheap desert land and this is the
fraction you need to supply the current
electricity needs of the world at twenty
percent efficiency okay so there's a lot
of energy hanging around it's just a
matter of money at cost
we are thinking of well because we're
good at nanotechnology in the lab and in
Berkeley and so this is this is an ideal
let me just walk you through it you have
sunlight it absorbs it and creates
electrons and holes and one nanoparticle
can do to the absorption and the
creation of the energy in this
particular scale this is of scale 100
nanometers why hundred nanometers
because you can make nanoparticles like
can been selling nanorods that are
essentially perfect at that scale and in
this case the electrons and the holes
are differentiated by a conducting
polymer and a semiconductor nanorod
where you can maybe we know how to grow
these nanorods and can we slap
electrodes on them of the scale and the
real trick here is can you make multiple
interfaces with no losses here and if
you can do that you've got something
that's amenable to wet chemistry and
wheel the real process and so right now
these things are not aligned these
things where you do separate a
nanoparticle to absorb the sunlight
another one to conduct away but there
since they are not aligned there's lots
of losses there are only three or four
or five percent efficient you really
need to get up to fifteen or twenty
percent but the other part of its good
its cheap stuff and it's real to real
process and that's what you would really
need to get cheap not bad stuff batch
wait for stuff but really wheel the
wheel like printing newspaper another
area that we're focusing on is can you
create bioenergy and so recently it's
been announced that BP is selected the
University of California Berkeley Lab
and university Illinois to develop an
energy Biosciences Institute the idea
here is that you would have some plant
that would convert the basic ingredients
of sunlight co2 water nutrients into
biomass and that these plants can be
much improved so that they could use
much
more efficiently water sunlight
nutrients that could be drought
resistance so that you don't have to use
irrigation and pest resistant and then
the conversion of biomass into chemical
energy and this is where the economical
gain is right now it costs about two to
two and a half times more to convert
cellulose into ethanol than it does to
convert sugars or starches into ethanol
the basic idea is that sugars are
starches it's easy to break them down
into simple sugars and then you let this
5,000 year old process namely
fermentation do the rest of the work and
in order to break down the cellulose it
takes a lot more energy it takes a lot
more money mostly in the cause of
enzymes the average production of
agriculture in the world and the United
States has grown dramatically this is
coroner's by the way I'm not showing
this because I think corn is the right
solution it's definitely the wrong
solution but i'm just showing this to
let you know that breeding of corn in
this century has led to an Eightfold
increase in productivity per acre and in
the world about a two and a half fold
increase in pro give agricultural
productivity per acre where a lot of the
world isn't using modern agriculture yet
okay so so there is potential that's the
the world this is the population from
1952 2000 and this is what would have
been planted but this is what actually
was planted because of modern
agriculture so what is a better plant
well they would be grasses these are
grasses this is switchgrass but the
actual choice in the Midwest would
probably be a plan called miscanthus
this is a midget standing next to field
of grass no she's about actually in
truth these are foot markers and she's
not that tall she's about 53 she's a
graduate student of Steven long a
professor
who has taken this grass from a
botanical garden in Chicago and grown it
on uh negated unfertilized land it's a
perennial which means you planted and
then on harvest time you chop off the
top and since it's a weed next year it
grows with the same vengeance but you
didn't get the roots and because the
perennials you can actually get these
guys to think of getting into develop
symbiotic relationships with bacteria so
they fix a lot of their own nitrogen
actually sugarcane fixes a lot of its
nitrogen it's to as a perennial what so
this is an estimate if you had 15
million acres okay what is that where I
get that number from that's a lot of
land you saying United States that's the
amount we have 58 million acres in
officially listed as USDA as surplus
land which we pay farmers not to plant
in either long-range conservation plots
or year by year okay so this is excess
land okay and the estimate of using this
stuff is half tall of current u.s.
consumption of gasoline this the plant
on the right is remarkable it's two
percent efficient / growing season for
all the sunlight that hits the ground
that shows up as biomass above the roots
overall it's about seven percent
efficient if you consider everything
that is generating but let's say two
percent this is unimproved crop or an
unimproved weed if you will okay here's
an example of some improvements the
joint genome Institute which is run by a
Berkeley Lab and Livermore and in
partnership with these other
institutions that led actually by a
scientist at oakridge we have sequenced
the popular tree it's a very fast
growing tree it's got 45 thousand genes
roughly twice the number of genes of you
so just think about that it just means
that popular tree is more complex
yes and this is a modification of the
transcription factors in this tree so
under the same growing conditions it has
twice the amount of usable biomass which
woody stuff as the wild type and this is
just the beginning and they're actually
you can think of all sorts of things of
using modern biological methods to
promote long-term carbon sequestration
and all these other things okay so it's
actually the gene regulation was
actually related to human steroids so
you can say that this is a plant on
steroids okay so what's the deal why why
why isn't this commercially done today
at large scale so here's a picture of a
pine board or any cellulosic material
this is the stuff in the cell walls and
if you magnify this what you find these
cellulose microfibrils which if you
magnified at the molecular scale what
you ultimately see are simple sugars
fiber ring or six rings sugars strung
together in a long polymer but that's
not all in addition to the six ring and
five string ring sugars the cellulose
and hemicellulose and this is the
average breakdown in this weed
miscanthus is a stuff called lignin and
the lignin is a very complex set of
molecules of multiple rings that were
designed by a plant to actually protect
the plant and the cell wall from
attacked by microbes fungi bacteria
anything like that so it's a
self-defense mechanism and it's as
lignin that actually prevents us from
efficiently taking all the chemical
energy of this plant and converting
efficiently into ethanol and so this is
a pilot plant of a commercial ethanol
production from cellulose and it starts
either by steam explosion or hot acid
that this stuff's tries to separate the
lignin from the sugars after that that
you have to get rid of there let's say
the hot acid and then
and then you sprinkle a set of enzymes
that take the long polymers of these
sugars and break them up the simple
sugars the biggest costs are the cost of
the enzymes currently the second biggest
cause is the energy invested in order to
break this stuff down the verdict
ultimately this the verdict is not in
actually one wants to look at taking the
biomass drying it and turning to sin gas
and so I can't really say but but
there's they're just beginning of this
stuff that is it let me go back to the
most valuable form of energy is the
liquid fuel and so the syngas requires
another step if you're going to take
this thing gas pass it over steam turn
into hydrogen post water and burn it to
make electricity there's not enough
money in that yet
I think that this is the the syngas
route into methanogens into biofuels is
still more expensive I'm okay but this
is another thing that we're gonna be
looking at okay and other people are
going to be looking at okay so the
biggest causes the enzymes so can we get
better enzymes in fact right now what
they do is they take microbes and they
grow them and then they and then they
recover the enzymes from the microbes
and sprinkle it on the cellulose and
hemicellulose and Nova Simons and Jenna
core are the primary companies that do
this but it said the price has gone down
by an order of magnitude but it needs to
go down by another factor of two or
three in order to get a production costs
the same as production from sugarcane so
here's a critter who has some of the
right enzymes this is a termite this is
a multi-billion dollar industry to keep
them from eating your house but inside
the termite this is the gut or there's a
multiple gut of a termite there live up
to 100 microbes that actually break down
the woody material into a chemical fuel
that the term I could use and so the
relationship is that the bacterial
colonies actually have a little carrying
charge and they get a little bit of the
energy that past the restaurant to
determine with the instructions go get
me more wood you can extract this so
we're partnering with a small company
called diverse in Southern California
that is going and prospecting for
termites all over the world and they
bring them to the joint genome Institute
we sequence the bacteria and we find out
what these bacteria are doing and and
termites are different in different
parts of the world some of them are
really good wood eaters that can put the
ones you have in California to shame
and and so then how can you develop
microbes that have the mechanisms of
taking modest carrying charges and pass
the rest of the energy onto us now this
idea of understanding the genomes and
modifying the genomes of microorganisms
is something that sounds a little
strange but it's a new area called
synthetic biology so fundamentally what
this means is that you take not just one
gene and put it into an organism that
doesn't really belong in the organism
but you put in tens of genes and put it
into an organism one of the poster child
of synthetic biology is a cure for
malaria malaria kills about one and half
billion million people in the world
today but the protozoa that causes
malaria has become resistant to the
standard quinine based drugs so there
has been a new cure found called
artemisinin it's it can be extracted
from a plant that grows in Asia but it
small quantities and so there is an
artemisinin shortage worldwide now
because remember many many more people
are dying from malaria because the
quantum based drugs are ineffective and
in fact there's so much of a shortage
sadly that countries in particular China
have a a great counterfeiting scam going
on where they actually put in cornstarch
or whatever to mask for the drug the
real danger is sometimes they put in
trace amounts of the drug at a five or
ten percent levels so that a very simple
test can tell that there is some of the
drug in there and that's really bad
because that will encourage the protozoa
to morph into resistant dropper ZOA but
anyway this is a real serious problem
you want to drive the cost down and so J
Kiessling division director of physical
bioscience is a professor of chemical
engineering and chemistry at Berkeley
has taught both ecoli and yeast but to
grow this drug precursor that's Jay just
in case you want to know what he looks
like and this work out the eye of the
Gates Foundation and in January of 2005
they gave jay and a start pumping
designed just to deliver this drug to
third world countries what's given 42
million dollars to make it commercial
and so this was the milestone how do you
elucidate the pathway and cloning of the
genes that will make the drug the
functional genes and then productions at
higher and higher levels this is
milligrams per liter not grams and the
final one the the industrial goal was 25
grams of protein per liter this is this
arrow are the times where they've
achieved the milestone and they've
actually just passed this one so they're
ahead of schedule to deliver the drug at
20 cent secure to third world countries
and because its molecular biology and
yeast you won't be limited you can just
crank up amorous the company that was
given the grant they said you got to
deliver this drug at cost but any IP and
know-how along the way you can use for
whatever else you want that's the that's
the hook that gets top people into this
and already they've got first round
funding because the drug is a multi ring
hydrocarbon that is closely related to a
fuel and so now there's a huge
difference between fuel and a drug but
it the way these guys are going it's not
it jay says is within an order magnitude
okay so the idea here but then you can
talk about so what am i talking about it
consider what yeast does it takes simple
sugars and it turns into ethanol until
it gets to be about fourteen and fifteen
percent and the ethanol kills the east
so what you really want is you want a
critter that korea
it's not ethanol and you can breed yeast
that you know our alcohol resistant but
you really want something that that
creates you start with butanol which can
be mixed in any ratio with gasoline but
actually a heavier longer linear chain
hydrocarbon that at a certain fraction
like ten or twenty percent automatically
separates from water so it's a
continuous process okay and so we think
we can do this okay not yeast that's
5,000 year old technology and ultimately
I have to say that alcohol should be
drunk so although not in those
quantities okay so this is the
University of California Berkeley for
those of you who don't know that's the
famous stadium there's a grove of oak
trees where people are camped out so you
never mind and up here is Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab and so next to a
new nano technology building that costs
87 million dollars to make and it has a
20 million dollar budget next to the
National Center for electron microscopy
which will have within three years an
electron microscope which has enough
spherical aberration correction so you
can have genuine atomic resolution not
rows of atoms but genuine half angstrom
resolution where you sit at the focal
plane so instead of getting a computer
reconstruction of different miss focuses
that you get out the spherical
aberration you consider the focal plane
which means you can take movies of
nanoparticles and crystals growing in
defects movie at atom by atom scale and
by tilting your sample you get Adam
tomography so we have that facility we
have arguably the most productive
synchrotron facility in the world
certainly in the soft x-ray but also in
protein protein crystallography even
though it wasn't designed for that we
have a molecular material science
building so we want to stick 160 million
dollar building there where where the
the plant biology guys the molecular
biologists the solar guys
photovoltaic guys and everybody else
could be in this building so that's
going to be the site over here so so
how's fundraising coming well we have we
have a good start so we raised a half a
billion from BP over ten year period we
got 70 million from the state of
California for the building the
University of California is agreed to
put in use general revenue bonds so we
can get tax-exempt bonds at five and
half percent to get 60 million we've so
far raised it's a little more than this
but a scale 15 million from private
donors and already 4 million to start
the research in in this year 2007
because we were because we're waiting
for the federal stuff to come in there's
one renewable energy chair there's
actually I just had another chair so so
and we're going to be applying for a 125
million dollar over five-year grant from
the department of energy for the bio
part and and we hope that this is a
start we're not going to get the 15
million because that happens to be all
the money the department energy wants to
spend on material science for fiscal 08
but we're hoping to get half or third of
it but we're worth it but we've applied
for all of it but hopefully and this
mood is rapidly swinging in the country
that this month this type of money will
ratchet up to two quite frankly it
should be about a billion dollars a year
in energy research in the United States
and then we're talking with private
foundations and we're actually trying to
get industrial partners not only for the
money but this is very different because
because it's not academic research
academic research what do you do you
write a bunch of papers and you make
sure that those bunch of papers will get
you funding for the next cycle of three
or five years and and then after you
write the papers you go to the next
thing because what you're really trying
to do is to become famous this is
different you're trying to solve a
problem but it's a problem
of industrial strength and in order to
solve this problem you need much more
than just getting personal Fame and and
the scaling is going to be a couple
orders of magnitude and that makes it
very different so we need industrial
partners at the get-go the Los Alamos is
a multi scale operation that got very
bright young people this is one person
was put in charge of a theory section
when he was in his mid-20s that's
Richard Feynman so sitting amongst
Enrico Fermi and Oppenheimer and others
so there's also the need to identify
young talent and give them resources
early not to wait until they're 40 or 50
or 60 especially 50 or 60 this is a
place where I worked for nine years that
also had a knack for giving young talent
resources and and in the invention for
example the transistor this is the first
transistor you think of these guys who
got the nobel prize for the invention of
the transistor but in actual fact there
had to be fundamental breakthroughs and
material science in theoretical physics
and experimental physics and a basic
understanding of many many things that
required a bunch of groups working and
communicating with each other so it only
took nine years from the discovery that
two semiconductors can act as a diode
and they said we think we can make a
transistor to the announcement of the
transistor and then the following ten
years or so much of the foundations of
the semiconductor world were laid at
Bell Laboratories this does not happen
in academia on that timescale so the
idea here is that we would like to
gather up the talent and the structure
to do this and I just wanted this also
is in the DNA of Lawrence Berkeley Lab
this last year's Nobel Prize was given
to George Smoot and John Mather Mather
was a graduate student at Berkeley Lab
in Berkeley George Smoot entered as a
postdoc he became in charge of the
project that led to his Nobel Prize when
he was 32 another great discovery that
the universe is now expanding but it's
accelerating as it expands the
this is a million-dollar prize this is
another international prize these are
precursors to this one and he he started
a group that ultimately captured several
members of the National Academy of
Sciences but he was the leader of the
group in his early middle 30s so so this
is what we're trying to do we're trying
to capture what happened in the Los
Alamos what happened in Bell Labs what
happened in high-energy physics and is
still happening today at Berkeley Lab
but to transfer over that to material
science and biology which is much more
individual based and so if we can do
that then we've got something and if we
can get the money that that's what you
need you need the the raw talent you
need an organizational structure that
allows individual genius to assemble a
team and for management to give them the
resources they can go fly and not write
a proposal that takes too long and bell
labs we didn't write proposals we went
to and often said I got an idea and we
talked about the idea than in there and
so this is another issue so you know if
this happens we would like something
that keeps the climate here the way it
is and keeps the lights on so with that
thank
I'll take questions its climate climate
change is very different it in the seven
in the mid 80s when the price went down
to twenty dollars a barrel you know all
that all the new technologies that were
being developed just went out of
existence this is different if you the
cost the final cost of the climate
change you pick your favorite whether
it's no water to drink or irrigate your
crops or huge millions of people being
displaced from areas like Bangladesh or
Florida or Louisiana for you know just
go down the list of things there are
going to be huge economic costs by the
way and it hasn't escaped people's
attention that even for the remaining
conventional oil there's there's you
know there's all sorts of people
positioning to have access to
conventional oil and and and that shapes
a lot of the foreign policy it I gave a
talk in them at a meeting of finance
ministers in China about a year ago
taxable fiscal policy regarding energy
and I said well I think it's no secret
that china is modernizing its army so it
can guarantee access to energy and
everybody went like this right it's not
that you can invade it's just the
presence it's like part of the reason
why we have Navy that's a part of the
cost and so regards to what you think of
the current temporary situation in the
long term gaining access to energy and
natural gas and oil are increasingly
defining points in in the geopolitical
world these are all costs
high energy physics question no question
is what are the relative energy costs of
tracking oil into kerosene versus
gasoline I don't know the other one is
have you had a chance to evaluate who's
hard people work partly and I was
discussing with people Google for I
don't know an hour an hour half and its
continuing and let me just say so far
there's not enough information so i can
give an evaluation of the probability
that might work or not but i'm trying to
get more information I've talked to them
a little bit yeah
50 of the songs power
point oh four yeah its enactment of
recent upper lower the temperature here
why would that you take it yeah you'll
door bit you rerouted and you release
the energy and some so I think it's net
balance reflectors to to generate
electricity from heat how does what's
right there's actually several things
because variance of this there are
parabolic trough reflectors that that
take you know the loose oh okay there is
this releasing for air at the height of
the chimney like to have blood warming
in fact okay just off the top of my head
I'm saying that it's a net you know
there's a net input of energy from the
Sun and then what happens is there's a
radiation of the heat so we're in quasi
equilibrium you absorb energy you reread
it to space and in the form of infrared
radiation that's why this greenhouse gas
stuffs right it reflects the heat and so
you get a little warmer here and so
anything that generates heat is more or
less going to be the same you're going
to get some radiation through through
the water vapor through any greenhouse
effect and it gets rear ated so it that
stuff is just on the growth scale it
doesn't really change anything back to
biofuels we've been hearing for a while
about how not great core it is and how
potentially great wheatgrass is where
switchgrass these other materials could
be is there a funding shift of policy
shift Pacific that's going along with
this is that not happening yet I mean I
know there's a lot of invested interest
in the agricultural industry to keep
things in car in it certain states or
interests out actually no I would say
the farmers will switch very rapidly
every year they make a decision and what
drives the farmers is so it's not it's
not that it's really the cost right now
the farmers don't have a market if they
want to switch grass or myths Cantus
because there are commercial it's not
industrial strength commercially viable
mechanism for giving cellulose into at
so that's why I talked about this factor
of two and a half there are pilot pens
going up there are new technologies that
they're going to be a few pile plans to
invest in the next three or four years
of improved technology to break the
cellulose down once you've got that
going these pile plants that can take
the cellulose then the farmers it's one
season they would actually prefer
growing weeds why because you don't have
to till the soil for 10 or 15 years that
means the huge capital investment in in
diesel fuel and fertilizer its its its
110th to know fertilizer irrigation
costs go down so the capital investments
go way down for the farmer and so even
if they get the same return or eighty
percent of the return on the crop they
don't have to bet the farm or half the
farm every year to put in these huge
capital medicines they would love to do
this also by the way the agriculture not
safe is not sustaining now the water
tables going down in the Midwest as more
farmers begin to use irrigation the
nitrate run offs are huge there's 100
the soil erosion of a grass a c4 grass
like miscanthus or switchgrass than corn
there's all sorts of reasons why you
never want to use corn in the long run
or even the mid run for growing energy a
lot of state politicians and a lot of
certain organizations that are still
pushing money towards the corn ethanol
solution and I guess I'm wondering why
why why is that not shifting towards oh
I would guess yeah people like Archer
Dan leurs Midlands are doing that but
I started talking to farmers there you
know and and they feel very differently
i think the it's more right now there's
a technology that has a market and so as
soon as you establish a technology
biorefineries that the way they have a
market they will start switching very
rapidly all right look that I the US
government noses at USDA do II and the
president actually knows that this is
just a transition you want immediately
switch as quickly as you can is is you
know there's not that much difference in
co2 emission from burning gasoline as
their from producing corn but there
could be a factor of 10 from cellulose
so so you know there's huge game and and
the product could oh yeah productivity
per acre corn is 252 maybe 350 gallons
per acre of ethanol / growing season and
Miss Cantus at 20 dry tons per acre not
the 26 in that field you saw will give
2,000 gallons per acre the yields are
higher the soil Rosen's let everything
is better it's just get better enzymes
get better treatment design the plan so
it's easier to break down we can
genetically alter the ratio of lignans
so you covered twice as much sugar we
already know this we now are thinking of
trying to alter the lignin so there are
attack points so that we can design
microbes to break down the lignin and
separate the lignin actually is a very
high fuel hydrocarbon that you can think
of syngas type stuff or or using it to
burn to power a biorefinery it's you
know they actually the you had no
exactly this is why it's so exciting you
know exactly in the next three or five
years in the next ten years where you
want to go that you have a reasonably
good probability that you can transform
the whole process that's why BP and
dupont and others are investing that
kind of money
it's it's not a you know wild Willy
dream either
okay all right thank you
