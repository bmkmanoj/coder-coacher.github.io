pleased to welcome this morning dr.
Steve Heller and dr. steve stine both
from NIST and they will be discussing
with us this morning the Enshi project
the international chemical identifier
project and discussing with us chemical
structure as the key to chemical data so
we'll be bringing up dr. Heller first
thank you that's a delight to be here
and we're going to break this talk into
two pieces the first one will sort of be
an overview of what's going on I guess I
there are three of us working on the
project myself steve stine and Demetria
Jeff's coy Dimitri does about 99% of the
work Steve does the other point nine and
and I'm sort of the salesman and
marketing and so forth and they've been
very successful accept the fact that
we're giving us a way is open source has
really reduced my royalties to 20 what
we have here is this open source project
which is to uniquely represent chemical
structures in both public and private
databases which is something that is not
possible at this point in time with
anything else the project was originally
proposed in the year 2000 approved by
you pack which is the International
Union for pure and applied chemistry in
2002 you pack is the organization
probably everyone knows it is the one
that names chemical elements it also has
a nomenclature for the names of
chemicals which is sort of 18th 19th
20th century sort of thing and we're
talking about the 21st century where
everything is computer readable and
computer understandable or we hope and
sustainable and the first version of
Vinci was released a little over a year
and a half ago what we'd like to do is
work with Google and have inches
properly indexed on the web for the
users to be able to easily search four
inches using google we want to work with
Google because Google is a verb and
everyone would prefer to start with I
think something like this then the
current ways are doing it give you some
idea about who's using it and Steve will
go into more details later there a whole
bunch of people doing structured roaring
programs
and so it's becoming pretty much
mainstream in terms of the chemical
community being able to access it people
doing structure search works and might
be M people down few miles down south
and almaden are working on an internal
project to process patents and search
those very large US government national
institutes of health project called
pubchem through kynect chemistry with
biological data uses this the National
Cancer Institute at NIH uses it
companies lights IT chick and
accelerates use it for their analysis
software as a way to exchange things
because this was the only readily
exchangeable format that they could come
up with a lot of people have been using
it for file into conversions there is
also some other software molecular
matrix and some chemical scripting tool
kits a variety of databases around the
world now are starting to use it the
second one the pubchem is is used by
about 30,000 people a day the fourth was
sorry the third sard second one the
pubchem third one the NCI has now grown
to a database of about thirty nine
million structures and is the largest
collection of inches or structures
certainly anything available publicly
and as you can see there's somewhat over
a dozen of very large companies that are
using it including two that are here
today this here the seminar prow science
and Cambridge soft a couple of
information resources about how to use
in chi and frequently asked questions
about in chi and in a sense sort of
second to searching on Google the
scientific journals are beginning to
incorporate google in chi into their
journal articles and over time i think
that this is going to be one of the most
important ways to get everyone to be
using it on a regular basis since there
is nothing being used right now in
chemical journals that across the entire
board this chemistry central which is an
open source project going out of london
england biomed central prowl science
their journal on drugs of the future
which is a
in very useful journal starting in
January is going to be incorporating the
entry into their each of their issues
and articles and reviews in drugs in the
future and lastly the Royal Society of
Chemistry Peter Marie rust who is here
two months ago giving a lecture he's
been working with the Royal Society and
they're working on incorporating in
cheese into all the Royal Society of
Chemistry journals that's in the
planning stages and like any society
things take time but Peter Marie rust as
i'm sure you remember from his his talk
is pretty enthusiastic and and pushy
about trying to get things going so it
seems like that's moving along rather
well and we're hoping that other
scientific journals organizations will
do this as well and then we have some
websites that provide information about
how to generate in cheese as well as
being able to just to download the
software what I did is I did a couple of
quick searches on Google as to how
things work right now and here if you
put in a an airline flight it'll come
back and tell you what's going on
because it knows how to interpret that
the next thing is if you just put in chi
in and just tells you about the project
and then if you actually type an inch en
or cut and paste in Incheon it comes
back with some of the places on the web
where you can find information about it
the problem of course is that right now
occasionally and she's the google seems
to change the way it wants to interpret
and cheese and this particular case
anything after twenty three characters
gets cut off which makes sense in
general but obviously not for this
particular application or a lot of
applications in science so that's one of
the things that we're hoping to talk
about and basically this is my
conclusion in summary and I'll let Steve
then go into the details we'd like for I
you packing Google to work together to
develop a special sort of one box
leading to a user interface that is
specialized for chemistry so that when
people put something in they don't have
to worry about the cutoff being 23 or 37
or 41 or whatever is being done at the
time that may make sense for ninety-nine
percent of what Google is doing but
doesn't seem to work very well for
chemistry and we're hoping to get some
people interested in
wanting to do this and get some get some
discussions done so that's my my talk
and I will let the Steve now take over
and go through and give his his
presentation it's a great pleasure for
me to be here google up I've been four
so pretty much most scientists or
chemist I know use Google all the time
they have something they all know and
you can convert the query into a word or
two you've searched google and find it
well i'll be talking about as a way for
chemists to do that by the chemical
structure basically the main point i'd
like to bring out and describe it in
little details the fact that the
chemical structure is a series of
characters its unique series of
characters every chemical compound which
has a unique structure and there's
millions of them has unique chemical
name and if you have that name you can
find that that compound wherever it is
or you can change around that name to
find similar compounds but it's the key
into chemistry and it's a it's it's it
can be naturally expressed as a series
of characters and and therefore is
searchable and possible but at the
present day it's there's no effective
way to do this you can and know and you
may find some chemicals you want but
you'll miss a lot more and as people
adopt a standard a unique way to
identify chemical we should be able to
find all the chemicals we want and miss
none maybe we'll get too many will need
to filter that further but in the future
when I'll be able to deal with all
chemistry of well-defined chemicals
through identifiers such as entry and
this ranges from benzene up into a some
DNA series from very small the very big
simple too complicated as long as you
know what it is and you can draw it you
can convert it to a string and search it
so that's the overview and that's really
i'm so i'll try to fill in some details
about why it's developed the way it is
and how what the current users are and
and it's will be up to others to figure
out ways for search engines to search
this more effectively
it and so it's for chemists but really
it's for everybody who deals with a
chemical structure in a news article and
a patent literature or anywhere else and
these are very widespread in penetrate
we're outside of the lab chemistry so
this is IU packs the aforementioned them
they've been around very long time for
standards for chemistry around the world
naming things and and and trying to
coordinate the chemical communication
pretty much internationally and and I
work it and I estea used to be the
national bureau of standards is all
physicists and people tell me they do
various computer things there as well
another building I'm in the chemistry
group there but this is a about 100 year
old institutions the oldest US
government labs it's a office of weights
and measures originally and we're here
to help standardize things from the
Department of Commerce help Commerce's
and there's many different programs
there ours is just one of them ah the
current practice for chemistry is to
draw a structure and chemists know what
this means although you can draw it in
several ways it's all the same compound
but if you try to convert it to a string
further you can do that but there are so
many choices and almost all of them you
have to ask somebody else to look it up
for you and usually pay a fee or you can
write various strings and there are many
of them and they're all different and
they'll tell you how you get them
because they're closed systems that are
proprietary there's no open source way
to represent guanine Fu and
unfortunately guanine could be spelled
in different ways in different languages
and different synonyms and there isn't a
very good way to find guanine either way
finally would be to create an inch e in
t equals 1 version 1 and then after that
is a series of strange characters that
the users don't have to see but which
really identify that compound tell you
exactly what it is and confer and also
tells you the level of detail that you
know it at which I'll try to describe
later unfortunately you can't simply
describe all chemical there's a single
string because different chemicals are
described the different levels of
specificity or the same chemical can be
looked at at different levels and we
need to deal with that also the fact
that humans make a lot of errors
draw these things so we need a robust
way to deal with this and that's what we
tried to do in developing in chi so
every chemical has a unique natural name
like Steve and Steve you can't tell us
apart but from the second name the
second layer of information tells us
apart and one can do the same effective
thing with chemical structure macol law
and represent them to the level of
detail necessary to understand and this
is expressed as a connection table serv
to the connection of what's connected to
what what Adam is connected for watching
and what and for the nature we have
different levels of specificity so we
need to know there's all the Steve's in
the room stand up then they just a Steve
Heller stand up that decreases the
chance of lovely dog of error and
special increases specificity and so but
generating a unique name from this from
this connection it is a mathematical
chore that in many cases is simple but a
lot of cases is very difficult and for
this we use Dimitri Tchaikovsky who's
slaving in gaithersburg right now and
chain worth as we're traveling around
talking about but so but it takes and
there are a lot of different ways of
doing it I suppose every little detail
counts it has to be done right but once
you have one way to do it you'll wind up
with one string regardless of how you
drew the chemical and so in chi is
proposed as such a public name and the
goal of it basically is to buy a unique
string it's independent of how you drew
it and you can derive it from what
everybody uses to draw a chemical
structure connection table of any sort
freely available and also very important
it's extensible we can build on this
because the chemical known your chemical
somewhere is useful but usually not the
purpose of the search is to find
something about that chemical chemical
property and interaction some
calculations done on the structure
itself is just an index and we need to
extend it the talk will be divided it
tried to first talk about the evolution
how it came about from technical details
current practice and something searching
the internet Steve Heller already show
you the sort of thing
be trying to go through this quickly and
then the sort of extensions that can be
added on to and she because the way it
was built was designed to be extensible
and so the history of nest is we have a
big database for many years NIST has
been distributing standard reference
data and and the key to all this data is
the chemical structure so we're very
interested in how you represent the
structure and a unique way so we don't
have to separate entries for the same
compound for example and instruction we
built the structures and properties
interconversion for our database more
recently on X in the old days of dolls
computers we have this chemistry webbook
the biggest source so I think of
reference data on the web and Google
sends a lot of people there every day if
you're looking for property of a
compound but it does it by not by an
entry usually but by some other
mechanism and then we developed our own
way of representing uniquely within this
and then I you pack teamed up to try to
develop a unique standard that could be
used worldwide to to have one way of
representing a chemical that everybody
could agree on and use are you packed
her about that as almost as old as NIST
but I think we uh we were formed a few
years before to the turn of the what of
the ninth 1901 something like that turn
the previous century the objective is as
i stated which was as written it six
years ago one remains true today it's
basically to provide an identifier
that's of general use an obvious
straightforward task really and it was
announced in 2002 is one of these
several places nature we synthesize a
naming system and so forth however it
took us longer to complete the first
version because we discovered that we
could extend it quite extensively but it
would take some work because it and we
might as well cover a larger fraction of
the chemicals before the first release
salts
sometimes chemicals are in two different
interconverting forms and they're the
same thing we can deal with that this is
a good degree organometallics they have
strange bonding we felt we can deal with
that where the proton is a compound is
important for some people we added that
in its uncertain and I don't know what
happened there it's in she goes to the
depiction yeah in other words you take
an inch and you get back as chemical
structure to look at and that's a
helpful thing to add and then the last
stage of conformance test to see if
you've built in chi right and that's
been completed and now delivered and
here it is on the I you pack website
with conformance testing just this year
and it was announced before the
conformist as the main five the Royal
Society publication and it's well known
to people interested in chemical
indexing and it even has entry in the
Wikipedia and is being taken up by
open-source programmers and the like is
a nice common denominator so here's some
details if you're interested in handling
it I'd like to show it's not a simple
string that can always be used that way
but you want some manipulation to really
make full use of it but the requirement
for an entry is that two different
structures have different entries
obviously these are two structures that
sits and trans aha Opta trains but
they're one's bent and they're not the
same they should have different in
cheese if you care about that and this
is a general property other general
properties if however you draw it if
even if I look different you need to
resolve them into the same compound and
this this is something come as argue
about a lot what the right way to draw
it is but in chi should give you one
regardless which camp you're in for
drawing practical requirements simple
text format ASCII characters we want to
represent well known cases of
equilibrated structures because so many
chemicals in a popular like that we want
to count the fact that people make
errors all the time and drawing them
especially the stereochemistry which may
not know about it everybody makes nari
we need to hide that in a layer at least
that doesn't destroy
search me we want to handle a precise
bonding extensible as I said and the
practical solution though is to devise
this thing a series of layers you saw /
as each of those slashes on Angie is
another layer of information more
specificity that that we calculate for
these reasons to satisfy these practical
requirements I'll talk very briefly
about it here's this aspartic acid and
basically isn't in chi for it and so
regardless how you do that there
hundreds of ways of doing it a chemist
will resolve them all you want wind up
with one thing and here you'll see the
slashes that are so complicated in there
you'll see that they're basically all
the different types of layers that you
can have depending on how much you know
about the information about the
compounds how much detail you care to
give somebody else searching doesn't
have to use all those ladies you can use
a subset or a superset of them but you
ought to be able to do a string match to
find if it's a compound you want
here's a here's a quick example of the
layers is there key to understanding in
chi and the complexities involved in
naming chemicals that are really part of
chemistry not not part of us of
statistics or or information transfer in
general it's just partners partners it's
an expression of nature and chemical
structures so here's histidine here's a
formal the first layer is a chemical
formula which we mostly know and this
it's one name but it's an ambiguous 14
histidine and this is how we draw it and
if all we know is the chemical structure
because chemical formula we can
represent it by an entry just that alone
those for h2 it's not ambiguous but for
histidine it is and then we deal with
the connections what's connected to what
which of these elements are connected to
each other and this is how we represent
a series of characters that comes up
canonically from a computer algorithm
then where the hydrogens are the ones
that are moving around assuming they can
all move around then we locate them you
see the Reds are the hi genes that are
then fixed and this is how they're fixed
with another layer then we have the
stereochemistry so often run in crack
incorrectly but often very important and
we have that is you have another layer
and finally if we decide that hydrogen
czar really fixed we want to fix them we
don't want allow them moving around
we'll all that in the end to give you a
precisely specified chemical structure
string all these things together and you
have an entry for histidine there's
three steps really first you normalize a
chemical structure Joe you take out all
the information that you don't really
need for its name then you do the math
which is a Dimitri has done a very good
job of using graph theory to solve this
very quickly for complicated structures
and regardless how you draw each of the
atoms different types of atoms gets a
different number and then you spit that
out of this string and some agreed on
way the normalization is a chemistry
part basically we divide the structure
the layers before we start processing we
ignore this thing called electron
densities we only assume there are no
electrons any anywhere they're sort of
people put them in different places it
doesn't mean anything except to
communicate the chemist vision of what
he thinks where the reactivity is and
then we basically only deal with the
general types of stereochemistry now
although future in cheese could do more
here are the munch knows which we of
course invented are named in Munich and
all these different things are the same
chemical structure different ways of
drawing them all equally acceptable but
in the end after normalization we get
one and then we do a math on that and
get an itchy so current practice Steve
Heller went over this really pretty foul
just a pestis he covered this but if you
want to know details about in chi
there's a fact Nick Nick days facts is
very detailed and he has everything we
know about in here and it's thoroughly
documented his site we have a test
software for showing a user interface
how it develop and in chi and then the
software how they use it for for
creating it out of away from the users
site as a dll dynamic link library but
here's a 12 project basically in this a
CD software you jaw structure and you
say generate an entry and there it is
it's really nothing to it nothing
special and then you can take that entry
and just an entry law and you generate
the structure back from it it may look
quite different but it'll be the same
thing as you drew and so we have with
this reversibility that's in there as
well as the last thing we want to add
before we distribute it now searching
the internet well that's something you
probably have a little bit interested in
and of course this is really how people
will find make use of Angie and just by
searching a worldwide
for information for chemical information
and here's a search for a score big acid
and it shows things up but there's only
24 of them there should be twenty-four
thousand of them that people had things
indexed in in chi and exposed to google
and this is a very practical thing it's
just matter getting it out that we just
in chi is just a few months old really
for his final use and we hope that this
Monday will do it it works it doesn't
work very well because of issues that
Steve Heller mentioned it's punctuation
thing that we need to separate things we
we can do better and we can find ways of
an inch e2 of making it simpler but in
the end we don't want punctuation to be
mistreated and we're using it there for
a purpose and if you turn it into a
blank something's going to go wrong you
can miss structures now false negatives
are you lose your uniqueness which gives
you false positives effectively so the
both of them are bad with punctuation
problems the layering basically if you
just decide once they learn only you
must have that it's inflexible doesn't
make full use of it sometimes you don't
want to use a layer a person searching
doesn't care about layer that may be
represented and by somebody else and we
need some kind of parsing up front and
in the back and we lose the depiction
pretty much this becoming is the way
that person drew yes
Olivia
sometimes but but not because because
it's not a linear substructure searching
is not a linear sort of search at least
unless you do something special with it
it's it's a tree search you can take
what's in there and do your own and
their various places people that do that
commercially and publicly but it has all
the information you need for a substring
search it has fully coated connection
table with all the connections in there
and you use some are not others and so
it's just a way to deliver something so
you can do that searching on it's just
there's no way to write a simple
strength to do effective substructure
search on because it's really
somebody could take the injuries a
million or of them and create a
substructure searching engine all of
them with and that by several different
groups could do that now that
difficulties
yes yes write the word in this case is
the whole structure if you want to get a
part of the structure because it is the
rights now linear you can never
represent in a useful way substructures
in the linear strength not because of
wings basically if nothing else so and
other things so this is just allows this
that more people to do it but because it
gives them a structure they can know how
they do that they can anticipate and
know how to parse and so sometimes
people draw out the way they want and
and you'll destroy it if you don't keep
the structure originally and so one
wants to deal with that but this is a
current probably if we have an entry we
lose it the imaginary drawing that the
the perfect drawing the chemists drew
kind of some of them are very sensitive
about the way the molecules look so
beauty contest that I'm joined my mouth
you look better than yours my 90 degrees
and that really looks more natural
there's a lot of that especially oh I
love their older chemists I think that
happens once you look at chemicals to
look through long and but you lose
information by taking out punctuation
this just illustrates that if you take
out a dashes or parentheses you these
three things look the same I mean these
two compounds look the same by being
converted to the middle and just as a
trivial illustration but you're running
risks of Miss misidentifying that way
false positives and negatives put some
going back okay extensions now in chi
offers because it gives you a unique
number for every different atom in a
molecule that's really a very very
helpful thing for other people to attach
structures to these basic units steroids
or any any structure you will often
people want to attach things to
different positions or create a polymer
of attachments of different positions in
chi allows gives you a specific number
unique to that position on that molecule
which you can then use to connect to
other things and this is very important
for extensions of entry because it gives
you a number in a structure for each of
the atoms and that then allows you to
pretty much do whatever you want with it
expressing how it reacts and out how
it's changed how it permits
and we can with simply and unspecified
atoms you just say this is this position
? or X or Y so we don't require it to be
an Allen right now we do we can
basically have predefined structural
units that people already accept widely
and have lists of them and people are
working on this the sugars and polymers
and and and proteins and anything else
you want you can make these macro atoms
and just link them together in a logical
way and even markers series which people
use in the patent literature can be in
chief I'd if one wants although these
are have a huge ambiguities potential in
them that goal you won't do the whole
thing you do a hard large part of it
with some work so all anything that has
a chemical structural element in it can
be turned into unique string of
characters and call a ninja this is an
example of how you pack already has a
numbering system but it takes a human
and reading a book and very few people
do it right and even they make errors
it's very complicated to take a
complicated structure and number it in
many cases and they have names at the
bottom that have been invented by you
pack for that but there are many
different names that are correct for
that thing however in chi will give you
numbers same number of numbers really in
effect but but make them uniquely and
without having a human have to have any
intervention you can point them point at
a certain position and that number will
be applied automatically so this gives a
lot of flexibility of a big debt
numbering part it's already been used as
glide connection tables it's glycan data
exchange format just proposed to be
using this glycan community sugars which
is a very big deal I mean you know these
people and it's a so on yeah it's music
the other guilds all the all the
significant diseases what are the sugars
like sugars aren't always so sweet when
they're causing cancer but they need a
unique way to represent them and don't
have one and they propose the use of in
chi numbering system to start that off
and
seems to be going well there are several
other groups using in chi as well or
thinking about to help deal with similar
issues now you can deal with on certain
positions by putting some special label
and give them red here say / you we owe
the coin could be somewhere else so you
can deal with ambiguity by adding a
layer some types of ambiguity the
depiction well along with in chi we do
store optionally all the coordinate
information so you can draw it the way
the author wanted it's not the part of
the in chi that's canonical unique but
it can be tagged will pulled along with
it there give multiple structures for
the same and different people drew it in
different ways so if one wants to keep
your own structure you have to do it
there is a place to hold that but it's
not canonical depends you know you have
to pick coordinates of your own which
could be a happy happy Rida mentions for
drawing but it's there we can add in
this and what week's call auxiliary
information information in the original
structure that was stripped out because
it was needed for naming and with that
that's that's what I wanted to say and
that it's really just the beginning we
hope of this of this general way of
integrating chemical structures into
into searching and into while processing
and even even searching of the
literature searching external world and
searching your own computer and your own
corporate data system can be unified
every corporate data system now has
thousands of chemicals and there many of
them all the big companies have their
own internal systems and almost all
we're different and proprietary to get
that stuff out to search anything on the
internet or to a corporation they may
have purchased will take some heavy-duty
computer people coming in trying to make
it work by everybody convert into a
common denominator in chi we hope to
make this this this process of
communication much less painful and so
that we have reduced the number of rooms
and the Tower of Babel and well thank
you very much
because we're open to questions or I
hope we're open to questions at FBI
network all right then I see these guys
want to help you out what do you want to
well basically what i said to create
this user interface so that when
somebody puts you in chi in google knows
it's an entry like it knows various
other activities and functions that are
collected for the system right now as a
potent as opposed to people may or may
not be able to get a result based upon
the way they're doing searching across
the symptoms and then you need to get
the rest of you actually put these two
inches really fun well we obviously we
need people that inches but if you can't
search them because of the process that
this particular search engine has or
this particular search engine changes
which I know Google does make slight
improvements on an hourly basis we just
want to be sure that these changes are
taking are taking into account when they
make procedure I would also say just
just the pencil people keep in mind this
issue when they're developing future
products are interested in Google and
the fact that this exists and will
always exist this chemical structure
thing and and that it is naturally part
of a search engine linear strings can
start everything off but you need
processing at the end and and of course
we as we going along we'd like to know
well what what characters to output I
mean we will have version 2 if we had
some advice on what to do or not do with
my help and but but the the fact that
people putting exposing their entries
more people will be doing that we're
sure but if they saw it could be mostly
more easily processed through the search
engines they be encouraged further every
time they put up there the chemical
companies all they have all their stuff
exposed the ones that sell these
chemicals as in trees they it would be a
chemical catalog and then they get a
prices put the other posts / at the end
of entry with a price per gram if they
want but this stuff can all be packaged
together and because it spoke so closely
related and once it started we just we
really want to get the ball rolling and
we're assuming once that happens we'll
just sit back and and enjoy our
retirement move on to something else yes
the bathroom here
we 55
what for
well there are many our entry fight in
the pubchem almost all of them but but
we need that to point to some useful
information they're just there and you
can search through there but but a lot
of people go to the dynamics of interest
this right
well you can create an entry for
anything that's not the problem in terms
of the databases on the web that have
inches the largest one is the Cancer
Institute that has almost 40 million and
various organizations we listed about it
below over a dozen that have started to
incorporate it and there are others that
we don't know anything about me if you
do a search you may randomly come up
with additional databases that happen
we're just really getting in on the
ground floor right now we're trying it's
a chicken in the egg I mean you know why
would you want to end in chi if you can
search for it and then and then you know
what's what good are these things if
Google cuts were or someone else cuts it
off if 20 characters 2731 takes out
parentheses except equal signs because
that's the way the search engine
interprets things unless we can come up
with standards and the database
basically simultaneously then we're not
going to get very far with this most
people place dollar they they already
have and their corporate or personal
data centers up onto the web will even
now we would find a lot of stuff and
then it would be motivation to do it
further so we're trying to just get up
to that stage now the by solving the
easy problems to solve and in the hopes
that once it becomes a useful tool it'll
it'll grow because people find it so
helpful I mean it's it's it's not really
a technical issues for economic
political
what problems are the hardest to solve
this way
imagine in chief for
oh geez well fine structure if it's a
bit like lignin you know now you could
put some structures in lignin that are
always characteristic and and but you
need exhilarate software for that now
because it's so it's a couple it's it's
it's described by a distribution more or
less of structure it's really described
by what happens to the wood one UV and
when you let it though my Oliver's are
like this in many ways to maybe we
talked about intro fying polymers you
sit down and talk with some polymer
chemists and they said well you know
we're not exactly sure what this is so
we sort of describe it then some has a
good mish and but that's polymer
chemists are happy with it which might
be might find that certain peptides
very well defined some it some are the
ones that are enormous yeah and you know
the tertiary structures and things are
do you have layers for one could one
could put in tertiary structures if they
were needed and other confirmations are
it's a stereo issue really you can put
them in the stereos we're assuming all
single bonds freely rotate if you
restrict that then you can actually put
in confirmation so it is extensible
through another layer I mean there are
always people do it but that would be
then that's not limitation the
limitation is you have to know some
element important elements of the
structure and then you have to know what
you don't know so that you properly deal
with that and you know what what parts
are ambiguous and the first version of
in she doesn't deal with ambiguity we
can do it a lot of cases by simply
saying well it could be anywhere of
these these four connections could be
this group and and or this is connected
to that but we don't know where or we
have a chemical reaction chemical a in
chemical be and talked about them
together or separate and so we can do
that but the ambiguities in chemistry
are the same ambiguities in in chi this
then and and there's no way to resolve
them and people use words or other
things you might do a partial chemical
structure with a name to get some of
those difficult ones they're just trying
to picture if I had a
protein or something and
the in chief or it will be so fun
that would be I still might want to
search what you know my browser is on
and and people talk about that to prove
a predictable end the other would be to
happen for the glycans have predefined
things somewhere else and so some index
open index number that would be held by
the human proteome organization or
someplace like that with a series of
numbers and then yeah and then on on
there you just pass the their code
number and you can go their site to find
the true in chi and their modifications
on some of sometimes you can have an
amino acid on there it's modified in a
strange way that can only be expressed
well within chief like AG like camp for
example then the sugars start getting
put on these these peptides it can be
very complicated and they can know more
and more about it and they make care
little or not but that stuff can be
stored somewhere else and represented in
a way that everybody released wouldn't
be the same language and then could
allow those things to be built and the
you know the european bioinformatics
institute for example has a small
molecule collection of biologically
related things that they're there
they're putting up as in cheese and so
they can be linked together but when
they're too long there's no one can deal
with that you certainly want to eat with
me experts to work with this yeah
adding bolts
anyone any quotes and either at this
and Sunaina
no none that snow that to do that as a
substructure search and you and and
somebody else would have to take all the
entries and index them like the pubchem
has that we cut them will do this is
that user interface that I was talking
about the beginning when somebody puts
in no offense E and then you just go off
to some other specialized system to
handle because you you can't do it it's
not a really text string as most google
is made even the places that are a text
me where you have mathematical equations
I mean it goes off you're writing a one
plus one plus one and it goes somewhere
and there's an equation that it's going
to process that
with rings with renz you can't do that
it's just you've got multiple layers and
they're very common if they're aware
yeah but you have rings that rings
between them are connected in other ways
to other rings it's a mathematical grave
okay takes on chemistry has nothing to
do with chemistry okay just forget the
word chemistry just think of it as a
mathematical grab and how you handle
graph theory
yes right so this and some of the
substructures are simple like men's if
we wanted to its pull out and perceive
all all the benzene rings we could have
crazy unit out of them if we wanted to
but we decided instead to have a very
general mathematical way to do it that
was that just was treating it as a just
a series of connections to each other
the structure that we're getting from
entry is unique structure but the
substructures in it you have to parse
out yourself and this is a whole problem
and and then there's different there's
multiple different ways of doing it and
people can search huge structure
databases even before I hurry Google
very quickly but by creating an inverted
tree to work your way down and you could
have millions tens of millions any
number you want and you can quickly find
substructure matches in there once you
build it up what we're doing now is
giving people the tokens they need to
build those things that the information
they need and 2222 to create such things
and it could be done by by whoever wants
to it could be done by Google or cook
will be done by other people who sell
other services for that and it's just
the fact missed as a whole is that's
what we're involved we really want to
provide information make easy to use in
exchange and chemistry especially if
what I'm in once that's out there when
we've solved what we can solve we have
that software support is there is now if
you change one line of the code it would
change everything it's not type of robot
system you'd like because of the graph
theory and you have to make the best
thing and there's no such thing except
by choosing me out of it where is there
on PCs the software a number of ways it
once it runs on linux and it runs on
it's written in c and it's a you know
people could try to port it but it's
super fast and and so it's never time
will never be an issue and and we're
working with various people who want to
use it some of just taking it in their
internal systems and we don't even know
about are you accepted by word of mouth
i think google knows about where four
inches are the we do
they probably seen some this scarlet if
you only can use that
they get water probably
to be done is it possible
it's my duty named Brianna projected
important
the caffeine ETD your engine and yes you
can you could once you have that you
have the full connection table and and
there's all you can do just about
anything that a human can do with with
with with breaking it up and and into
different some people think the benzene
ring is the least interesting thing I
want to avoid all that they might find
the cases where there's an o H next to a
nitro group you know two carbons away
and and and and you can't put that in an
advanced and so we don't mind
get all the search options
yes actually so you saw the nist
chemistry webbook and it has its orb in
there and we it's a very heavily used
resource for looking up things like that
so an amex hmmm not standard except
that's a nationalist to standards take
on but it's a it is web book that nice
gov and it's it's very heavily used for
for reference to all the reference data
we produce almost all but it goes up
there
I mean the Cancer Institute has those 40
million structures on actually it's a
Linux cluster and that's just but that's
one database how to do the largest one
but it's one but you know
National Library of Medicine has another
one and proud science has a proprietary
database and so forth
the idea is to try to link and search
all these things together and then when
of course when it's a fee-based of
products such as science and the drugs
in the future you have little google ads
on the side we make money from that and
or your legs the directly for there is
it happen people have to pay for the
defeat the same way to do right now
google links to a lot of pain t pay
sites Nick city
yeah hubcap upcoming logical guys you
can get a copy of a tree most of the
stuff you know you can index part of it
you can't really do with the deep in de
coca Melissa yeah well some do punk am
does but NCI for exam 40 million you
can't do it because of the agreements
they have with the people who provided
the 40 million structures so it all
depends upon what the sources of the
information as the what level you can
index and deliver stuffing and I'm sure
the Google lawyers are very experienced
with that with the publishers right now
having nothing to do with what's right
or wrong but the point is you can do
something but you can't do everything on
in all cases polka net sadiq now it's an
irrelevant welcome is a revolutionary
new resource that some people know this
is suddenly exposed all chemistry to the
internet before then there were all
kinds of reasons why that didn't happen
yeah but not a kind chem links to them
to proprietary will link to it yeah they
have whatever lengths a user submitted
with with the structures but but the
structures themselves in the beginning
of a linkage it was created by them
really single-handedly the chemistry is
not any different from the entire web I
mean some of the stuff is completely
free and some of the stuff is partially
chemistry is a little different because
of antique representation of the way in
which you look at chemical it's a
mathematical graph is opposed to most of
the other things on on the web but other
than that it's pretty straightforward it
does have the advantage
an economic point of view between
chemistry biology physics for example
physics is just no market for physics
information biology information because
there's so much of it it began in the
1990s for the most part the genome
everybody had a computer everybody put
it up and most of its free chemistry
probably a billion dollar a year or more
industry so there's money there and
there's value in linking things back and
forth so there's a reason to want to
work with this is a reason to for
companies to want to work with with the
project and with Google or whoever is
interested in putting this together sort
of we do web indexing indexing surgeon I
mean what I did love was I you know it
didn't say explicitly drugs can be
turned into in cheese I mean so that's
young they love different right now what
drug you have and the details of it how
it differs from each other and then the
impurities in it could all be put in a
lipid in a package so all the chemical
information about drugs is a natural the
eat almost easiest application of inches
yes
where is it
you're asking for it
I think the robust in most cases would
be first going to the formula and the
connection layer layer pulling that
stuff out and having software than
figuring out whether the rest is what
you want or not that would be
discriminating enough just a structure
without knowing where the hydrogen's
were anything else and the formula would
be a lot and you pull down maybe 50 or
60 or a few hundred and then you could
always on your desktop sort the rest so
you didn't miss any because as I said
people make errors and and if you
searching for cholesterol or something
and you draw it you have the full C or
accounts you're going to miss people
that have the stereo wrong or lift it
out and things like that so that's why I
say the layering is very important for
Malika largely for errors of people make
as well as when they want to be very
precise they can do that too and so the
users would decide what sort of level
position they wanted I would think the
default would be the formal connection
what layer which are the first two
layers and after that that could be then
be done player
however I start certain sugars is this a
lot of sugars that are different from
each other that have the same
connectivity so you want to do more
you'll get too many so some people or
some people may know there's certain
very common drugs and they want to know
the one with the stereochemistry like
this and they can very quickly do that
if they want and front from the
information that's passed back from that
web page or wherever it is so so it's
there and where you want to do it is is
an option but effective search of just
the first two layers within post
processing software on the user's side
would would solve the largest fractional
problems some people will want to know
you know give me all of the drug tests
for lipitor and some people want to know
you know give me a similar structures to
live before and they're depending upon
the question you can either look for the
exact information to armwood generic or
partial in Christ
and it's both of them obviously the
exact match is a lot easier it's some of
the things that Steve talked about the
faith more complicated which is why you
need something a little more I get
sophisticated which is the reason for
going to a specialized piece of software
but well another way you brought upon I
didn't make explicitly of course you
still have words and you steal so here's
the chemical thing about everything with
its chemical structure is limit but you
could put in cancer or or high blood
pressure or whatever else let me run
into the usual problems but something
like glucose there's so much of that so
if you're going to have to put in it's
like looking up though you know you're
gonna have to put in some more stuff but
at least that will be then one term
it'll have that in there somewhere even
the different stereo isomer of it and
with more terms with benzene or
something you'll you'll maybe have two
different chemical things you want to
appear together so it just turns it into
a into a word that you then can use in
your normal
did you hatch yeah various people yes
well normally normally we would think
people wouldn't type this in themselves
that some some something we draw a
picture of her there have a picture of
it somewhere they click on and that
would pass in chi so people shouldn't we
hope worried about the length of in chi
but nevertheless their variety of people
who want to develop a hash for very
spicy it might be painted
got an old thing she
lots of shoes
yeah this is a group in England Jeremy
fried southampton university published
the paper back in May or June where he
talked about hash that because of this
exact problem and was sort of ironic the
hash color that he thought of a software
algorithm is what he should use in fact
was a NIST US standard for hedge codes
and it's a different group at this and
then what we're involved with and for
basically for political reasons this
project was only designed create this
algorithm the issue of a hash and
structure searching and so forth we're
not part of the project and are not are
not acceptable for the things that we're
supposed to be doing but these other
groups are working on it we parameterize
when someone someone's going to do it
pretty soon it knows it's obviously it's
something that needs to be done Steve
remind me to the in chi the USB itch I
chii you pack chemical that got in chi i
added the big end for NIST then this
lawyer saw that so now you can't do that
or a government agency so we became the
the International the I n became the
second letter international so that's
the history of it so but
yes but almost all the four letting
things that you can pronounce they're
already taken up someplace somebody's
there's all kinds of organizations named
in chi never be more so what in chi
equal we left the I mean it will supply
and doing it in chi equal is the
beginning if it's not into equal it's
not in chi we try to have that as part
of it and one means version want so we
have a verse thing in there probably
will there will be an injury to maybe
that will be all but obviously we don't
want to keep changing in chance we make
a change hopefully it's a small one but
there are certain things we definitely
need to add in chi like ambiguity and
and did everything you know there are a
lot of issues that people could bring up
old which are totally valid
you know our only desire is to expand
the universe of people who are working
on this and you know again it's the
chicken in the egg I mean why would you
work on it unless people using it and
it's accepted it can be searched and so
forth and the people who do that why
they going to wipe they want to do that
it's not been accepted people are using
it so we we need to get everyone
interested and basically we're here to
sell it and to see if anybody wants it
wants to help us and I think Google put
this thing together which I think would
be a bad valuable resource for everyone
is engineering proposal of its kind
there are others standards quote unquote
but they're all proprietary and that the
problem with those is first of all
getting them and secondly when changes
occur what do you do about where is this
thing being public domain open source
you don't have that issue and in that
sense it's unique I mean frankly the way
in which all this stuff is represented
is granted speeds mathematical graph
theory it's nothing really new it's just
the way we're putting it together the
matter which putting together politics
of the open source and so forth the
internet the way are the Google blaring
is I mean if things like Google didn't
exist you know why the heck would
everybody wanted to put in their
database how could you probably did
without googling on the other hand of
Google doesn't process it correctly
you'll never find it either so it's that
problem sorry
music so please like this
and solves our property
fizik state no just just cashed this is
the oldest unique nobody's ever tried to
separate the layers of information the
chemical structure but when we did it
this because we continually had problems
with stereochemistry and other things
ambiguities same compound to two people
may slightly different drawings if we
gave them exactly that we forced a
certain structure we have 45 vapor
pressures of cholesterol you know each
named differently and and so we so we
did that out of need and but it also
then we found that's why it took several
years longer that concept allows you to
extend it to a variety of other things
that better have this sort of ambiguity
earliest different levels of specificity
and we put that in but it looks like a
very general they especially for
chemicals which have that that's then
that's the way they're built we're not
really imposing ourselves on its
chemical mystery is narrow but there's a
lot of money
historically there's been a lot of money
show me for example crowd science just
put their drugs in the future which is
just a couple of thousand compounds and
they're getting five to ten click fruits
from pubchem which has the information
there are other databases under they've
given to popcap if you're talking about
putting something together on google
which is definitely bigger you can
imagine the kind of potential interest
and your realtor so we we have a couple
of examples of how this has some real
value technically scientifically and
economically and it seems to be growing
we're just either have it grow faster I
work at NIST all the time and so we're
government agency we're not really
supposed to deal directly with the
demica people we could be pressed
dealing through consortiums and groups
like I you pack so everything we do is
really through I you pack Steve Heller
works sometimes at NIST and sometimes
when he says money and commercial
stuffies he's not working at NIST so
don't say somebody but just in case it
comes up I'm just yeah and as anybody
else asks us to give a talk we find it
interesting we we very much want to help
everybody so this is obviously the books
giving you an opportunity to do
something before we go up north through
seattle
oh that comparison yes very
they live here
and for
what those two right there's two
different issues one is the connection
table format and people often mix them
up and there's all kinds of connection
table formats the way you say where the
cut what carbon is connected to what
carbon 6 connected to oxygen for and by
this type of bond and at this position
and there's all kinds of formats and
like all these formats different people
implement them differently so even
though it's the same logical format you
can't read it unless you really tried
yes but they didn't use line feeds or
something like that or spaces mean that
is it daylight corporation has smiles as
their format the problem with that the
suspect is proprietary the different
versions of it neglecting all that is
it's not extensible and so it doesn't
cover things like chirality inserting
stereochemistry and a variety of other
things because they don't need to i mean
they're they have a customer base that
they're they're satisfying basic in the
pharmaceutical industry which we're
talking about chemistry overall in each
case you won't know the algorithm and
it's not published so so the canonical
part of it there's the smiles canonical
but there are different implementations
and there's in chi I don't know of any
other that's probably used yes
just when you pretty good
some mr. Yuni column
fuser closer
yes
I mean how soon's normal by developers
the spacesuit as
you need to download it or their
websites were you drawing it and it came
from the very good map but that was
derived from l some top-level
mathematical work but Mackay and
Australia actually uses code which is
very fast this or the orientation
jealous yes if you have a very
complicated symmetrical molecule it can
take years if you just do some standard
method for doing it and so but you do it
right using other people's algorithms
which they invented for other purposes
these are these could be roads in San
Francisco you could turn into a graph
and canonicalize the map of San
Francisco but we the same math as we're
using here so that every location gets a
number now if you build a new road on
that you have to do the whole thing over
again but if you have a fixed set as a
molecule is have any interconnected
network you can even color different
types of roads in one way streets or
whatever as long as it's fixed you can
canonicalize the whole thing and develop
a and energy for a San Francisco so
having a
a dress for everything
his face
similar
our unique addresses for URLs
so a lot of
questions for that you know
where else which are ashes for
thanks
so
once you have
address now you can have a place where
oh here's the unique address and hear
all the links to all the databases a lot
of things that because if you look at it
as another way of
the whole range of problems in similar
spaces with that but that George that's
not Russell all right for you I yeah but
you guys have all given the unique
addresses all right that's that's that's
it we just labeled we've just labeled
the territory next to that is the key
medium but but with input without Google
or someone else working on this then
what we've done I mean you know it's a
tool it's necessary but not a sufficient
condition what's going on that's that's
wife that's why we need to cooperate
well loop we wanted love and that's why
we think it'd be valuable to put
together a project because there's this
scientific as well as and hopefully the
problem has been solved different
chemical companies and NIST we solve the
problem ourselves and everybody solves
it themselves but when they want to talk
to each other there's the problem
because they've also held in different
ways I said one little line of code 1
plus or minus change or one any trivial
changing the code could totally change
the ordering of the entry and wipe it
all out so it has to be up this is a
case where only one answer is correct
beneath it should be there and so we
proposed this seven code which is odd
standards or usually standards are much
easier to describe but this is the
package algorithm set and it's at one
place and everybody has access to it and
if you put together what you're talking
about you think that it's a
billion-dollar industry you just take a
small percentage of that
they're in terms of ads and it's
probably something that might be worth
thinking about yeah
biochemistry website
so
one of the things that we like to play
with yours and ask what are hard in the
search questions
he said he saw a t-shirt
structural formula
I'm coming off that what
he was able to do it in two searches
because it was right
plenty of meta information that they
already knew
but being able to take an image
hand it to some soft produce Oh yellow
with exists people houses things that
I've tried he has a digitization effect
for you and and it did the problem there
are problems it's not drive but strong
oddly you know somebody don't convention
then you'll have to tweak the algorithm
you all right yeah we looks quite yeah
why there's a program i will reply this
calculor which was developed and there's
another problem people cry which is
being sold up in canada which does that
exactly
maybe not often % d9 person whatever but
yeah but basically there is software
that does that because one of the
problems we have is searching images
yeah let's click you have to pee you'd
have to take all those images you have
to pre processing choice yeah have an
image that's effectively a series of
connections what's the word for it yes
like a framework then that with the
right algorithm you can turn that to a
string that's just the chemistry is yeah
but no we know the Nellie's I could see
going through the index index of images
and yes running some software i'll have
this life we don't make it in chi out of
this that'll be fun today yeah well you
know this is what the people are the
amount that did they went through 30
years of patents they took out all the
names and then they converted those two
inches and there's a lot of pilots and
its problems and certainly not perfect
but that's the sort of analogy it's a
family in this case it was just in the
text string interpreting the text string
as a chemical and then thinking that in
this case you'd be perfect oh yeah go
especially after you after you come up
with one you might find a name for it
and then you find that name somewhere
