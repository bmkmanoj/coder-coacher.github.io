introduce Chris Munro as a respek here
today for control AI Tech Talk series
Chris is one of the leading atomic
physicists and quantum information
scientists in the world he's a well
known for his pioneering work on trapped
ions and his famous experiment on first
quantum logic gates in 1995 which
actually led to a Nobel Prize in Physics
in 2012 which was shared between Dave
Eiland and Serge haroche Chris moved to
a University of Michigan as a faculty in
2000 and he managed to put trapped ions
on integrated semiconductor chips and
then in 2007 he went to University of
Maryland and demonstrated the first
control teleportation between two
quantum model over distances of on the
order of meters and he's right now
working on a modular quantum computing
quantum devices which is going to
discuss it with us let's thank Chris for
to the stack
I think Thank You mr. and also Hartnett
for for having me here and in the course
of this this time please feel free to
interrupt me with any any questions I'm
it's a slightly different audience than
I'm used to but I like speaking to
audiences that may not even have any
knowledge of quantum physics that's
actually maybe an easy audience but here
I'm going to deep dig sort of deep into
a particular technology and in the
course of doing so try to make
connections to any type of a technology
paying attention to certain aspects of
quantum technologies that will be
required to build a large-scale system
and so maybe the first example I'm not
sure there's a laser pointer in the room
sorry I should have brought my own I'm a
laser guy okay thanks
okay kind of weak but so there's a
question on who is this Boris guy well
when I was at Michigan he was he was one
of my postdoctoral researchers Borsalino
if he's now on the faculty in Seattle at
University of Washington and he's a very
good painter as well and this is a this
is an oil painting at the time we were
playing around with an atom atoms of
cadmium cadmium ions and if you've ever
dabbled in oil paints you know that this
bright yellow hue is called cadmium
yellow so he he painted this to
represent two cadmium atoms ions and
this in between presumably is the
entanglement between the two the tooth
the two cadmium ions so you can use your
imagination there my this hangs on my
home office wall my wife doesn't like it
so much so it's it's a it's banished to
the to the to my to my own space okay so
as an example of something I'll talk
about that doesn't pertain just to
individual atoms which I will be talking
about at length I want to talk a little
bit about qubit economics okay so I made
up this slide so if you don't agree with
it you can you can yell at me and throw
things but one figure of Merit
of whether you want to build a quantum
computer or you're going to build a
quantum computer how big should it be is
how much will it cost
and here I've on the x-axis I've labeled
the number of bits and of course in
quantum computing bits or quantum bits
that have this funny feature of being
able to exist in both state zero and one
at the same time and well one quantum
bits very cheap in fact it's trivial to
deal with one so I didn't start there I
started at two and this is the cost per
cubed and so I guess I would propose
that any technology may be wrong the
precise shape and where the knees and
the bends are here and where the where
this this sort of asymptote is but it
seems to me that most qubits sort of
will start off fairly expensive you can
put whatever dollar figure you want
there and then the cost will grow but at
some point it will saturate if I give
you fifty cubits I could I probably
could have given you fifty one at very
little added expense and so that's this
nice area where we want to scale things
up and naturally we're going to push and
push that until the slope starts starts
growing
now you might know in classical
computing in fact the slope can be
negative when you build more bits on a
chip the cost per bit can be can be less
and that's of course one of the ways to
describe what Moore's Law is meaning
that things have just gotten much better
over the last last 50 years or so but we
all know that time is ending and in fact
quantum computing is sort of a
revolutionary change to the fundamental
rules of computing so Moore's law
doesn't necessarily apply to this this
model of computing and so we might not
expect classical classical curves cost
per bit to be the same as quantum I
guess the most important point I want to
make here is that well in addition to
this flat zone there will be at some
point when you put too many qubits
together it gets very expensive to add
that next one the system just gets too
big it gets so big that it in if you
want to maybe reduce things they become
classical they lose their quantum
character
we sort of know this in physics any very
big system quantum mechanics really
doesn't play a role anyway this is a
pretty small system maybe a hundred
qubits or so but in many technologies
this number will be different depends on
the technology depends on the state of
the art depends on all kinds of
engineering processes and it seems that
some technologies that are talked about
now this this this need does happen on
the order of 50 to 500 or something okay
and so in addition to this plot I
suppose we should plot other lines of
constant dollars so since we're talking
about the cost per qubit these these
these curves are sort of go down with
the number of qubits so if you have 1
million dollars the cost per cubic
better be small if you're going to make
a lot of qubits and the point of course
is where these lines cross is how big of
the system you'll be able to build with
a certain budget and of course when you
have a vertical asymptote it means it
doesn't matter how much you spend you're
stuck at 100 cubits ok
and again this is not this is not a
physics lesson I guess I can't prove
that physically everything has to be
this way but in practice I believe this
is the case and so it turns out that I
think in the foreseeable future we'll be
dealing with quantum systems that are on
the order of hundreds of qubits or
something which is not so big but of
course that's not the only the only
story here if you have only a few
hundred qubits and you want 100 million
you have to figure out somehow
how to modularize the system make it
multi-core in a way and adopt adopt
concepts from classical computing
architecture and that's not my feel at
all but I'm always a student and and
like many of us in this field we alert
we will learn from high level computer
architectures and of course this is a
big topic in the quantum group here here
at Google very interested in these
issues ok with that
editorial and speaking on something I
know very little about this is total
guesswork of course I think it's not too
far removed from reality I'm going to
move on and talk about hardware are
there any questions yet hopefully not
because I probably can't answer
okay any question somebody come up to
the microphone right in the middle then
okay and again feel free at any time to
rush up there and and yell at me if you
want okay so let's get into hardware and
as Massoud mentioned I've been involved
with this field for for a number of
years now and in the last few years
things have really changed and I think
this is maybe typify by the fact that we
have now pretty much two technologies
that are sorting to separate themselves
from the rest of the field so what is a
quantum technology a quantum technology
is is is a system that can be
sufficiently isolated to to store
superpositions of values now the laws of
quantum mechanics tell us that
superpositions are fine we can store any
quantum attribute can be prepared in a
superposition of States as long as as
long as you don't look as long as long
as you don't measure as long as the
environment is not in flowing
influencing the system in a way that we
can't compute so in quantum mechanics we
typically talk about the fiction of an
isolated system you know you know the
analogy to Schrodinger's cat the cat
that's both dead and alive well to me
the what what's strange is not the cat
being dead and alive what's strange is
that the box of the cat sits in is
totally leak-free nothing observes this
cat there's nothing from the outside
environment that can get in and that's
the hard part
that's the hard part and it's the weird
thing in quantum physics that we can
think of isolated systems now in the
laboratory nothing is perfectly isolated
but it can be sufficiently isolated to
do things to do interesting quantum
computations in a time that's much
faster than it takes the environment to
leak in so as I as I mentioned these two
technologies individual atoms that are
that are held in a vacuum chamber and
superconducting circuits of wire at very
low temperature these look really
interesting now and we're seeing efforts
to build systems at a fairly interesting
sizeable scale approaching hundreds of
qubits and so forth
and here I point out some of the some of
the state of the art and and positive
sides of these are consistent and also
some of the problems and what's neat
about these two platforms is that
they're somewhat complementary
superconducting circuits can take
advantage of existing fabrication
technologies you can print you can order
a thousand cubits if you printed on a
circuit board of course wiring them up
is another matter it's very difficult
things have to be held at very low
temperatures atomic ions on the other
hand they don't come with wires you get
to wire them up externally with laser
beams that's good and bad it's good
because we can reconfigure the
connections I'll talk a little more
about this top platform of course this
is this is what I work on so you can
wire them up in a reconfigurable way but
it requires lasers it requires lasers
that have low noise and so forth and
these are fairly exotic types of
hardware to imagine in a computer where
as super gating circuits involve
radiofrequency sources sort of
conventional currents and voltages that
we all that we all deal with that
conventional computers deal with
superconductors have to be capped at
very low temperatures the the whole chip
and the surrounding has to be held at
milli kelvins above absolute zero
whereas trapped ions they can work in
room-temperature apparatus we probably
want to go to 4 Kelvin for technical
reasons but they have to be in a vacuum
chamber so it's like we've gone back to
the days of vacuum tubes so so what you
should what you should take away from
these these two these two comparisons is
that whereas superconducting circuits
are somewhat exotic compared to CMOS
these trapped atomic ions are really
exotic this is hardware that that lacks
an engineering presence that that we
have in superconductors and and so it's
no surprise that of the big investments
in quantum computing in the last few
years this is probably not an exhaustive
list but what's notable is that there
have been several very large investments
in particular Hardware on the
superconducting side of course the the
collaboration between
this office and and the group at Santa
Barbara is quite notable IBM itself is
investing heavily in this field Lincoln
labs up north of Boston has a smaller
effort but these are big efforts really
devoted toward building something up and
this is something new in the field now
on the atomic physics side most of this
work in addition to university style
research is is funded through the
government at this stage and while
Lockheed and and Honeywell and a few few
private outfits are starting to look at
this it's still we're still going to lag
I think a few years behind
superconductors I think both of these
both of these technologies though will
sort of I think learn from each other
right now and I'm going to now move on
and talk a little bit about this exotic
type hardware maybe haven't heard about
it too much I do mention at the bottom
here there there are many other quantum
platforms that look interesting but I
would say they're still in the
exploratory stage the researchy stage
where say atoms and superconductors were
10 20 years ago yes question
he said they complement each other
how's that oh thanks I should probably
expand on that a little more well the
one thing about super gummy circuits
this is a sort of a cartoon of one
superconducting Junction
you simply wire them to neighbors
through through capacitive wires or
inductive couplings and so forth they're
typically printed out on a
two-dimensional chip and you have
nearest neighbor interactions
represented by wires between nearest
neighbors you can just slightly more
than that so the connections are
hardwired you can't change the graph
without changing the chip trap dines on
the other hand they can have an all on
all coupling they can have long-range
interactions very long range
interactions they're reconfigurable from
the outside and so already that implies
that maybe the application of this
hardware might be different than the
application so in that sense they're
complementary I didn't mention speeds
and so forth but superconducting
circuits they can execute gates
fundamental operations at the nanosecond
and faster timescale very fast atomic
systems are with with a single exception
I might note in a little while are quite
slower on the order of microseconds or
even a little slower than that the
memory times the coherence time if
super-gang qubits is typically
microseconds but again that there's a
big spread depending on exactly how the
how they're connected I don't write the
time well I guess I do here these atoms
they're the same isotope of the same
element and they're basically atomic
clocks they're incredibly good memories
there's really nothing there they're
standards so they have very long memory
times so you can imagine I mean in the
long run I could look 50 years in the
long run if none of this other stuff
develops you could imagine the
superconducting systems doing fast
computations and the trapped ions being
the memory I don't know that's that's
maybe maybe a longshot because you have
to somehow couple them in the quantum
way but in that sense they are
complementary maybe the most important
thing is that there's a lot of
engineering there's the LSI of these
things we don't have any of that in
in in atomic physics we don't have the
engineering okay so let me talk about
trapped atomic ion so here's a picture
now you can see already this wasn't very
well engineered well actually I think it
was but it was clearly hand assembled
here we have a bunch of electrodes
inside of a vacuum chamber that window
is four inches across this steel thing
is a it's a microscope objective one
inch in diameter and it is imaging a
bunch of atoms that are held in this gap
right there so these are gold electrodes
that were plated on a ceramic substrate
there's a couple layers of them you can
see the wires this is not you know this
is not Intel's work this is our work it
has an is this looks like a university
laboratory doesn't it but when you make
when you apply appropriate voltages to
these electrodes you can create you can
create basically a potential that will
store charged atoms in free space so
these atoms are hovering in free space
which is a great ingredient for a qubit
because that means they're isolated
there's no surface there's no gas it's a
vacuum chamber there's very little gas
that's not a solid it's anatomically
perfect little crystal here and here we
have this is a picture maybe it's a half
a second integration on a camera of
about 15 or so ytterbium atoms ions
ytterbium plus ions now each atom here
is separated from its neighbor by
several microns and this is just a this
is just a compromise we're squeezing
them together but they repel each other
so there's this the form of equilibrium
spacing you'll notice first of all the
spacing is not uniform that's sort of
not a big deal in the long run we know
how to make them uniformly spaced but
there's no need to for such a small
system and secondly the reason you see
these atoms at all is that we're shining
lasers on the atoms and they're
fluorescing now atoms are unlike solid
matter in that atoms are very
discriminating they only respond to very
narrow bands of color in fact this light
here is in the near ultraviolet and we
have to to
stabilize and make make accurate the
wavelength of this laser to about nine
digits of accuracy every day and and
this is a lot of the classical control
that goes in the back of one of these
atomic experiments we're seeing here
diffraction-limited spots from a bunch
of point sources these atoms are very
cold their laser cooled I'm not going to
talk at all about that their laser
cooled to very low temperatures and and
they form this they form this linear
crystal and each atom fluoresce is very
strongly but the fuzzball here is given
by the diffraction of this lens so at a
way the atoms are actually about a
thousand times smaller
that's exaggerating about maybe 300
times smaller than this blob but because
they're because of the diffraction
they're sort of spread out in space so
don't think of this as the electron
cloud that's basically just just a
single it's like looking at a star in a
telescope you have some resolution limit
but fortunately it's enough that we can
discriminate we can label these and call
each one a qubit and and we can
manipulate them optically with other
laser beams and I'm going to talk a
little bit about that so let's go inside
one of these atoms atoms are complicate
you question
so the what's the uncertainty in one of
these atoms position how does it compare
to the size of the blob the size of the
blob is about is about one micron and
the uncertainty position is about one
hundredth of that but Advanta meters so
comparable to the atomic radius itself
or i'm so bigger than that it is it's
quite a bit bigger it turns out the
fundamental limit here is also given by
quantum mechanics if we know where an
atom is it must have residual energy
velocity and that compromise gives us a
minimum spot a minimum spread in
position of a few nanometers okay and
fortunately that parameter doesn't
really play a role in anything talk
about oh yeah and what is the atomic
radius the atomic radius for most atoms
the meters is typically a tenth of a
nanometer or so okay
yeah you know my I mean I would call
myself an atomic physicist but I very
rarely think of the atoms as more than
just a two-level qubit or other levels
that we use but the motion the
electronic motion of all these internal
core electrons doesn't matter now I also
list a bunch of groups here that are
doing a research involved in trapped
atomic ions and I like to point this out
there maybe 30 or 40 groups in the world
playing around with this system with
with with research involved in quantum
information science because 20 years ago
there was even 15 years ago there was
only one group doing this and this was a
group I worked with with Dave Weiland at
NIST and Boulder and since the mid to
late 90s since quantum computing really
took off this field has exploded
mostly at universities but not entirely
there are groups in industry for
instance at Honeywell and at Lockheed
and government laboratories like Sandia
National Laboratories and in Georgia
Tech Research Institute but the field is
growing explosively over the last 10
years ok so let's look inside one of
these atoms where we store the quantum
information well it turns out you turn
me I won't get into too much atomic
physics except to note that you terbium
plus you might ask why this atom well
the ytterbium plus is a very simple atom
and that it has only one outer electron
all the inner electrons are paired up
and we don't excite those there so I
think of those as sort of frozen out now
the nucleus has lots of protons and
Newton neutrons but their spins are also
paired so that whole nucleus effectively
has a spin 1/2 so the nucleus is a qubit
this outer electron is a qubit 1/2 and
1/2 so it's exactly like that of an
isolated hydrogen atom and as such that
the atomic structure is exactly like
that in hydrogen and so here the
vertical axis denotes energy and the
horizontal axis are just different
states and this is the so-called ground
state hyperfine splitting in the
ytterbium ion you can tell them a
physicists not a computer scientist I
label this is up and down instead of 1 &amp;amp;
0 but you can think of this
the qubit state 1 and the qubit state 0
now States these two states in the atom
represent their so-called hyperfine
levels think of them as different states
of spin of the nucleus and electron
taken together now it turns out that
exactly these types of states currently
define the second so this is basically
an atomic clock the and the reason it's
an atomic clock is that this energy
splitting is very well-defined it's the
same here in Los Angeles as it is in
Washington DC you can take your own one
your own 171 you terbium ion and you
will measure twelve point six gigahertz
point six four to eight one two one one
eight etc gigahertz
it's very well-defined it's a standard
and also note that there's atomic
physics in these two particular levels
they don't shift very readily with
external perturbations this is an ion it
spends its time and zero electric field
so there's no electric field shift and
also it's very well shielded from
magnetic fields turns out with
laboratory magnetic field noise this the
coherence time of this of these pair of
levels can be as high as several seconds
without any work without any shielding
if we want to go to 15 minute coherence
times we could easily do that it has
been done we don't need to because all
of our operations are much faster than a
second okay so there's the qubit within
each atom it's give us a spin state
inside the atom okay well in addition to
storing quantum bits we can also measure
the state of a single quantum bit or
many quantum bits and this is very
straightforward in fact it's simply you
shine light on at a particular color one
state glows the other state doesn't and
so the atomic physics here is that when
we shine laser beams in this case it's
in the near ultraviolet part of the
spectrum this spin up state it turns out
that we can we can excite the spin up to
an excited state and it returns right
where it started and it does it again
and again and again it's sort of like an
amplifier and this is this is real data
on a camera the image of a single atom
prepared
and spin up or one if you want and this
is a collected histogram of the number
of photons we collected on a simple
photomultiplier tube in in half a
millisecond and this is a several
hundred experiments we see an average of
ten clicks when we're in the state up
and if we're in the state down the same
laser is twelve point six gigahertz away
from this line and this line only has a
width of 20 megahertz so the point is
the atom is largely transparent if it's
in the state dome and here's data same
experiment the only difference is we
prepared the atom in the other state so
you can clearly see a good detector here
even in a single shot if we see light
more than one click that's background
light or something or you know just
small errors on the detector dark counts
if we see more than one click we can we
can be sure with very high probability
that the atom is in the state one or
spin-up and if we see one or zero it's
in the state down now we typically
measure 99% discrimination here there's
a there's a slight 1% overlap of these
distributions but we can get to four
nines of this measurement without too
much extra work again we don't need to
yet when we have hundreds of qubits we
will okay all right so that's sort of
the background in the qubit and it's
measurement well how do we do something
interesting how do we make super
positions how do we make logic gates
well you need qubits to interact to make
a logic gate like a NAND gate requires
two inputs and the output depends on the
states of those two inputs well these
atoms don't naturally interact very
strongly the the qubit States are spin
within the atoms and five microns is
actually miles away atomically speaking
so whether one atom is up or down the
other one doesn't really care but what
is strongly coupled is the motion of the
atoms you should think of these atoms as
a bunch of masses connected by Springs
if you move one then they all know it
and this is exactly the connect the
interaction we use to do to do something
interesting and we do this again with
laser beams and
in this case the laser beams there's I
don't want to get too bogged down in the
atomic physics here the laser beams
don't don't couple don't couple to an
excited state and cause fluorescence
they are they're detuned from any
excited state so they don't directly
scatter off the atom but we apply two
laser beams that have a precise
difference frequency matching or very
near this this this number here twelve
point six Giga it's when we do that in
fact there's a coherent transition we
call we call it a two photon transition
there's a coherent transition between up
and down and we can do this sort of in
the dark it's it's it's not a
measurement it doesn't tell you whether
you're in one or the other it just flips
spins this is sort of a very simple way
of doing a gate like a not gate flipping
a spin coherently or in quantum
mechanics we can do something called the
square root of not which has no place in
classical gates its square root of
naught is that gate which when applied
twice is a not gate so we can flip we
can flip the spin we can do a cube root
of naught and so forth that just depends
on the power and the time of application
of this laser beam so you can already
see right away what the bottle I hope
you see what the bottleneck and all of
our experiments are it's this laser
controlling it controlling its power
controlling its spectrum controlling
that it doesn't point and move around on
these on these individual dots okay now
one really nice feature of the ytterbium
ion is that this detuning by the way
it's not drawn much disco it should be
about a third of the way between these
two for technical reasons that's sort of
the optimal place to work between these
two excited States
I didn't even define them doesn't really
matter and it turns out for this
particular atom that wavelength is very
friendly
it's 355 nanometers you might not know
what that is but it's it's the third
harmonic of a very popular color that's
used all around and in fact that color
is used for all nuclear fusion
experiments laser confined fusion and
the reason it's popular this is a
slightly difference on 3:55 but it's
based on a particular nonlinear crystal
that works very well called the
aggghhhhh crystal if you've ever seen a
green laser pointer that's the second
harmonic it 532 so here we have a pretty
big laser at Livermore labs and the
point here is that you can get as much
power of this lasers you want to pay for
now we don't typically use the the
megawatts of power they have at
Livermore we instead use a much more
modest version a this is a few feet the
cross on the table but it produces laser
pulses and I'm not going to get into the
details but this is that one example of
doing very fast operations on atomic
systems we can control a single atomic
qubit at tens of Pico second type type
timings it's as long as you have enough
power and this takes a few watts of
average power to do that okay so I think
I've given you all the tools then for
how we how we manipulate measure and
store quantum information and atoms now
let me give you after let's say I'm
about halfway done now I can give you my
outline which is basically how to wire
them together and how to make a system
big I'm not going to talk about all
these in great detail but I will talk
about one this top one again the natural
way to wire them would be through their
Coulomb interaction their their
repulsion and let me give you the very
high-level view of how quantum gate
works involving the Coulomb interaction
okay we have a bunch of atoms here in a
chain and let's say we want to do it we
want to do a and gate or some some type
of a quantum gate between any two of
these atoms well here's what we do we
shine we sign two laser beams that only
hit the two atoms in question and these
laser beams are tuned in a very special
way that allow us to apply a force to
the atoms it pushes the atoms but very
importantly it pushes the atoms in a
direction that depends on their internal
state and this can be done based on
selection rules of the atomic
transitions and we do this with our 355
nanometer lasers in this example if the
atom is in the state spin up it gets
pushed upward if it's in state spin
gets pushed downward these are called
optical dipole forces are very
well-known and there's some displacement
Delta in space between the two up and
down now the physics what's happening
here is that we're going to consider the
energy change between all four
configurations of these of these two
spins okay now if they're both state
spin up they both move up together the
Coulomb interaction is the same as it
always was they're the same distance
apart if they're both spin down they
move down together so the Coulomb energy
doesn't change and for the moment we're
going to forget about all the other ions
that's actually in one limit of this
that's that's fine just forget about
those but if those two atoms are
different states down up or up down
they're a little further apart from each
other and it's that tiny change of
distance that modulates that changes
their Coulomb energy that allows us to
do an interesting operation so if you
look at the math here the change in
energy this is the Coulomb energy from
from when they're on this on this little
diagonal here minus their original
Coulomb energy and this is the
expression and in physics this is known
as a dipole dipole interaction we have
an effective electric dipole charge of
the ion times the separation divided
squared divided by R cubed and these
energies can be very large and this is
exactly what we use to do gates why is
this a gate well if you look at the four
configurations of those two spins again
only the two mixed States suffer this
energy change and in fact it's the same
energy change so in quantum mechanics we
add this phase factor the energy
decreased a little bit for a certain
amount of time and so that determines
its phase factor and when that phase
factor is PI over two these two numbers
here in front are minus I and it turns
out that's equivalent to a
controlled-not gate or a NAND gate it's
the sort of bread-and-butter of the gate
model of quantum computing it's a
universal gate when taken along with
other more trivial gates
and so this is the physics of what's
going on we're applying forces to these
atoms okay questions on that there are
many different regimes of this this is
one particular I didn't want to get too
detailed but this is first pointed out
by the way only months after Ignacio
serac and Peter Zola learned about
Shor's factoring algorithm they they're
their atomic theorists and they learned
about this math breakthrough and they
said well look there's an atomic system
that actually we can develop gates for
and it's been refined and improved over
the years and many laboratories now
operate gates like this on small
collections of ions including our lab
and in our lab we've made a lot of
progress by not focusing on individual
atoms but do something a little easier
and that is just hit them all with the
big fat laser beam then you don't have
to worry about the focusing turning on
and off of individual beams now in this
case we're applying a force on every one
of these atoms and let's say it's the
same as I mentioned if the atom of state
spin up it goes up to the state spin
down it goes down so this force remember
it has this funny form this means that
if you're in the state spin up you have
a plus force if you're in the state spin
down you have a minus force and so an
interesting question here is it's not
exactly a quantum computing question but
it's more of a physics question what is
the configuration of these of these
qubits the spins if you want what is the
configuration that minimizes the energy
under the influence of this force okay
so if they're all remember if they're
all spin up they're just going to all
move up together same energy they're all
spin down they're going to move down
together so the energy doesn't change
there well it turns out that this
configuration where they're alternating
up down up down up down it's it's not
too hard to show that this is this
minimizes the energy and you can kind of
see all the atoms are on average a
little further apart from all the others
you have to do a complicated sum to show
this rigorously but it's true slightly
more interesting is that there's another
state that's equally low in
it's this one the other guy so these are
two states these are so-called Niall
ordered states of an anti ferromagnetic
Hamiltonian anti fat magnetism means the
neighboring particles anti-aligned and
it turns out you might imagine if we
make this state in the right way we
might have both of them at the same time
since they're both the ground state so
this is maybe an interesting place to
think about doing some physics now of
course this this force here doesn't flip
spins at all so you're not going to find
the ground state by just applying this
force you have to somehow mix the spins
around and this is afforded by applying
a so-called transverse magnetic field so
depending on the relative strength of
this magnetic field and the force the
atoms will either sort of spin around
the magnetic field or they'll align
according to this force so this this
term sort of allows you to mix and
sample the entire space of spins this is
a very fundamental model in physics it's
called the transverse Ising model it's
sort of the first thing you learn in
solid-state physics and it's the
simplest quantum model that admits a
phase transition a quantum phase
transition so it's actually a good place
to think about doing some experiments
and indeed experiments have been done
it's sort of a little cottage industry
of stimulating magnetic spin models in
trapped ions starting from the
theoretical proposals the same serac and
his collaborator Diego for us and many
years later we see a whole slew of
experiments about half of these are from
from art from our group um since I'm
running out of time a little bit I want
to this this slide is so busy I'm not
going to get into it in much detail
except to note that the force we apply
for technical reasons is at a right
angle and it creates sort of a running
standing wave over all the atoms we
don't gently push the atoms up and
gently push them down we push them at a
it's a time varying force that is near
the normal mode frequencies of this
chain that gives us a much big resonant
enhancement and all I want to do is
point to the end of this nasty math and
that we end up with this Ising model
which is a coupled spin model here and
the coefficients that couples spin I and
spin J are basically all on all every
spin talks to every other spin this is
so-called long-range model it's not a
nearest neighbor only model and there's
there's some math behind this but the
the coupling matrix between spin I and J
depends on laser parameters we can tune
the power and the tuning of that laser
to change the the configuration change
the model even change the range of the
model how long range
how long range the interaction is so
this is sort of a testbed to do what are
known as adiabatic quantum simulations
in this case this is a cartoon from from
one of seth Lloyd's paper many subfloors
papers many years ago the idea is to
prepare a bunch of spins in a trivial
ground state in our case we prepared in
the ground state of this part of the
Hamiltonian this is the transverse field
and then we then we hopefully adiabatic
Li turn on this part of the Hamiltonian
what does the adiabatic mean it means
that it preserves the entropy it doesn't
doesn't add excitation Ziff you want so
if you do this adiabatic Li you turn B
down to zero and J up from zero then you
should evolve to the ground state the
lowest energy state of this model which
can be interesting and this is the
so-called adiabatic model and
experimentally we we lower the magnetic
field according to some profile and we
turn on the the Ising coupling at the
beginning B is much bigger than J at the
end B can go almost nearly to zero
whereas J is still on and again I'll
note that these these Ising couplings
they fall off with distance with the
polynomial power law and this power law
can can extend over the whole chain or
over just a few neighbors okay
I just want to give you a brief glimpse
at some some some early data on this
type of a simulation this is with only
10 spins though and remember 10/10
qubits is only 2 to the 10 States
so there's 1024 configurations
that's not big enough to be
earth-shattering to the 10th we can
diagonalize 2 to the 10th by 2 to the
10th matrices nevertheless the whole
point here is scaling up to much larger
numbers where we can't it turns out that
number is more like 2 to the 30th so
we're not with 10 cubits we can model
everything on a PC or a fancy PC with 30
or 40 we certainly can't and so
everything here is promised upon doing
something better in the future that will
put us in a land where we can't we can't
simulate what's going on okay so here
are a couple of images of 10 ions here
their calibration they're all in state
up remember they bright they're bright
and stayed up here they're all dark
stayed down well we did this experiment
2,600 times the same experiment we tried
to adiabatic ly we prepared the atoms
along a transverse field and we tried to
adiabatic ly lower the field so that we
were prepared in the ground state of an
anti ferromagnetic Ising model in fact
the the range the the power law is one
in other words the interaction fell off
like 1 over distance to the 1 power
fairly in a long range we're not
infinite range well out of those 2600
runs we found about 17% of the time we
got one of these two states this is a
very direct measurement by the way every
time we do an experiment we simply shoot
the laser and see which atoms are bright
which are dark if we can directly
measure the quantum state here we have
the expected nail ordered one of them
here we have the others and they're
roughly half and half but this is only
17% what happened to the other 83% well
we can look we can see exactly what
happened to the other 83%
well here's 8 percent of that 83% it
sort of looks like Niall ordered except
we have a domain wall these four these
four levels are actually degenerate
they're expected to be and so 8 percent
of the time we had these states these
are excited States so we were not
adiabatic apparently we really made
excitations along the way here the next
excited States one
the domain walls moved further out okay
so the dynamics of this of this
experiment are actually really difficult
to simulate we weren't adiabatic but
simulate exactly what's going on it is a
little tricky even with just ten spins
so here's a distribution of all 1024
configurations and the probability since
we started with the transverse field
this is uh plus down to the tenth power
we have we have a superposition well
yeah we have we have populations of one
out of ten twenty four in each
configuration and then after the
simulation we see these two states also
known as 341 and 682 in decimal they pop
out and again they represent together 17
or 18 percent and then you have all this
other stuff this is real dynamics and
there's a lot of physics in what
populates those states and that's that's
sort of a vinter astir in the long run
now what about scaling up here's the
same experiment with 14 spins this time
there are 16,000 configurations and
we're paying the price already we only
see the ground state I don't know four
three or four percent of the time what's
happening is the gap is shrinking and
we're not going slower we should be
going slower and slower and slower in
this nor not so again this is a little
bit of a taste of sort of what we're
playing with right now and I'm sort of
running out of time but we're we're
having a lot of fun engineering various
types of Hamiltonians in a small chain
of between five and twenty spins or
including studying studying spin one
dynamics instead of cupids having three
levels that has actually some some
import for topologically encoded cubans
so why are we might you might ask why
didn't we stop at twenty why didn't we
just go all the way to 100 where I
claimed that cost function goes through
the roof well it turns out this is this
is a technical shortcoming of our
current apparatus
remember I said vacuum well the vacuum
is not perfect there is a background gas
and it turns out every atom that we trap
in in this system suffers a collision
with the background gas about
every half hour and our pressures that
means that if we have 30 of them the
whole crystal will melt every minute and
it turns out it takes about a minute or
two to recover from that we don't lose
them entirely we just have to recall
them it takes a few minutes because
we're not very smart at it at this point
but that means that we're never taking
data is by that time another collision
happens so we're limited by a background
pressure to about 20 spins so in the
future we sort of know how to get around
this the the apparatus is room
temperature but by going to Fort Kelvin
and this is a picture of the cryo system
we have and there's a cartoon of our
next generation trap will install we
should be able to get get pressures that
are about 10,000 times better maybe the
only a thousand times better but the
point is when we store a crystal then
we're basically shutting off the
shutting off the background collisions
now crystal will last for months it
should and of course we have to we have
to set this thing up and so we're well
on our way in fact filled rooms in the
audience here he's postdoc in group and
a research scientist who design this and
Paul Hess has come along and he's going
to implement this next year so I want to
start to step back now and I'm not going
to talk much about much about these a
little bit but remember this cost
function if you put if you put a hundred
eyes in a trap I think we can probably
deal with all the motion of a hundred
ions imagine having a hundred pendulums
connected by Springs that's complicated
but you could imagine engineering the
springs just right so that you could
deal with that complexity I don't think
we'll be able to do that with ten
thousand though and so that cost
function at some point is going to go
through the roof and we have to think
about how to modularize the system how
to connect to another group of 100 if
hundreds of magic number put 100 here
under there 100 there
and somehow couple them now one model is
sort of brute force in fact Dave
Wineland and I'm Dave cope in T proposes
many years ago and that is to make a
very fancy set of electrodes where we
sort of have the individual atoms
surfing between different zones in
between computations and
well this is a nice PowerPoint ion trap
it's easy to have electrodes floating in
free space but in fact there's a great
deal of progress in making ion traps out
of silicon this is this is a chip
centimeter on a side that was built at
Sandia National Laboratories Georgia
Tech Research Institute it's a DoD lab
in Atlanta is getting on board as well
Dave Lyons group at NIST Boulder
probably has the most complex trap these
are surface traps the ions actually
hover above the surface and this allows
you to pull the wires through through
the bottom for large-scale processing so
this is something you know these chips
they're just starting to get used
Honeywell I mentioned in Lockheed
they're dealing with they're dealing and
fabricating chips to do exactly this I
want to talk slightly bigger and that is
to scale over not just ions on a single
chip but actually communicate
information from one ship to another
chip or two sets of ions that are so far
apart that you wouldn't want to shuttle
them well it turns out we can we can
also do this by coupling our qubits with
photons and I just want to talk a few
minutes on how that works and the large
scale this is sort of a concept picture
the Lawrence scalar here then is to take
individual modules these boxes might
contain 100 or whatever your magic
number is 50 10 100 200 and then have
fibers coming from one or more of the
qubits inside a module and have optical
switching networks allow you to entangle
atoms between different modules and this
is a pure this is a truly modular
architecture if you can make one red
thing work if you can hook up to red red
modules you can think of hooking up
2,000 red modules I don't know what the
cost function is there but it's not
going to be exponential probably more
like linear maybe quadratic I'm not sure
but the
well that's a good question that what
you're doing here is limiting the
connectivity because there's near full
connectivity within a module and here
we're sort of is the weak link here
would be maybe only 10% of these have an
optical link so you're right that's this
is important there's overhead involved
in getting complete connectivity maybe
you need more modules you so these are
really good
high-level questions that I'm starting
to learn about was there another
question could you ask that question or
just restate the question so people that
are on air can hear what it was oh okay
you want to do it okay so the question
was in this in this modular architecture
is it fully connected and the answer is
no it's not not as connected as the
atoms within a module are connected
those atoms can be very well almost
fully connected but these these optical
interfaces are sort of weak links in the
sense that not every atom in one module
is connected to every other atom in
another module so this is a great
compromise that I hope computer
architects start to study and I think
this is true in any quantum architecture
we need to study these things what are
the trade-offs paces what are the cost
functions but the important point I
think the one the one word that is
important is modular any quantum
architecture has to be module if you're
going to make it really big and
therefore useful well let me now step
way down jump down off the cliff from
the bottom looking up again and tell you
how this mapping from qubit to photon
works this is sort of the last last I
want to talk about well here's our atom
if you remember our qubit was stored in
these two levels well we can shine a
different laser beam on on a single atom
it's a fast pulse that puts the atom in
the excited state this pulse is on the
order of a picosecond long it's not hard
to do that and then what happens is in
the next 10 nano seconds this state is
unstable it will decay in fact it will
decay along one of these two paths
it could decay back to where it started
but in fact due to some tricks that
doesn't happen as long as you observe
the light in
in appropriate direction it turns out to
be along a magnetic field that you apply
and when you do that now we have a
single photon that was emitted from a
single atom and better yet the
polarization of this photon denoted by
Sigma plus and Sigma minus this
polarization sorry for me back up blue
this polarization is entangled with the
internal state of the atom but I didn't
talk about this but these two states are
actually not so good there they're very
noisy state so when this happened we
immediately zapped the atomic population
with microwave fields this is all very
clean and very well established we
returned the atom to the space of the
qubit we want and what we end up in what
we end up with is an entanglement
between the atoms the internal qubit
state of the atom and the polarization
is Photon the trick here is that this
photon could have been lost sometimes
are tricky they're not like matter they
don't hang around they can hit Wells
they can go all over the place they can
get lost in a fiber they can hit a
detector and the detector won't fire
there's lots of loss mechanisms and in
fact this is a very lossy channel you
can't collect all the light so I say I'd
say this is entangled but it's a very
weak entanglement in fact you can only
say this state is entangled if you post
select it on the condition of knowing a
photon is there we don't know photons
there until we detect it and therefore
destroy it so this type of entangle is
actually useless typical atom photon
entanglement is useless when taken in
isolation in fact the probability of
having this state is only about a half a
percent due to all these losses we
collect 10% of the light 20% of that
makes it into a fiber 25% of that
registers it clicked on a detector so
already half a percent but what's magic
is if we do this twice something cool
happens well we do it twice or we
squared so if this is a half a percent
and that was a half a percent well the
probability of getting two photons is a
half a percent squared which is really
small to analyze five or something but
when we take those two photons and
overlap them on a beam splitter this is
really giving into the
the woods here when we overlap them on a
beam splitter it turns out this beam
splitter erases which path it tells it
erases the information of which photon
came from which atom and remember the
photon can be one of two different
polarizations so by by detecting
appropriate coincidence events there are
two photons and so you wait till two
detectors fire and when they do you
basically entangled these two spins and
the problem is it's really slow because
there's a repetition rate of the whole
experiment you're trying and trying and
trying but P squared is the probability
of success so in fact this rate is
really it's painfully slow right now
it's on the order of five to ten Hertz
really really slow nobody wants a
computer with a five Hertz clock right
so this is one reason I said that we
that link is weak it's slow but and I'll
show you what sort of the state of the
art right now is that of this of this
modular architecture we have linked two
modules with multiple ions in them about
five years ago we were at a Mille Hertz
that's really slow you have to wait ten
minutes for a single click that's no fun
right now we're at about ten Hertz and
we know how to get to the ten to fifty
kilohertz range which is a lot better
but it's still you might wonder is it
too slow that's an open question and you
know this experiment having two modules
this sort of looks like in the lab and
again I'm exposing our basement
University style here here we have two
vacuum chambers and there are fibers
that come out from each of these and in
this setup we indeed teleported the
information from one qubit to another
now we could say we teleported the atom
if you want if you if you want to use
full license on that word
well the atoms personality is given
entirely by the qubit it's the same atom
same isotope so if you if you actually
teleported the atom like we think of
Captain Kirk going from A to B you
wouldn't have been able to tell the
difference all we did is we move the
quantum information the unknown quantum
information from here to there without
destroying it and that's called
teleportation it's a it's a good useful
protocol for moving information around
but never think it will be applied to
big things
okay single qubits find maybe 20 cubits
maybe thousand cubits but not not ten to
the twenty five cubits which is me okay
so and to see to see a back view of this
same lab you can sort of see the issue
here those two those two vacuum chambers
are right here by the way and all this
other stuff and control electronics are
devoted to the lasers that excite the
atoms and allow us to measure the
individual spin now I don't mean to
scare you here it is kind of scary each
piece of this table we understand fully
and attack each piece is trivial but
there are thousands of pieces so 0.99 to
the thousandth is still zero so you have
to I mean I mean it's it's a real art to
run one of these experiments but there's
just no question this thing can be
miniaturized in a very big way and this
is something that hasn't happened we
have to have this happen in this
platform and you know we like to step
back and think of the evolution of
classical computing I would claim that
the physics between this device and this
device didn't change now people would
object there was beautiful material
science that came from that but the
basic physics of a transistor is the
same but this I mean this looks
ridiculous you can't miniaturize that in
fact if you if you if you slam the door
shut on that lab it wouldn't work so now
we have the LSI of course it's the
miniaturization than making the
footprint smaller that we need and the
thing about atomic physics is that
hasn't been tried yet nobody has
engineered these systems I'm convinced
it can be done I don't know what the
cost function is but I know it I know
that I know that the efforts in the next
five or ten years will at least tell us
a little bit about how far we can push
this this type of vision and again I
think I want to back up and say that the
atomic this atomic view of quantum
computing
it really is complimentary to
superconductors I think super Dutch does
have the edge in terms of right now
being able to get chips but the
individual superconductors the qubits
they're all a little different and when
you scale that system up the calibration
not just in the qubits but in the
pairwise interactions
get to be a major part of dealing with
the entire system now we will have
calibration issues with these atoms not
the individual qubits
but the lasers that couple them together
so some of those problems will be will
persist but the fundamental qubits
themselves as a memory are I would say
more fundamentally scalable than any
solid-state because they're atomically
perfect okay with that so this is a
dated picture of some of the researchers
in our group and I point to two
collaborators in particular Phil because
he's here in the audience he's about to
go to the University of Indiana in the
fall to start an EIN trap lab as our
these two other postdocs Brian is going
to Lockheed in Colorado Graham's going
to Honeywell so we're farming people out
to do big things I also point to a close
colleague of mine junk saying Kim who is
an electrical engineer in a certain
expert in MEMS and photonics and micro
electronics he's been doing atomic
physics for 10 years now and he has a
systems level view of how to make things
big and I work very closely with him on
this vision of building something in the
in the next five years five or ten years
that hopefully can do an important
problem in quantum computing and I
should also thank our funding source
currently is in that big dome there okay
thank you for your attention
so are there any more questions
Chris seems like the basic clock time is
one challenge and I entrap systems
therefore any so the computation has to
be large enough to be able to make up
for it through better scaling and did
you have any sense out of at what
problem sizes are for what problem types
and accordingly
you would get a head of classical method
so so the question cancer can concerns
overall computation times and I guess
it's true that one
you know the gates that have been
developed so far were the ions are in
there sort of the megahertz or sub
megahertz type range maybe 100 kilohertz
is a typical gate speed I guess to two
ways ago that there is research pushing
toward much faster gates as I as I
mentioned a little bit that's a little
speculative it requires a lot more laser
power if you want to make it go faster
you need proportionately more laser
power and that has its own problems but
even at 100 kilohertz if you know if
it's question between a computation
taking taking one hour and ten years
that's sort of obvious but I guess I
haven't spent enough time looking at
problems and and what you know the Shore
factoring algorithm is probably one of
the hardest you could imagine with fault
tolerant encoding it probably requires a
billion gates ten million cubits or
something like this to factor an
interesting number so if you do a
billion gates in each one is it as a 100
kilohertz that's a problem it's 10 to
the 5 seconds so I guess I'm I'm sort of
wavering I'm not answering your question
very well I just don't know what depends
on the size of the problem I guess I'm
heartened a little bit in the sense that
if you build a device with 100 or 200
qubits you I don't know how many gates
you would have to do to make something
interesting with a few hundred qubits
it's probably some power of 200 not a
huge power I I'm not sure if that if the
numbers are on the order of a million or
so I I'm not too bothered by that that
would be a 10 second computation so you
know much more than me about how you
know how complex optimization problems
might be the state space is enormous
maybe maybe this clock speed does get to
be an issue but I'll admit I had them I
I guess I haven't thought about it as
much it's a good question thank you
maybe maybe that'll limit the ion traps
to doing certain types of problems more
accurately but slower and maybe in the
long run or some hybrid approach where
you have the fast processor and then
slow on
you're asking about talking about the
going into the low energy state and the
anti chimera antiferromagnetic order one
thing I wasn't quite clear on when you
were bringing that state up was at the
time you're doing the anneal into that
state which was sort of usually
successful but but as successful you'd
like because of the domain walls was
that actually still a superstition
before you measured it or was it
inherently in a single state long before
you got to the point of having a look at
it oh that's a good question and we
haven't done too many experiments
showing the coherence between these two
states turns out that to show I should
go back to this this global picture to
show coherence between these two states
there's a way to do it it's very well
prescribed it requires very high
fidelity preparation of that state
basically the fidelity has to be 1 minus
1 over N so for for 10 spins it has to
be at least 90% and we're not there so
that most direct measurement we weren't
able to do now the group of Reiner blot
in Innsbruck has shown coherence in a
different system he's shown coherence of
up to I think 14 spins in particular
states using that trick and also in a
separate experiment I didn't show the
data one sort of sanity check is to do
this 80 been a gram right here and then
and then before measuring reverse it now
of course we first do the experiment
will we measure and we get the
populations then we do the experiment
again and we reverse it and see if we
got the initial state now if there were
no superposition at this point and we
reverse it we will not get the initial
state it will be noisy and this is most
quantum experiments do this they measure
populations and then and then without
measuring you do something else to
measure the coherences and so for that
experiment we showed I think with
10 spins a fidelity of 70% reversal to
its original state so that indicates
there is coherence there it's very hard
to say exactly how much though these
these problems are really tricky with
many qubits showing many cubic Clarins
but very good question thank you for the
can you a couple of spins when you
couple of spins adjacently can you make
it an asymmetric couple so you can run
that AFM crystal as a shift register and
shift to the domain walls at the end
indeed I skipped a slide where we were
just shows you sort of a device where we
hope to have arbitrary icing couplings
it basically involves having individual
individual intensities on each spin and
that allows us to have an arbitrary
arbitrary map and so you could just
program it classically offline and
decide what you want to do in sure shift
registers and you can do gates this way
this is this is sort of this could be
the adiabatic model it could be a gate
this is discrete gate on any two spins
on and off and so forth so it's very
it's reconfigurable very flexible and
also say it's you're opening the door to
noise anytime you you know you have to
focus all these atoms all these beams on
individual atom the other issues you
have to deal with and this is where you
know robust engineering approach is
needed but in general yes we're thinking
about architectures where we do shifts
first-in first-out type operations and
so forth with these ion chains
thank you
