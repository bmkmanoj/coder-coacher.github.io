joining for these lightning talks my
name is still my Holly I'm currently
working as a postdoc in University of
California Santa Barbara and I would
like to take these next five minutes
doing my elevator pitch about work I've
been working on in the past year it's a
validation and monitoring of interface
contracts and specially in web
applications so the context in which I'm
doing my work is actually this so you
have a small web application on some
random server that's actually using a
third-party web service in the
background here i have amazon com as an
example but you could think of any other
web service provider that actually
provides functionality that can be used
in the background for any web
application and we're talking we're
thinking about these applications at the
message level so actually you have here
a request for example that the
application does to the amazon server
about a specific item and then amazon
replies with a list of items and in
particular we're thinking about these
messages in terms of their xml content
so we're actually working at the soap
xml level of monitoring and actually
when you interact with such a web
service there are some constraints that
you have to follow in order to have a
valid interaction with that service here
you have an example of five different
messages where you actually asked for
some item get the answer back create a
new shopping cart with some of these
items inside you have the response from
the web application give giving you a
cart ID and then you want to add one
more of one of these items into your
shopping cart and the application
replies you with an error message and
actually this is actually taken from one
of Amazon's web services and the
constraint is that you cannot add the
same item twice to the shopping cart and
this is an actual constraint and the
question is well how do I know about
these constraints how can i check these
things automatically and actually if you
look into this is a screenshot from
Amazon's actual documentation for that
service which is the e-commerce service
if you look in that documentation indeed
at some point in the documentation you
have the list of error messages and one
of them tells you what happens if you
try to add the same item twice to your
shopping cart so you shouldn't try that
so we invented a language where you can
express these kinds of properties so you
have properties over messages and then
we also have temporal operators that
express something about the sequence of
these messages and then we also have
some kind of quantification on elements
so that you don't need to repeat the
same property for all items in amazon's
catalog now and it's called LTL f 0 plus
and what we do is well two things we can
record the messages to a persistent
storage and then check this trace for
violations or we can also intercept
these messages as they are produced and
raise a flag when something bad happens
this is called runtime monitoring and B
beep is actually a tool that we produced
and it acts as a kind of policeman so
when the application so it hasn't memory
the kind of contract that it has to
monitor and then when the application
tries to send messages well if it's okay
it relays it to the application as
expected but if it's not it will block
the message and instead this mission
will be thrown away and the application
can be notified about the error so if
you want to add this monitor to a real
application well we have a tool you can
download it and then you just need to
include it to your application by doing
two modifications one to the HTML code
where you include a JavaScript file and
the other one in your JavaScript file
actually where you call our class that
does the monitoring and that's it and
then you have a contract file that
actually defines what are the properties
that the monitor wants to validate so
the take-home points to conclude is that
contract is a sequence of constraints on
a mixture of sequences of operation and
data parameters we have a tool let's
call BB that can monitor and enforce
these contracts at runtime it's open
source you can download it we have a
website and if you want one details I
have a flier here so if you want to have
a copy of this flyer well feel free to
do have one otherwise go to the website
and please do
me if you have any idea of application
for using this thing and thank you for
your attention thanks so I'm glad I'm
able to share with you a concern I had
ever since i've started my career and i
still have that concern today and
hopefully that can lead to discussion
today or tomorrow when i were to devil /
on any given day I had the open coming
to my desk and telling me Fred I found
you know five bugs okay whatever I'll
take a look later next day that some
person said you know today I found 20
bugs you know I walk you suck but well
it bring my attention so I look at the
book and find out that well a lot of
these bugs were not really while
business-critical and we can argue
what's business-critical and I didn't
have enough information about them how
to reduce the wrong the operating system
information about about that actual bug
oops then while i was working i saw you
know testing competition which is good
it's good for motivation it's good for
tester but the goal was to find a
maximum bugs which for me was was a big
strange and then in some objective for
tester the goal was to find you know the
maximum amount of bug I was bothered by
that and no later than today a person
received an award which is good i'm sure
she did a great job but there was one
common that bother me and it was well
she did a great job so far she found
seven hundred bucks so there's the
problem here there is we still a value
quantity about versus quality of the
actual bug and we still perceive tester
as people finding bugs instead of
finding important bugs and helping fix
them so we
argue about what's in important bugs and
it could vary in some country an ATM
crashing like every I don't know 30 days
for 20 minutes might not be important in
Japan for example a system could be up
and running for seven years and it
failed 20 minutes and you got a CEO of
the company it was I p.m. at the time
Luger strim flying the next day to
apologize that's a problem adsense
crashing it's a problem you got people
relying on making money with that sense
that's a problem so we need to make sure
test her and it's a challenge for tester
because sometimes they sit so far from
the business so they don't regress
what's important that's the first thing
the second thing is let's make sure they
help fix the bug so they bring as much
information as possible about the bugs
operating system what's the step to
recreate the problem what's the I don't
know it could be fragmentation level on
disk at the time because it's important
for that particular application network
status at that particular time and well
some could see that as very difficult
and kind of boring to report but you can
make it fun you can I mean win that
automation conference so let's make that
fun and automating the actual reporting
the actual aggregating of data the
actual draining of data the actual you
know performance testing is a good
example there is a lot of data you
aggregate your data you can use cube all
up to drill in to pinpoint the problem
so we need to encourage tester to
actually bring valuable information and
really change the perception that
they're only here to fix bug but really
to help fix the bug there is a good
article from what they can turn on the
web it's called bug advocacy and it's
called stomping bugs and make friends
friends are developer and so I encourage
everyone to read that because it's
really good and bring some good
information thank
he say to you okay ten developers they
have to create programs which load data
into this database cream not which use
this database schema to to make some
jobs so please let's check that the
programs are working and so what you do
you have to create this data you know
and what you do all most of the time you
type you type you have a table with ten
fields you will type in the table but
the table is also free constraint for
unix key unique key and one primary key
and foreign keys so at the end you get
made what you can do you can use GV
feeder with debbie fiderer what what it
does it just analyzes the database
creamer I must say an Oracle database
schema is actually tuned only for oracle
here it's the foreign key unique key
primary keys and then you press a button
you get the data that's the basic idea
of the Beefeater but there is also
second idea is now become troubled
second idea is how do i get to this page
so actually the Beefeater is quite with
a very modern GUI GUI number paste you
can choose your number and to create
projects to to say password for database
here I took as an example hahha
with the HST mouth Oracle very well
known they were scheme of rock on how
many minutes I have still free okay
thank you you talk and then it start to
analyze the depth of them of the table
so you started job region are also some
kind of rule tables then counters are
relied to regions than locations
departments like Google department in
Zurich employees of Google and then the
job history of the employees is the day
at the depth number five that is first
step analyzed then the Beefeater works
on some kind of configuration files
quite long history where you can you can
set the type of the data that you want
then you press a button and you get the
data and I have to go down here is the
point where heat is inserting data I'm
very happy that I have only five min
talk so I don't have to do any demo and
then move to demonstrate its working now
I want to there is also second part of
Debbie feeder which is called data
generator I will quickly speak about
this this module is after late letting
you two to configure eight the data the
basic of the era of this module at the
time when I was creating the beefeaters
I can create the data i carted rise the
data now in an efficient way and then I
got the idea from the reg ex and I put
it upside down I used reg ex to to
create data instead of filtering data in
this way you can configure your data for
each column and
then which is in the database and in
this way tune your data for the database
and I hope you enjoyed the Beefeater is
free is in sourceforge better generate
is also free is written in Paris in
Sipan if you have more question please
contact directly i will vary like i will
vary enjoy if you come to me alright so
the talk i put on here is every test
should look like every test should look
like an iphone commercial but the other
title for this talk is watch the fine
video is the new read the fine manual so
I'm Jason Huggins creator of selenium
also co-founder at sauce labs I'm hugs
sauce labs com and also J huggins on
Twitter brief history of sauce labs is
I'm a creator of selenium I was a form
I'm a former Googler worked on the
selenium farm there and now sauce labs
is the same thing selenium in the cloud
so cloud computing is this big old hyped
thing well I'm actually doing that so
we're your outsourced test lab and well
anyway I should get on with my slides
that's a brief history of sauce labs so
brief history of film right history film
has been around for a hundred years or
so they've got a good lead on software
development so a brief history of film
for a good 30 years there there were
silent films and then everything else so
between 1900 and 1927 I'm not going to
play the clip so I don't know time but
you've watched three meet three amigos
you've got these silent films they show
so that the link here actually works but
not going to click it but then
everything after that is talkies which
we all know is just regular movies but
at the time we talked he is a massive
huge improvement about 30 years into the
film industry the specific movie was the
jazz singer I'm not going to claim play
the clip so I don't have time so anyway
let's keep moving on a key technology
though at the time was the movie theater
that was the key thing that let you go
see this massive new technology didn't
have to buy it you just go to the movie
theater you watch the movies now a brief
history of computers so briefly there's
call it the silent documentation
remember think of the title of the talk
that read the watch the fine video is
the new rtfm between 1979 2004 two very
important dates we had the silent
documentation area roughly it's
everything started with visicalc apple
to everything ended this era with sorry
at the time documentation was just known
as read the fine manual right well
everything changed in 2004 2004's when
ruby and rails came out and this jerk
I'm a Python guy so I can call him a
jerk but at to his credit he did some
novel thing he created screencasts right
he invented it of course of course he
did it in quick time and do din rails
and Apple all that stuff like that but
I'm going to make this quick analogy
that rails screencast the very initial
one in 2004 is as important to the
cosmic history of the universe that jazz
singer was in 1927 so the key technology
now fast forward is YouTube of course
the video that they produced was quick
time and not put on youtube I was going
to say you know in the history of time
YouTube will just be credited as the key
technology for video being the future so
what comes next and so I'll show you a
demo so now going back to the other talk
every test should look like an iphone
commercial when I've got I've got two
minutes left on my clock here so if i
can find lose money right so if I just
click play i watch this there's a good
six months when iphone existed as a
thing but didn't actually exist as a
thing you could buy and so Apple puts
this video up on their website this is i
just downloaded it from again I guess I
pulled it from YouTube made sure it was
running local so I don't have to play it
see it break but this effectively is
test automation like you're opening
every iPhone commercials like this you
launch an app you click around you type
some stuff and like this is what they
put this is I look at this and say this
is test automation but I apple looks at
this and say like oh this is actually
what they use to sell product and I
think actually as a test profession we
should all aspire to make our tests this
beautiful so of course what is the key
technology to kind of do this kind of
thing I've got about almost a minute
here so I'm going to cut pause this and
I'm going to show you now this isn't
just hype it's actually an improvement
on my
eltek talk three years ago in London
I've actually now have some working
stuff around here so really I've took
this existing library called PI VNC to
Swift which I did show a tell tech three
years ago I've now made it as wonderful
as this API you instantiate the object
start and stop basically this is video
recording libraries so you start video
do something awesome then stop the video
so you combine test automation with
video recording and now you have your
least the possibility of iphone
commercials so what I'm going to show
you briefly is a webdriver test combined
with my video library and I've got 30
seconds so I'm going to show this
playing and maybe I'll let it finish but
really it's it's launching the browser
doing your canonical browser test of
doing a hello google kind of a test and
closing it so now if i go over here like
going to click Play and this is the
video that it is recorded now process is
a flash video I could put this I'm
serving it from my own server I can put
this up on YouTube important technology
and make this my documentation that
people would use I've got 10 seconds and
all I will say is this isn't just theory
at sauce labs record a video of every
test last time I measured it we did 50
that we've done 50,000 of these tests I
think is probably more make me that
75,000 range so this isn't just theory
it's not just a broken theory from a
code from eltek I'm actually doing this
in production every day tens of
thousands of times and I'm out of time
that's my talking this came to my mind
during today's presentation I was
wondering how can I test my cappuccino
so until my doctor asked me to stop
drinking milk i used to love cappuccinos
and for everyone went to starbuck
already they know that when they prepare
cappuccino they give you the cappuccino
and they give you the sugar because i
cannot string coffee without sugar
so my problem in this configuration was
how do i add the sugar to the cappuccino
saving the phone because if you drop the
sugar on top of the phone and you mix
everything it's not a cappuccino anymore
so I used 12 some stratagem hacks in
order to attempt to have some sugar in
my cappuccino the first one was to lift
the prom really really hard task to just
leave the phone put the sugar and then
put the phone back I just tried on my
second try whilst to you destroy but hot
coffee drinking Wizards show is horrible
I also only try once so I try to think
about strategies and I came with two
strategies the first one was why not
delivering do-it-yourself cappuccino
kids so I asked to starbuck can you give
me the coffee give me the phone beside
the coffee so I could mix the coffee on
the sugar and then put the dominance
unfortunately they refused to give me
the kid so that wasn't the solution the
second solution was to integrate the
user so that when they prepare the
cappuccino with a stop just before they
put the phone so I can put the sugar mix
the sugar and then they put the phone on
the coffee when I was alone in this
topic it was ok but with 20 people
behind me they wouldn't agree and
integrating the user in the process of
making the cappuccino so DTAC we've got
a for automation but everything I just
said is can be summarized to one simple
question do you have strategy to
integrate the user in your process how
can we mix or how do you mix automated
testing from the user they can test the
phone they can taste the coffee but they
can't test how I put sugar in my coffee
and from one drink to another it may
change because if it's white sugar it's
not the same amount of sugar as when its
brown sugar it's a problem so how do you
mix the part and we can automate no
testing no process with the part with
asked to be done in front of the end
user this is one of the problem of got
actually in some of my development and
that what the the idea of the joke what
I heard today underline me that this is
important and very difficult problem to
mix automation with end user feedback
so this is just kind of a transcript
into presentation form of a document I
wrote while I was exploring a problem
last week and there weren't a lot of
presentations when I signed up so I
thought it might in for some of you my
name is Alec Monroe I work for research
in motion I have no formal computer
science training so some of the things
I'm going to suggest here may even
contravene everything you've ever heard
you're probably right but save your
booing until I'm off the stage please so
the particular problem that I was
addressing was how to write a data class
that integrates into my application and
eat it itself is testable and the
application and other components that
use it remain testable and by a data
class I mean in this case something that
represents an XML file so it's a request
in a response request could look like
that it doesn't really but it'll do this
is some ways I thought we could build a
request as a request is just a list of
providers but we may want to take an
existing file we may want to take an XML
document or an XML object that already
exists or we may want to just parse out
some texts so that's pretty
straightforward stuff I figured we need
a base class that just does those things
so we have a request that inherits from
XML file which is something you're not
going to see but processing data
processing data is where I thought it
got interesting in this case there's two
examples there well finding the sum of a
sequence of values represented an XML
file both of these come from the
response actually we're not going to
talk about that one because I didn't
write about it was fairly simple the
other one was validating kind of that
certain elements are nested within a
given response document
which we're going to call download
availability so one way we could have a
download availability method or download
available method is to have it on the
object itself but unfortunately the fact
that a download is available or not is
really specific to our usage of the
request object or response object in
this case so i figured that wasn't a
very good way to do it so I thought okay
oh well they're supposed to be a static
method in there where that's called
download available and you pass in a
response the what I called start and end
and as far as you know that death to
testability is a link to miss go heavier
ease blog post of the same thing or save
me so I'm not going to explain why
static methods or desk death to
testability because it's fairly long and
a very involved discussion that I don't
feel too to qualify to get into so I
thought okay my application can check it
out but in this case RF the application
ends up ok hiding the functionality from
other potential users and our
application whoever is using it needs to
understand the format of the xml file by
the xml did so the final solution is
that we move the any data management to
the response object so if we want to
just get all of the downloads that are
available there we had to get downloads
to the response object and then we
create a download utility which is in
this case the usage is specific to my
application but anyone could take it
extend it without needing to know much
about my application or particularly the
format of the xml data and i mean this
this all works well for separation of
concerns for dependency injection and
then there's one last thing about long
term concerns
the response object is traditionally I
think about ninety four kilobytes so
there's a incredible amount of data in
there I only cared about these two cases
so I only wrote logic to work with it
but I now have I think three different
classes that are using it in some form
or another and other people may use so
to make sure that when other people do
end up using them they don't break my
code I figure using using keyword
arguments is helps it's not going to not
going to guarantee it so that's that's
my talk it says up in five minutes and 6
seconds court to this thank you very
much
so I'm not talking about techniques of
automated testing but I I'm talking
about the mindset behind especially in
agile environment so I called my top
five ways to improve your developers
sense of quality but first let me
introduce myself my name is Cristiano
Phillips and I used to be head of QA at
studio visit it's the biggest social
network in Germany with over 50 million
people but I decided to leave now in
order to look for some new adventures
and I'm a little bit obsessed about
agile i loved-ed I very much and we
started introducing scrum in march this
year at studio visit so i think many
many companies are now in this
transformation process from from water
fall into an agile process and what's
the problem behind i think the main
problem is the question of quality and i
picked up two things so developers must
stop relying on the QA guys of course
you heard and something about this is
not my job quality is not my job is it's
the QA guys job and some QA guys take
over this responsibility from the
developers and feel themselves as
quality police and i think this is a big
mistake so what we can we do here first
let testers and developers work together
very closely that means let them work in
one team because working one team yeah
okay working working in one team makes
them learn from each other that's more
important so second improved testers
technical skills that
means teach testers in a technical way
so that they can improve on the
developers knowledge about testability
that's very important so third convince
your senior developers why that because
senior developers have a huge influence
to your whole team if you got the senior
developers on your side you have the
whole team fourth short and post
development time what does this mean I
give you an example when we started with
scrum at studio visit we had two and a
half days afterwards after development
in order to test the code what happened
developers relied on that they had
enough time to fine-tuning their code in
this time so because of that we decided
to shorten the two and a half days to
just a half day and yes just a half day
in order to make clear that caring for
quality is not the QA guys job and it's
not a job mate made afterwards and it's
a job by by coding so the last one
provides feedback in a very quick
reliable and visible way especially in
your continuous integration environment
quick means the developers have to get
very quick feedback in when they run
their tests and reliably reliable means
that your continuous integration
environment has to be stable if it's not
stable developers don't trust it and
then they don't use it and visible means
you should use huge monitors in order to
give them feedback they they
I cannot ignore yeah the best way to do
this is to place huge monitors close to
the coffee machine yeah yeah so I'm sure
that there are many thousands of ways to
improve the sense of quality but these
are my five favorites and I would be
looking forward to get more ideas from
you okay thanks okay I'm not talking
about testing actually I'm a PhD student
I'm working on artificial intelligence
so I'm talking something about
allocation and so I'm working with
missionary the idea is that if you have
the data how can we extracted knowledge
from the data okay that was nobody done
by human but the idea for machine
learning is we develop software we
develop algorithm to do this using
computer okay and emission learning a
disarray me encanta base we believe that
the knowledge is just data plus some
generalizations and generalization is
actually a very dangerous concept isn't
it because if you think about it he
stuck on odin he started apple throw up
from the tree and he discovered this
universal gravitation mr. generalization
some person who winner 30 show and win a
football match and from then on he
always went that issues were playing
football he believed that dirty should
bring him luck this is also
generalization all right so this kind of
difference actually also in terms of
classification is also having a similar
problem can we have the data we have the
green path we have also this oh sorry we
have the blue path imperative the red
path and we have to kind of different
decision boundaries actually if you see
this the screen boundary actually
perfectly classify the two different
type of boss and sing is
we only care about the performance in
terms of future instance not only
interesting what you already have so in
fact we would prefer that this simple
black boundary in practice okay so it's
kinda like generalization how can you
make a safe generalization and this is
actually not easy well because oh oh one
major reason we do it is we want to
reduce the human a phone until it's a
tracking these things but that is not
the only reason because we know that
sometimes human just cannot do it it
turns out that in very complex
circumstance human really suck okay
because human perception is fuzzy okay
human reasoning is not rubbers towards
noise so here's what we do
it's about 15 seconds
ok
he has no idea it cause change blindness
in nero sighs so it's why we Famers are
say cam locks internet so now we're
which human perception sucks and there's
another example okay so this is a black
and white picture and I would like you
to just look at this picture and please
concentrate on the black dot just look
at the black door and don't move don't
move and anybody see any color picture
here all right you should but actually
what it happens here it is when you saw
this picture the color picture actually
you try to remember the picture and when
I suddenly change your brain cannot
adapt it so it's kind of like a dilution
right so your perception again so again
what is a moody label catification as
common as commissioner classification is
from the label said we have a set of
labels I pick one of them and would you
label classification is different and it
says that its kind of only pick one of
them a pig a set of them it seems like
is the easy extension but actually the
states can much more complicated here
because when we have to pick a set of
labels we have to consider the
correlation of labels so here is example
if you have a paper which is related to
computer science it's more likely
related to also automatic rather than
law and this is this correlation is
crucial in with the label classification
and what your level clarification and
have a lot of different applications for
example your flickr you can take a
picture and one single picture at the
same time it has different labels and
for example your social bookmarking that
website for example Twitter intelligence
you can the same time bill is too much
social community and so on right some of
the system already implemented I think
that Google should also just use not
come up with a neighbor classification
in for example Google Mail but we have a
email now what we do is a human will
sound and tagged a sound label to the
mail but if you could implement other
mod states that automated system which
can assign this label out American 20
emails so you can save a lot of time of
human so this is all from my sight and
if you want more technical details on
how to realize every label system we
have developed system on this you can
just check my website and I also have
some more technical talks with your
lecture donate you can just such a my
name and found some other talks so thank
you very much so I have to say I'm
really proud of you guys we had eight
talks in 47 minutes right that was Swiss
very very Swiss so thank you all for
staying on time I think this were very
nice fun at some times and interesting
talks tomorrow we start a bit earlier on
today let me double check I think it's
yeah eight o'clock is breakfast nine
