kazuhito kodachi and katsutoshi suji
from its away links in japan and they're
going to give us a presentation on web
accessibility in Japan okay thank you
for coming the title of presentation is
implementable web accessibility what a
Japanese web production company can do
so let's get started let me introduce
ourselves first my name is cathy tolkey
dachi I'm a popular director of metal
rings and a general manager development
a research department of metal rings and
Omar at here still working with his pc
but he is an accessibility engineer of
the same department and she is ryan
since his breast so he is an expert of
assistive technology so today's talk is
a shortened version of a presentation at
susan conference this year and it's not
so technical actually but it took it to
talk about how we have done about a web
accessibility and how what we will do in
future about web accessibility so here's
the agenda now we are in interaction and
next I'm going to do some services
accelerated to web accessibility
provided by our company and after that
constancy will explain some really
interesting situation about kind of
state of Japanese voice output softwares
like post browser or screen reader and
and we will talk about some
accessibility related activities writer
and we have short summary so let me
introduce our company which are working
for mr. odd mr. rings the company wanted
in 1990 so 18 years ago and we call
ourselves as a information integrator
that and we work hard for
a cry on sustainable business from
viewpoint of accessibility and website a
construction in general and now we have
about 170 employees so we are actually
one of the largest companies in the web
design or web development field in Japan
and one aspect of a company is we obtain
iso 9001 and iso 14001 and some other
management systems we use these tools as
to improve our output and workforce and
if you are interesting at the company
more you can get some information at our
english websites and here I'd like to
explain your way of thinking about web
accessibility we define the the web
accessibility is a condition in which
all users can access or use information
and functions on the website without any
dependency on any specific viewing
environment and you know it's it's
important it's not only support for
disabled and elderly people and also
it's important to 44 software or
machines can access to the contents now
we're in the web two point or error so
it's really important to support for
such a software striker mashing up and
in general we think to improving or
maintaining web accessibility is to
maximize potential potential
possibilities of a website in
consideration the special characteristic
of the web as a media and now we move on
to some services provided by mr. rings
there are some several services in the
web accessibility solution our clients
have defined a time and cost
requirements for web accessibility but
we have several services and we can meet
the requirements anyway we have web
accessibility service first in this
service we have screen reader testing we
will mention about this traitor and we
have web construction accessibility
support service in this service we have
three levels right standards in the
professional
and we have web operations excessive
vegetable service this is support for
actual running website after the launch
and we have weather security consulting
in this service we provide for develop
facility guideline with clients so we
are going to talk about two services
here one is screen reader testing there
are two objectives one is to improve
awareness of web accessibility of the
the clients company and second one is to
to raise our will to to to to make easy
to understand web accessibility related
problems so here is the role of the
service it's quite similar to kind of
user testing first we define the task
for the for website and next hour
accessibility engineer execute the task
and record the actual audio output from
screen reader or boys browser and
raspberry we produce a report containing
or accessibility issues with actual
recoges output we think it's really
important the voice output because it's
our power to facilitate the
understanding of the accessibility issue
so that's a reason why we started this
service and next I'd like to mention
Weber construction accessibility support
service as I explained before there are
three rebels from right to professional
of course as you imagined professional
one is the most expensive one but the
it's the important thing here is we can
adjust the clients requirement and skill
we can find something to help the
clients business from viewpoint of web
accessibility because some clients may
don't have enough for large budget for
to improve web accessibility but but
almost every case there are something to
improve it so we can do that in with
this flexibility
and and maybe many of you already know
it is to improve the web accessibility
the important thing is to consider the
the the brand you can't use it who uses
both browser or screen reader and and in
english-speaking world or countries or
areas there are really good software
like Jose and window eyes but you might
not know the conscious state of the the
situation about such a software in Japan
so from now kasto she will talk about
the topics so cuts Toshi well thank you
cause akito I will talk about a current
conditions and issue with Japanese
screen voice reading em environment
there are eight kinds of commercial
screen readers and three kinds of voice
brothers in Japan this software hub wide
price range the cheapest is mm toca and
Jose is most expensive theory the there
is a large difference in functionality
which depends on the price okay next
right yes here is a list of both reading
environment with price usershare
developer information and features for
screen readers pc toca has sixty-eight
percent of users share and according to
develop pass the currently have about
20,000 users for voice browser's home
page Rida is also famous in Japan and
has many users this software is used not
only not only visually impaired users
but by web web developers as well
I will move to next right let's talk
about the availability of commands for
web viewing some screen readers support
web viewing commands but most of them
has only basic basic features such as
leading lines with a lock keys and
leading things with tab keys so they are
not powerful enough to navigate website
besides jawed focus talk which is a one
of brand news brand new screen reader in
Japan has web viewing commands such as
heading jump quick keys in the price
isn't even that expensive of course
every boys brothers has web web leading
command connect right
I will talk about problem problems when
hunting web content with Japanese screen
readers in this right I will talk about
three things as I told you in last right
most screen readers cannot assess the
document structures of headings or list
also open operational methods and
uniformed for example with jaws or
window-eyes they used the same key same
ques keystrokes to jump headings or list
but with Japanese screen readers if I
want to use a new screen reader I have
to learn new key commands for new screen
reader so it makes hard for users to
switch from old screen readers to new
one the last problem is that it is hard
to assess that content of large data
table most Japanese screen readers
doesn't support the table leading
features they can beat table in the HTML
source ordered but can't lead tables by
clumps I'm sorry collective minds I
couldn't
I start my computer I will ok ok skip
the game afresh yeah I'm sorry and I
will move to next right yes ok
I would talk about luck abuser skills
um
I will talk about in this right I will
talk about three more things users can
only use basic commands such as a log
arrow keys and tab keys during web
viewing because most of most of Japanese
screen readers only support these basic
commands they are not aware of and don't
commonly use information such as
headings or list if they are screen
readers provides information such as
this document structure they usually
don't notice it because other websites
didn't contain the information about
information about the document structure
like heading so at least they don't
understand the benefit of document
structure also some users operates based
on their first experience of website for
example they believe that contact
contact information will probably add
the bottom of a website any webpage
sometimes this method works but
sometimes it doesn't they they think
that this is the only way to us access
web web page and if a new feature is
implemented into a screen reader they
can't use it because they trust their
past experience now finally I'd like to
say that Japanese screen readers should
have more web viewing features and we
also need learning opportunities so that
users know more about their screen
readers thank you so as car so she
explained some users who don't know much
about the talk to us they are using
about screen readers or both browsers
and this means that they might not know
much about web contents are becoming
much better I mean more accessible than
ever in the more than in the past with
many standards-based developers and
designers and that's why we have started
some stuff some activities to raise more
awareness to to about web accessibility
we recognize that the importance of web
accessibility has not yet been
sufficiently spread and educated to
everybody yet so the first thing to
introduce is our exclusivity blog this
is of course about accessibility bro
about blog about accessibility it's only
available in Japanese but the access
the you Ras is over there and it started
in august 2005 and country we have about
more than two thousand and visits and
more than 50,000 pageviews per month so
we believe this that this is a kind of a
popular blog anyway and next thing is
about accessibility podcast this is a
joint project by mr. links and in flux
which is a very successful accessibility
related company in Japan and it's your
week size right here it's also only
available in Japanese I'm so sorry about
that but we provided 12 episodes so far
since sep tember 2007 and one aspect of
this podcast is we provide complete
transcript for every every episode so
it's quite accessible there are two main
contents one is excessively headlines
which contains foreign and domestic
topics about web accessibility and the
second one is assistive technology tips
it's only it's for information for
website producers content providers and
also assistive technology use it as
constancy pointed out some users don't
know much about just off to rest so we
hope we can provide some useful tips for
what actual users anyway as you say
about future plans we can have a sense
of six months is to continue this
podcast and we will have some related
events to this podcast and something is
Bill casting future Engstrom Harry hbu
casting is studied by a problem of
motion picture team as kind of promotion
tool it has an English version of the
content so if you are interesting you
can access to this URL and there is a
series of contents titled meet the
professionals in this you see industries
I interviewed to the some really active
people who are in the industry and it's
6 episode i interviewed to the sean
hannity from the WCC at the season two
thousand
it's a just one year ago and we provided
the transcript and its content is kind
of interesting things so you can access
to the content and forcing is addressing
is screen reader explanatory video it's
not all started from our original idea
we are impact inspired by victor turn
who is an engineer at yahoo he made a
really nice video introducing screen
reader titled an introduction to screen
reader and we also heard that the
necessity to provide such an information
to introduce screen idea what the screen
reader is and what can be done with this
software this kind of software so we
will have five episodes of content speed
of contents and here's a target
prisoners including contents providers
and CSL representatives who are in
charge of corporate social
responsibility and of course it will
designer developers and screen reader
users as well and here is a trance
contents of the series first episode has
been already reduced very decently and
we started with the definition of screen
reader what the screen reader is and
last three episodes will focus on how to
use Joe's efficiently with video and
more and more we worked on this kind of
spreading and educating web
accessibility in Japan we feel that it's
really important to becoming a kind of
bridge to the world and Japan from the
world to Japan so here we would like to
share some activities we have done so
far so passing to this is participation
in the WCC it's a world wide web
consortium and established in 1994 and
country with their 100 / / 1 members and
and they created web standards and
winter links has a stud participated in
april two thousand four
and we're currently working with hmm
working group and exit m2 working group
unfortunately we don't have enough
resources to to join the web winter web
accessibility initiatives away but we
contributed to the weekend too we have
is you know it's a guideline provided by
WCC and kind of state of the rust cohle
working draft of the weekend to the
button to of the web content
accessibility guidelines has been
published in the december two thousand
seven and mr. rings has commented to the
graphs for several times for example
about priority and calculation of
contest so we work hard to improve this
black line and we also have a plan to
spread the the guideline in japan and
try to to cooperate with some
organizations or companies to harmonize
this quadrant to the some clients or
Japanese standard and also participation
institution confidence is a really
important activity to be becoming a kind
of bridge we first attended in 2007 and
we made a presentation at that time its
title was making website accessible and
we focused on how to use web standards
as a tool to improve accessibility and
we also participated and the sponsor
this event as well in this year so in
future at least next year we hope to do
the same thing for for this the most
what most largest accessibility related
event and here I'd like to introduce
some I TLC and the UA I at GRC stands
for Internet technology research
committee it's interesting committee its
object food object is to promote
interaction between the wide range of
fields in the Internet industry and
academia and different generations and
country there are 32 universities and 10
white stations and 28 companies
including meter rings are working with a
TLC
and there is a subcommittee called you a
I you a research group its focus on the
elderly and handicapped Internet users
every month you a research group has a
meeting to share some knowledge about or
about research or papers and every kind
of information about accessibility and
its activity you as activity have some
very interesting and international
projects like publishing is a very nice
book visiting english-speaking world and
localization of the software so i would
i would talk these two things so first
about a publication of a book you may I
published the Japanese version of a book
titled web accessibility web standards
and the regulatory compliance it's it's
translated by um research group members
also its earnings has committed to the
work and it's released on October 25th
last year and it's not just the
transformation work we provide you some
very original information like
registrant zine web accessibility in
Japan in the appendix we also care about
the information assurance so we provided
electronic test it's really huge volume
of pages this book but we provide
including text version 2 to the people
who can read the paper version and rusty
I'd like to introduce the localizing the
anybody a into Japanese a PDA is
non-visual desktop access it's a free
and open source based screen reader for
the microsoft windows operating system
it started from 1996 and country
available in more than 20 languages but
unfortunately it's it's there are some
difficulties to use this software in
japanese operating system so you a
research group has studied the Roca
rising this software and the output is
widely available in the the nbdl JP
website and the regarding project is
actually read by cut assoc here so he
will introduce some demonstration of the
Japanese version of anybody a culinary
we are translating latest version of any
video message and so we can lead for
instance we can leave the things like
NVDA main window and sitting dialogues
so you can try the English version of
any BDA from NVDA website but today I'd
like to introduce Japanese version of
any BDA with commercial speech in style
which is from IBM and it's called Pro
toca i will start program here nov te a
ido seamaster a new media are you ready
to a new media a quick start o documento
ok this is NVDA main window and actually
this is a bit older version of any video
because latest version doesn't have a
main window but I'd like to show you the
main we hope NVDA so I use I brought
here bit old button so some of you might
think that translation is almost
complete but this is just beginning we
have some of things to work for japanese
version of NVDA for instance
japanese screen readers have to read
when we are choosing cut kanji character
from a list but currently NVDA that
cannot lead the these choices so we have
to work to solve this program also we
don't have free and open-source speech
incisor which speaks Japanese so we have
to find good quality and free and
open-source speech insider for NVDA in
Japan we have a lot of things to do for
japanese version of nepa but we'd like
to solve this problem and drag to
provide this powerful screen reader in
japan thank you let's wrap up today's
presentation so we have two points in a
summary so first about keeping an access
environment as you have known in
english-speaking countries or areas
there are really nice soft chairs like
Jose and Windows eyes but in Japan there
are many kinds of screen readers or both
brothers which are mostly row costs and
it's the functionality is not good or
not sonia and but because of low price
there are so many users of them and and
recently many web designers or
developers aware of the importance of
little excessive video and web standards
so content itself is now getting much
better than the past but how about
assistive technologies like voice
browsing softwares of course they are
getting better but it's this this seem
not to be touch up the progress of web
content like Ajax or something like that
so it's it's just it's already not
enough just create the web content
access
in with with web standards so we work we
started to work on to provide the access
environment itself maybe it's out of the
web design companies scope but we feel
the necessity to provide this kind of
software and not just the content the
more the more people you see this kind
of tool and the more we create
accessible content on the web the web
can be much better so it so we we
believe and second seeing is a the
concept of the over hub for
accessibility this this idea comes from
steve jobs speech in 2001 and and he and
he explained the digital hub concept in
his concept there's some small devices
like a digital camera or music player
connected to a macintosh computer and
and they're all work together and and to
improve the web accessibility probably
you know so many people need to work
together for one purpose to improve the
web so including web designers and
developers and user agent spenders
associations avengers and of course the
users of such a user agent or excessive
assistive technologies and also like a
standards body right there was this year
of course every kind of people so many
people need to work together so we want
to be a hub for this to to improve this
kind of collaboration that's the way i
was thinking about the hub for
accessibility and we really want to be
becoming a hub and and we don't mind
whoo-hoo think that we don't care much
but the other people or other company
will think about different point of view
or different way of thinking about web
accessibility but anyway we want to work
as a hub
so that's a strategy to improve the web
accessibility of the meetings and thank
yous for for listening and we will be
happy to have your opinions or questions
or any kind of feedback thank you yes oh
it's a really tough question i think the
mobile development is a kind of very
special situation in japan there is no
global standards and some carriers have
original aspect on on the on the total
software or web content implementation
way so and so it's really hard to say
about the current state web access
mobile accessibility so I mean the
contents itself is still no there is no
standards between different careers or
content providers so in my humble
opinion it's it's really tough situation
for mobiles in Japan how do we sell is
much much better than some carriers in
America or European maybe I reply phone
anyway but er yeah it's it's really far
from the the our imagination of the for
the future there should be so you are a
developer for mobile yes ok
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
