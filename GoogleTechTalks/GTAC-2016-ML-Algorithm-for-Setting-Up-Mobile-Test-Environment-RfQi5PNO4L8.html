going to take the next 15 minutes to
tell us everything you need to know
about machine learning and tested here
no pressure thank you you're very good
after and all of you I'm Raj Kumar's
before so I start by presentation I
would like to thank Google for having
given me an opportunity to to share my
ideas with y'all thank you google voice
or coming oh it's cool yeah so this is
my topic machine learning algorithm for
setting up while test environment the
agenda of my talk is about me I would
like to give you a small introduction
about myself mobile test environment
device management and its challenges
then we will see the Machine algorithm
machine learning algorithm for selecting
the devices then we'll have a Q&amp;amp;A
followed by a demo okay yeah my I'm
rajkumar yogi bhajan you can call me Raj
I've been working as a principal
consultant at wipro technologies Boston
MA I have two decades of experience both
in academics and ID I Marisa scholar
published many technical papers and file
couple of patents I also work as a test
architect QA manager corporate trainers
come master and test consultant yeah now
before we start the test automation
environment let us see what are the
important factors to be considered if
you look at the slide he talks about oil
platform so whatever platform i am going
to use it whether they are going to use
the mac or windows or the unit chill
index or whatever why which platform
wendy was it networking Norman is it a
2g 3G 4G or LTE mobile these tools there
are say about 20 to 30 tools are there
so which truly am I going to use it then
comes the testing types whatever TCM I'm
going to do it in my environment a
regression security functional or secure
our save the performance so whatever
this thing am I going to read now along
with that we also need to think about
the emulators simulators the application
to be tested aut along with that again
we need to think about the devices so
which type of device here by going to
use it for my mobile test enrollment if
you look at the side all these things
are countable X of the devices so which
device you am I going to select for my
regression sweet what is the combination
of combination of a terrible devices for
my testing enrollment then comes the so
that it was that side leads us to talk
about the mobile device management
challenges so if you look at the
challenges the first challenge is what
we feel is each and every year the
device is getting released no hunger
Sinai's 100,000 sour device are getting
lazy every year and device is getting
rave refresh every 12 to 14 months 24
months then new capabilities each and
every year we are getting additional
capabilities like camera gps orientation
wise so many things getting added every
year then it comes the multiple carriers
network asst switching disconnected use
to put latency so these are also again a
challenges on top of all these things it
is very very expensive to buy the
devices for my own tests for every
retesting if i want to buy see about 100
devices for my testing it's a very
expensive i need to allocate see about
fifteen to twenty percent of a budget
budget for my devices alone so the next
one becomes one second sorry sorry yeah
there are four in the network operators
throughout the world so each and every
network operators they have their own
technologies cdma gsm LTE they have
their own technologies that's again yet
challenge for testing testing folks then
comes some hardware challenges like a
process speed memory communication
protocols then comes known availability
of devices some devices which ever i am
able to see it in the u.s. i am not able
to see it in india or china some devices
are more popular in India but those
purse of device I've not able to see it
in us so the non-availability of devices
the second is challenged the last
challenge what I've discussed yurius the
tight deadlines today ABC company is
launching a new device within see about
two weeks of time XYZ is launching
another device to capture the market so
these are all the challenges we face in
our selecting beam selecting the devices
so with all the challenges how am I
going to select the device
what are the key criteria for selecting
devices does nice device compatible with
all type of mobile testing what is the
permutation combination of devices for
my regression testing what is the device
market share whatever the user ratings
are reviews now so the ball it is these
questions are totally know which it is
not that easy to answer so what we have
decided in this slide talks about how
are we going to select the devices from
a pool of hundreds and thousands of
devices if I also same question to my
children this children in the child I'm
giving us a about 10 different mobile
devices so which device are you going to
select my child used to say hope is very
easy part I thought the child is very
creative so she will give some answer
she said inky pinky ponky father area
donkey donkey died father cried and
she's how he expected me to kind father
cried father crane so that shuttle we do
not know what devices we have to select
for our own device testing when you have
a large number of devices so I have to
go for the iOS so I have to go for the
Android so I have to go to the
blackberry which we have to select right
in Android alone we have 24,000 devices
plus iOS devices plus blackberry plus
windows so how I am going to select for
my regression suit how i am going to
classify these devices how i am going to
select the right combination for my
devices so we thought why don't we go
for a machine learning algorithm
so you guys you all know that machine
learning algorithm there are so many
algorithms in fact it I'm talking the
Google place Google itself is a pioneer
in machine learning algorithms right
miss tensorflow deep learning and
similarity pro is also doing a lot of
focus on the machine learning and the AI
tools so here we have decided to go for
decision support algorithm as well as
the random forest algorithm so if you
look at the decision algorithm sorry so
we have taken someone running 120
samples out of 15,000 samples and we
have done some of the research like this
and actually i'll show you the the next
slide this is our sample data these are
the classification graphs now this is
that the demo screenshot i have taken
front what did we do you first we have
imported all the required library for
our prediction then we loaded the data
from the csv file so the csv file we
have nameless device underscored demo
dot CSV then we took we have cleaned
just how we saw any n so you will get a
lot of amy n so we have to clean the
data so all this data we have cleaned
and then we started to use the dysentery
classifier so when you to use the
distance reclass fear along with the
features so the features and all we had
to say about seven different columns we
have we got this type of a decision tree
now you if you look at the des entry
here the top you spot you have a genie
value so Jeanne is nothing but it's a
entropy level and it comes to know there
are samples that we have taken thing and
for commerce six been divided
and the genie value fee if you look at
the genie value it comes down it goes
lower lower it is coming at the zero
point zero that means there is there's
no more impurities so the first level it
will be like a 0.48 as it goes down
lower and lower it comes to zero point
zero that means you need not go further
decision so is there though the growth
of the trees stops there so there are
some type of disadvantage to the
dysentery so we thought of doing a
random forest / algorithm with the same
data so if you look at the year the run
of a classifier with the same data to 10
values we have taken you can see the
attributes the variables like a warriors
in memory manufacturer these are the
genting data gently cata bus we have
taken and now at the last column you can
see it's a selection that means based on
my historical data I'm going to select
these devices the first one maybe the
Google picture the second is the iOS
device so the first one I am going to
select the second one I am NOT going to
select third one I am going to select
it's like that so based on our project
based on our data we can give our own or
training data are we can be I hope we
can set the last color collection so
once you make the selection here you
will get the prediction value it's like
DC now if you look at this is 16 435
point on that's the third row we have
taken that row so the based on the
existing value it gives you the value
called one I can show it my laptop itzel
because because of some technical hits
you know where glitches we are not able
to do it now on the screen but it is
giving the value called one the second
one if you look at this image observe to
cover the distance another value we are
another row of data we have taken and
based on the
the random forest estimator it is
Miranda for class where it is giving it
the Z value called zero that means it is
you are not going to select the value
then we what we did we have selected the
same set of data with a new data in 64
mb in 64 gigabytes we are giving 128 1
comma 1 / a new data we give and is
giving us number one that means it can
be selected so now based on the based on
the 10 values we have arrived this type
of prediction now based on our own of
projects whichever project we do
whichever know what we can do we can
train our data and based on the training
data will be able to select the right
set of devices now in my results i am
selecting i have self adjust value one
device but with the same thing what we
can do we can make like a set of devices
at 20 number 20 or 30 number of devices
we can put together in my boy in the
same random for a sedition tree and you
can predict the values now comes the
other two may take away from the my
presentation is the first one is
predicted value is equal to the scent of
recommended devices for the regression
testing we can leverage the machine
learning algorithm for identifying the
right number of devices the right number
right combination of devices the second
one is ultimate little of radius a time
and cost third one is it is we will also
be able to overcome the device based
issues by selecting the right devices by
using the machine learning algorithm so
as I already told you I present i have
used the decision tree and random
algorithm but you can we can use any of
algorithms it's not necessary that we
have to stick one of these two
algorithms
okay that's all thank you so much once
again I've had if there's any questions
specific very good I think my question I
would want to know how did the machine
learning prediction compared to your
daughters weight of cheese yeah okay
that wasn't really your game to those
people yeah I need to do a lot of
visitors and dad yeah let me try and get
the questions on screen but in the
meantime does anyone in the room have a
question yeah I have a question because
I came from the statistic background and
you know the random forest and that is
you know decision to I'm pretty familiar
with oh yeah cuz the data volume is
really about I think personally I think
it's really not suitable for that you
know to to use the you know that easy to
injury and you know photos by anyway
yeah it's a good idea but I just have
you know have some salts on it yeah
thank you no I didn't get no no yeah
coming in here oh I'm sorry I'm getting
at you though you said that
traditionally cannot be used for this
tip of IE analysis yes actually you know
I work on the data mining for a while
four grand and you know I I kind of feel
you know food for the you know the the
data volume on you know the mobile
device is pretty you know small you know
that's not hope you know noise when you
you know training the model so
you know is um yeah I thought you know
for the yeah I totally agree with
it that's why I but the decision tree
we're not cannot be used for a small
volume of the data that is why we have
switched to the random forest Rob
algorithm it is not necessary that we
have to stick to 111 this in an idea
they would know we have already
implemented a POC and we can use any
type offered their algorithm it says up
data mining and it need not to be only
for the large volume data right we can
also your public it is also opting for
the small set of data yeah okay and
since that was a lightning talk okay
we're out of time but yes thank you
thank you so much round of applause</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
