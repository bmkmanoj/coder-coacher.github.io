open source program office I'm actually
substituting for Leslie Hawthorne who
can't be here tonight
which means unfortunately I'm gonna have
to miss the talk which is a real pain
because I think I might really enjoy
this one so just a couple of questions
first who how did people find out about
this talk did find it by I think I think
it was on Google code blog or something
how many internal Google people are
there here are quite a few so and so
that the non Googlers did you find out
about it on the Google code blog raise
your hands oh one okay we need to
advertise more I think anyway this is a
series of talks it will be going up on
Google video probably in a week or so as
time so if you have frettin if you
really enjoy it and you have friends who
missed it they can they can always tune
into the video anyway so I'd like to
introduce our speaker tonight who's Alex
Martelli and Alex works as an uber tech
lead I don't quite know what that is but
sounds very important uber tech lead for
production systems at Google that is
very important
he wrote Python in a nutshell and
co-edited the Python cookbook both of
which I have so I should have brought
one for you to sign and he's a member of
the Python Software Foundation and won
the 2002 activated activators Choice
Award and the 2006 Frank will allow
Willison Memorial Award anyway please
welcome Alex martelly thank you
everybody and welcome so this talk is a
very brief introduction to the Python
language and a mention of its few
libraries for people who are already
experienced programmer in some other
language that is the summary so if this
doesn't describe you if you already know
Python very well or if you don't know
programming at all I will not be
offended if you leave so essentially I'd
like to have here very experienced
programmer in some widespread language
at a C++ or Java or C no need for any
previous exposure to Python if you have
some it will hurt if you have a lot
you'll be rather bored tonight you must
be kind of prepared for me to be very
fast in some of the parts others will be
more relaxed but a few hard stuff I'll
be hundred a lot about and I apologize
in advance I have a lot of slides with
code example to squeeze more code per
slide my formatting isn't exactly
elegant and some of my names are too
short I don't do that unless you have
two codons lives of course so what's
Python we probably heard about it but
let's summarize it's a very high-level
language that I put that in double quote
because it's a technical term low-level
language is assembler high-level
language is C or Java very high-level
language is Python Ruby pearl it's
basically got more power per line of
code you write essentially it takes you
far away from the machine which has
disadvantages but it makes you more
productive in coding the syntax is
particularly notable as clean in spare
as we'll see comparing it with other
languages the semantics we have striven
to keep very regular meaning simple and
powerful at the same time and without a
lot of special cases and exception for
example we don't have two types of
integers depending on whether it's a
real integer or an object integer that's
a typical Java or C sharp issue like see
we have integer that's much simpler it's
object oriented but also suitable for
other paradigms of programming we'll
again we'll contrast that with the
compare and contrast with other
languages to help you cite it its main
focus is on the productivity of the
programmer we want the programmer to be
able to do a lot of work
fast how do we do that well maybe I'm
not using the right order here because
like number one is simplicity simplicity
is the best feature of any complex
design as Santa's very best known as the
author of the novel the little prince
but actually a stronger in attic
engineer said you know you reach
perfection in design not when there's
nothing to add but when there's nothing
to take away now Python isn't exactly
that perfect but we're going to take
away a lot of things very soon in Python
3000 which you can expect to see out in
less than a year so far we haven't been
able to take away anything once it was
in because of the well-known demon known
as backwards compatibility they the life
of a new language or a new company or a
new anything is always easier because
you have no customers and therefore
there is no problem with offending your
customers but as soon as you have a few
million people using the language or
buying products from the company you
can't really be too innovative except on
major releases and Python will have its
first major release in a decade this
very year will take away a lot of the
things I explained now because they're
not strictly needed uniformity is
another strong Python value we'll come
back to it but basically the dream is
that things work the same way in in
different contexts so you don't have to
remember a comunitaria complexity of
explosion of rules of okay how does this
work in this case versus that case
modularity is very important of course
and pragmatism is engineers rule number
one they all of these theoretical
considerations are absolutely crucial
but pragmatism Trump's them all
sometimes something is just too
important to not have it's got a rich
standard library maybe not very Java
standard Java standards but pretty rich
compared with most other language
and lots of third-party tools additions
extensions and so on and it's got
several good implementations the one
most people think about when they say
python is known as C Python for classic
Python there's also an implementation
which was just released as a result of a
two-year project financed by the
European community known as pi pi which
is basically a Python implemented in
Python itself the siren Python which has
just reached released 1.1 and is
Microsoft's product but I believe it's
the one or at least was one of the first
to Microsoft product which is open
source so you can download it it will
only run on dotnet of course and then
although the project state is a bit
uncertain right now there's something
called JSON which is an implementation
of Python for the java virtual machine
unfortunately the 2.2 release has been
in alpha then beta for like four or five
years now
the main architect of that project has
moved to be a Microsoft employee and as
being the driving force behind
ironpython so I don't know what to
predict for jarton at this point in time
but beyond the technical aspects of
Python is a language and if its
libraries Python is also and this is
very important a vibrant open-source
community you will find in just about
any field of programming some more
represented others less a lot of
companies and individuals using Python
the Python Software Foundation is the
nonprofit organization which holds all
the intellectual property rights to
Python and it's organized in a series of
sub communities that pursue special
interests there's a special interest
group on databases one on matrix
computation
when an image processing and so on and
so forth
there are a lot of local interest group
wherever you live there's likely to be a
active Python interest group meeting
once a month or so I'd like to put in a
plug for Bay Piggy's which is the local
interest group for the Bay Area San
Francisco Bay Area which meets at Google
every month on Thursday and the next
meeting is two days from now so you're
all welcome to show up
it's a beginners night meet-and-greet
night so there's no specific theme this
time but it's certain to be an
interesting experience and there's an
enormous wealth of websites news groups
and mailing lists or all sort of general
and specialized discussions there's
plenty of courses worship tutorials just
in the Bay Area over the last year I've
seen something like four or five
different courses offered by various
local universities plus other offered
privately anderson is inexhaustible
array of books that includes online only
books a few of them paper only books a
few of them and most of them of course
available in both ways so I will spend
the rest of the talk is explaining the
good and bad points of each of this
books not really but I wanted to
threaten you of course I think the best
one is this the Python cookbook it's the
best one because I wrote it with my wife
but the second best is Python inertia
which I wrote on my own now seriously
they're not well the pattern inertia is
not ready a book for beginners it's a
reference book Python book book is
reasonably suitable for beginners
because it shows you how to do hundreds
hundreds of tasks for beginners there's
a lot of other great choices for example
Python for dummies written by two other
Bay piggys members and another one I
know very well is core Python written by
yet another Bay Area make biggy member
and of course some are about Python
in general some are much more
specialized for example Python network
programming is about using Python
specifically to program network to book
years is a specific Python framework for
websites or jython is an implementation
I already mentioned data crunching is
essentially about using Python and other
tools to take data files and do useful
stuff with them so choose wisely so I
claim the stock is addressed to people
who already know to program in various
other languages and therefore I like at
this point to introduce how does Python
resemble some of them in different ways
they most important similarity to Java
is in the typical implementation Python
like Java is normally compiled to
bytecode it doesn't need to be you can
make machine code with Python you do
that using pi pi 1.0 which has a lot of
backends including I believe Intel only
machine code but it doesn't really buy
you much as people have tried to compile
Java with the GCC Java compiler now
compared to a well-tuned virtual machine
it doesn't really buy you much one
crucial difference in operation between
Python and Java is that in Python
computation is implicit you don't
normally bother to explicitly compile
your files you just leave the sources
laying around and whenever you import
one the Python runtime system founds
it's not being compiled yet it composite
on the fly it's a very fast compiler you
don't you hardly notice the fact and
then it saves the object file to disk so
next time it won't have to everything
inherits from object except the it's
lower case o versus the upper case but
the difference is that we do mean
everything
numbers in URLs from object functions or
object classes or objects every
his first class there's no need to make
strengthing just take a function object
a second integer object and stick it
anywhere else where he would stick any
instance you wish like Java Python as
you know uniform object reference I'm
antics anytime you assign a to be you're
not copying all the bits of a into a box
called B rather you're attaching a label
called B to wherever label a was already
attached so same goes for argument
passing same goes for return the
difference again is that this does apply
universally in Python we don't have
special cases whereby this is almost
always true except for numbers it's got
a vast and powerful standard library
Java's is like twice as big a thing but
after job is maybe the largest and
library of any language in what used
today is called garbage collection again
there's a little difference in
implementation if you look at
implementations such as Aaron Python it
will of course piggyback on whatever
garbage collection semantics are offered
by the underlying platform or J or or
jython will use exactly the garbage
collection semantics of the JVM classic
Python tends to have a dual system of
garbage collection to collect garbage as
soon as possible it uses both reference
count and mark-and-sweep if you're
familiar with the issue but that's an
implementation detail and then it's got
all sort of cool stuff at least for
people coming from CMC plus parcel to
use to adding them such as introspection
which I believe Java called reflections
that serialization threads as part of
the library and so on in other respects
Python is rather more similar to C++ for
example number one is multi-paradigm in
Java you want to write hello world you
have to write a class even though there
is no conceptual need for any class you
still have to write one because Java
forces you to in Python like in C++ or C
for that matter if you want to write
just a function you write just a
function though need to force a class
around it besides like you can do
object-oriented or procedural you can
also do generic programming essentially
in in C++ you have to do that explicitly
through templates in in Python
essentially it comes for free as will
point out later and the little
functional programming because you can
pass function of functions around which
is notoriously a problem in in Java it's
much easier in Python because you don't
have to extinct in terms of pointers to
function you can actually think in terms
of passing a function returning a
function from another function just like
you do in functional programming
languages there's multiple inheritance
it can be used in structural ways but
that's a very controversial theme in any
language supporting multiple inheritance
or it can be used in a very nice way
which is they mix in if you go to the
web on the Google Video site you'll find
my talk on design patterns for Python
second part I show how to use mixing
inheritance for a very powerful class
level implementation of is what's
essentially the template method design
pattern extended to a whole class ok
signature based polymorphism is
basically the same thing as generic
programming at some level except again
that in Python
everything is a template the features
needed from a certain argument or
certain function are defined but what
the function actually does with it what
methods it calls on it or operations
doesn't it in in C++ you explicitly say
which type parameters are in play also
what C++ and Python have in common is
that for just about anything that is a
core issue of the
the language itself things which we
could call side dishes except that
they're typically at the core of any
serious programming you may ever do
you've got even too many choices what
you want to use as a graphical user
interface in Python you can basically
use anything you can use from C++ plus
anything you can use from dotnet if you
if you're using our own Python path
anything you can use from Java if you're
using jython plus more so you have even
too many choices for a graphical user
interface framework
similarly for how do I go on the web how
do I do other network operations how to
interface to databases I do I do
communication between processes
distributed computing and so on and so
forth for all of these things some
languages offer you very strong guidance
Python like C++ basically tells you to
do your own choices
one of the most interesting similarities
to me is that even though a sufficiently
superficial observer would claim that
C++ or Java are very similar to C and
Python is difference because basically
scrub is got no braces or it doesn't use
braces for structure the way these are
those languages do if you look at what
defines C the situation is actually very
different
fortunately the iso standard for the c
language in its pressure in its
rationale offers a five-point definition
of what is c all about what is the
spirit of c one trust to the programmer
to don't prevent the programmer from
doing what needs to be done
three keep the language small and simple
four provide only one way to do an
operation and five make it fast okay on
point five unfortunately Python isn't
all that
dear into the spirit of see but on four
out of five of the points pythons
principles are exactly the same sees
principle we don't put a lot of
infrastructure in place because we don't
trust the programmer like Java does like
C++ do all those private public
semi-private semi public if you trust
the programmer that useless baggage so
we don't have them and therefore we keep
the language small and simple and we
never stop the programmer from doing
what needs to be done because anytime
you try to make something well first of
all you cannot make something foolproof
because fools are so ingenious that's
the well-known fact but anytime you put
in place as something to constrain the
programmer because you don't trust the
programmer you are in certain
sufficiently nasty situation stopping
the programming programmer who you
should have trusted from doing something
that needs to be done so 0.123 go very
well together in point for the first
time I read that design principle for
Python it's it's very contentious in
today's world the way the principle
reads in Python is there should be one
and preferably only one obvious way to
do it for any do it anytime you have you
do have a way to do task X having
another one is sheer waste you're just
making the language bigger don't of
course it's a target it's a dream even
in C there's often more than one way to
do an operation you can I don't know
have a pointer walk through an array or
use an index to walk through their a
they trust you to do the right thing but
these are never desired the way they are
in some other languages I for example
there's one language which is generally
very similar to Python but with very
different philosophy which decide the
since programmer
never can remember if an array has a dot
size or a dot length well they would
offer both with exactly the same
semantics that is exactly the reverse of
pythons philosophy having several ways
to do something fights against
uniformity at all the uniformity is a
present value if we all manage to only
have one way to do it then everybody
would be doing it the same way which
means maintenance and teamwork would be
vastly enhanced this part isn't exactly
exactly met and fortunately it's there
are some choices which may not be all
that important today but for example
Python does not define the semantics of
14-point numbers exactly like C or C++
it says the semantics of floating-point
number is whatever this Hardware says it
is nowadays this isn't very important
because basically all reasonable pieces
of hardware of similar semantics but it
used to be a big deal because for
example all the Christ supercomputer had
their own semantics for for floating
point along with such a job I would say
this is exactly what the semantics of
floating point numbers is going to be
could never have run on a Cray
supercomputer at a speed faster than a
snail for Python or C we'd rather give
up some portability so therefore in
point computations are not guaranteed to
work the same way on an old IBM
mainframe Cray supercomputer versus VMs
vac CMS machine so in this sense we have
made exactly the same design choices see
it's truth be told it's partly laziness
because this way we don't have to
provide a complete software
implementation of floating point on
those machines whose semantics are not
entirely precise so
so far as trying to stress some
similarities and only minor differences
but of course we can also go the same
way and see how it's been different from
all of Java C++ and C here the big deal
is that typing is strong but dynamic
strong much stronger than in in C for
example you see you can basically use a
cast to say these bits whatever they may
be make believe that a float which
basically destroys your type system you
cannot do that in in Python on the other
hand the typing is dynamic another way
to put it
a name has no type a name is the name is
a name the type belongs to the object
and the name may refer to an object but
that it may change and refer to a
different object so the type may change
there are no declarations just
statements basically there's no
distinction or some no conceptual
distinction between compile-time and
run-time compile-time where the
declarations are something that guides
the compiler and runtime where the
statements are actually executed we
don't draw the distinction things are
just executed as you go conceptually
speaking even though of course there is
a computational stage for speed syntax
is very spare ornamentation is
absolutely minimal or no braces for
blocks just indentation no parentheses
around the conditions innocent while
statements bless punctuation in general
interesting observation I've heard of
this point is that pythons the only
programming language designed according
to the principle of edward tufte if you
read the visualization of quantitative
information you know that his core
principle is no wasted pixel one pixel
that is there just because it looks nice
is a waste take it out
Python doesn't have any extra pixels
well we do we have some full colons
which could be removed but there's very
tiny pixels so everything is the first
cost object by everything I mean classes
functions methods
Jools packages just about anything you
can think of it doesn't exist just at
compile-time for the benefit of the
compiler if it exists at all it's a
full-fledged object it is just a runtime
you can put it in a list you can return
from a function you can pass it as an
argument also the while Python lets you
twiddle bits it's not really what it's
meant to do the focus where it really
shows its strength is on the high and
very high levels of us abstraction so
fundamentals there's an interactive
interpreter it's not the main normal way
to use Python but it will it's nice to
try things out and explore things the
prompt is 3 greater than science or the
secondary prompter like in in bash in
here it's a dot the dot means statement
continuation normally you write source
file food of py first time you import
them we'll see what import means in the
language in a while it gets compiled to
py see the object code and there for
after that it's simply loaded from there
the simplest instruction in the world is
a plain assignment which just says a
name equals expression it binds a row
binds name this is not an like it would
be in C and or C++ an operation between
objects it's an operation between an
object whatever the expression means and
upward of your name variables just name
that's like it would be in Java this has
absolutely no effect on whatever name
used to indicate previously it just
means that from now our name indicates
this one there is no declaration of name
whenever you bind something to a name
the name springs into existence and
names don't have ax types object to
other service aid there's a special
object called nun which is a place
louder placeholder value meaning there's
nothing here that would be roughly the
equivalent of nool or lowercase moving
java application moving sea
we're meaning there's nothing except I'm
still holding the place or something to
come in the future for example a
function that doesn't have an explicit
return statement will return on however
none is a full-fledged object again you
can pass it as an argument returned from
a function put it in a list and so on
everything is first class including the
nothingness very zen concept the
elementary yo which you never use in
real programs that is nice in some -
like right short example state acting
example there's two simple built-in ways
to do input one is the function called
input which basically lets the user
input any expression whatsoever compute
the expression on the fly and inputs the
result of your program of course that's
not something you'd ever want to do in a
real program because if there's a syntax
error him for the user is typing you're
going to crash a row input which is the
same thing that just returns the string
that the user of staff just trims the
training new line in front of mentary
output there's a statement called print
followed by zero or more comma separated
expression which just puts them out on
standard output one after the other in a
new line at the end unless you have a
trailing comma there's no fancy
formatting there if you want to do find
some formatting you can have your comma
separated expression via string
formatting expression as we'll see but
print itself you just copied stuff with
this absolutely minimal formatting the
space in the new line of course again
it's not meant for professional that
allowed to does a bazillion other ways
to do that okay so here's some trivial
example of what we've seen so far of
whatever name X meant before including
nothing it now means the number 23 so if
you print X then 23 is what you get on
Sandra output and then X is now the
string foo so nothing nothing bad
happens to 23 it's not damaged in any
way just not referred to by name X
anymore now print X image foo so see
the name Express a doesn't have a site
at this point the object is shown by X
is an integer and at this point is a
string but also one thing you can do in
Python which is typically not available
in other languages is to delete a name
that doesn't damage the object in any
way again it just takes the name out of
the other issue so the name X doesn't
refer to nothing anything and if you are
print X you get an error at that point
on the other hand if you want the name Y
to be around be usable but not mean
anything special you can assign none to
it that's the place holder and now you
can if you want print it and you will
see the letter n or n e no big deal
Python is flow control there are three
will so we'll see how one of them is
defined in terms of the others but
that's a bit later if while and four if
is the only way we do conditional
operations you may have else if which is
build Elif you may have an else meaning
in every other case there's wild while
except inside its loop body breaking
continue same semantics as in all the
other three languages and it can also
have an else this is not common to the
other languages essentially and else in
a loop in Python means if the loop is
terminated normally has not been
prematurely interrupted essentially a
break terminates a loop prematurely the
else is what happens if they if no break
has executed during the loop and then
this for which is basically having a
name step through a sequence and I
trouble recall it if you need can have
break continuing else just like while
can here's some simple for control
example after a couple of preliminary
assignment let's see which one of these
statements this print statements would
you expect
be printed who thinks it will say a is
greater than B nobody who think it will
say a is equal to B who think it will
say a is smaller than me well somebody
most of them most of you don't believe
it will do any of these things it will
do one in yes it is of course the last
one just to show how easy it is to
understand the semantics here and let's
see if after that we have this loop what
will happen well is a less than B yes 23
is less than 45 so we pray in 2345 and
this makes a refers to twice if the wire
add an else it would execute because
there is no break the wild terminates
naturally because a becomes 46 46 is not
less than 45 so that's it that's a
natural exit there's no breaking it
makes no sense to have an else if you
have no break in the body because it
will never execute okay there's some
simple types or scalars so to speak
which are a lot of numbers there's
integers long floating complex I don't
know why I'm an old Fortran programmer I
don't know why other languages after
Fortran drop the complex numbers they're
so handy for all sort of computation oh
here's some example of numbers 23 is a
number and so it says you may notice
that this number is kind of long but
it's far from too long for Python you
just keep typing digits until you manage
to exhaust your available memory which
will take you a long time with a typical
machine of today with a few gigabytes
Python is quite happy to store your
integer it has multi precision implicit
or we're going to use like XO decimal or
2.3 is of course a float which would be
called a double in in C and 4.5 plus 6.7
J is a complex we've used james like in
electric
jeering rather than I like in like
mathematicians usually do but it's one
of the to recognize notation there's all
sort of operators again
Fortran lovers will note we do have the
double star meaning raised to power
again I don't understand why it's not a
widespread use this to form of division
one means with truncation the other
without truncations and there's modulus
shift bit operations and so on and
there's a few built-ins we'll
compactable things later but pretty
obvious like absolute value minimum
number okay it's not entirely obvious to
most people why should we have powers
built-in if we already have star star
the reason is that the built-in powers
potentially three arguments it does X to
the Y modulo Z and if you're really into
number theory you know that can be
extremely faster but that's really the
only concession concession to strange
things we have in the built-ins okay
some takes any array of numbers and sums
them up and strings we have to kind
unfortunately here's an example where a
backward compatibility fights against
simplicity will remedy that in Python
three zero
it's obviously simpler like in Java to
have only unicode and it's obviously the
right way to do it
unfortunately for backward compatibility
we still have plain strengths meaning
strings made of bytes and Unicode
strings as well so we have to explicitly
indicate with you Cole on something
sorry for something quote that this is a
unicode string otherwise all the others
are byte strings in the current version
and then there's all sort of escape
sequences and you can do catenation you
can do repetition of strings and you can
do formatting which uses a very rich
format language very similar to the
printf function of c off you built in
such as
chr which goal or any unit CHR depending
on type you want go from a number an
integer number to the corresponding
character and/or goes from a character
to its ask your unicode code number
sequence strings are read only sequences
will see what a sequence means shortly
meaning you can take the length you can
index and slice them you can loop over
them and strings have so many methods it
would take several slides just to list
their names but stuff like capitalize
the strings Center the string in a field
of arbitrary length all sort of cool
stream manipulation stuff so we have the
built in simple type scalars if you will
and then we have containers only a few
containers are built in most of the
container types are in the library but
these are the ones which we have deemed
so important that it's worth having them
as built in a tuple is an elementary
mutable sequence it doesn't do just
about anything except it holds immutably
a small secret typically small sequence
of objects of any type or it notated
with parentheses and commas and or you
can build one by explicitly using the
word tuple with the sequence argument
basically it's a essentially a
mathematical concept that it's typical
use is very similar to a struct in c
except instead of having they the fields
be named
they're just numbered a list is a
mutable sequence don't let the name list
who you it's not a linkedlist it's
implemented as a vector it's in
contiguous memory so that tells you if
you're an experienced programmer all you
need to know about its performance
characteristic is notated with square
brackets again you can build one
explicitly by calling the type with a
sequence argument certain frozen set are
the mutable and immutable versions of
sets which are basically implemented
- tables our dick is a key value mapping
also implemented with a mesh table again
this indicates the notation you can
always call the type in the case of
dictionary you don't call it with a
sequence but with keyword all containers
have a length being the number of items
they contain all containers of looping
you can loop over all their items and
all containers allowed membership
testing if something isn't the container
most of the containers tuple is the
exception also have methods that let you
do all sort of cool stuff set all those
operators because that's the most
natural way to express operations on set
for example intersection you can spell
ampersand Union you can spelled vertical
bar sequences are a subset of containers
specifically strings tuples and lists
plus a lot of other stuff in the sender
library which have some extra things you
can do compared with what you can do to
with other containers first of all you
can ask for the repetition in catenation
so given any two sequences a and b at
the same time a plus b is the sequence
which has oh I Tunes have been or a nor
they're followed by all items of being
order it's a very natural concept you
can concatenate lists you can cut any
strings you can concatenate tuples
repetition is basically the same thing
you could write a plus a plus a but you
can write a times 3 or 3 times a it
means exactly the same just like it
would for numbers then you have indexing
just write the index from the index all
starts from 0 in square brackets you
have slicing you write the two indices
with a colon and you can have slicing
with a step we write to start stop step
the for example given the sequence e
chow CIA o chão do a is a because we
always start from 0 12 3 2 1 by minus 1
meaning minus 1 so
backwards so we started three zero one
two three it's a no and we go up to down
to one which would be the I excluded so
we do oh and a in reverse order away
always first bound included last bound
excluded if you've read under screenings
masterpiece see traps and pitfalls
there's a whole chapter or why all of
your loops should be first index
included last ended excluded read that
book even if you never program and see
it's a great book just you like you
should read KN air for they just because
it's a great book so it's clinics and
basically in Python you get it you get
that concept built into the language and
it's built-ins so this are mutable
sequence so given an indexing or a slide
you can assign to it moreover if you
assign to uh slide you don't have to
assign a list of the same length as the
one at slide your assignment you can
assign a shorter list with will collapse
the list you will you can assign a
longer one it will automatically extend
that of course does mean that these kind
of assignments can be very costly
because as I said the thing is
contiguous in memory so it has to move
everything around to make space
dictionaries insects are not sequences
or so it makes no sense for example to
multiply a set by three doesn't make any
sense at all so button doesn't let you
do it okay there's several comparison so
you if you're familiar with the
comparisons in Java you know why equal
is different from what in in Python we
spell is it's about the being the same
object versus being same or distinct
objects with the same contents
containment is also test2 spelled in
with operators in or not in comparisons
can change so for example three less
than a less equal X less than nine reads
in exactly the natural way every time
you teach any other language
beginners you have to explain that this
doesn't work with the way everybody
thinks it would because it first
computes three less than X which is
maybe one and then it computes one less
than nine which is true at least in see
where comparisons are zero and one
in Python it works exactly as everybody
thinks it should work meaning X is
greater than or equal to 3 and less than
9 what is false in Python for purposes
of if and while and other tests all
numbers that equal zero are false
empty strings are false none is false
every empty container is false and false
is false false with the uppercase F is
the boolean construct equivalent to 0 so
if you need something that is false and
doesn't need to have any other
characteristic you can know that
everything else is true
you see Python is a very belief oriented
language because almost everything is
true but if you need something that's
only true another absolutely another
interesting characteristic you can use
true spelled with an uppercase T not is
an operator which always gives you a
boolean so not X is always the same as
not bollocks so not of an empty sequence
is true with another case T not of a
non-empty sequence is false
I keep seeing people who come to Python
from other languages check if a sequence
is empty by asking if length of that
sequence equal equal 0 and that is wrong
it's simply if not that sequence for
example say members is the set of
members of your association to do
something like close the Association if
it does November if not members close
association that's Reese pretty natural
not if Len of members equal equal 0 in
the nor operator short-circuit like
ampersand ampersand vertical bar
vertical bar but very usefully they
always return one of the operands
so not necessarily true or false but any
operand you've passed to them by
short-circuit it means they don't bother
to evaluate the right-hand operand if by
the left hand they already know for
example false and anything is false true
or anything is true they right-hand
operator might potentially even cause
any kind of side effect that side effect
won't happen that's guaranteed by the
language there's also built-in functions
any and all which can be called with any
number of arguments which do essentially
the same thing but on sequences of
arbitrary length basically they
terminate as soon as the result is known
unfortunately there is no way to do that
on empty sequences and still ensure that
something is returned that is in the
sequence because nothing is in an empty
sequence so therefore any and all don't
have this handy feature of always
returning an operand a return a bool so
it's potentially useful like in C++ or
Java errors are handled through a
concept known as exceptions not only
errors but also anomalies that aren't
errors Python uses a lot more exceptions
than would be considered good style in
either C++ or Java exceptions are
instances of built-in type exception or
any subtype of it there's a statement
raised if you want to make noise
explicitly they propagate along the
stack of function calls terminating the
function because they go until they're
finally caught or if they're never
caught your program is history and
typically with a trace of the error that
wasn't code you can use statum try
except to catch exceptions you can just
try finally to not catch obsession let
you propagate the guarantees that some
termination operation is done you can
use the nicer form with which lets you
implement the rest
or allocation is initialization idiom
now
I mentioned a for statement as being
separate for a while but the interesting
thing is that the semantics are for are
defined in terms of those of while and a
concept known as a iterators so
basically for I in see something means
make a temporary variable which is the
ITER of C ITER is a built-in function
that returns the iterator for any
container and start looping try getting
the next item from the T then it's I if
there's a stop iteration exception
that's it and then do the body they're
not exactly the same because an else
clause in this for might execute well an
else clause here would not execute
because the only exit is via break but
this is the sense of the equivalence and
you can also build you can also have for
embedded in an expression in other
parenthesis to just make an iteration or
square brackets to make a list this is
known as a list comprehension and this
is known as a generator expression or
for short gain expo the optional closers
mean you can nest further for and if
closest to nest looping or or selecting
whatever your you're doing with so the
main way to organize your code is
function is highly recommended to have
all of your executable coding function
among other things so since a function
is a welder limited unit particularly if
you write small functions Python can
optimize much better try making exactly
the same code at the global level in a
module
versus inside functions in the module
and you see what I mean you can go two
or three times faster if you have
everything properly organizing
so there's an a death which start the
function name parameters in parentheses
in a body the point is that when death
executes and remember death is an
executable statement there are no
declaration when the statement death
executes the body doesn't execute it
gets compiled but then the compiled form
is saved as part of the function object
as generator and that function object is
assigned it name name the parameters are
zero or more local variables which get
initialized by the color so like in C
and it's the derivative languages
parameters are the same thing so slow
chol bearable s-- except their
initialization happens at call time you
could have default values like in c++
only two trading parameters again like
in c++ by writing equal sum expression
to the name however the expression is
evaluated only once the expression that
makes up the default value is evaluated
when the DEF statement executes and so
therefore anytime you make use of a
default value for a parameter is going
to be exactly the same object parameters
may end with star name to take a tuple
of arbitrary positional argument or star
surname to take a dictionary of
arbitrary named argument which is
basically useful when you want to make
function what even the c are called very
attic functions which take a arbitrary
number of parameters here's an example
of function first of all the most simple
obvious way to do a sum of square take a
and b there are the parameters and do a
times a plus B times B by the way as any
old time fortune programmer will tell
you the fact that you have the race to
power operator doesn't mean you should
use it to do squares a times a is
actually faster than a star star do
- it's probably not true unfortunate
anymore because the Fortune compilers
have become pretty smart but Python
compiler never tries to be till tomorrow
sighs gotta be a reason this guy is
right I was written a stanza - I'm going
to compile exactly the bytecode to
compute the power and that's slower than
the one that computes the multiplication
so remember do it as if you didn't have
the raise to power so you can just print
the sum squares then you get the area
that of the square built on the
hypotenuse but why limit yourself to two
sides I mean Pythagoras would be happy
because this is what you're doing but
you don't have to because you can take
an arbitrary number of parameters and
this is how you send them all sum all of
the square remember our syntax for the
generator expression expression for some
item in a container here's exactly what
we have expression X 10 X 4 X arbitrary
name for an item in the container a the
tuple of all arguments passed to the
function so this works just as well if
you print as soon as Q 23:45 but you can
keep passing arguments and we work just
as fine this is the low level occurring
it's okay I mean it works but Python
tends to have a okay there's a concert
very important constantly in C++ known
as the abstraction penalty something dr.
Stepanov has been measuring for decades
now basically how much does it cost me
to do things right and work at a high
level of abstraction rather than very
lower level closer to the machine and
slowly gradually a C++ compiler become
more and more complicated and
sophisticated it's slowly going down
Python does things differently we
typically have an abstraction reward
they more abstractly you program the
further from the machine than the closer
to mathematics into your problem the
faster your code
go try it's very easy get a Python
interpreter check how long will this
take for a dozen arguments versus how
long will this elementary lower-level
closer to the machine expression thing
since we're on the subject of loops and
end functions I should mention
generators derivatives of functions
which instead of return to give a value
and you know return gives the value in
terminates the function of the same time
that's true in any of these languages
they use yield yield gives a value but
suspends the function ready for the next
time and by the next time we mean that
when the function is called it returns
some an object which has a method called
next every time you call next the
function restarts from wherever it last
yielded the first time it starts from
the start and then every time it starts
from the last yield where it got
suspended its but this is particularly
suitable for looping in a for because of
what I mentioned before an iterator
having the next method means you can use
it in a loop just to complete that when
the function ends it has yielded all it
and it runs of the end or hits a return
statement then it raises a stop iterator
so if you're using it in a four it
exists normally for example this is
actually a built-in but if it weren´t
this is how you would make something
which even a sequence gives back one
after all of the items of the sequence
each with its proper index zero one two
three so you pass it quote ciao quote it
yields first time zero C then one I then
to a then three oh and then raises top
duration it's not very difficult you
start with n equals zero loop over the
sequence and yield N and the item at
this point the function suspends once
yielded the first
still ready all of its local variables
and in particular are still perfect
intact when you call next or at the next
iteration and gets incremented and you
do the next stop so you're suspending in
the middle of a loop ready for the next
time very handy this is an example of
how and it can be a generator I said
they function or a stop I just did the
object returned by the function will
raise a stop iteration when there's
nothing more to yield but I should have
said if it went because this is a case
in which it just keeps going well it
will eventually fill up your memory
since at some point you will have
integers that take about a gigabyte each
to represent and you will be running out
of memory but it will take quite a while
so this is a Fibonacci sequence from my
compatriot well known as one of the
first arithmetician
it sounds as I&amp;amp;J to one and while true
all this is by the way something I
didn't really mention is a multiple
assignment
I'm simultaneously assigning to are I
and J the expressions IJ and I plus J so
the whole everything on the right hand
side is computed first and then
everything on the left hand side is
assigned so you don't have to worry
about I and J changing on you when
you're still using them here it's a
simple multiple it's just a multiple
assignment if you've ever used
SNL or or Haskell R is what ever used to
be na is the number of rabbits actually
and so we yield it and we never end the
problem that Fibonacci was discussing in
his book is I have this farm raising
rabbits and I start with one only one
rabbit and
after 2e when his 2 years old I get as
many rabbits as I had in the previous
two years so this is how the sequence so
this is how we use it we have to
explicitly break out of the loop at some
point in this case I'm doing it I'm
going to sell the farm when I have more
than 100 rabbits and retire to some less
stressful job and this tells you how
many rubbish you'll have to house every
year closures well known to every
functional programmer but just I did
mention very briefly that closures are a
natural in in Python actually said like
in C++ they're actually much handier
here that in C++ because we exploit the
fact that death is an executable
statement that creates a new function
object and we also exploit lexical
scoping you can't have nested function
in C so it's not really so this is the
trivial example we want to make an adder
with a given add end I'll simply make a
function which take the other Samand
which is known as the ouch end nobody
knows that though but I do and which is
your gender class here then and from the
make adder we return harder so make up
variable here is looked at here so we
can print a 20 through 100 a 42 of 100
or one of the other and everything works
there's no interference like they're
kind of like is that kind of like in
some shading a class except that it only
applies to a very narrow set of use
cases but it's very useful to have
because it's so much simpler
our decorators are purely syntactical
form to apply higher-order functions
basically to wrap a function into
another function or function of function
and assign it it's kind of handy okay
there's two styles of classes in Python
for backwards compatibility reason I'm
only going to talk about the new style
process
forget the existence of legacy classes
you have to give some basil's all the
time there are other methods but if you
don't have any bases you care about just
right open paren object closed paren
have you ever eating in Aries from
objects so you're not going to break it
so its class name basis and a body and
the body is just a series of statements
of your choice but they're invariably
death and assignment statements
everything is your defining or assigning
in the body becomes an attribute of the
class object and also all the attributes
of the bayes's are attributes of the
nucleus object unless the nucleus object
overrides them with something else in
the same way so to create an instance
you just call the class that's very
handy because basically you can easily
make a function that takes as one of
these argument something which gives it
something else just calling it it
doesn't have to know whether it's a
class object or a function object it
just calls it so this is an example
which is why I'm calling it eg or exams
given we have a class attribute a simple
list empty initially and this is an
attribute of the class so shared if you
will by every instance of the class this
on the other hand we assign as an
attribute of self which is the way we
refer to the object the instance and
this is an empty dictionary as an
variable of the instance we have a
method which append something to the
class CLA the class variable and we have
another method which assigned something
some item to the dictionary and we make
two of these instances then okay in the
beginning everything is empty then we
call the methods a few time and now we
see that the class attribute is actually
being modified twice by one and then by
four while the instance attributes are
separate so we can check with the ears
are they the same object well in terms
of the class attribute es because these
are two instances of the same class in
terms of the instance attributes no
because their instance attitude
whenever you look up a method or an
instance in order to call it or for
whatever other purposes they look up in
the caller totally separate operations
we go to the type of the instance which
would be class if you'd rather call the
method and implicitly pass the instance
of the first argument of the one we have
called self previously whenever we do
the lookup well this is what happens
except for descriptors which are not
going into here with very important
mechanism first of all we look in the
dictionary which belongs to an instance
every instance as a dictionary and we
just can look up the name if that
doesn't work well we are going to look
in the dictionary of the title the
instance the class or it's not there we
do the same thing for each of the basis
if not we try the special art special
method called get outer in case somebody
else defined it which can essentially
build dynamically just in time whatever
is meant to correspond to that thing and
if everything fails to raise an
exception an attribute our this our
example of sub classing remember that
class EG well we're overriding method
we're overriding it simply to give Y a
default value then we just call our
superclass or we can also use a word
super to do that but I honestly find
this more readable this is pre abysm
calling the method on mr. eg and passing
it so this isn't so obvious another
example we can overwrite data suppose we
have a subclass of list which each time
you append something offense it twice a
repeater well then they we can suppress
sub and override the class variable so
that all the methods are the same but
the class
is a separate one another important
concept our properties I said I wouldn't
talk about descriptors but these are of
all the descriptor types this are the
most important built-in descriptor type
the property say you have a getter
method which without any argument
returns a value and a setter method
which given a value does something with
it presumably assigns it somewhere
somehow stores it in the class then you
can wrap the getter and the setter in a
property and assign it to a name now if
you have an instance of this class every
time you access the name you actually
call the getter and every time you
assign to the name you actually call the
setter instead so this is basically
property of basically offers you syntax
sugar so that instead of calling an
appropriate method you can just act as
if you were accessing an attribute or
setting an attribute why this matters is
that in this way you never need to hide
attributes behind the getters and
setters anytime your class has an
interesting attribute you just expose it
forget encapsulation it was invented
before the concept of property was
invented the point is if you're in the
next series of your code suddenly
doesn't have that attribute anymore it
needs to compute it rather just write
your getter method and rub it in a
property by that name you're done no
problem
all of the code keeps working all of the
code that using the class doesn't need
to do anything special it just works
avoid boilerplate if in Python you ever
see somebody writing death get through
self return self foo you know this guy
hasn't learned Python yet
Python like C++ a force operator
overloading those legions and legions of
methods we have to underscore right at
the beginning and end of the name
because basically these aren't meant to
be called directly the Python will call
the special methods on the type as
appropriate don't call them yourself
with rare exception so that's why we
made them ugly so they wouldn't be
tempted to call it for example this
method these methods lets you define the
semantics of comparisons these as you
define the semantics offereth medic
operation or these define semantics
basically defining how is your type a
container how you get items that item
delete item how you know how Lang how
long is an instance and so on
for example this is the equivalent
written out in full as a class of that
handy Fibonacci generator I showed
before this doesn't use the suspended
function concept and so on it just those
things plotting Li it uses the init
method to do initialization the I J
which I used to have are now explicitly
indicated as instance variables it uses
the iteration special method returning
itself because it is an iterator and it
has the next that this is meant possibly
for calling yourself so it doesn't have
the the underscores the still special
method and it does basically the same
computation as we did of course you can
of course it's using exactly the same
way you see why we draw the writer
generator which was like three lines
instead of seven but this the point is
that internally the generator
essentially builds something like that
so don't call special method directly
built-in functions and other operations
do it right for you for example definite
example somebody doesn't know Python if
he gets the absolute value by explicitly
calling
under under under under what you should
do is called ABS absolutely do whatever
is proper because that may include like
I try this special method if that
special method is not there try
comparing with zero possibly change the
sign also the staff that happens under
the cover and you don't normally want to
bypass it all those plenty of
interesting built-ins and most of the
other interesting stuff is in the
standard library okay here's an example
using three built-ins I have highlighted
them we want to build in index for a
text file meaning we want to print in
alphabetical order all the words in the
text file for each word the list of line
numbers where that word occurs so first
of all we build a dictionary which maps
a word to a list of line numbers we
start with an empty dictionary we use
the with statement because that
guarantees is like a try finally except
this nicer syntax it will open the file
name give us the results as file F and
then intrinsically close that when we
exit by any means whatsoever then we use
enumerate which gives you line number
and in the text of the line split the
line that's one of the many methods of
strings which I mentioned which splits
them into words set default is a method
of the dictionaries which basically
assigned something if it wasn't already
assigned a value if there wasn't already
anything assigned for that value here's
our default is the empty string for that
given word so the empty list I'm sorry
so we can just append the line number so
we're building up our list of line
numbers okay when we're done with these
five lines we have our dictionary and
now we only need to display it so we
wanted sorted versions the natural
comparison of courses alphabetical well
may not be like all all lowercase comes
before a sorry
uppercase come before
kay is a typical ascii order but good
enough for me
and we just use print with a little bit
of formatting and a comma to not break
line yet we loop over lo all the line
numbers for the index of the world and
print them again with a comma to not
break and finally we do an empty print
just to break the line so there it is
this is a complete index and and display
of the index of the text file I once
tried coding it for C++ in C++ goes for
fun but I gave up because it was just a
joke they code is totally unreadable in
a slide and the funny thing is that this
is actually typically faster in Python
this is printed multiple times yes we
are carefully doing that here's the
alternative of course would be to
essentially map a word instead of a list
of lines map it to a set of lines so
sets intrinsically are not application
so if you only want one occurrence well
instead of of these square bracket use a
set open close print and instead of a
pen called ad which is how you add items
and here you would have the to use
sorted if you want the line number to be
sorted so you'd have to change two tiny
spots here and one tiny spot there and
you would avoid duplications if that's
what you want okay
so I do say Python points a lot of
modularity so how do you import the
modules the library is full of them you
just import module name or from some dot
package import module name and then you
just use module name dot whatever you
want
there are shortcuts available but
they're never recommended you don't
don't just inject an alien namespace
into your own it's it's not
good idea namespaces are good use them
you may short a name using as dis
understandably if your file is called
long module name and you need to use it
a lot you don't really want to type it
many times so important on what your
name is Zed and then you use that dot
whatever or you can import whatever
directly from the module name but then
it's not obvious to all the reader
supporting where does this whatever
comes from and this is the worst of them
the import star and for everything you
basically inject all all the namespace
into yours that's like if you're into
C++ is like using namespace who it's
evil it's it's about idea don't use it
okay this is an example we use the item
to function we import math and then use
math dot atom to if we try to use a bear
as in to we get a name error we could
but we shouldn't import the function
from the module or import everything
from the module now math is one example
where I can see you doing because you
need to do a lot of mathematics but
avoid the temptation it's an interactive
session if you're using Python as a
calculator you can define your own
module so straight do every Python
source file is a module you just import
it
it must reside in the import path you
can also have their bytecode files which
is what Python meant for you or you can
have binary extension which you can
write and see or use Pyrex swig and a
lot of other tools so ammonia is a
simple object with attributes are no
methods and it may have functions but
they're not methods there's no implicit
self the attributes you are also what
you inside the modules here the
top-level names are they're bound by
assignments class def important from
statements they're also known as global
variables a little not only variable not
all of them are going to be very mobile
still and you may bind or bind them from
the outside there's nothing stopping you
from doing it but don't don't do it
and unless you're doing tests or like
mock object and the like a package is a
collection of modules organizing another
module it's mapped to a directory to
distinguish which director is just
directories which are packages you tear
packages they need to have an init py
spelled with the user double underscore
which is a module body and the modules
are all the py files which are in the
directory and the sub packages are
subdirectories which have their own init
py the parent directory must be in sis
path and you can import foo bar or from
foo import bar this is basically all I
have to say about the language Python
and then there's a library which back
before Java started spreading Python is
a few years older than Java back in 92
93 the size of a Python standard library
was scarily bigger than any other
standard library ever released even when
even with java 1.0 python was still
still larger with java today okay I give
up
Java in a nutshell is 1,600 pages I was
criticized because Python
internationally 700 pages our can't beat
them so we have 190 modules at the top
level so to speak of doing anything from
math to system operations random numbers
sockets RFC 8 to 2 or 20 to 80 Turing by
now 28 we have 13 top level packages
organizing 300 modules so having to do
with the Berkeley database pythons own
built-in compiler and so on we have a
lot of encodings for a sort of Unicode
operation sort of unit tests included in
the library or and a lot of stuff that
is not normally distributed with binary
distributions which are very nice you
should get from the source distribution
demonstrations of how to best use this
in that feature and tools which actually
very help little
like ah then beyond what comes with
Python there's a site cheese shop Python
orga Python is named in honor of Monty
Python and a cheese shop is named in
honor off the cheese shop sketch heat I
checked Sunday how many modules do we
have packages do we have today
and yet exactly two thousand one hundred
and twenty two which I took as a good
omen whatever and these are the main
subjects of course software development
everything is about software development
some very helpful there are other but
these are the popular ones this are
possibly a better more useful way to
organize things there's all the way to
write graphical user interfaces sequel
databases and wrappers object on on top
of relational databases or sort of
computation stuff or sort of net and web
stars development environments and tools
games games meaning frameworks to write
games don't know if you've heard about
the PI weak context it runs a few times
a year you have one week to write a
video game from scratch from the moment
the thing everything happens on the
internet so you can have a team whatever
everybody uses by game and the Python
programming language is some pretty cool
game I've come up people give you the
theme this revealed at the start of the
competition and then the clock runs for
a week the only problem is you probably
want to take a week off whatever you
normally do study or work because
otherwise other teams are going to do
that and they'll destroy you multi other
multi medium visualization scientific
visualization mostly an integration with
those sort of languages and platforms
let's go 1 micron deeper to see what's
in the in the standard library there are
some fundamental things things that
would be in the language possibly in
many languages like bisection algorithms
how to copy things more collections
beside the built-in ones tools that heap
functional functional programming an
implementation of
he priority queues to city's iteration
regular expressions threading in the cue
thread a lot of tools for testing and
debugging file in text processing
persistence and databases time and date
but there's one crucial category missing
here none of the standard time and date
module deals with daylight saving time
essentially the Python core developers
punted we just can't bear to release a
new Python release in a hurry because
some legislative body has decided that
daylight saving time will actually start
there and finish there remember there
are a hundred and sixty-five legislation
in the world we would basically have to
do nothing for this huge package that is
Python except following news for 165
countries and states and things in the
world to know what are they doing with
her so you absolutely need a third-party
helper either one that uses the stuff
that comes with typical Linux
distributions or a standalone one
they're both pretty good okay then we
have computation stars in terms of net
and web stuff I've given up on
summarizing how many tools we have for
net and web okay this is when asked the
what do you think is the best example of
Python what the creator of Python Widow
van Rossum currently a Google employee
gives he says I never like sitting down
at a machine and try W get something
because I get my precision it doesn't
have W get well it does usually have
Python and it takes me much less time to
code up W get a simple version then to
find it and download it install it and
run it and this is how you do W get in
Python essentially there's three uses of
the standard library so you need to
import the module cysts you are Lib
which deals with urals and OS which does
in the operator
system you need to define a hook
function in this case we just print a
file name followed by whatever feed
become argument or given this is what
the your lab you retrieve calls every
time it gets a bunch of stuff from the
net and so we do pover all the arguments
script them their URL so we strip them
to their base name and we download them
to this file name with a little printout
and your retrieve does the the job and
calls once in a while cause the hook and
this where does what oh it's a it's
right here global it's remember def is
executable and the body is not executed
at the time Sony compiled so there's no
need to look up at them by the time who
gets cold FM has been assigned here you
don't need to declare a fan anywhere
everything is executable and the order
of execution is def executive at this
doesn't need a fan then the for executed
in this assignment and then this which
calls back and this is where the body
gets executed yeah I see a lot of people
in cases like this say FN equal known as
if it was a declaration don't there's no
such thing as a declaration this is the
exact equivalent I mean my
multi-threaded version is not quite as
similar but then multi-threaded is
neveress it almost stays because thanks
to they thread safe first in first out
queue basically this has just a little
bit of extra to declare itself a demon
so it won't keep the program alive but
then basically the body is essentially
identical except cube gets the URL from
from the queue and then the main program
so to speak only needs to build a pool
of workers and put everything all the
work requests in the queue
and they'll just do their job I measured
this is actually much faster
particularly in multi multi-core
machines because the other version
basically spends all its time waiting
for the internet so that's a case where
multi-threading is definitely worth it
and this is just a few more packages on
on the standard library I'm not really
able to do it justice
except I'll mention one they are
essentially the foreign functional
library for Python C types c types you
need to know which platform you're using
because basically you can call arbitrary
c function from a dynamically load
library but you need to know which then
any library you want so for example if
you're on Windows you want to load n is
VCR t the common runtime library that
comes with Microsoft stood is your
studio if you're on Darwin which means
Mac OS then you want to leave seed are
live else your presumably on Linux or
otherwise you need to keep testing and
then you'll want to read blips are
fortunately any of these deep-sea object
will have a printf function in c2 which
you can pass a string and will return
the number of characters printed and
that'll better be 12 so this is just an
example of how you can call arbitrary
arbitrary C function from Python and
that concludes my talk thank you very
much I think we do have time for a
little question and answer
no it implies the colonel can remember
that dealing with the tcp/ip stack is
not exactly zero cpu load so if I have
two cores I haven't actually tried with
more than two - is what I have in my in
my macbook then it means the kernel can
be running the internals of socket
reception Nagle algorithms whatever else
while the application is preparing to
request write it as the nest
essentially there's many I to convince
the European Union to finance the
project to the tune of two million
dollars we had to present about two
million dollars worth of paper now I say
we because I used to be before I joined
Google I was part of that group in
Europe so number one to facilitate
experimentation with programming
languages
so the standard implementations of
Python are written in C Java C sharp so
to experiment to make us different
language that similar to Python
you basically have to know beyond Python
also C or C sharp or or Java with pi PI
you can do your experimentation Python
itself so it's easier to experiment in
even if you do know we claimed that
Python makes you more productive so even
if you do know the other language you
should be able to do your
experimentation twice as fast if you can
do everything in Python also freeing the
backend from the specific constraints
existing in the existing implementation
basically by coding the output so to
speak to an abstract back-end which is
suitable for computation to either
higher level byte code engines or
machine code
basically freeze up to your back end if
you look at pi pi 1.0 is released it's
got a funny collection of back ends for
example it has a back end which compiles
Python to JavaScript the reason are
obvious you can pump that on they put
that somehow as part of your webpages
and basically do the logic behind your
webpages on the user's browser but in
Python there's an implement the one
back-end generates Common Lisp which
then can has some pretty strong
compilers around mostly commercial ones
other implementations generate machine
code that's not in very satisfactory to
me so bloated generates not not very
efficient machine code another one
generate code for something called the
LLVM the low-level virtual machine you
should read up on that on the webisode
so basically it's got a lot of backends
because it can it's designed to have
multiple backends
and part of what it does have to enable
specifically the easy generation of
machine code or the equivalent of
machine code is got type inference built
in so we don't really need that to
generate JavaScript or Common Lisp but
but it's still handy and it's
particularly handy if you want to
generate machine code even though it
comes out very bloated you need to know
whether something is an integer or float
because it may occupy different number
of bytes in memory so any other yes
I presumably can although it will take a
while actually itself repeat school
well only for a while
which one 21:33
if Connery is going to yield one item
and suspend the next time is going your
the next item
so take one example of enumerator that I
have thinking when I do the indexing
example I'm using enumerate there so
enumerate is called once but then we
loop on it so we get 0 and the first
line 1 and the second line 2 and the
third line so we're getting the line
number as well as the line as we go
without having to deal ourselves with
low-level logics such as N equals 0 and
n plus equal 1 so that's what enumerate
does for us if I iterate over my
sequence I don't get the line number I
get lines but I don't know what line
number I am and I need to to save the
line numbers by problem definition there
is it just just passed in a slightly
different syntactic position but it is
definitely passing
you you have to pass it explicitly to
the method because you call the method
on the class while this basically wraps
it up so it gives you an virtual
instance of your superclass so you're
calling a method than an insect which
implicitly passes itself
yes setting what sorry it's fine I'm
just saying that in the example I was
giving there's absolutely no use of that
variable until much later so why should
I set it yes make sense more you're
welcome
if you don't have control over the
source code then you will take whatever
source code you're given but if you do
have them then in system making them a
reasonable length it's really no reason
to do otherwise you can't you can tell
me you have no control to to split them
down into reasonable length say a couple
hundred lines at most but you can
control which 200 lines they are that
doesn't make sense if I did have to
maintain a thousand line script I
probably would refuse to use any global
variables at all I would wrap everything
in two classes so if I can't have a
decent source code control that way I
can't how many people will be editing a
thousand line file at a time I can just
see the conflicts in your source code
control system and people resolving
conflicts by hand all the time it's
going to be hell so anyway at least the
conflicts will be in different classes
with any mark I think we have
one more question no there isn't there
isn't there are there are tools such as
pie checker which will cancel your typos
that they're completely separate from
Python you don't load them separately
yes okay not for the language but the
libraries are not identical so you have
to realize that the main motivation for
somebody to port fight on to dotnet was
to make available windows forms if you
do use them don't expect that you run
the same script on Mon or under Linux
windows form will appears they want
their Microsoft crown jewels so
essentially the language is totally
portable but you never do anything with
the language alone you're always calling
some library or other be careful which
library you call because if you call a
proprietary library that only exists on
this platform well then you know they
say you're you're using sequel as part
of your your Python script if you're
developing for Microsoft sequel using
all of its specific dialects and
features then moving to Oracle will be
help and it's not
pythons problem it's your problem yes
yes generators okay if you cut when you
call the function the function returns
an object so if the two if two threads
call the function you get two separate
objects no interference every time you
call next you consume a an item no
matter how thread safe you can make it
internally you will still be consuming
one item so if there will be a race
condition for calling next between the
two threads that's assuming they in your
body is safe between successive yields
being simultaneously in execution so
you're going to get some non
deterministic effects sometimes the
first thread will get the first two
items and then a couple for the other
and then by other times different
interleavings it's kind of like what if
the threads what did printer standard
output well the lines coming from one
and the lines coming from the other
would be mixed in about random
if we call it twice so then we get two
different objects which don't interfere
with each other I don't understand we
have a method which is defined with that
okay okay then in run time when this
death statement is executed an object is
basically a function object Escrima
factional yes is created then we call
maybe put a method we basically use this
function object if that contains a
yielder then it's the generator and what
it returns is an iterator object but it
returns when you call it is an iterator
object exactly thank you very much I
think it's getting a bit late so we
should be
