we've invited two people from the Space
Telescope Science Institute to talk
about Hubble Space Telescope data and
also some of the outreach issues dr.
Alberto Conte and also dr. carol
christian will be talking and we'll ask
to hold Q&amp;amp;A until after the presentation
please thank you very much Brian I'm
still with this discovery no problem
release the first of NASA's great
observatories is now on station at 330
nautical miles above the earth thank you
very much for the ride
you
well good afternoon i hope i get your
attention I my name is alberto contador
cat a Space Telescope Science Institute
which is the place that controls this
beast up here and what you have just
seen in the last two minutes are all the
press releases for the past 15 years for
the Hubble Space Telescope Hubble is
arguably the most successful NASA
mission ever is the telescope eyes
change really a revolutionary
revolutionize astronomy over the past 15
years and it's part of a series of
telescopes have been built by nods are
called the Great observatories that
survey the sky multiple wavelengths so
Hubble is typically known to serve the
mainly the visible part of the sky
there's a was a gamma-ray observatory
called Compton this x-ray channel is
orbiting currently and there's also the
infrared Space Telescope in Maryland in
Massachusetts where the headquarters are
and these tesco basically r
revolutionized the way we do astronomy
so Karen I today are here to show you
how astronomy has been changing over the
past few years and why where's this
change is taking us and and we're going
to focus on two different aspects one is
the outrage basically or what can you
what can you do to entertain and excite
the public about about science the other
issues are what what what is changing in
terms of of astronomy so I strongly when
digital about nineteen sixty and ever
since to use this I guess I'm scary here
and ever since um NEC ever since stomach
when digital basically there's been a
complete revolution if you take a look
at the green and green curve here these
are pixels in area and pixels in terms
of detector so from 1972 now we
basically gone a factor 3,000 in pixels
and we have now instrument so basically
give us hundreds of gigabytes a night of
data in many many different wavelengths
so the detectors roughly followers
follow Moore's Moore's law which is
interesting by the problem for us
because we have it our data basically
doubles every couple of years so
what what what I'm going to do now I'm
going to turn it to care okay what's
going to explain to you how we deal with
this massive amounts of data in terms of
outreach and then we're going to focus
at the end at how astronomy is changing
due to this to this to this effect
Carolyn thanks alberto so i'm going to
walk you through some of the imagery and
describes the science that we do with
the Hubble Space Telescope but also
introduce you to some of the science we
do with the other observatories because
both ground-based observatories and
space-based observatories work together
when we're trying to understand physical
phenomenon in the universe so we want to
know everything we can possibly know
about an object this is called the Ultra
Deep Field being from NASA you know that
we use acronyms for everything so you'll
see acronyms threw out some of these
slides this is the ultra deep field it's
the deepest image of the sky that has
ever been taken every pretty much every
object that you see here this this part
of the sky which is a very tiny part of
the sky was chosen specifically because
in every other telescope it's blank in a
short exposure so just about every
object you see here is a galaxy
containing as was one famously said
billions and billions of stars our
interest in these fields is that we can
see what we call relatively nearby a
sort of foreground galaxies that are a
huge distance from us but foreground
galaxies but also the little dots and if
it was darker in the room you could see
you can get these on the web
everything's available on the web so if
you're interested in any of these images
have at it the full resolution images
are available eat studying the
individual little tiny dots that you see
here these fuzzballs tells us how
galaxies formed in the early part of the
universe and what we've learned is that
nearby quote nearby galaxies seem to be
like you know similar to things that are
really really close and like our own
galaxies but the little fuzzy dots are
telling us that in the
early universe there were smaller
entities that that merged and then built
up bigger entities uh rather than just
one big thing collapsing and becoming a
galaxy so work this is it's it's a
mosaic in that we to get super
resolution we move that we take shorter
exposures with the telescope moving very
slightly and then we build up an image
and cut out the best part of it so there
are there are more data out here but
they're not the same exposure time but
this was done with the advanced camera
for surveys which is four thousand by
four thousand on aside and it was one of
the largest detectors now you can build
bigger cameras on the ground and put
them on ground-based telescopes but we
have you know in frequent access to
Hubble so we can only update the cameras
every so on this shows you a zoom in on
some of the objects that are in this
field and it shows you a little better
some of the little fuzzy things that I
was speaking about that are very
irregular in shape and merging way back
in the early universe this is another
galaxy what we're learning about
galaxies now is that many galaxies do
format of mergers and mergers can also
occur later in time closer to our time
in the universe and this is called the
tadpole galaxy find that astronomers are
not particularly clever and how we name
we kind of you know it comes right out
of our mouths of the top Oh looks like a
temple okay it's now called the tadpole
galaxy and this structure has been made
by the merging of smaller galaxies that
fell into a larger galaxy and in fact
these kinds of merges and this image of
these two galaxies that these is their
telephone numbers in addition to the
coordinates on the sky that we know this
is a really good illustration of how
galaxies interact and then spawn all of
this stuff and these are new clusters of
stars hundreds of stars forming together
and in there might be individual stars
that may have planetary
a systems so if you think back to the
UDF that little tiny place on the sky
which is no bigger than then this laser
pointer if I pointed it into the sky
contains millions of galaxies and all of
them are doing this kind of thing
forming stars so by looking at the
close-up galaxies we can understand how
star formation is is is spawned by the
interact sometimes by the interaction of
galaxies themselves that object is is
billions of light-years away so it's
taken billions of years for the light to
get get to us closer to home this is an
object actually in our own galaxy which
is a spiral galaxy similar to the ones
that you've seen this is a star in the
formation stage and it's interesting
because in tantalizing because it has
all this material that is has collapsed
slowly in to make the star in the center
which we can't really see but the other
enticing thing is there there is this a
linear structure which we believe is a
disk and that's where we believe
planetary systems forms so there's a lot
of interest in using Hubble Space
Telescope to find planetary systems in
formation and we found quite a few that
are tantalizing like this but we haven't
actually seen upon it yet because we
don't quite have the resolution but
there are other new missions being
launched by by NASA that will find
planets and be able to eventually image
them this is the other end you saw the
birth of a star this is called the cat's
eye and uh when I was in fourth grade I
learned that planetary nebula so called
because originally Galileo and
colleagues thought that they looked like
stars with planets around them actually
are very complex nebula and this is a
star very similar to the Sun but in its
death phases and you can see it has a
very complicated structure so we're
trying to understand we used to think
that the star just kind of Slough doff
its outer part in a nice uniform
spherical distribution but with Hubble
we've learned it's much more complicated
process there seem to be jets and
material
spews out and makes these beautiful
structures and there are there are
hundreds of examples of these kind of
objects on our website and everyone is
different so it's a real challenge for
theoreticians here's an example of a
cluster of stars that is forming out of
the remnants of other stars so massive
stars form they slough off their outer
parts that stuff gets mixed together and
new star clusters form and we liked this
image because it showed the cluster but
also the beautiful filamentary structure
of the gas and dust out of which that
cluster formed here's an interesting
thing that you saw on the movie this is
called a nova it's another star in its
death phases and remarkably usually an
astronomy things change of a very slow
period of time but actually in 2002 this
Nova blew up and completely changed its
structure so we have we go back to it
periodically and take a snapshot of it
so we have a kind of a movie of its of
its change and by looking at the physics
of this eruption we can understand a
little bit more about how these stars
with their magnetic fields are how big
they are what kind of material they have
in them and then what happens to this
material later as it recycles into new
stars this is my favorite observation
because I proposed it it's actually this
one Andrew ISM as a mosaic of many
advanced camera for surveys images it's
kind of like hat I remember my show my
age my brownie camera which I couldn't
have taken a mosaic of the Grand Canyon
and then suddenly having a digital
detector today this is the kind of
advancement we had on Hubble and this
camera was just put up a few years ago
and I cautioned my colleagues to wait
for the new camera and it was really
tough to convince them to do that but we
finally did take the mosaic of this
galaxy which is called the sombrero and
you can see why so this is the Hubble
image of it this is the infrared image
of it which is completely different so
many of the stars that you saw in the
halo the bright halo disappear and the
infrared is able to see right in
to the core of this galaxy and
diminishes the effect of the huge dust
lane and then the two were combined in
this very striking image so this is the
two Great observatories at work together
there are also of course this is a radio
image there are x-ray images of this
object just to understand what the dust
Lane is doing how its rotating how big
is it and what is the core of this
galaxy doing we found that in many
galaxies there are black holes in the
center and we're trying to understand
how big they are and how they form as
well now this is to show you a
comparison of this is a wide-angle image
taken from the ground of Orion so if any
of you know any of your constellations
Orion the Hunter these are his shoulders
his knees and this is his belt and he
has a dagger and there's a famous nebula
that can be seen by I a little fuzzy
spot in the end the dagger it's been
known for a long time and this is from
one of our sister observatories a
ground-based telescope image of the
nebula and then of course we always want
to image it with Hubble so this is the
Hubble image and although we can't cover
the same footprint on the sky it does
show us some of the detail the little
movie is just showing the zoom into
Orion so that this is has tremendous
detail now and we can start to resolve
the film entry structure and cart start
to pick around in here and look for new
stars in formation and possibly
planetary systems as well and this is
just then zooms in and shows finally the
high resolution Hubble image i compelled
to show also globular clusters because
this is my field of research globular
clusters are clusters that have millions
of stars in them that formed in the
early part of the universe so these are
witnesses to the formation of the
universe and by studying them we can
understand what the conditions were like
we have few things around us that
remnants from that time but these are
galaxies the sombrero that you saw the
colliding galaxies that you saw they all
contain these objects and so we study
them because they form together we learn
a lot about stars how big they are how
small they can get and how they evolve
and you can also see the the beautiful
color though the reddish and orange II
stars are the big massive what are
called supergiant's red giants and the
other ones are stars more like the Sun
m101 is a classic because the original
Hubble images that were taken when we
actually had an event that we don't talk
about anymore which is when the mirror
was not perfect this is a classic image
that then showed to NASA and the world
that Hubble had been fixed and in fact
it had achieved its resolution that that
we had hoped for this galaxy is often
used as an analogy for our own so if our
galaxy sort of looks like this we would
be about this far out we're about our
son is about halfway out in our galaxy
and our galaxy is a pinwheel spiral very
similar to m101 and this just shows
again that these images have very high
resolution so you can really zoom in
with the new camera you can really zoom
in and in fact interestingly enough this
law object is actually this object and
you can keep zooming in and again these
are on the web so you can play with them
yourself but this is actually a
background galaxy that that is slightly
obscured by m101 but it's way way way
way more distant than m101 is itself we
we also have imaged every planet except
for Venus and Mercury because we can't
point the telescope too close to the Sun
because it'll damage the electronics and
the mirror but we've done all the other
planets and in fact Saturn we can look
at different phases and see how thin the
Rings are and also resolve the various
the various ring structures the the ring
system of Saturn is actually very
complex made of Little Rock's of dust
and we're trying to understand why these
gaps are here and it's believed that it
has some
to do with a resonance with one of the
moons and then this is the famous
pillars of creation it's one of the
regions in which stars are forming out
of this dark gas and dust and then new
stars begin to emerge so this is great
you know that we do news and we put
these images out whenever an astronomer
has a discovery and also we have a
project called the Hubble heritage
project so we find images in the archive
and we go to the person who proposed the
the observations say can we publish your
image in color on the web and they
usually agree and they provide some
background information so that's really
the news track but we collaborate with a
number of institutions to get this
material not only into the news media
but to provide public information to
everyone to to interact with science
museums for example the Adler
Planetarium polls images online for
their shows and also for their cyber
gallery we have a formal science for
mille curriculum stream where we work
with schools and educators to bring
astronomy to develop math and science
skills in pre college students and then
we also have a very robust at a college
education program because most of our
investigators are in colleges and they
teach astronomy and maybe some of you
took such a course in in your career the
challenge that we're faced with is that
we have many many observatories we have
a whole fleet of observatories in orbit
and we have many ground-based
observatories and scientist as well as
the public would like to say tell me
about this part of the sky and get the
information and right now when you do
that you have to go to each individual
Observatory to find the information that
you want we have one project of many
which aggregates some of this
information there are a number of
archive projects that aggregate in in
wavelength aggregate in public interest
and we also belong to a project at Space
Telescope that is a collaboration across
the country with
many universities and organizations
called the virtual observatory and the
idea is to provide a a structured layer
and alberta will tell you a little bit
about this which has data standards and
has tools that are standard protocols in
astronomy so that eventually anyone can
build an interface and doesn't have to
worry about going to each mission or
observatory that through these standards
and protocols can get at the data right
now this is the science interface to the
virtual observatory and it's arduous at
best to use it is very useful for
finding out inventory so i can say how
many observations does m101 have what
what has this what have astronomers
observed in EM 101 and I can find out
that information but it's not yet a data
aggregator and we would like to develop
a data aggregator so that anyone
including scientists but also the public
can then find and ask a question about
the sky and get the end for all the
information that's available because all
of this research is funded by NASA and
NSF and the data belongs to you so at
this point I'll turn over to Alberto and
he'll talk about some of the technical
details so before I go into a little
detail I would like to tell you actually
we're all these data that Carol is
pointing to basically really is so for
Hubble for example the data the Hubble
is covered doesn't cover the sky so
these are we going to use a little movie
that shows basically where the Hubble
data is located at this point so they're
so system.object this is ecliptic the
path of the Sun and in the sky there are
stars what Carol showed you the clusters
the galaxy clusters but Hubble by no
means covers the entire sky and the
reason why it doesn't it's it's simple
it's because the field of view of Hubble
is is much much small it's much smaller
than any other spells telescopes and
also because Hubble does not serve a
systematically the whole sky there's a
large competition in people to actually
try to get time on humble so how bold
really has the time to observe and
usually does observe the most
interesting objects in the sky but there
are other surveys at the Space Telescope
we host the digit
Sky Survey which is a servant of that
covers in three different wavelengths
the entire sky at obviously that much
lower resolution in hub bulb but it does
cover the entire sky at Space Telescope
also we host many more missions we asked
about 15 those submissions one on one of
them is Hubble Space Telescope and some
of these missions actually do have a
full sky coverage i'm going to show you
one in a second there are other service
that don't are not hosted in space
telescope they are not part of NASA the
separate service one of them is his own
digital sky survey which in about a few
years will actually have covered
basically a quarter of the sky of the
whole sky so it will cover pi basically
a quarter of the entire sky to actually
do a pretty good depth and so in in five
call if I defend wavebands so you can
generate multiple if you will RGB color
images out of this and it's a very very
well understood very very well
understood and cover survey and but you
can see basically as you can see it
doesn't cover for example it covers only
partially part of the southern sky
there's another survey which actually
and by the way in Sloan was mainly put
together because of the interesting in
starting Galaxy Evolution so it mainly
surveys galaxies but there are services
are aimed at surveying the sky four
stars so this is the 2mass survey which
so this image that you see here has
probably half a billion stars or
something and all of the all these dots
actually starts this is the skeleton so
to speak of a milky way in the infrared
so again this is a whole sky survey you
can point in any direction in the sky
you're going to find images from the two
masks from this infrared survey so as
you can see we have multiple multiple
coverage across the whole sky from
multiple surveys another interesting
survey which is not complete but it's
starting to be complete which is also
hosted at the Space Telescope Science
Institute Carol and I work is galux
which is an ultraviolet satellite which
will have a full sky the whole sky
survey and this galaxy run if you
remember this but carol just showed you
this this is a more than one just
realized this this morning actually um
and so this is actually the view of that
galaxy that carol showed you in the
infrared
and resolution sorry in the ultraviolet
a resolution that was not even thinkable
if you just a few years ago so and again
in maybe a couple of years this will be
there will be a UV image ultraviolet
image of any of all the sources in the
sky up to this to this resolution and
just to give you an idea of the scale
this is about 3800 pixel on the side so
where does one go if one wants to get
all this data so the in the united
states in particularly nasa there are
lots lots of data centers the data
center in blue here is the data center
hosts visible and ultraviolet data at
Space Telescope where Caroline I work
but there are other data centers namely
there's data centers the heart that have
high energy astrophysics meaning x-ray
x-ray data there's infrared archives
Ursa their archives a whole microwave
background data so it's very different
wavelengths and then their archives for
example like 80s which hold really all
the publications and astronomers that
astronomers make and published links to
these data archives on where you can
actually go and get and get the data and
then there there are other databases
available to astronomers which actually
they're like yellow pages so to speak
you can go to Ned for the for the extra
galactic database and you can basically
what you can do at this NASA Center you
can actually ask I want you to search
for m31 or for Andromeda anyway and this
will do a name resolve in so to speak
for you and will give you the
coordinates on the sky and point you to
all other observations are available
about these objects in in the other data
centers so astronomy as I said at the
beginning it's come a long way in the
past few years we have been entering
basically this new era of astronomy
which is the era of large large surveys
and now many of them are coming to be
multi terabytes in size the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey for example has
already many more than 100 million
objects and by objects I mean galaxies
and stars and anything else and there
are other surveys are being planned and
so at at this rate we're really going to
have a problem actually even publishing
data making making the data available to
the public not because
the data volume is so large but also
because but because it's going to be
hard to to have people find the data in
a meaningful way on top of this as I
just showed you they're going to be many
more all sky surveys and in many many
different wave bands and so a
multi-wavelength basically astronomy's
is starting at a frantic pace as you say
and so this will cut will just make the
problem even worse and the good news is
that you know they're being already
impressive discover just made just made
by by using you know for all the all the
people that have access to these
hundreds of millions of objects there
being some impressive discoveries
already made so we're going the right
direction as far as the science but we
still have we still have problems so
what is the problem really so we have if
you count all the data that we have we
probably have a few petabytes of data
which are basically online somewhere
somehow in data centers in Europe into
the sensor the united states across the
world basically but the problem is that
with this data we have you know we are
interested in basically in fine in
getting some science out of this data
mining for interesting objects or weird
objects that we have seen or new classes
of objects and the problem is that each
of these objects that we are basically
tagged with a property like position you
can you can think of like some
brightness or some color some type it's
as a galaxy star or some size depending
on how close to you they are or if the
intrinsically small for example so we
typically are dealing with multi you
know multi petabytes did datasets with
objects i have that live in this 400
let's say dimensional space and so this
is not it's not easy so it's not easy to
deal with on top of this as i said the
beginning the data bridget doubles every
every couple years due to the growth in
technology in detectors and so the
publishing of the data is really one of
the key problems that we encounter at
the moment and on top of that we really
lack and i will show you I'm show you
why in a minute we really lack you know
good visualization and query tools for
this amount with this amounts of data so
astronomers were used to just
concentrating on just a few objects that
you can study them at length now they
can actually study a length millions of
objects but they don't have the tools to
do so one of the answers to this
question is an alliance it's an
international alliance that
has been formed a few years ago and
start and is trying to deal to try to
federate basically databases across the
world I have astronomical data it's
called international future Observatory
Alliance something that care alluded to
before and the the u.s. partner in this
alliance is called the National virtual
Observatory which is again the project
manager for that is is actually Space
Telescope where Cara and I work but
there are as you can see their
collaborations across the world
basically the idea is that we should
come we should be able to come up with
some sort of standards built on top of
what a storm is already know to actually
be able to talk to each other and try to
make sense of this large amount of data
that we have really at our disposal and
historical astronomers have been pretty
good at actually establishing standards
for the data one of the one of the one
of the cornerstones of of their
standards is the flexible image
transport system this fits file which is
a standard in astronomy it's like it's
like an hdf5 HTF file basically for GIS
so just to give an idea what it is it's
it's a system that it's a files it's a
file type that allows you to carry
information it has a header and the
header is very useful because you can
see a little example here it shows you
basically allows you to understand what
kind of coordinate system you are in if
you are working to projection using for
that particular data where how you can
let's say rotate this data d projected
this there and we project it so it
allows you to give you some metadata
about about the data you carrying it has
a very simple scheme there's a keyword
value statement in the header and the
interesting thing is that and this was
built I think almost the idea came up
almost 30 years ago actually it was
supposed to contain both digital images
which is the pretty images that we
showed you but on top of that it is
supposed to contain also catalogs that
basically address the fact that okay I
have a disability image now tell me
which ones are the stars which ones are
the galaxies for example and so and it's
pretty it's pretty intense in a sense
that you can have tables if you will in
there so you can multi dimensional
tables inside inside a structure
structure of this time supposed to
remind you that fits is as old as
8-track tapes it was invented at about
the same time so astronomers kind of got
her we got our act together early which
is a good thing
thank you that's right I forgot so but
what we also aware that you know things
are changing around us so we have to
take a look at more flexible ways of
really not not using fit because this is
mostly for the data but really thinking
about how we can describe it it I think
about the metadata so the virtual
Observatory Alliance came up with a with
a particular xml schema if you will to
describe astronomical data it's called a
vo table it's a it's a there's no
transport of information in here other
than I mean imaging it is a pure means
of transport or of talking either
between computers or humans if you can
read this of describing basic resources
are available to you in astronomy and
and its main is mainly used to carry
information about catalogs about list of
images and where they are located and
other resources let's say I want to know
where this particular observation was
made and when it was made I can actually
query some service that will return this
to me and I'll show you in a second what
I mean and the other corner stone of our
standards is is a word coordinate system
so we we have we know we understand very
well several kinds of coordinate system
from galactic to ecliptic to two
different epochs in equatorial
coordinates and we are very very good at
understanding all of this little jargon
here what all these projections really
means so these are just some of the
projections that are using astronomy so
10 is very very it's very the tangential
projections is extremely popular but
nevertheless we we know this is pure
math really so it's not too hard but we
know how to transform from one to the
other and then recently there's this is
not a standard yeah but it's it's
something that has come to the attention
of the entire stroma community and it's
the fact that some extent having all
this data online is great but at some
point we need to be able to find it and
find it quickly and so I call this zip
code in the sky it's it's a weight
basically to index the entire sphere the
entire entire sphere for you two to be
able to ask very quickly find this
object and find me all the neighbors
that it contains a you know in less than
a millisecond just I want and I'm
creating billions of objects so this
hierarchical triangle
index is basically it's a 64-bit
integers that allows you to to find
objects at different resolutions very
very quickly it's been implemented in
databases and and right now lives as a
as a stored procedure in Microsoft
sequel server but is a very efficient
and at allowing astronomers to find in
very large thatÃ­s databases are
basically a a particular point in the
sky and so around this and run some of
the standards that showed you the vo the
National virtual Observatory in the US
but also across across the world the
visual Observatory Alliance has
developed some simple services these are
all web services because we recognized
at some point they're going to be
they're going to be lots of machines
talking to each other so these are all
sup web services and one of them is very
simple one I want you to give me a all
the objects on around this particular
region and this is as tribulus asking it
database basically to return to you the
list of objects these stores but then
they are in there are other standards
and one of them is obviously the an
image access protocol so you can
actually ask a server to give you
basically a an image on a location for
the particular image and then again
they're based on fits and their returns
as as this particular XML standard that
we use in and then there are other
sophisticated I'm not gonna go into
detail but they're more sophisticated
ways to query data bases across across
the interpreter Observatory that allow
you to do to ask a particular database
for some objects to ask another database
for the same objects and then to put
them together and and find and figure
out which one of the same objects or not
you might seem a trivial might seem a
trivial task but is really not because
many many databases of different
resolutions across the sky and then just
to show you what what kind of interface
astronomers are used to right now this
is the this is a mission again hosted
Space Telescope Science Institute and
this is a typical form that storm is
Phil to find the data it's almost
primitive I would call it but it's a
very simple form where you actually say
I want Andromeda here and then the
coordinates are populated and it's going
to return to you some information he's
going to turn to you the
position in the sky magnet which is
brightness some measure of how much data
rates may be and these are typically
what we have but the Islamic immunity
has been growing a little bit more the
growth the Islamic communities being
will be more interesting so lately
they've been asking for interfaces to
actually do a little bit more that allow
you basically we expose to the Roma
community the entire database and we
allow them to do to cults equals
straight straight sequel against the
databases and ask for any questions so
to speak that they want to answer which
is something that they cannot do with a
form which is with the previous form of
that just showed you and then finally
there are also they're also this is from
the zone Digital Sky Survey they're also
interfaces that go beyond that the junk
they don't return to your list of
objects they want to return to you
images basically so this is a this is
what's called the navigator on the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey it's a very
interesting interface looks almost like
a mapquest of Google Maps it allows you
to navigate the sky and allows you also
to click on each on individual objects
and for each of these objects you can
have information such as obviously
position but also such as how bright
they are and all this is interesting
because the the emergence of these tools
of this navigator is actually something
that it is actually needed in astronomy
in general and the interesting thing is
that there are a series of web server is
the plug into this interface where you
can actually find for example all the
objects are being detected in this
particular field or all the objects that
have respect from all the objects that
are detected in particular in a
particular in a particular field in in
this area and they allow you obviously
to zoom in and out so let me conclude
here I think what we want to we are like
for you to go home with is really that
they are there are these many square
degrees in the sky these degrees in the
sky correspond to basically two trillion
pixels or so and one wavelength
astronomers have to deal with out four
terabytes this is what the entire sky is
not a very high resolution of my ad but
there are multi-wavelength services are
coming online and so this is the volume
we're going to look at maybe hundreds of
terabytes or so for multi-wavelength
surveys and then something I never even
touched on is if you add now
the time dimension which means suppose I
want to find objects that had varied
since my last observation this number
might actually go up by a large factor
because you have to survey the sky
repeatedly and there's the test scripts
are coming online they're going to
survey the entire sky every three days
and so these is the volume that we
expect so the challenges that we're
facing are all these there is really
hard to publish and not only the
programs are minded data are hard to
publish by the data in general is out to
publish it's hard to find and understand
the data because there's a massive
amount of information and the interface
is actually not well developed so what
we need is a new paradigm basic we need
to look at the data in a different way
we need to look at analysis tools and
visualization tools in a completely
different way we need to think about us
we need to think about it sort of out of
the box and at the same time we have to
realize that we have to do some
educational some education within the
community because there's such illogical
issues you're involved you know when a
thermos don't concentrate anymore on
just a few objects they need to think
about hundreds of millions of objects
there's this there's an issue here which
is may be as simple as educating
astronomers and and having a lower
sequel or just exposing them to new kind
of technologies so i'll stop here and if
you have any questions that's Carol's
email for all the complaints and that's
my email for everything else thank you
any questions we scale them all please
right so you could do it that way right
so you could do that way yeah the
question is why do you use you use the
HTM index as opposed to just doing a
straight position or cut basically in
the sky so you could do that right it
turns out that HDM is extremely
efficient at answering that question
that you just asked there are issues
with we rate with the fact that we are
cutting in in position in the sky odin
sphere so it's not that trivial as it
seems and you might be that you are
projecting the data in a particular
projection system so you have to do
additional calculations HTM is is very
powerful because he's hierarchical so I
can actually concentrate on just
particular edge of the sky and then
drill down to the resolution I want and
it's very very fast so we're talking
about a factor of 100 maybe a thousand
faster than doing what you advocate any
other questions right
what is that what is the typical storage
for matter
and can you project it all in one space
kind of like Google Earth yeah so the
question is we use a lots of projections
and can you use is there a single
projection system that we can actually
possibly use the answer is yes I mean in
principle the most common one is a
tangential projection right now
everybody does that but it is actually
not hard to project or to reproject as
you will there's an issue only since you
consider sphere at the polls so you have
two very very pale as you probably well
know for for google earth though they
issue the polls right but I think
there's nothing it really depends so the
way I was thinking about this is like if
we had a tool to actually would browse
the sky at some point you might want to
as you approach the polls you might want
to use a different projection right and
so that might be influenced might be
better but in general yes the answer is
yes you can with a little bit of work
you can project Islamic elimination to a
want to let's say tangential projection
Carol I was also going to mention we
have a similar search problem if you
will if I can make an analogy the sky
surveys are like Landsat right it's time
ordered essentially and that's how the
sky surveys are done and lots of times
the archives are built that way so
that's time ordered but the pointed
observations like the digital globe or
you know the I conus quick bird all that
stuff that's pointed observations and we
have pointed observations too so we have
to marry the two when you do a search
you have to search into archives that
our time ordered and position ordered so
that that can be tricky as well yes sir
and so I did on that I didn't I didn't
even mention time domain but that 10
domain will give us even more headaches
then we can even think of because it's a
very isn't really non-trivial problem
you know when you keep observing the
same part of the sky and how do you find
objects that vary it from the previous
from the previous observation or
something so it's a it's something that
it's that has been on the minds of a
thermos for a long time wait for you
your first time okay why are the radio a
which is why resolution
okay so the question is why I radio
images such a low resolution compared to
visible as actually you want to take
well radio waves are very big so you
need a very big antenna so a typical
radio dish has to be the size of this
room to even get a modest resolution but
you know you have a digital camera with
a small with a small lens that big and
you can get quite exquisite visible
images and it's because of the nature of
light and nature of radiation that that
visible light is really tiny and so it
you can resolve it with us tiny lens or
mirror whereas a radio wave is very
large and to collect many of them and
bring them into focus requires a large
facility so for example era sebo and
puerto rico is a very large dish it has
an interesting resolution but now what
radio astronomers build are called
interferometers where they instead of
building one big dish they simulate it
by having many dishes and then combining
it and then you can get to the higher
resolution if you have you know like in
Arizona or New Mexico there are you know
fields of little radio dishes and then
you combine all the signals together and
then you can get the same resolution but
it's the nature of light that a
radiation that x-ray is really really
really tiny so you can get really high
resolution and then visible infrared and
radio and so your detector has to be the
multiples of the wavelength of the light
radiation that you're trying to detect
did you have a question branch I Brian
talked about compression in time I mean
it seems like since very little change
over time that you can impression with
quite just doing Delta compression and
so hopefully you won't end up with
petabytes maybe yeah maybe so the
question is uh you might not hand up
with petabytes of data if you actually
use high high high level compression
basically too yeah so Ella system which
is this new survey telescope which will
survey the sky over three days a full
sky well actually try to do exactly that
because they're looking for asteroids
right so the idea is okay Westeros move
very fast across the skies I'm looking
for things are changing moving from one
place to another overnight and so the
idea is that I can store I don't have I
don't need I saw resolution images I
just need it will be the difference
between images basically very very
efficiently to find them yeah so
at their standards for the image
compressions for lossless yeah so we use
of it as an image compressor so it does
some compression is not is not extremely
efficient in compressing because it was
was built a long time ago but it's a
it's quite effective at compressing so
yes Andrew unexpectedly you have special
k see those pictures or is it something
that weekend we can support or later the
public always seen you I think that
would be an interesting project to get
the highest quality for the press
releases we have one person who knows
how to do this and he is an artist he's
a scientist as well but he is an artist
and he's been mentoring other people in
the process so it's possible to do a
quick and dirty color image and come to
combination you do to registering and
then you and and then you you decide a
color balance so we could do that if you
wanted the highest quality stuff that's
why we don't actually produce everything
in color it's because we produce the
best of the best and it does take some
time but I think you can get sort of a
baseline color image and in fact Sloan
has done that yeah so again I wasn't
going to say exactly that so Sloan has
done this systematically right and again
the Navigator Islam it is an example
right so you might not be the best let's
bring it up it might not be the
best-looking galaxy scientifically
speaking but it's actually pretty good
right and so they've done this
systematically very quickly trying to
match you know blue is very hot here and
this is a you know proper probably older
older population stars in this
particular galaxy this is a fairly young
galaxy so they try to keep the science
the science underneath it right but
they've done a pretty quick and dirty
and New York it works pretty well so I
think the answer is yes I was also going
to add with with the sky survey you know
you have a set exposure time and so you
know what you how each filter is going
to be exposed for a certain amount of
time and then you can automate it with
Hubble it's up to an individual
to specify the observation so what
Alberta wants to do with his data and
what I want to do with mine are very
different so they are pointed
observations are different and they they
take a little more tooling but in fact
the scientific community is starting to
exhibit a little impatience with having
to do all the process themselves so
we're starting to look at automated
processes for scientists as well so any
also i guess just to add to this much it
really depends on the audience right so
if you're really talking to to do this
for outreach purposes and you want to
develop a navigator which has the first
you know the first thing you want to do
is is not really carry the scientific
information one you want to maintain
some scientific information so you may
be a little bit less about being
accurate hundred percent right on the
other hand if you really want to serve
the scientist the scientist might even
actually not care about the color image
at all you might want just a straight
image from from the telescope trying to
do whatever he or she wants or national
so here
that's interesting what jung kk so
Hubble yeah the question is often does
Hubble see junk in the way basic another
observation right let's write
interesting question so I wish I carry I
have an image here but I don't have it
right of how the data actually gets to
us to space let's go from from humble
directly right so you know we shown you
very very beautiful pictures of the
actual of the actual images but in
reality there's a lot of junk that you
actually don't see a nice to be cleaned
I saw their space you know to make an
image like this you know if you take a
look at this image when it comes down
from the telescope it's extremely
extremely different and okay the junk
I'm thinking of is not the junk you
think you know everything right so you
do see sometimes trails of asteroids
right extremely rare because the field
of view of this of tell Hubble is very
small so is the probability of
intersecting something is very tiny but
you do see sometimes well you don't see
here is that the image need to be clean
because there are particles high-energy
particles in space called cosmic rays
the heat detector constantly so they
need to be cleaned and they cause trails
which are similar to asteroids so if you
see a non clean image of Hubble it's
going to be full of these little trails
and so that's why carol was saying the
beginning that we they move the
telescope around because each pixel then
is hit by a different set of these right
and then you can clean them up later
it's called a different pattern so they
have a pattern maximize the resolution
of this other spacecraft so and i'm
trying to think about other satellites
but i don't know if you've actually
Hubble eyes there are the satellites
because most of the satellites that we
were speaking of are in low Earth orbit
and so they're they're all within a band
around the earth and so they don't
really very often pass over each other
but one of the other hazards is when we
go through the meteor shower so we have
this big frantic thing when we go
through the meteor shower we closed the
mirror and a little anecdotal story is
that we had a prediction two years ago
of when the meteor shower is it was a
Perseids I think which is in August
we're already you know weird okay we're
going to turn the telescope away so that
it's excuse me its butt and was into the
meteor shower right we closed mirror and
everything
prediction was off by 15 hours and it's
sat pointed straight into the meteor
shower and then we turned it and closed
everything down and found out later that
we had completely missed it but the
telescope wasn't damaged so we have
problems like that but but pretty much
the satellites don't pass over each
other because the orbits are really very
carefully monitored but there's a lot
junk right but you know but it's it's
not that much so the question is how do
you access the data basically or why do
what you do so for Hubble data we used
to actually make dvds and send them to
two people right but not dvds are small
too small right so if I gigabytes is
nothing right so you have lotsa so right
now the preferment is actually they
allow you to download it from the web
there there are sites if you go to the
Space Telescope site where we we work
there's an arcade link so you can
actually go and download the feeling but
that even that is becoming a little bit
problematic now because some people
would like to have the entire entire
zone Digital Sky Survey which is to try
bites but you know over ftp over any
anything it's pretty silly so what we're
trying to do is we have the problem
right we have the problem people asking
a lot of data so what we try to do is
that many of them ask a lot of data
because they don't know how to search
for less data so what we try to do is
try to build interfaces for them for
them to cut down on that data and say I
want just this particular observation
even if it's five thousand objects or if
you yeah a few gigabyte then then then
that's what you do yes Carol this is an
example of the vo interface Alberta
showed you some other interfaces but
right right here is here's an option you
can save it locally so you select all
the stuff you want so the this
particular observations was for a
globular cluster called NGC 6624 and it
turns out there's some deep sky Digital
Sky Survey images or some HST images
is there some infrared images and then I
can click on here and then save the
whole thing locally and analyze locally
or i can analyze online with a tool
called aladdin so typically what people
will do is they will select their data
actually download it to their desktop
and then analyze their
scientifically okay so the question is
what people have what where are people
then you know with the data they've
downloaded I don't know scientifically I
can go on for a while here there are
lots of the lots of lots of things that
the people have done the people who have
discovered you see new objects right
knee new classes objects that we're not
there the people have discovered that
all the objects look very different now
if we compare like like Carol showed
multiple wavelengths right you see for
example a sombrero galaxy you see some
image in the in the visible and a very
different image in the infrared and this
tells you what's going on in that galaxy
saw people doing a lot of a lot of work
of this if you want to add on some I was
going to say for Hubble and further most
of the observatories an individual
scientist can specify an observation
like we specified the sombrero for
example and then to study the dust Lane
in that galaxy but then the data became
public so the power of the archive is
another group I just went to a
conference a month ago where another
group looked for clusters in that galaxy
so different groups look for different
things they want to study different
different things with the same data so
our philosophy has always been with the
archives the archives are open after the
originator of the observation has some
period of time to analyze the data then
the archives open and anybody can get in
there and take the data and do whatever
kind of research they want and so that
really is starting to pay off
