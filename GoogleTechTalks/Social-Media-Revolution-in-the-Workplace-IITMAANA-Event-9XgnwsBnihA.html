is Kaushik and I'm an office bearer of
the IIT mana bay area chapter since a
lot of you might not know what that
means I'm going to take the trouble of
expanding that whole acronym so it is
indian institute of technology madras
Alumni Association North America so we
organized a bunch of events through the
year some technical and some cultural
and we just decided to pick one of the
hot topics of the year which is
obviously social media social computing
and we have a fantastic lineup of
panelists and a very capable moderator
with us now before we get started the
founder of the pan IIT group has a small
announcement to make and soon after that
I'll hand over the mic to page so
without further ado let me just get
started with a short announcement thanks
guys hi folks monisha sanyal from iit
madras but to be correct I'm one of the
cofounders of the pan iit group the
penalty is the composition of all the
seven campuses of the IIT in india which
is indian institute of technology i just
have a small announcement to make our
next major event in fact that's a
penalty event is going to be on May
sixteenth and it's the first ever pan
IIT research summit and we are kind of
holding this around the visit of our
great nondurable professor ashok junjun
voila who is visiting on that day he's
got the padma shri award and several
other awards for his work on on ruler
advancement using technology so he's
going to be visiting and we are putting
together a crack pan IIT panel from all
the other IITs also and you might have
seen the picture of Chris Banerjee of HP
today announcing the Singapore set up
he's also going to be on a panel he's
confirmed that and we have another
number of others who are joining so this
is going to be a morning session and the
advantages it's
the day after ticon which is on
fourteenth and fifteenth of me so to
facilitate this for ice cores people we
are doing it in the morning so they can
leave on time so please mark that on
your calendars it's May sixteenth Sunday
thank you okay so thanks for the
announcement I guess we ready to get
started so please join me in welcoming
all of our panelists and page Finkelman
right here who's going to be the
moderator for the evening thank you hi
guys how's it going great ask eric
mentioned i'm paige Winkleman and i'll
be moderating tonight's discussion first
off I'd like to thank everyone in the
IIT mana which is a complex acronym for
joining us and many thanks to Google for
hosting us as you might have heard the
topic for tonight's panel discussion is
the social media revolution in the
workplace so really the goal of
tonight's gathering is to engage with
assembled panel of experts to my right
to answer questions about the adoption
of social computing in the enterprise as
well as the cultural effects of said
adoption and the best practices they've
learned in the field I want to specify
that this discussion will focus on
internal tools as opposed to external
tools just to clarify before our
panelists introduce themselves I wanted
to take a quick poll of the audience to
get a sense and a pulse on your use of
social two tools both inside and outside
of the workplace so if you wouldn't mind
bear with me and sort of do this cheesy
exercise by raising your hand and my
question for you is do you use as a
consumer with your friends I show a
social network to connect with them that
would include things like Facebook
LinkedIn high-five myspace orkut all
right I'm gonna go with the Oliver marks
clearly doesn't human races so I'm gonna
say the majority of you far majority
going
who doesn't if you don't leave where we
miss you we're waiting for you to join
so my second question is by show of
hands how many of you leverage tools
like social CRM wikis blogs or social
software in the workplace Oh more than I
thought ok cool and that my last
question is by show of hands when you're
working is email the principal form of
communication you use to communicate
internally with your coworkers that's
the fair number ok so just wanted to get
a little pulse so generally speaking the
majority of this audiences uses social
applications in the workplace except for
a couple of guys in the back majority of
you use email at work and there are
quite a few adopters of social tools
within workplace which is good so I just
wanted to get a sense of what sort of
caliber the audience was so we're
gathered here today to delve a little
more into the second third second and
third questions which is the usage of
these tools in the enterprise you know
the answers to second and third
questions are changing rather rapidly
and have been for quite some time more
and more enterprises are acknowledging
the value of collaborative technologies
and these tools liberate us from the
constraints of legacy communications
like email social tools also provide
business managers with access to the
right information at the right time
through a web of interconnected
applications services and devices
ultimately collaboration encourages the
collective intelligence of many to
bubble up to the surface flattening the
organization which translates to a
competitive advantage by increasing
productivity agility etc so as
technology is shifting away from a data
centric perspective to a more people
centric perspective a profound shift in
the way we work and communicate is
occurring work groups are no longer
limited by geography or time zones I
don't know if you all recall the
author Thomas L Friedman he wrote a book
quite some time ago acknowledging that
the world has indeed become quite flat
at least from a collaboration
perspective so why is this important why
should we care for starters it marks a
significant change in the ways companies
source business intelligence it gives
everyone in the organization an equal
opportunity platform to be heard without
needing to yell humans are inherently
social look around we're all here in
this room to engage and interact and
ultimately hopefully learn from each
other and now that the technology has
arrived to mimic the social nature
inherent in people adoption of social
computing is on the rise bringing with
it valuable intelligence that can solve
complex problems and not only are these
problems being solved but we're learning
every step of the way the best practices
and the cultural that impact those
technologies are having on work culture
so I was looking around for a statistic
to share with you about what how big
this market is and the most accurate one
I could find was from readwriteweb we'd
white web and it was from april two
thousand eight and it said the
enterprise 2 point 0 which is loosely
the term used to define collaborative
technologies very umbrella term was to
become a 4.6 billion dollar industry by
2013 let's let's chunk of change and
there's significant vendors here in this
panel that represent pretty significant
organizations that are clearly have
something to say so with that I want
without further ado I'd like our
panelists to introduce themselves
starting with my friend and iit alumni
anshu please state your name who you
work for and what you do for your
employer go IIT especially caliper so my
name is Anne shoe Sharma I work for a
company called salesforce com I ran
product management I'm a vice president
of product management for the platform
group and what I do for the company is
help figure out our vision for our
products which in this context probably
most
relevant product is called charter which
is our social collaboration tool which
extends our platform and CRM
capabilities to make it a more social
tool and I think I'll have a lot the
words to say about these things the 4.6
billion dollar number was interesting
always wondered where the last hundred
million dollar comes from when you come
up with 2030 numbers but that's a
readwriteweb question not a page
question want to share your micro I am
Raju Vegas nuh I'm the Evangelist for
zoho my responsibilities to just get the
word out of out and educate many users
about soho we are a company based in
pleasanton but most of them in 90 more
than 95 of other companies kind of just
behind IIT campus in Chennai so we have
been around for 14 years doing private
bootstrap profitable and doing well so
far hello everybody i'm oliver marks i'm
a family part of the service group which
is a new company which is basically all
that enterprise collaboration consulting
and i'm the only person on this panel
he's not a vendor I'm actually platform
agnostic so what I do is I go into large
companies and organize their
collaboration strategy and tactics and I
actually worked inside Sony Playstation
running their collaboration environment
for two years we should have informed me
for a lot of work I've been doing
subsequently my name is Ross Mayfield
and I'm here to fix your email problem
I'm with a company that's called social
text we started back in 2002 is a wiki
platform and have evolved into a far
broader platform with everything from
social spreadsheets to micro blogging
and activity streams and in general what
we do is a group has helped provide the
tools and some of the practices for
people to change and transform their
businesses I'm Matt Matt Tucker the CTO
and co-founder from jive software and so
I guess if it's a 4.6 billion dollar
market
we'll leave maybe a 600 million for the
rest of you guys I don't know maybe ouch
hi I'm Greg Dallas enter I work for a
small startup that just went public
couple years back named google and i
work on google wave as a product manager
my superhero name is dr. wave and Greg
just for everyone's benefit can you
stand up real quick Greg's actually got
jeans with the wave logo monogrammed on
to the pockets yeah he's that into it
wrangler sure sure high school sure okay
thank you gentlemen I wanted to say a
quick word about the format we're going
to engage in the panel conversation for
about an hour and then we'll open it up
for Q&amp;amp;A there's a microphone here in the
middle of the room I also wanted to
mention for those of you with devices
and are on twitter the hashtag for this
event is iit it's pretty straightforward
so i'll be refreshing search page and
getting questions that way if you're a
little afraid of the mic please feel
free to use social micro blogging tools
in the social media revolution in the
workplace panel okay so I have a few
questions actually I want to I want to
talk to Ross real quick so Ross you've
been in the wiki business for quite some
time yes I have there's a lot of vendors
in this landscape it can be a little
overwhelming for someone because it's so
saturated how do I know which wiki is
best for my problem so I don't think
it's just which wiki I think there's a
lot of choice in the market which is a
really good thing the best place to try
to figure out what the real differences
is kind of where do these companies
start you know everybody whenever you're
starting you know it's it's kind of a
funny thing every single company starts
with a single product and every single
product starts even with a single
feature and the DNA of what
you are is very much from where you
began the early customers that you got
the problems that you tried to solve the
culture you're built in your community
you know within your company in the
community around it so for us we chose
kind of the starting point of a wiki
which is the more collaborative of the
applications it's actually the most
widely used behind the firewall unlike
let's say with public facing social
media there's other things that have
grown let's say even beyond let's say
Wikipedia to a degree but I think also I
mean everybody has different starts you
started off as doing public facing
forums you started off as kind of the
daughter of all demos or you know as it
well you know Google is started as a
search company right and I think this
might be cheered up are you anyway what
they do all kinds of right is it really
the know but but really I think if you
if you look at it through the lens of
where did they start and take a look at
their products and the capabilities
around it and what their customers have
actually achieved with it that's their
very clear differences in how they've
teased in both the depth of what they
did and then what they discovered along
the path and actually within all these
vendors every single vendor has a
product within their platform that's
very different like right now one of the
things that we offer is the only
microblogging solution that's integrated
with a broader platform right that
broader social platform you could say
but so I think there's enough
differences people just have to do their
homework so Oliver is the only non
vendor I love that you're in the middle
yeah and I know Oliver on a personal
level that you're you're pragmatic and
you're quite a realist so are we going
about this the wrong way and my question
really is should we instead of being
social for the sake of being social
instead start with the problem and try
to solve it evaluating the best tools
without sort of thinking you know that
from the c-suite down what's our social
media strategy what's our what's our
collaborative strategy are we are we
going about this the wrong way is my
question um there is no 11
way I mean though sort of to set the
stage for this year it is a very crowded
market we're sort of an embarrassment of
riches with all the different
technologies out there but the the
caveat to that is that most companies
now are awash with dozens of different
systems so any sizable sort of company
will have social takes jive somebody
will be using google legally or
illegally in the company somebody else
will be using zoho properly and you know
sales forces another component so to
address the problem essentially what
you're seeing from a high level is that
you know the c-suite guys are looking
down and they're seeing all these
mushrooms growing up all this little
what I call collaboration silos building
up so a worst case scenario is where you
have dozens of different usernames and
passwords for dozens of different
systems so while you might have a
hundred people in say a sales and
marketing department working and
interacting wonderfully well and so jive
clear space or drive social business the
people outside that don't necessarily
see that may if there are thief terms
and political currents and undercurrents
you know running through the company
which that frankly they're almost
invariably is then these people will
tend to actually sort of retreat into
their castle and and and actually use
the technology for the exactly the
opposite way for which it was designed
and I see this all the time so I think
you know this year sort of summarize
there is a tremendous amount of
tremendously good technology out there
there's no a lot of people jump on
bandwagons and doing me to technologies
you know Twitter came along and then
there's dozens of Twitter variants of
varying degrees of use I guess but two
pages point you know you really have to
put the think very clearly through what
it is you're doing and why you're doing
it just as you would have anything else
in life you know pick the appropriate
tool for the appropriate job to fix a
fix a problem to fix the specific
problem not to be social page are we
allowed to just jump in and and keep
solutely not you'll speak when spoken to
what
now go ahead line panel ever what what
would you like to share is this live I
don't know ah excellent and so one way
that I take that question am and this is
an interesting report from gartner that
came out I think about two weeks ago and
one of the statistics was that seventy
percent of all IT led social initiatives
would fail and what was a percentage
sorry seventy percent have any percent
something like that and and if it's a
business-led social initiative much much
more successful and that's absolutely
what we see every day and its really are
you approaching this from an
infrastructure perspective is this a
tool or are we actually trying to solve
business problems and we absolutely
always look for the business buyer and
we know that those social initiatives
are much more successful there are IT
departments that get it that you know
are focused on on solving the business
problems and can do it the right way but
and yeah in terms of what is the right
way to do this start with the business
buyer start with how do we actually
leverage these tools to solve business
problems and in there invariably much
more successful rollouts so so if your
current buyer is a line of business
buyer do you ultimately want to be on
the CIO agenda and have him earmarking
dollars do we want collaborative
technologies and enterprise to point out
technologies to be their own bucket um
we like that the CIO budgets yes sure
and and and this is a market that's
interesting because it is still very
early there is no line item in most IT
budgets for social software still at
maybe next year and there's starting to
be a shift and but it is still taking
money from some existing project in
order to do the spend on social and and
ultimately yes that's probably where the
budget will live and but the way that
most of these products play out is
business buyers sometimes it will pool
pool together it's the CMO and every
once in a while it's HR sometimes it's
the sales organization that wants to
change the way that they are working
together and they will
cool and their their resources they will
go to IT they will say obviously you
guys were on our infrastructure and
maybe it comes out of your budget but
here's the problems we're actually
trying to solve and set from a budget
perspective probably it does altima tlie
come from at the CIA office but am more
successful if it's not actually being
driven from there at least for now
gotcha Greg um so but I think the issue
comes up that Oliver was talking about
earlier that it's not just that you know
HR or sales will will you know get
together one and do this what happens is
they all want to do their own solutions
they all have their own sets of problems
and they want to solve their own sets of
problems and the problem specifically
with social media software which is a
sort of all-encompassing word and I
don't know exactly what we're talking
about there but you know but the problem
with social media software is that like
I'm sorry social business social
business media software is that um no
but the problem is that if it starts to
break down if sales is using one set of
things and HR is using another set of
things but the problem is that's the way
enterprises work like there they are
their own little fiefdom um so what do
we do about it like how do you how do
you start to make it so you can have a
comprehensive set up within your
enterprise and people can actually get
the information they need even though
the HR group is not going to talk to the
sales group and wants to have a
different solution aren't you I'm a gym
do you want to talk sure um I love to
talk I was counting the number of
minutes seconds stay quiet it was a bit
with a friend so it's past my bedtime I
think two things I want to say one is
there is a way of you know addressing
that problem but you know how many
people here you know went to school
before there was Facebook right and what
happened was we all survived right we
built some friendships we made some
friends real life friends I was all good
in fact facebook if you remember if
evolved initially it wouldn't let you in
unless
you were at a particular college right
I'm not wrong about that and over period
of time people realize that you know
what I just don't want talk to my
students in my college I want to
actually talk to you know my friend who
graduated last year and slowly Facebook
opened up and it spread from there right
because this solved a particular problem
for a particular set of users did not
come to me and say hey you should have a
social network because you know how can
you be in school and not have a social
network or be in business so any of you
who's ever used CC bcc received an email
from an application that you didn't want
to receive or how to log into an
application in three different places to
find out whether your paycheck has
arrived or not arrived has a fundamental
problem which is it's inconvenient and
there are two parts that will help us
get over the hump if there is a hump one
is there are what one is yes it's fenced
I will tell you the hump joke later on
no I don't think we can let this go I
think we have to talk about it alright
that I'll Delhi get that to you so I was
going to say up so the way we've seen
people start beginning to use our
charter product for example is they
might start off in a sales and marketing
team or they may start out in an HR team
or one particular group and they may be
following an opportunity hey you know
this is a potential customer of yours I
am talking about this customer they are
not thinking I'm doing social software
just like kids at school were not
thinking they were doing social
networking because there was no such
thing they were doing homework and they
had friends they wanted to ask questions
on while filling up the assignments may
be called cheating his post but they
were collaborating right and
collaboration is good apparently so we
think that people will start using these
tools in the context of the application
so that's one part and as that circle of
people that you need to collaborate not
that you desire to collaborate
need to collaborate expands because once
the sales guide talks to the marketing
guy for the collateral then the contract
gag gets built in then they have to talk
some someone in legal the circle expands
in a natural secure share manner and
that's the responsibility of us vendors
to make sure that's both natural as well
as secure and shareable the second
aspect is once you have that in place
you need to make sure that it's not just
people talking to people because half my
emails are not coming from people
they're coming from systems that say you
know our bug system yesterday analyzed
73 thousand bucks and here is two bugs
that fail or I'm getting an email that
your expense report is three days late I
don't want that in an email because
that's not the right wait for the email
system these enterprise applications so
the problem the second problem we are
trying to solve in my opinion is systems
talking to us as human beings at not
interrupting me me going there and being
able to search on a sphere and say give
me all the things related to expense
reporting for example I think if you can
make these two problems solved which is
what charter is basically designed to
focus on then I think you have solving a
specific problem for a specific set of
users and there is a natural evolution
and I'm sure a lot of other tools are
trying to do the same thing and if I
don't see that they're not excessively
laaste is why I saying no I'm not saying
productivity I am saying the end user
has a specific problem and we need to
help them solve that and as a result of
that there will be you know you can call
it productivity agility there'll be
hundreds of things that happen today as
a result of email that will happen
faster and in a less inconvenient manner
for the end user so that's you know and
productivity is part of it so so on that
note email the dirty word in the
collaboration space I did have a
question for Greg dr. wave yes so it's
probably a lot of Google people in the
room outnumbered and outgunned but I'm
gonna ask it wave has been labeled as a
hosted conversation that provides
business context to communication and
collaboration I just I just did your
elevator pitch
alright so wave does not claim to
replace email but rather downsize your
inbox are you simplifying my workflow or
complicating it because there's
something else I have to check in with
well so i think the UM so the core
problem is that people think people use
email because they're trying to get
something done um and you know and and I
think um as we talked about earlier like
they there's massive amounts of email
coming to people that they don't care
about that's not useful and then when
people are actually trying to get
something done with it there and they
refer to it as collaboration through
email it's cumbersome it's it use the
word linear you know where you're just
sort of trying to go back and forth um
and it's not very efficient so what
we're trying to do with wave is take
another approach rather than thinking
about how can we make email better just
think about like what are people
actually trying to get done um and what
people are typically trying to get done
are sort of having conversations about
things and trying to come up with an end
product through over the course of that
conversation and so that's that's really
what wave is designed to be is to allow
people to do that smoothly what we have
been finding is that people will as
they're using email after they've used
wave they start to then I think the best
comment we had is is wave made me resent
email because once you start using it
then you realize yeah there are all
these waves that ways that email is
breaking down so I guess we're not
trying to say that we're replacing email
what we're trying to say is we're giving
people a way to collaborate that they
used to try to do an email if that makes
sense so Oliver give some comment yeah
just a bigger point I actually did a
white paper of a cisco which I think
they're finally gonna publish later this
month and on the future of work and one
of the points I make in that is that we
you know we basically a salon on a very
old fashioned postal and document
paradigm so while wave is a wonderful
tool you know that most people on the
planet who don't work for Google and who
aren't sort of spending you know 14
hours a day looking at their browser and
aware of all the latest web too
technologies coming out every day and so
on are still very much stuck in a
practically you know a hundred year old
way of thinking where you you you know
email is effectively like letters coming
through your letterbox accept that that
there is no there's no regulation of it
I mean it's just pouring in and you
write your like Pavlov's dog reacting to
it and constantly yeah yeah I mean
nothing you know fundamentally the way
people work nothing has changed there
you know so you substitute the big gray
filing cabinets for the you know for
SharePoint or whatever it is but you've
got this fundamental problem and you
know this is true for all of the vendors
on this panel you know and in the entire
industry that is the way people work
still and it's very very easy to say
they shot you off they don't like what
you're saying I I have a control button
to show you yeah I mean I've I made my
point sir just yell my to help put the
mic if you speaking goes to the mic test
me 12 don't know what happened my saves
the day Mike with a mic thank you my
yeah yeah so I mean that's the
fundamental problem that we ought to be
fair all these vendors are doing
wonderful things with their technologies
but that is the fundamental problem
we're grappling with so the sales guys
for all of these companies you know
basically going in to the room and
demonstrating all these fantastic new
ways of interacting but there is a huge
training and understanding exercise you
know the point and she was making in
closing and for this point is that you
know even though there's not a lot of
people on Facebook that is still
ultimately a minority for them for the
way particularly the way we work
internally so if female the legacy
application is not going anywhere soon
why don't we focus on fixing the legacy
application I'll take that um and stuff
that's an easy reinventing just like
email don't make telephones go away
right you still use phones I don't
answer my phone
I I know I tried calling you but you
know I blocked your calls i know you up
you also blocked my email and my
facebook i know tire off seriously
though i don't think the purpose for any
of our tools is actually to kill email
replace email or anything like that at
least it's not for me and I'm not even
here talking just about sales forces
approach I think none of us are you know
because this is alumni crowd for me this
is fellow alumni that I'm talking to the
i think the purpose of some of the tools
that we are building here is to make as
I said our lives easier in different
ways and if as a consequence of that you
get fewer emails and you like that good
right because nobody likes receiving 17
emails from their collaboration system
either you know I have a collaboration
system consumer world that sends me an
email every time and get a mess email
message I don't actually like that so I
don't think the focus on killing email
replacing email what we really want to
do is in an organic fashion do for the
enterprise's what Facebook did for
college students and consumers and if
you can do that will be helping people
collaborate with each other and getting
their work done I don't mind if you know
five hundred years from now there's
still an email system I actually like
email sending one to one email when I
really need to talk to just one person
think as you look at it there are there
are 11 what okay so there are personal
communication tools like you know email
where steer month where one email
communication is more intrusive than the
other likes a video conferencing is more
intrusive than audio which is more
intrusive than say chaim or which is
what into then they an email so each of
these each of these systems have their
own purpose so I would categorize all of
these as personal communication tools
then we have public group or
organization specific communication
tools these include say blogs discussion
forums and microblogging within the
organization and several of these
but the real value comes in when you use
these individual communication tools in
context with your business like when
integrated with your CRM system so when
your email system talks to your CRM
system which in turn talks to your
financial system your similarly other
systems your marketing your content
systems collaboration systems I think
when all of these are merged together I
think it can be made really powerful
because they are as unsure said they are
contextually integrated and there is
this greater value there and they each
of these tools they do have their own
place in the system so I do you think we
we need to talk about a wave and email
in particular person one more second and
so one one interesting thing i've
noticed and in my people telling me okay
i went tried wave and now I've come back
a few months later and maybe I haven't
visited for three months and it's kind
of a ghost town actually you're
consistent and and I think the reason
for that is there is an email
integration yet and I'm sure you guys
are working on it but how do we get
sucked back email integration that was
one of my questions that that would have
been a good question it came better Liam
unit but it is critical to build bridges
back to where people already are and how
do i often get sucked back into facebook
is because i get an email telling me
that there's a facebook update and then
i get sucked back in and that's how we
get work done that's how we do have
patterns we do have scripts that we
follow and an email is one of them and
that is why it is so critical to build
bridges between these systems you use
email as a tool to suck people back in
and yet ultimately we want to get rid of
some of the worst abuses of email
because it is abused all the time inside
of our companies and it is good for some
stuff and but we should also use it as a
bridge and there's other ones too so we
use Excel we use word and we need to use
those as bridges into social software as
well if we don't reach back into the
tools that we already use every day then
ultimately it just makes it much harder
to adopt something new
it's a good point hey I got a comment on
that it's not depending on which part of
the town you're in um the the biggest
issue and it's funny that I'm on a panel
about social media is that um we don't
actually think of wave as a social
product we think of a wave as a
Productivity tool it's a place for
getting things done and the the
comparison we often kind of use is if
someone gave you a car and you had no
idea what it did you'd be like this is a
big hunk of metal and it's kind of
strange but then when you had somewhere
to go you're like oh well this is
actually quite useful to get me
somewhere and wave is a similar sort of
thing where we need to if you don't have
something to do in it yeah it's not
terribly useful but then what people are
finding is when they do have something
to do in it it is very useful and that's
when they get into the point where they
they get used to doing things in in that
sort of way and then they try to go back
to email and they realize that there
were all these sort of ledges that they
bump their knees on um we are working on
email integration obviously um but
there's there's actually um long ago and
land far far away that land was called
Sydney Australia when we were building
wave one of the things we did build
initially was a way to to just dump all
your email and wave um but what we ended
up finding which we thought was kind of
fascinating is everyone started
interacting and I'm talking about google
wave as if you all know everything about
it so you know ask me questions if you
don't know but um but essentially the
problem that we we had is that everyone
then started treating their waves just
like emails people wouldn't edit each
other's waves people were not responding
you know in the places they needed to be
responding they just started using it
like an email client and then said like
wow wave is a pretty crappy email client
and it turns out wave is a pretty crappy
email client cuz it's not supposed to be
an email client supposed to be a wave
client so it's kind of interesting that
you you I totally agree with you that
you have to build those bridges back but
at the same time if you if you just give
everyone the easy way out so to speak um
you don't push yourself you don't you
don't try something new because it's
just too easy to fall back on what
you're used to doing all the time
so let me say again we're working on
emailing rich and someone commented from
the audience that you know wave is
really combating the the version issue
right you can constantly see new
versions without having to and actually
that brings me to my next point um so
Microsoft and IBM aren't here tonight at
least I don't think they are it is a
couple of people oh hey guys so if I'm a
large enterprise and i already use
microsoft office or lotus notes you know
no one ever got fired for buying
microsoft or IBM vendors have at it are
you sure you know i don't know like
who's gonna say i got fired for doing
this right but you know these are very
respectable companies they have done
amazing jobs people have built
multi-year couriers decades long as
someone that i may be working for these
days said Lotus Notes paradigm was
probably built before mark zuckerberg
was born right so conceived was the
words that mr. Benioff used and i think
there is something to it right these
email systems and loader systems are
amazingly powerful tools from 25 30
years ago and times have changed and we
want to bring v as in the collective v
and that includes possibly probably the
existing vendors that are eventually
going to see the light of chatter and
wave and all these things and come along
to the the brighter side but at the end
of the day that's history right these
are tools people have been using its if
they work in certain cases clearly
people are complaining about it certain
circles for us the focus is how do we
take the folk what facebook dead for
consumers bring it to the enterprise
everybody in this room understands how
to use facebook right there's no
confusion you don't go like oh
I saw this link thing what is that right
like do I have to click on it double
click is it right click and you know
we've been clean not just on social
software and Facebook we've actually
been trained to click things if you've
ever used a ERP application that didn't
have a web-based interface some of us
are old enough to have worded companies
or worked at old enough companies where
they have those kind of tools from big
database companies and such you will
realize that clicking is not supposed to
be what as deeply ingrained in our
lifestyle as it is today right you
didn't ever click through your expense
report 15 years ago because there was no
such thing as clicking through stuff so
all that training that's gone into how
we use the internet forget even social
software like Facebook Twitter etc is
training a generation of new college
graduates existing workers because now
they have to talk to their dads on
facebook to come into this new paradigm
and they're trained I don't need to
train you how to use charter because you
are already pre trained so I think a lot
of that stuff goes away if we think
through the paradigms that customers are
already used to end users are already
used to if you try to create new
paradigms completely if I told you now
have to you know in order to come to
Google's campus you must you know rent a
horse cart it be confusing or write a
bike I'll end up Google to go there
today page so the thing to build on that
that needs to be respected is the rate
of change is a lot faster than what it
was before right the vast majority of
Americans use social media on a daily
basis even with these really large
companies that you speak up not me it's
kind of interesting because they're
still built on very old models of
producing these kinds of tools right
when you end up having like we have a we
release a new version every two weeks
right sure point releases a new version
every three years which means that it
gets implemented every four or every
five years right facebook over night
early last year changed its entire user
interface from kind of an info boxes and
widgets model to a stream activity
streams and feeds and
status 8 update model overnight 300
million Americans expectations about
what this stuff was when they came to
work changed right and the point is that
so we have to be set up as vendors at
least to keep pace with the rate of
innovation that's going to be on the web
and it's always going to be faster
definitively than enterprise software
meantime you know I think we've spoken
enough about like email and classical
office tools and things like that but if
you think about traditional enterprise
apps you know they're all top-down
highly structured rigid business rules
the whole goal is automate business
process to drive down costs right the
point is regular employees don't spend
all day executing regular uniform
business process they're handling
exceptions to business process they're
handling when the design of those tools
don't actually fit the reality of the
environment that they're working in
right and the opportunity in effect
whether it's some of the interesting
blends of how you you know we can make
other enterprise apps more social right
or you can socialize around a business
you know record for example you know
what you're really solving for is kind
of the other half of enterprise software
that hasn't existed yet right because
the best thing we've got is this really
wonderful tool with email that actually
is so flexible and so social that we've
been able to bend it around and attach
things to it and use it for pretty much
everything so we have to celebrate like
the creation of new modalities or at
least the testing of the creation of
those modalities but also recognize like
as you said it's really damn early in
this stuff and while a lot of the
vendors in the space have been around
for you know seven years or you know
more or less and stuff like that there's
still a vast larger opportunity and
we're not talking about the market size
number you know that's a natural tough
nut to crack so that's it all right guys
yeah just one one is the one quick point
is us a roster the American market but
in fact the world is increasingly global
as I'm sure everybody in this room's is
acutely aware so it's a couple of years
ago I was in a very slow G meeting in
London where somebody a whole bunch of
customers CIO type customers one of them
said that if if you told him a year
previously that he'd be dealing with
partners in Costa Rica you think you
know we were absolutely nuts but that's
increasingly what's going on and you
can't argue that email is actually quite
effective on that level it just has to
be used you know responsibly and you
know the one other component is if you
do actually get a access to a new
collaboration system you're going to get
your initial user name and password by
email so in some ways it's very
foundational now I'm somebody that
spends a lot of time in companies
actually talking about why they should
adopt collaborative technologies so I'm
not being negative about this I'm just
being realistic so we we do believe that
there is a failed strategy and two
products which is let's take an existing
product and add some social features
maybe it's a content management system I
won't name specific products here maybe
it's a CRM product and you add a few
really simple social features and you
say this is a social business strategy
it's just not true and it's not going
far enough and what this market is
becoming it's big enough it's
interesting enough there are new
paradigms of interacting and all the
traditional vendors desperately want in
on the hotness they realize that it is
interesting that what we have done in
our consumer lives it has changed it has
changed our lives it's changed the way
that we interact and it is fundamentally
changing the way that we work together
and but just adding a few social
features to an existing product it
doesn't ultimately work and what this
market will become is a new set of
products a new a new paradigm and it's
very hard to take a CRM product or a
content management system add a few
social features and truly get all the
way to where you need to go so you're
saying they shouldn't buy you and then
combine the two things just well I so I
know this this isn't an Asian market
because I know you know a lot of the
smaller vendors will will be looking for
exits this year and you know and maybe
that's the only option available to them
and I think that's a little blow that's
not on gtalk I think you make a very
good point that you can't just take a
siebel crm system slap some social
features
on and magically have it become social
because there is a fundamental problem
your system has to be web-based and if
you are a web based company such as the
one that's hosting this show you have
certain advantages which is you have the
capability to reach customers end users
within an organization across
organizational boundaries and customers
across even customer boundaries based on
rules security sharing models and such
having a set of users that passionately
loves your technology be it customer
relationship management be it the
platform for building new applications
you know we have hundreds of
applications such as risk management
others and financial applications by our
partners having customer service and
support applications these applications
need to be brought in to the Facebook
era and while I like the you know the
way you portrayed that I think oh if you
can transition the users if we can yeah
I know it's in jest I am taking it as a
joke and you know so I think for a for a
company that's you know the bean IPO for
a while just like my other friend on the
other side that's a you know I should
always joke with VCS you know search is
a feature it's not a company right so
maybe CRM is just a feature but maybe
not I think you know the key point here
is it's not you know we can all take
potshots our database companies and CRM
companies and search companies and all
that I think that's kind of silly the
key point is are we delivering a
solution that people will find useful in
day-to-day business and are there enough
business applications that will come
alive if you provide these social
capabilities and help these people move
into the Facebook era and I think that's
what we are looking to do and I think we
we have a shot at it and also I think to
run a business we need some basic set of
tools like say CRM financial system erp
system these are all the basic systems
that are needed to
on a business is the social media tools
at that level I don't think so but when
you slap these social media and
integrate them on top of the existing
tools you can be really productive and
that is what we think the social media
tools add to the existing systems and we
think it is absolutely necessary that we
marry these two these systems the thing
we can all agree with all of our stupid
jokes is there's a chance to rethink
some really good core assumptions that
we've had yeah definitely all right so
Matt Tucker hi you're finally asking me
a question yeah so it should be known
that I work for a company called tech
web and we're a drive customer i'm also
a salesforce customer i use IE i use
though um anyway so Matt Tucker um
people can be resistant to change a what
are some general guidelines for a
successful implementation introduction
because clearly corporate mandates
aren't going to work if you just slam
social business software on people and
say put it put it in there you know use
this now how do you get to that organic
critical mass point where people start
to see the tools as a help as opposed to
a hindrance and how do you as someone
who's selling them this product how do
you help cultivate that a very good
question i think we'll probably all have
that some tips and tricks to contribute
to this and there is a failed assumption
that if you turn on social software it
will just automatically take off like
wildfire and there are a few
organizations that have a culture and
that are open enough to the way of this
new way of working where that does kind
of happen and you put in you put in jive
or you put in social text
or something else and it will just kind
of take off and but more often than not
that doesn't always happen and one of
the and there's a lot of strategies that
you can employ and you do actually need
to to think about it and you need to
have a strategy for rolling it out very
often we'll see and people have even
dedicated staff that are responsible for
let's add let's go and reach out to a
new part of the organization and you
know teach them this is a new way of
working it's like wave and they have to
get it a little bit before they start
using it and and just spread it one
pocket at a time and then there will be
eventually critical mass and will take
over and it will spread and there
there's a new paradigm but it's not
always automatic and one of the sort of
very specific tactics that we always
suggest is pick something that they get
done just using social software and so
maybe it's a if it's a sales person
they're going to every time they go out
and do a customer call they'll blog
about what you know what happened there
and then people will comment on it there
will be some interactions and they'll
discover all right there there is some
value to this if i put my my trip report
up in social and you know there there's
a new set of interactions that will
happen and so just get very specific
about there is something that i get done
every day at using this tool and that
starts to shift the mindset and that can
be a pretty key way to get adoption
going funny then I just always automatic
funny that you used a salesperson
example and CRM kind of example just let
me point out that guys do you have any
more tips and tricks you'd like to share
and in this this issue of cultural
adoption we talk a lot about you know
the new workforce coming into play and
and obviously they have consumer
experience with the tools and then they
come in and sorry IBM but there's lotus
notes as their email client and they're
like you know what's going on um so one
of the things that um I've actually
found from talking to a lot of people is
that you you asked question earlier of
like why would you buy something other
than Microsoft Office or other or Cisco
now
science is it the reason people are even
thinking about doing these things is
they think they can operate better and
so the issue is you need to understand
you know where are you currently broken
what are these biggest pain points
because typically what you can do is you
can find something that is just horrific
currently in the company and I tell you
every company out there has something
that is horrific and usually one of
those horrific pain points can be helped
by social software of some sort and so
what you really need to do is find where
that biggest pain point is and then just
try to try to address it um and usually
doesn't take long when you try to do
that for people to start to understand
the value of it and then and then I
think Matt was absolutely right is that
you know you need to you need to start
it spreading like it's not the kind of
thing where you can just mandate that
everyone has to start doing this and
it'll happen it won't ever just crazy
I'll go back to my earlier point x which
is that you know the sales and marketing
people make take off like wildfire but
because sales are marketing own this
wonderful new collaboration environment
some other path the organization would
dig a trench and start the third world
war because they don't want to use that
collaboration system that's the first
thing the second thing is that all the
vendors are selling something new and
it's bit like that TV show America's
Next Top Model everybody conveniently
forgets about in America's last top
model which is like the previous
generation of software they bought which
is still sitting around possibly being
used so there's a number of issues there
and I think that was that there was a
perfect point that it's not hard in
large companies to find problems that
need fixing really urgently and I'm
often the pinata in meetings between
different factions in the company they
all agree there's a big there's a big
problem but how they're actually going
to fix it is is kind of the really tough
nut to crack so I think there's two
things from my perspective one is end
user training right coming back to my
same expense report example if you
joined a company that used a
three-letter acronym company's software
about even now actually if you're
running for dot 7 version you will find
out that it's not intuitive to you how
do you get in from your you know how do
you login
then you know you have a client how do I
basically find my expense report none of
that is intuitive you don't always have
a link paste web-based metaphor unless
you're running something which is very
latest version what the Internet has
done you know New York Times essentially
trains and Amazon trains users to use
Salesforce com because when you know
clicking on a link does something and
you are in a CRM system clicking an
opportunity you intuitively know it's
going to do something so I think the
beauty of the web metaphor which is what
Google has been actually leveraging
lately is unlike you know your
spreadsheet system of earlier era
intuitively you know how to use a web
browser and so that's one part same
thing is now happening so that happened
about 10 years ago the same thing
happened in the last few years with
facebook to be honest right they trained
millions and millions of people how to
use this new social collaboration
software and we don't need to go teach
people that they intuitively understand
why it's useful in the person life what
are the kind of things they do hey if I
want to share a piece of content I am
doing a performance review in my HR
department and we have guidelines for
our managers that they need to read and
it's publicly or selectively shareable
as long as I have security and sharing
systems in place which is where
enterprise class systems come into play
it's intuitive to you you take your
document whether it's created in Google
Docs or whether it's created in an
office based system of your and you
upload it and you don't have to send an
email saying in order to understand the
following systems you must go to the
system the login process is as follows
it's a seventh page template people
understand click it will be readable
whether it's a PDF file or whether it's
a web page so that whole training cycle
that used to take months and months for
people that I've ever implemented in erp
system 10 to 15 years ago or even a
modern ERP system from certain companies
this is a huge paradigm shift so I don't
think we need to do a lot of work there
people understand how to use those
systems just you know within this market
Shin has been kind of a classical
problem one way and I think we've
already spoken to part of it but the you
know there's two ways or places that you
can adopt social software in the
enterprise it's either in the flow of
your daily work or kind of above the
flow of your daily work there's a period
of time in our history where we were
doing a lot of kind of above the flow of
daily work let's build a Wikipedian side
of the inside of the company and
then we really discovered that when we
embed it in existing processes in
existing workflows which does require a
little bit of training and developing
new information architecture you're
changing habits but it's easy because
you have a real problem that you're
solving a real business goal people
understand that's why I'm changing my
behavior right but still the problem is
that ends up siloing itself to a degree
so what Michael I DiNapoli's who used to
run Mackenzie's knowledge management
practice and runs our professional
service practice does now is what we
call a t-shaped adoption we roll out a
shallow set of functionality to a very
broad base of users ideally it's already
enterprise-wide you know within the
first couple days and literally what
that is is we give them profiles that
are about themselves which we can
populate from their directory system we
host a webinar invite everybody in that
webinar talks about what they're doing
and in the middle of it they use micro
blogging is kind of a live chat channel
so they walk away with this kind of
shared experience and they're using just
a little simple thing right it's just
what are you work answering what are you
working on in 140 characters or slightly
more and the net result of that is what
do you get the basics of sharing
dynamics across organizational silos the
ability for people to update status or
context in a way that's richer then your
IM system which is really just kind of
the state of a communication channel am
i busy am i available and more
importantly get the ability to have a
place to go when search fails right
which is i can if i have a question and
i don't know who to ask i can go and ask
it openly and i get answers try this on
twitter and the important thing is i
have enforced at a interruption on
anybody right and that's a ver and so
you do that broadly and then you follow
with the base of the T very deeply in
these in the flow implement
asians working your way kind of
department by Department and partially
because the people are broadly using it
or like I kind of get from seeing the
way this one departments using it deeply
and the way we're using it broadly how
this could maybe be applicable to my
business problem because as a vendor
we're not really going to know the
business problem it they're going to be
the ones will know it and then we'll
work with them to understand how to
adapt the tool to make it fit so that
example of what are you working on by
Ozzy is like save your scene with
Twitter as is it could be useful but
when we integrate that with say a
project management system that question
becomes more valuable so what are you
working on so your project members
really know what exactly you're working
on and you can start a conversation
right there you're not going to poke him
and ask additional details unless you're
interested in that but that's a good way
to start interaction so that's what the
contextual integration of these social
tools into other business tools can be
really useful yeah so so yep no good oh
go ahead um so I think we've had a nice
little lovin about social software here
but I think there's there's really this
this question that a lot of people don't
find social software in outside of the
business place useful and interesting a
lot of people find for instance you know
people on Twitter talking about you know
what they're eating for dinner
overwhelming right and so they don't
necessarily feel like they want to bring
that into the workplace because their
impression of social software is it's
wasting time not that it's giving you
useful information and potentially
saving time in other places of your life
so the question then becomes how do you
sort of you know go into these places
where they're like yeah trying to bring
social into my business is kind of like
saying you're gonna waste all my
employees time what do you do about that
man well you actually do a very simple
thing you ask you know has to do this
many many years ago when you're just
starting to talk about cloud computing
and I had a very simple question I would
ask an audience like this how many
people here use ATMs to withdraw money
and beat everybody how many people here
have ever like deposited a check it be
about you know one third to to third and
how many people here
deposited cash more than hundred dollars
should be about like 20 people and I
would say you're my core audience in
this is the air 2003-2004 for being able
to run your core applications in the
cloud you are the next circle and you my
friend will come to me in five years
right I think there is a similar pattern
there which is some people are just not
ready today so if you've been following
I don't know Britney Spears all your
life on Twitter you can have an
impression that you know all social
computing is about using Twitter I'm
sure when telephone systems were
introduced when email was introduced
people had the same questions why would
I want and you know AOL kind of a system
at work that's going to be complete
waste of time and I think between wave
chatter social text jive Soho all of us
we're trying to change that mindset so
so besides the vendors Oliver what do
you think okay yeah i mean just one
quick point facebook is ubiquitous but i
mean i would question how deeply people
actually use it a lot of people use
facebook to play farmville or whatever
it's called and but very few people have
much understanding of groups as we were
discussing before before this sessions
though people are unwittingly leaving
their lives open to anybody that wants
to sort of wander by their page and has
access to it same thing with twitter
twitter is supposedly growing
exponentially but you look at the number
of accounts out there they're actually
being used and it's a relatively small
number so i mean it is my sort of bread
and butter that i preach every day but
you've got to be very clear the word
context you used earlier is perfect i
mean anytime you're deploying any of
these technologies just like any other
tool or technology you have to be very
clear what your intent is and where
you're actually going with it rather
than just assuming as Matt was saying
that you're going to install this thing
and there's this of a magic unicorn
button that you press and all these
wonderful things will happen and
people's minds will change I mean it's
just you know well I respect that kind
of perspective I would like to challenge
it because it's a panel discussion after
all right uh the reason I'm challenging
education apparently yes the reason I'm
challenging it is because I don't find
anyone here in the audience saying you
know this CC thing in email is
just terrible and you know it's a
terrible waste of if if actually you
were a CIO and I came to you and said
all email had only one recipient field
right called to write and you could only
send email one person at a time and you
were using it you were happy because one
person could only send one email at a
time so there was only so so much email
going around and I came in and said you
know what I'm going to change this thing
now you can see see people and you like
oh my god what does this mean i could be
seeing 15 people at a time they would be
explosion this thing is never going to
work our company is going to shut down
and this fear of new features is
partially actually true and partially
actually false but irrespective of the
key is we have to train and teeth with
respect our employees that they know how
to use features like following people by
updating status in the context of the
work environment just as we trust them
to use CC bcc i can send an email to all
of my company and many of you can too
there are you know mailing lists which
say all at you know whatever company
calm and we don't do that there is a
reason for that we know that's a bad
idea you could get fired right so I
think we learn to use these modern tools
and will be responsible otherwise we'll
be out of jobs I hate to be rude why I'm
gonna cut you off because I have one
last question and then to be respectful
of time I want to open it up to the
audience because I'm sure they've been
intrigued by what you have to say my
final question is about the future of
software or the future of applications
delivered over the Internet now if you
attach the word future to anything
everyone cringes but bear with me and
this is kind of a scary one and and
we're along for the ride to a certain
extent in the collaboration market in
the enterprise to point o market we're
hoping that it's going to implode that
it will be earmarked on the cios budget
list but quite frankly we don't know so
my question is future-looking will
social just become a feature and what
will happen then well in the bigger
picture yes social becomes one of the
important features within your business
systems but again we think it's going to
be future is going to be about internet
system so that it's easy to connect all
these individual systems and then social
is another system another layer on top
of your business systems we think that's
going to be a feature as you look at it
now social is not a feature because it's
also the first word in your product
social business software so it's very
easy to believe that we we don't think
it's just a future Wow um no the this is
a new way of getting work done and so
yes and maybe maybe we're in a hype
cycle absolutely and but the fact is at
my personal life is different it's
changed by Facebook and Twitter I think
most of the people in the room would
would say that as well and there was a
lot of hype two years two years ago
about Generation Y entering the
workforce and it frankly all sounded a
bit like BS two years ago and is this
really true do they really have
different expectations but I fast
forward two years and they're getting a
little more mature in their careers it
is different they do have different
expectations about how they work
together they have been influenced by
these tools and the momentum is building
and and it's not a fad and we're not
going back to our old paradigms and our
consumer lives it's not going to happen
that in our work lives either and it
doesn't it's not going to be effective
to take at the CRM system and add social
features or take a take a content
management system and add social
features it will be a new market an
important market and that's why you have
giant vendors like IBM and Salesforce
and oracle and microsoft doing such big
investments in this space is it really
is a big deal that's why we have this
panel today and so it's not just a
feature and how it all plays out of
course at hard to say and but it it's
not just we we took some existing piece
of software put a little lipstick on on
that pig and
I called it a day Elroy yeah yes I mean
the one thing we haven't mentioned all
night is mobile which is the fastest
growing thing you know it's great much
more quickly than the way it did that's
going to be hugely that's going to be
you know another wave of enormous change
I mean I think it's all and you know
this is a very difficult topic to talk
about because for some people it is a
feature and it's a it's a adjunct to
their CRM system or whatever it is for
other people depending on what it is
they're doing it is absolutely the heart
and soul and center of the business
strategy of what that company is trying
to do going forward so very very
variable depending on industry one other
thing we haven't touched on very quickly
is the space is polarized between legal
on one side which tends to really
protect IP and protect intellectual
information very tends to be very
secretive and then that the other
polarity you have manufacturing
companies that like to encourage the
world to think that you can actually see
deep inside their companies and
communicate with product managers and
practically know people on a first-name
basis you know making a product inside a
company because the company is so
transparent and so on and so forth so
this is a vast vast topic so I'm haven't
really answered the question no I think
that that's pretty right on given no
aren't you that's a doctor waving you
want dr. Webb to answer the future
question well I just think that you know
being the only non vendor and impartial
impartial when it comes to platform I
think that's the most accurate answer
we're gonna get tonight so I think we
might conclude with that answer if it's
okay with you so so with that I think
we'll invite folks to come up to the mic
I have one question here on a few
questions here on Twitter that I'll be
also be asking but please feel free to
step up state your name where you're
from and what your question is oh hi I'm
rom I'm I live in the valley I wanted to
get which we talked a lot about Twitter
we talked a lot about Facebook so well
and good I think the conversation was
about the enterprise today
it is real that everybody is trying to
figure out where the opportunities
that's fair I was wondering from your
examples the vendors as well as Mark
from a holistic perspective other
examples that you know of specific
examples where people have adopted a new
paradigm and what the use cases if you
are willing to share that it would be
wonderful so something somebody was
using email and then something else came
along but then the integration was great
or they were using something else they
had to integrate with email a use case
one use case was suggested which is a
salesperson does a report when they
finish and that's a good example so I
was looking for examples like that and
second question is what is the CEO or a
CEOs nightmare that they're having that
they don't know where the next wave is
coming and the company is not adopting
it in a culture so an example would be
helpful rather than a broad generic
thing which we read in gardner and
whatnot thanks so i'll give a use case
and again I said this before um I i have
trouble defining google wave as social
um because i think it really is just
about trying to allow people to get
things done more quickly together i
think the best example we have is
there's a small consulting company that
we work with and they say every month
have to do a report for all of the all
of their clients so um and they'd are
always done it in email they'd always
written documents in Microsoft Word and
each person sort of summarize what was
going on and then they all emailed them
to an intern and that in turn had to
collate all this information together
and then once they pulled all that
information together they had to resend
it out to everyone for approval and it
took ages and so they tried doing that
in wave where people could actually do
all of these things together rather than
sort of this again linear process and
they said that the most surprising thing
was that they actually got it done on
time which was the first month they were
ever gotten downtime and secondly um
they they saved about eight hours and I
think in the end when you're a 10-person
company that does billable hours
saving eight hours is money that you're
making and so I think the core thing
about using a lot of these types of
applications is it how are you going to
get things done faster get get them done
better and get them done more
efficiently to essentially save your
company money and I think that's what
people are really driving at and so it's
not about making people feel better
about their company it's about actually
being able to connect people and allow
them to do things more efficiently
thanks but I'll just add very quickly
that you you said what's keeping CIOs up
at night and ironically it's you know
babe CIOs and security personnel within
IT departments have traditionally
protected the security of the company
very tightly and are running a very
tight firewall and what's keeping them
up at night is the fact that you know
particular Google Apps you know we're in
the Google building assesses fair play
is basically being very widely used so
the Facebook generation we've been
talking about a lot think nothing even
on a Department departmental level are
whipping out their corporate credit card
and you know in 30 seconds practically
they're up and running in a
software-as-a-service environment which
is completely outside the guidance and
governance of the company but they are
getting their job done very efficiently
so people to intend to turn a blind eye
and I know dozens of situations where
employees are damned if they do and
damned if they don't if they get found
caught using software as a service
illegally they get fired if they use the
technology they have currently inside
the company they'll get fired because
they didn't get the job done in time
because actually my question was the
other word arm what's keeping CEOs awake
at night that day our company is not
adopting the next paradigm it's the
other word on okay I think people are
there are companies like Kraft and
others and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble who are
trying to it up these things and just
wanted to get a prospect well that's the
marketing side of the house which is a
very different you know sort of echo
sphere if you like the one we're talking
about an hour which is about more about
internal collaboration um CEOs I think
despite you know all the hoopla are
being quite conservative about their
center your pointer looking for case
histories and evidence of this being a
you know substantial advantage to their
company before they actually put money
against her okay thank you I'll give a
really quick example
I think there's maybe two categories of
examples 1 is let's pick something we
were doing before and just use a new
paradigm to do it way better super
valuable the other one is let's do
things that we never could before and
John Deere is one of our customers and
they're actually relatively innovative
for being a tractor company and
something that they they use our
software to do that they had never done
before is connect engineering teams and
in different parts of the world and it
was never possible for them to have
really productive email conversations
because they didn't know each other and
you couldn't just email all of them and
one of the things that they did was
shared some information about and I
think it was the height of a fender on a
tractor and I don't remember all the
details but they figured out that it
actually saved them two million dollars
to be able to share that information and
in this specific way that never would
have been possible before you couldn't
do with email and so because of the new
tool they were able to do something
brand-new and that ended up having a lot
of value so you're saying Toyota is a
candidate customer for a lot of people
probably and you had another one I think
maybe next question yeah actually I'm
gonna ask a question from the Twitter
stream this was asked can social
networking replace business networking
in the workplace will it ever be as
effective as face-to-face relationship
building no we can all say no I'd say no
aren't you you want to say yes my eye my
under-eye shy is this saying the time
spent face-to-face is to about valuable
for work right and especially when you
have distributed teams is actually true
half of our company is distributed so we
fly people in on a reasonably regular
basis get everybody together and yes we
get through some work work but a lot of
it is just forming the right social
relationships so they can be more
productive when they have to work more
remotely you know I work in the
conference business I didn't do a proper
job of explaining myself but I help run
the enterprise two point O conference
which deals with collaborative
technologies and I know these gentlemen
from the event that i have managed and
you know getting together face-to-face
will never replace I mean that's I've
heard it's a it's a little cheesy but
it's the original sort of social
networking
we're mapping the social graph to the
web in order to break down barriers of
geography and time zones although Cisco
would say IRA telepresence technology
which is coming on in leaps and bounds
that you can actually get a few more
percentage of that sort of reading body
language and facial sure nonverbal cues
etc but there's something about engaging
with someone and looking at their face
directly I don't think we'll ever be
replaced we're human we're social
objects so the for me it's very simple
name one social networking technology
going by trains to meet neighbors are
going by planes to meet people you know
cars telephones email internet none of
this ever goes away right the key
question we're trying to answer is in
this new Facebook generation are there
more productive ways of getting more
done and maybe meet more people less
people and how do we get more done so i
don't think anything of the past is just
simply going to disappear and it's very
expensive to replace some of these three
linear systems by the way even if you
wanted to so there is one example and um
I I totally agree that it's um the that
face-to-face is never going to be
replaced um but there was one example
that we found that was actually kind of
interesting amusing wave where um if you
have a group of 12 people who are all
trying to talk about a topic all at the
same time um and they're in a room
together you can't do it very
effectively you need to sort of keep it
sequential whereas there are tools that
you can use now where you can have you
know a dozen people all carrying on a
conversation and have it and then have
it be effective and have it carried on
um which I thought was really
interesting yeah like I never imagined
that we would get to sort of that point
where there are tools that are really
are better than face-to-face and I think
there's a couple examples where it does
work but and I would concur in terms of
like you know Taipei extrovert
personalities and versus a not so
extroverted introverted person needing
to yell to be heard I can see value and
in that answer Greg that's true why
don't we have the next question my name
is stiletto Hernandez and I actually
have a question for my
m14 Greg so format you mentioned social
network social software helps to solve
the company's problems but I didn't hear
like a concrete example other than
blogging about a cell or example related
to CRM ourselves over what about the
supply chains what about the HCM what
about the issues of deploying the social
networks to other countries when even
posting a picture posting a name you
incur in discriminations you have a lot
of sensitive data and could you comment
with an example on how this solution
solve the problems in a line to actually
the corporate goals okay I think I
understand the question except for the
part about and posting names in
different countries and a pin in issue
well as part of the strategy of
deployment internationally if you sell
your yourself to John Deere you sell to
all those are multinationals so what are
the rules that are playing the United
States we're okay but we're going to
France Germany yeah been posting a name
that's actually interesting question and
I so maybe we can dive down on that one
and there are a million interesting
examples just answering the other part
of your question of different places
that social software is getting used in
product management and engineering in
sales and often as a way to have the
larger conversation inside of an
organization that's never been possible
before so how do you actually connect
larger groups of people you can't really
do it over email and you can pick an
just business problem after business
problem that you can apply social
software to and but drilling down on
that question and there is there are
interesting issues around international
deployment so there are different
privacy laws in each country around how
do you share profile data and in Germany
there is an issue of workers councils
and and they have to go through a very
rigorous process in order to decide to
adopt a new tool and like social and
it's hard to get through that and and
there are different cultural norms about
how people actually want to adopt this
and
we've definitely found that people are a
little bit more ready for social
software in the US and then they are in
most parts of Europe and and so as you
are rolling out and social and we in
particular target large companies and
say we deal with this all the time and
maybe it's that the u.s. division that
is driving the adoption but what they're
really trying to do at yum brands for
example they want to connect and you
know their folks in China with the
people in the US and yeah it's hard and
and there are different things you need
to do in each each country much more
than just make sure it's in the right
language I'll just very quickly
interject I think there's some
legislation coming from the European
Union pretty soon about Facebook you
know about your personal rights online
and that's going to you know this is
young industry as we've all been saying
I think that will have a significant
impact impact on all of this and a real
quick thing is when you roll out to a
multinational one of the most
interesting values that you have is the
ability to start creating much more of a
global glossary right to help harmonize
a lot of language of the language that
people are using a weird example also is
about how vastly different people use
social software because of their
cultures because of their languages if
you look on wikipedia you know we all
know the way that the english wikipedia
works but let's say with the japanese
wikipedia what they'll do is everyone
will start writing first on the
discussion page and they won't touch the
article page and then eventually and
they'll be collaboratively drafting and
collaboratively drafting and get to a
point where they'll reach consensus and
then post the very first version on to
the article page right very different
from the way that an American would just
slap an assertion onto the article right
so thank you very much the other
question is what happened to google wave
I attended some of the first meetings
around the head course and it was really
hard to understand what is the concept
of google wave and from a marketing he
said what is the business that you're
trying to solve and even I'm checking on
Twitter there's a lot of questions is
what is who
wave and what is how come google buzz
from day one you get that integration
with the email you can tons of the
discussions and I don't know I mean even
Kevin Rose indignation last month he
still had a question he didn't even know
what who the way it was um thank you for
asking that so I think um one of the
things to keep in mind is what we're
trying to do with google wave is not
something that's going to happen
overnight this is not um in trying to
build a new way to communicate this
isn't something that it ends up you know
you put it out there in a month and
suddenly everybody understands a
different way to communicate it takes a
long time we knew it would take a long
time unfortunately there was there was
kind of a use the term buzz that of
around Google Wave that we didn't
necessarily try to contribute to but um
we didn't stop and so what ended up
happening is I think a lot of people
felt like wow google wave is a done
which it's not um and be it's this it's
this new social product you have to get
on immediately and so what happened
where was a lot of people had sort of
miss set expectations and so what's
what's happened is initially there were
a lot of people who who started using it
and then didn't know what to do with it
and so it's settled into um people using
it who who who have found things to do
with it who enjoy using it and then that
base of users is steadily growing and so
it's kind of I have to be honest as a
product manager on wave I'm kind of
excited that the hype is over that you
know that there was that sort of a lot
of hype going on because a lot of it
just wasn't accurate so so in terms of
why is Google Wave not in gmail um
whereas google buzz was initially um i
know i said the term google like nine
times in the last sentence but whatever
um it's really good kool-aid here yeah
well as about the book so part of that
was was we are sort of experimenting
with different models of how to launch
products you know I think there's
there's a lot to be learned from trying
things in different ways in the
the way buzz tried it was go out to
everyone immediately who has a gmail
account and let them have access to it
and let them use it and that had some
excellent things that happened out of it
and there are also some some questions
that came out of it um you know and its
really it's been fascinating reading a
lot of the news articles that there's
kind of equal parts some people are like
I hate new things being thrown in your
face I like to try it when I want to try
it versus people who are like you know
show me the new stuff because i'm not
going to go look for it so i don't know
if that's a great answer but the answer
is where we're trying different ways of
doing some of these things to see won't
work all your answers are great answer
dr. Waite and quickly I see a few of you
leaving I just want to let you know that
there's dessert and coffee on the other
room we're gonna break in about ten
minutes but if you need to stretch your
legs the white room the what oh there's
wine to mouth whining oh I misspoke in
the wine room or there's wine in the
other room as well as coffee and dessert
so if your need to stretch your legs go
for it I also wanted to mention that as
I already did I work on the enterprise
two point O conference if you'd like to
attend the event I had our marketing
team set up a code it's my name page Pai
GE and if you go to the enterprise two
point O Boston website you can register
for a free Expo pass or fifteen percent
off a conference pass because clearly
you're interested in collaborative
technologies and that's what we do it at
enterprise two point oh it's jun 14
through the 17th in boston so just FYI i
tweeted it out so FYI yes sir go ahead
hi I'm Manav from manymoon were a
leading social productivity application
and this question is for dr. wave again
so there's sites there's thought page
there's buzz and then this wave what is
Google's enterprise strategy with social
media that's a great question never
heard that there's a lot better
unsure do you want to answer that one
yeah what do you don't work in search or
Gordon said last time uh so so I think
um one of the things that is a it's a
bit challenging is um each of these
products and this is this is something
that I think needs to be improved um is
that we are building um individual
products that are sort of solving
individual product problems um in a sort
of one might argue to highly targeted
way so um to give an example um there is
email as part of Google Apps and email I
while a lot of people think wave is
supposed to replace email it's not there
are times when email is very useful and
in fact partly because everybody well
just about everybody in the world you'd
want to talk to has email that being
said if you're trying to do something
and I think the example I gave earlier
of that of that consultative firm that
that was trying to pull together there
they're sort of monthly report that's
hard to do an email it's hard to do
insights frankly it's hard to do in
Doc's um there are a lot of these kind
of process oriented operations that you
do with small groups of people that you
work with all the time that you really
just need to be able to get things done
quickly iterate with quickly and wave
does that well now the one of the things
that happens though is that so so we
built wave as kind of this experiment to
see how well that works it turns out it
works well in that situation then the
next stage is pulling pulling that in
integrated with a lot of the other
products that Google has to actually
make it work in a cohesive way because
one of the things that I think so many
companies fall down on is that they
expect users to understand all of these
products and all these distinctions and
and the sort of the difference between
you know well and um I won't use any
examples on the panel but but the
difference between what a blog is versus
um what a week he is and while a lot of
people understand that there are many
many many times more people in the world
who have no idea what these things mean
and so you
have a friend who says hey I just had a
baby and I want to tell all my friends
about this baby they don't necessarily
think oh I should create a blog because
what the hell does that mean right like
what they think is I want to share this
information and so then they go and they
search for it and they find you know
hundreds of different words wikis blogs
etc etc any of which could be used in
these situations the reason I went on
that tangent was because I think one of
the things we need to do is do a much
better job of not having to have people
understand what these tools are and the
distinction between the tools but rather
allow people to get the things done they
need to get done and that's one of the
things we are trying to accomplish with
wave is rather than you know i'm going
to i need to you know I need to talk to
my sales team so I'm going to go to this
one application you start a wave with it
and that wave can then morph and become
what you needed to become and the more
its integrated with the other
applications both at Google and outside
Google I mean we are open sourcing wave
and we're doing that for a reason we
think it's a good technology and it's a
good platform that people can build on
top of to be able to to have these
things integrate so you're able to just
get started and trying to do something
rather than have to think through like
what's the product i need you know how
where am I going with this etc etc so if
I hear you're right you're saying that
wave is a destination that you want to
go to and then everything else falls
into that when I wake up in the morning
and I get my cup of coffee and I'm you
know looking at email instead of looking
at email you want us to look at wave oh
man is that is out what want you coming
from social text did we accomplish what
did you look at first thing in the
morning no but um in some ways yes um is
it going to be wave and is it gonna be
the interface that wave currently has we
have no idea but I think in the end
forcing people to go into their browser
and then choose the one of 35 sites they
want to go to is not success I think in
the web and so as all of us need to get
better at that cool thanks so I think we
can all beat up Greg after the panel
good try them tough but so one more
question to close it out um well
actually
I wanted to sort of challenge the panel
because I'm not buying it and I'm not
drinking the kool-aid so much I'd like
to play devil's advocate and I do
understand that collaborative software
is extremely important and I do
understand that there are certain
applications I'll give an example Google
Calendar you know where I want to work
with people all over the world and we're
trying to plan let's say a trade show
and meet ups and we can use this but
we're going there for a purpose not
because it's like you're saying about
wave not because we love social media we
love chatting and all this kind of stuff
and so I would say that these examples
of Twitter Facebook Linkedin are all
very specific examples that have had
very specific uses for instance i think
that Twitter's replaced has done a
wonderful job of creating two-way
communication between news organizations
rather than just having AP news or
something go out and running headlines
and then journalists picking up on this
and finding sources now it's become very
popular to be a two-way communication
between live TV it's very immediate and
also politically reporting on Mumbai or
reporting on what's happening in Iraq
and being a force for social change
those have been very successful people
who want to collaborate on stock market
very immediate thing so there's
particular tasks that Twitter is good
for not necessarily a whole business and
facebook i think is really a community
where in a in a diverse world where kids
are now in many places around the world
and have been to high school together
and gone away and for many of us it's
more of a community a way to sort of
keep but we don't but is that your
experience or is that everybody's
experience in the room because i would
challenge that question completely and
say i don't use twitter to track news or
publish news at all I use Twitter to
talk to my customers for example and
find out if they are enjoying the latest
release of my product there are other
people in this room who are using
Twitter simply
deal with their family members that are
geography that would be a two-way
communication yeah exactly toys email
public so I think you know to summarize
this from my perspective I think we've
all consensus on this is social software
just can't be this amorphous tool for
Salesforce for example it's very
specific we want people within the
enterprise boundaries and outside
eventually in a controlled manner to be
able to engage in conversations that are
purpose driven and engage with your
business existing business application
so that you can actually do your work
and a friend of mine created this term
called BRP which I love it's called
barely repeatable processes so there is
a lot of ERP systems and other systems
that make your repeatable processes work
very well but there are lots of things
that you need to get done for which we
don't have a repeatable process based
system because i'm not going to invest
half a million dollars in building that
system in that case i need to choose a
communication pattern that's most
appropriate in certain cases it's
picking up the phone but we've strongly
believe that there's a new paradigm and
I call it the Facebook paradigm which we
are leveraging with our charter product
line to introduce a new way for
businesses to get certain kinds of
business is done and all of us have a
different slightly take on that but
that's basically what we are trying to
help you enable yeah i think i think his
if I'm understanding you correctly I
mean obviously there's an intention with
every technology that exists and that's
why it's successful similarly we're in
the enterprise we're mimicking
successful consumer tools to achieve
ultimately a business objective a
business goal and not just be social for
the sake of being social and and that
sort of fluff I think the vendors
represented in the panel all have a
stake in the game otherwise they
wouldn't be here I no jive / 2008 I
wrote down this quote or this stat Matt
Tucker let me know if this is true you
in 2009 you were up eighty-five percent
/ 2008 so right sounds right that's some
special sauce so
clearly they're accomplishing some
business objective yes so didn't read
what do you think that I would just
suggest but I thought you were one of
the best speakers by the way one of the
things that I would say in terms of
talking about testimonials and and case
studies and use examples I think that
what I was hearing just hearing from a
lot of people was allotted a lot of Oh
social medias great collaborations great
this is a new technology you're gonna
learn to click what I really want to
hear was exactly that kind of thing what
are the examples of how you do we have
several examples and you know I could
spend hours and hours with you and as I
said you know there's also something
called the 2 point 0 adoption council
that Susan scrub ski runs if you go on
SlideShare and just do a quick search
you'll find a million-one adoption
examples case studies etc actually
there's a social networking event and
some of these people I can guarantee you
are using these kind of tools today to
achieve certain business objectives and
you can come talk to us and we can each
tell you well I'm okay I don't imagine
what all those things are I just was
suggesting that it would have been for
me a more useful conversation if you
would have spoken more about examples
you studies and testimonials because it
just sounds like oh it's what I'm so so
they don't have to perhaps when I don't
respond to that really quickly because
all of the vendors have glittering
examples of why you should buy their
technologies and you know if you invited
a salesperson from any of the companies
on this panel along they will amaze you
with how tractors were you know slave 2
million dollars or whatever I'm sure I'm
just saying it would have been nice at
this path so potentially for the next
iag panel if there's interest in doing a
more sort of salesy adoption customer
story we could have half customers have
fenders that might make
you
okay but we're in Silicon Valley and we
all speak geek speak here and the
reality is there you know mix here then
if you've heard a mixer is enormous in
Japan that's all anybody uses in Japan
high five is enormous in other parts of
Asia facebook is broadly speaking a
Western European and North American
phenomenon and more good isn't big in
India and Brazil bed yeah exactly so I
mean you've got you've got all these
different you know one one that I make
this quick as i know we want to wrap up
with a lot of people think that making
something in their own image is going to
actually scale up and work for the rest
of the planet is it is a simple way of
putting this including the vendors you
know so that's a big issue right now
