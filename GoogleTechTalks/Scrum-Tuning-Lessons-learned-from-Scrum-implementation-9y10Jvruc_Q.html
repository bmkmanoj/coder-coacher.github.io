here at Google he forgot to tell you
that I want an ipod from google and the
agile conference but I was talking to
Google people in the back of the room he
gave it to somebody else so this is the
consolation prize i get to cover given
talk i'm going to talk a little bit
about scrum it's actually it's actually
going to be a lot about google because i
thought the paper that was presented at
the actual conference upon google's
implementation of agile in AdWords is
very interesting i'm going to be talking
a lot about that and I do my day job as
CTO of a healthcare company but I do
because I was the guy that written
started the first scrum I've actually
spent a lot of time traveling around the
world talking on strong and I've
typically been a CT of VP of engineering
and in four companies I tried to figure
out what worked in the fifth company we
have lamented scrum for companies later
scrum is just like it was in the
beginning the basics of scrubbed was
started in 1993 I do a lot of scrum
training there's a short list for the
next month you can see I'm in Europe a
lot sometimes down in South America a
little bit in the United States agile
ven as we know it today at the agile
manifesto meeting in 2001 17 of us got
together in Utah at snowbird who spent
three days arguing passionately we had a
one brief moment of clarity and woke
down was on the slide and
and most of you I think though the agile
principles that it's really the
individual and app individuals and the
interactions between the individuals
that build great software that's a lot
of what Google is all about that working
software is really the only real measure
of progress and that working closely
with the customer or the customer proxy
someone who represents the customer
working closely with the engineer team
engineering team is central to an agile
process and finally responding to change
it used to be only about forty percent
of requirements changed on the average
project in the industry but it in the
2003 report of the Stanford group that
number had moved up between 60 and 65
percent of requirements change during a
project Google already knows this but
some people are still trying to make a
plan and then then they create a a
change control group okay which is the
kiss of death for successful projects
these days so there were three people
from scrum there 4x4 XP people though
Martin Fowler is an author d SDM is a
process in Europe crystal Alistair
covert it has his old process he written
several books on and then a number of
consultants and authors and books those
were the guys that wrote the manifesto
it was kind of like throwing a bottle
into the ocean with a note in it and
everybody read it all over the world so
things that things have been amazing
ever since scrum is a worldwide movement
ads is where I'm a little bit
particularly struck
highest per capita from people in the
world are in Finland mainly because of
Nokia when I was thinking about scrum
there was some interesting ideas at
least I thought they were interesting
and they certainly were important to the
waste ground works it's actually a lot
of thinking in history behind it I spent
about 15 years working with
entrepreneurs in the valley here who
were in a nonprofit organization they
had all done great things that companies
that preceded Google they had cashed in
and they had were retired at 30 and what
were they going to do to make the world
a better place well they had to build
really good team processes to do public
service kinds of things and their goal
is to get small working teams to work
with the entrepreneurial spirit that
they saw in the startup companies so how
do you do that so all that kind of
thinking is built into scrum scrum is
derived primarily from Japanese best
practices from taki you chewed nanaka
and so it has a strong lean component to
it the leading the leading example of
that'd today is cost iota so I'm going
to be mentioning a little bit about
Toyota and finally I was on the board of
oxy on which is the leading microwave
enterprise development organization in
the Western Hemisphere they work
primarily in South America and that's of
immediate interest because the green
bank and Eunice and Bangladesh got the
Nobel Prize a couple of weeks ago they
are the leading micro enterprise
development organization in the eastern
hemisphere and the way we set up the
small teams and gave them a little bit
of money to start up their own
businesses and work together that kind
of thinking is embedded in scrum there's
also a lot of research behind it I don't
have a lot of time to go into this I
think maybe one of the things that might
interest to technical people here at
Google is when I was the just preceding
the time when scrum began I was I had a
little object database company on the
MIT campus and another startup asked me
for some space they wanted two small
rooms and the company is now known as I
robot I robot was started by Rodney
Brooks and MIT who said we
trying to build a smart system for 30
years we tried to build the biggest
database we could with all the knowledge
in the world in it we tried to build the
biggest processor in the sky we could
build that computer on the world's
biggest whiteboard and it was a it was
virtually a complete and total failure
so he said I'm going to do something
totally different I'm going to build a
system that has no database it only has
sensors the world's the database and it
will have no central processor will have
a processor on a leg on the spine it
will have a blank neural network chip we
will plug into its head and when we turn
it on by simple rules it will
self-organized learn to walk and then
run around and it would run into my
office trying to hunt me down with
infrared sensors now they're using it in
Iraq the same kind of technology
dropping into urban settings in Iraq but
the issue the thing that robot got me
thinking about is how do you build a
really high performance team out of
typical developers we were producing a
tool that had to be used by your average
developer at Ford Motor Company an IT
guy in Ford Motor how could we turn him
into a you know a googly kind of guy
well it was all about the team process
and then how that's how that's how scrub
began I've got a lot of slides to get
through so i'm not going to go into real
detail any more on the background of
scrum only to say that it's driven
largely by Jeff Japanese best practice
Fujio Cho was the president of Toyota
America in 2002 he's now the chairman of
the board of Toyota it's really
interesting hear what he says in an
interview because he basically is a
mouthpiece for agile principles we
didn't talk about Toyota we didn't talk
about him when we came up with these
things but when you ask him well you
know how do you think about getting work
done in Toyota he wants people to
actually do something you know if
they've got a new cop let's do a
prototype in a couple of months and take
a look at it and see what see how it
looks and then when we look at it we'll
see well it
really not quite what we want here's the
reasons why it's wrong let's do it again
and see if we can do it better and that
process keeps happening and after we
fail enough times and pull ourselves up
by the bootstraps we move to a higher
level of performance okay that's what
Toyota is all about that's the way they
think so what is google all about here's
the google way in 2001 I don't know if
his Rosen still here at Google no he's
long gone in 2001 he got rid of all the
managers but I understand you have a few
back we have any everything managers in
the room will you hear when that
happened no and basically he wanted the
teams to be small and take their own
responsibility and self organized and
get their own work done and some of that
flavor still exists here in Google the
only the only problem with that is that
when you get into larger projects and
this was what's interesting to me about
Adwords when you've got five different
organizations in different parts of the
world and when it's not an independent
project but like almost every other
global product has to somehow interact
with AdWords right at least that's the
way I understand it and so how does that
how do those five teams work together
and put stuff out that that supports
maybe hundreds of teams out there and
have it all makes sense you need a
little bit of organization okay so
that's that's one of the reasons why
AdWords started to think about agile now
one of the way interesting ways to think
about this is the way organizations work
actually this is a modified version of
what's in the Toyota way organizations
typically start up they will typically
start up in one to two ways usually a
little combination of both you'll have a
brilliant guy who's the CEO and he has
an autocracy what you do is how the CEO
feels today I work with compass some
comes startups like that talking about
scrum
and if you have a brilliant person who
is really good with people and could
really get money and generate great
product it becomes very successful I
don't know Google may have been a little
bit like that in the beginning I don't
know it does the problem is it doesn't
scale once once the company starts to
get too big they can't depend on what
that one person is thinking today to get
stuff done other companies they don't
have anybody in charge it's just kind of
organic maybe this is more googly like
that's the way Yahoo started I've done a
lot of work over yahoo and it was very
organic people did their own thing in
their own way and what they found is
that that didn't the scale so Yahoo they
went out and they hired some consultants
who gave them a big heavyweight process
and 300 page specifications and what I
got there a year or two ago they said we
really hate this and when they learned
about agile and particularly scrum they
said scrum would allow us to go back to
our organic roots and work in small
teams in the same way but give us the
kind of structure that Toyota has where
people are empowered but there's a
structure there that allows scalability
and what we're seeing is that scrum is
really infinitely scalable and in some
projects I don't know if we get a chest
talked about today but actually it's
linearly scalable ie if you double the
number of people on a well-run strum you
actually double the output of software
it's the only process that is ever
documented it with good data that
phenomenon so
it's interesting then to look at AdWords
which needed a little bit more structure
so they had to move from that organic
state up into a more lead a little bit
of a leadership driven organization with
their people making their own rules and
empowered but having some rules that
they're following so that they're
coordinated together and in looking at
the paper that was presented at agile
2006 it's interesting that it AdWords it
was a core group and there were there
were designs presented to them and there
was a team what we call in small talk
the product owner the person that owned
that product presented it to a bunch of
stakeholders and then they made a
decision on how to move forward and they
determined whether it was ready to move
forward this is a very nice setup for
strong because one of the most important
things in scrum is you have a product
owner who has a product backlog that's
ready for implementation ready means the
developers know enough that they can
cleanly implement so by having that
already in place ninety-nine percent of
the companies that I have don't have
that so Google was already a leg up so
we like to see in scrum a product owner
who owns that backlog has a list of
things that are prioritized people are
caught in constantly added to adding to
it it's totally transparent and visible
it emerges anybody can contribute and so
forth in AdWords the product owners held
weekly meetings with stakeholders now
this is really interesting because in
advance scrums we have what's called a
meta scrum my company runs a meta scrum
the product owner the cheap product
owner of the company comes in every week
and presents to the stakeholders in the
company the product plan all the
products projects in motion their state
and a recommendation for any tweaking of
that plan and in that meeting usually
our CEO is in that meeting as well as a
lot of other management type people and
lead
Engineers and support install people in
that meeting the decisions that are made
can redirect the process every week so
the company can navigate every week in a
new direction based on on what we call
the Metis from so adware has already had
a meta scrum in place this is really
unique okay because companies take a
long time to get to that state where
they can really do that so here's a
little bit more about the product owner
defines the features decides on the
release date and content this was all
going on as in AdWords we like people to
be concerned about profitability I met I
had lunch with some of the AdWords teams
they said don't call us AdWords where
the we're the coaching team so on that
team they know that they respond even
the team knows they're responsible for
profitability here at Google so that's
really good and scrum we typically run
in iterations of 30 days although many
crumbs run less often two weeks like XP
teams sometimes even one week's crumbs
the product owner has the product vision
generates the direction and looks at
what what what the result is and whether
it's good bad and so forth the kind of
meta scram we have a patient keeper is
actually very simple similar patient
keeper has one of the most advanced
scrum implementations in the world and
we when the product owner comes into
that meeting he talks about what the
team accomplished last week what they
will accomplish the next week what are
the impediments those are the three
issues and scrum that we're always
asking in the daily scrum meetings and
all product decisions are made in that
meta scrum things the starters stop
resources are changed and so forth
so AdWords had some good things to start
with but they were having trouble
delivering in the time that they thought
they could deliver and trouble
integrating working across geographies
and integrating with other teams and
they felt that they needed a little bit
more product process that we have
anybody from AdWords here yeah half of
you guys showed up okay so correct me if
I make any mistakes but this is what
this is what Mark wrote about you guys
so this is actually his words he was
very concerned about introducing any
process because it might get resistance
here at Google and so the strategy was
to do something as simple as possible as
little as possible first and he knew a
lot about scrum it's really helpful to
somebody to have somebody that really
knows this a lot of companies i see try
to implement agile by doing one or two
or three practices and they always
choose the wrong ones and it doesn't
work so if you're going to introduce it
by piece by piece you need the person
making those decisions who has really
gone through agile implementations and
knows that by not getting these pieces
introduced these are all the things that
are going to break and can kind of do
blocking and tackling automatically
while the team is kind of bootstrapping
itself up
here's the scrum process and simple form
how many people know about scrum what it
is most of you already know so here's
here's here's a the framework as
illustrated by soft house in Sweden we
have a product backlog the team pulls
it's really important it's a process
like the assembly line of Toyota pulls
just the amount that they think they can
get done in iteration when they pull
that though that feat those features off
the product backlog they break those
down in the development tasks estimate
them then they start into the iteration
daily meeting everybody speaks to the
three questions it's all inspecting
adapting expecting adapting inspecting
adapting all the way through and at the
end you deliver working software at
patient keeper every iteration delivers
production software into large Hospital
groups so our sprint demo at the end of
a sprint is let's turn on Mass General
hundreds of doctors and thousands of web
users and let's see if the phone rings
in the next hour that's the Sprint demo
if the phone doesn't ring and there are
no outstanding issues it was a great
demo that's our definition of done we
had a CEO that said look I'm tired of
this done meaning maybe it's been unit
tested I want it done and then done
meaning its system tested and not only
that I went I want it done done done so
that it's acceptance tested by the users
and not only that I want to dun dun dun
dun meaning the uses alive more than one
at least four and there are no
outstanding issues that's done patient
keeper it took us four years to get
really dun dun dun dun okay so now we're
always done at the end of the iteration
so what what was introduced first into
Adwords the thought was by just
providing some visibility into a release
backlog we're not not going to do it
erations yet we're just gonna have a
release back dog and we're going to
watch the task
being completed we're going to look at
the burndown chart for the release and
that looks like it like it might help
and it will put it up on wiki pages so
here's the picture of scrum that has
flowed out of a paper i did in agile
2005 where I said you know when you're
starting off and strum you're just
trying to get a team to work so I call
that a type a scrum so you need a
minimal amount of organization and
you're really trying to just get the
flow you trying to get the flow of
software delivery so there's working
code you get a you get to those
iterations you get kind of almost a
heartbeat going boom kaboom kaboom it's
just working code and if you execute
well it just gets faster and faster and
faster the problem for most people
implementing scrum is they have more
than one team they typically have a
product portfolio so how do you organize
where you have more than one you've got
AdWords with five geographies working in
AdWords you know you've got 30 other
groups with multiple teams working on
other things and they all have to mesh
okay so now you need to add some
different levels of planning that's what
i call a Type B scrum and so that is the
type B is directed towards making the
product a winner the the issue with Type
B that I found in many companies you
know you can have the greatest software
but not win in the market if the company
is not agile enough to move in a way to
both deal with competition and drive
into the sweet spot of the customer
somebody else can get there first with
inferior technology we see that all the
time Silicon Valley is littered with
great technologies that never made it so
I said how can we take scrum up a notch
how can we drive scrum right up into the
CXO sweet so the entire come
he becomes agile and it for us it's
really weekly iterations on a weekly
basis the company can change directions
resource change resources change plan
change projects change product on a
weekly basis so there's some things you
need to introduce at a type C level so
what I tried to show here is that Google
AdWords when they started they had a
release roadmap they didn't have an
iteration burn down chart but they were
implementing a release burned down and
they had the meta scrum that was kind of
driving things so these are the pieces
that they started with so in adopting
these practices one of the interesting
things is the question was posed to the
engineers what are the biggest
impediments in priority order that we're
facing and then by looking at what's at
the top of the impediment list what
practice could we bring in that would
take that problem off the top of our
problem list okay so it's a very
interesting way to introduce agile and
as a result the engineers sort of self
chose or at least agreed that the best
practice to bring in was going to
address their biggest problem and it was
done in a way to meet to maintain the
self-organizing character of the teams
and the person doing it was able to stay
a little bit removed from the teams and
not get involved too much in there
messing around with things so in the
scrum we course we have the scrum master
that has that responsibility and the
scrum master needs to really work the
issues between the customer and the team
show the customer or the product
organization how to maximize the return
on investment by really helping the team
to be effective improving the lives of
the team improving the productivity of
the team and improving the engineering
practice of the team so this is a major
function of the scrum master and strong
so here is your burn down
or any of you add word guys here when
this was going on some of you and what
you have here is task the numbers here
they tasks or our days or hours or
what's what was the metric two weeks
okay so 50 weeks of work and some of the
work is completed your burning down here
I think new work was added in so you so
instead of instead of having the graph
go up because some put some product on a
jam some new stuff into the pipe you
make it go down here so you can show
that the the team is just burning down
nicely but there's new work in here now
the gap is bigger the date is going to
slip out when you do that the burndown
chart gives you that image really well
it works Lee works really well with
management to they can really get it
really quickly by looking what's going
on with it so that helped but when they
looked at their impediment list they
still have some problems QA was testing
features that really weren't complete
what wasn't sure how to test them
engineers we're doing duplicate work
they were working on the same pieces of
the code base and clashing and there
were dependencies between engineers that
were not visible so things were getting
stuck or stopped and not flowing right
so the engineering team agreed that
maybe a daily meeting maybe the daily
stand-up meeting would actually solve
this that the QA people could know what
what should be tested what was ready the
engineers if they had dependencies could
work out the dependencies and people who
are working on the same thing wouldn't
be stepping on one another so they
decided to introduce the daily meetings
and when you do that initially they
could be long but after a while they
start to get really short typically
they're 15 minutes and scrum we have a
daily scrum of scrums a patient keeper
that drives the whole engineering
process it's 15 minutes
and a patient we actually have every
developer come it could be a group maybe
not quite as big as this because we only
have 30 or 40 engineers but the scrum of
scrums everybody comes but we get
through that meeting in 15 minutes and
it worked pretty well because you know
the team's kind of picked it up and
worked with it and it was moving forward
but it still didn't solve the problem
and this this is a really interesting
thing to me reading what happened they
estimated three weeks of work for a set
of screens and when they did low level
estimates they came up to 40 points so
what was the metric on a point how did
you what was the how to determine the
size of a point just had a was like a
quartz it 48 coins of work and what they
did wanted to do is measure the velocity
the first week and the velocity was 88
points got done and then the second week
well the second week was 7.5 and
interestingly the tech lead is the tech
lead of that team here it was there was
he said you know we've got 40 points we
did it points last week seven points
this week and we're going to be done
next week so even a really smart Google
engineer can do something that doesn't
make much sense when you don't have that
visible picture so at week three of
course the team implemented another nine
points but still far from done and the
team lead said well we're just going to
be done in another week but then in
another week the velocity actually
slowed down no way so at the end of the
day this thing took seven weeks and
they'd planned on three okay so the
question was is there any agile practice
we can introduce that would help resolve
this dilemma so what was done was they
took the same burn down chart and said
look here's our burn down
the work is getting done and we get down
here we got about eighty percent of the
work done but let's look at how many
features we're complete how many
features of the product backlog will
fully complete only twenty percent
you're almost the end of the iteration
and you've got eighty percent of the
work done and twenty percent of the
features complete what does that tell
you even a Google engineer can reinvent
work in progress is bad they figured
that out in Toyota about fifty years ago
okay this is a bad thing so you have to
reduce that gap and it was interesting
in the paper that apparently was a shock
to the engineers to actually actually
come to this realization so they learned
that they really needed a complete task
one of the things that happens in early
scrubs is you people choose what they're
going to work on but everybody chooses
something different so they're all got
running in parallel streams what does
that do it maximizes your work in
progress what did I just say that's bad
bad okay you want to look at and say
okay how can we work so we complete a
feature as quickly as possible might
have to put three people on one feature
so we sequence out the feature that's
going to minimize our work in progress
lower our risk and make our dates
realistic
another thing just to mention over at
pom they have this big time and the
stuff they're working on a lot of stuff
you bring into it iteration you can't
you don't really know if you can deliver
at the end so what you want to do is XP
has this concept called the spike what
you want to do is bring it in as an RD
task and the goal is to time box that
task and come out with information
allows you to make the decision about
the next step and that that information
that allows you to make the decision is
the done for that piece in that
interation that works really well I
don't know how much of your stuff is
spikes what percentage of AdWords is
spikes very small over at pom about
fifty percent of what they're doing on
some of the new technology because it's
both hardware and software is spikes so
on the first projects they felt good
that the tools were better early better
QA more collaboration but still hat
didn't have good prioritization of
features they were missing dates it was
risky at the end all these things
features not complete work done but
features not complete meant that also
that there's a lot of bugs hidden in the
features that aren't complete so but at
the end of the day they found
maintaining that release backlog was
useful it did solve some problems but
not all the problems so the next step
was to work with the product owners
let's get a clear prioritized list by
business value and the second thing that
was chosen was let's go to iteration
base development so that we can have
more checkpoints on things being done
and not allowing this work-in-progress
to escape our grass but force it to
closure at the end of every iteration
and they agreed to start with two weeks
in duration so is that what you're still
doing is two weeks iterations pretty
yeah pretty much so now you've got a few
more things in there you you've
straightened out the product backlog
you've got your daily meetings you're
working better with the product owners
you're starting in two iterations so
you're actually going to start working
out the Sprint backlog and burn down
chart issues which I'll talk about next
one of the problems that they had was QA
I know there's a lot of work now going
on testing particularly the unit testing
level here you google it's really hard
sometimes for people to get the QA into
an iteration so at the end of the
reiteration when they're done not only
unit testing is complete but system
testing is complete if you're not done
with testing at the end of it of
duration how much work do you have in
progress a hundred percent right we
already found out that's a bad thing
here's an interesting thing that you
could think about here at Google for
agile nokia nokia has this is their
criteria they first started with when
are we doing iterations they said if
iterations are longer than six weeks
we're not doing it erations if they're
not timebox we're not doing them if the
team tries to do too much planning up
front we're not doing them if it doesn't
deliver workable code we're not doing
them if they don't include testing
they're not doing them okay so so where
the AdWords group was right there they
wouldn't pass the nokia test four
iterations you know you did not do scrum
this is the scrum test your backlog has
to have estimates you have to ever
release burn down know your velocity the
team needs to know who the product owner
is and there is a scrum master involved
with the team that's their blitman test
for scrum and they say that's really
helped know nokia is such a big company
with so many hundreds of tea
teams it's really helped them be
effective in delivering product so
here's a here's a done kind of chart
that we use in the certified scrum
master training showing the idea one way
to improve your process is to extend the
definition of done so if you're if all
you're getting is coding done then you
want to extend the definition to get a
little more gets your unit testing done
and then if you're getting that done
then you want to push for getting the
whole quality assurance done and once
you get that done you want to push for
getting to the end of the iteration and
have performance testing done and once
you get there you want to push for let's
get some user acceptance or piloting and
if you get that far why not go all away
why not just budet live worldwide at the
end of every iteration okay that's
effectively what patient keeper does
although it's not worldwide it's just
into maybe for large multi hospital
systems okay if you do that it forces
you to streamline every aspect of your
operation it's like drink it's like
lowering the water level in a river the
rocks all starts sticking up there the
impediments the waste things that need
to be fixed and pulled out of the system
so they had they had release / and downs
but then they began to introduce
iteration burn down there starting to do
iterations now so they actually have the
real sprint burn down chart so and the
iteration burned down guides the
development efforts and the release
burned down from the product owners
point of view is the product release
milestone are they going is it going to
be met here's here's the way scrub looks
at the sprint backlog usually small task
on the average a day or eight hours team
members it's always a pull system the
people are always choosing their own
work pulling what they can do and so
forth here's a typical scrum board
that's using a lot of companies I don't
know if you use to use these in AdWords
at all developers will we'll start off
they'll put they'll put a story if they
use uses stories for requirements then
there'll be a certain number of tasks to
be used with a user story then when the
developers and the daily meetings will
be standing in front of this board this
is our the QA test ready for this story
the developers say ok I'm going to start
working on this they'll move it over to
in implementation when they're when the
development is done and probably unit
tested they move it over to this column
and say hey QA you have it when QA is
done they move it over to the done
column here the scrum master has got the
burndown chart there it's a it's a great
way of providing using a kind of an
information radiator to show everybody
what's going on in the project anybody
in the company can walk by this board
and in three seconds they know the state
of this project and in some companies
like in Stockholm st. Jude Medical have
these lava laps lamps that you have
around here they have it connected to
that chart and it goes red green or
yellow the CEO really likes that he just
walks around he looks and see if there's
any red lights
now the interesting thing about this
implementation of google and the thing
that registered to me that this was a
good one is that mark had to go on a
three-week vacation he was really
concerned what would happen and when he
came back it was all running by itself
so to the key to being a really good
project leader a scrum master is that
you're so good they don't need you and
it exercises there's actually a number
of quotes I could have pulled out of the
doubted Jing but this is the one I chose
you know he you act spoiled so this is
this is a googly way of thing I mean
this is embedded in the lugal culture if
you try to force something it gets
spoiled he who grasps the project leader
who tries to grasp that project causes
it to slip because he does not grasp he
does not let it slip this is what Mark
was effectively executing if you if you
did actually meet your date's ultimately
did you after all of this start hitting
dates okay so as the person who invented
scrum and what I was singing at the
beginning this is kind of a litmus test
for really good implementation so now
he's got everything in there pretty much
for type B except I didn't hear a lot of
talk about scrum of scrums or sprint
reviews do you have a scrum of scrums or
a meeting of the team leaders from the
multiple the five teams at different
locations how is that working in AdWords
how do you coordinate across those teams
oh you don't have what does it just
coordinate by osmosis or I suppose
osmotic osmotic coordination is this a
new thing we want to introduce does it
work well no it doesn't work well so now
actually mark told me you're probably
thinking about how to do distributed
scrum so I thought you know here's some
things to think about next so I want to
talk a little bit about discriminant
scrub outsource scrub type C scrum which
you've been talking about a lot of
companies run several teams and then
they'll have the daily meetings like
over at pom they have the daily meetings
of like three teams and then right in
the same room they have the scrums comes
after that so it's all over in an hour
and only everybody h / sits only 15
minutes except for the scrum master
scrum masters they have to do two
meetings their scrum meeting and the
scrum of scrums there are ways to design
this which I don't have time to talk
about to actually make this infinitely
scalable so it's a very nifty way to do
it what I want to spend time talking
about is distribution because you have
right now AdWords assuming you're
running a scrum like thing in all sites
you have what i call isolated scrum
communication only by fortunately google
has better osmotic communication than
most companies which have virtually no
osmotic mutation so somehow it sort of
works ideally you would do what it's
viewed as best practice right now in the
agile alliance is that you would have a
scrum of scrums that would meet
regularly across those across those
teams make sure things were coordinated
between the teams they would also roll
up the impediment list and have one
common impediment list for the whole
organization it's easier to get
particularly impediments that require
company changes not just team changes if
you have that unified impediment list it
gives you a lot of power
but if you really want to do you know
Google always want us to go the next the
next mile right so if you really want to
get really creative you might want to
consider totally integrated scrums
because here's what happens here here's
an example before I get into that I'm
going to talk about an outsourcing
example here's here's the metric that I
have in my mind in the company US
companies I've been I've said you know
the boards of directors are always
wanting to outsource because we can save
money okay and if the the data shows
that by outsourcing to india on the
average you save twenty percent that's
across across the industry so you take
two million dollars worth of develop and
you send it to india and gets done to
1.6 million you save four hundred
thousand dollars the board is really
happy the bottom line looks better say
my argument with them is that every
company I've introduced scrum in even
one that had 600 developers more than
double productivity in fact I don't even
view that as very good that's that's
kind of a mediocre implementation good
implementation gets a Toyota effect at
least four times it's designed to get a
ten times if you can just get two
hundred two hundred forty percent is
what I got at my last company where I
had about 600 developers that means that
I can take that two million dollars and
do it locally 4.8 if I send it to an
Indian team that's doing waterfall and
pay 1.6 how dumb is that why would
anybody want to do that you'd always
want to introduce good agility locally
first and then go and insist that the
Indian teams be agile and that's what
Yahoo is doing the converting all of
their Indian operation which is growing
bigger than the u.s. operation to scrum
if you can if you can bring them on
board with scrum then and you can
actually execute well then you can get a
real linear increase in productivity by
adding people there at lower cost you're
going to really achieve the benefits
okay so good company is what they're
working
with not just the Indians but the
Chinese Eastern Europeans people in
Russia Dubai and so forth trying to get
them really on board with this whole
agile process and distributed agile okay
so here's an example Jack blunt was it
was the CEO of dynax it merged with
Cersei dynax and he had a library
application it ran the whole library
every application in a library 12,000
sites 42 countries 120 million users
okay it's a lot of users or even even
for Google this would be a good piece of
change and he had to completely
reimplement it and he knew it was going
to be more than a million lines of new
Java code he had been CEO or CTO of a
dozen companies he'd done outsourcing in
all of them and in all of them it did
not meet his expectations so he said I'm
going to do it different this time he
started off just working mainly in utah
in january 2003 and this is thousands of
lines of code of java so you can look at
the increasing lines of code this is
kind of a measure of velocity of the
team that's about a team about 25 26
people in utah here they put in some
legacy code so this is an artifact once
they put it in you can see the slopes
tits the slope is the same so he said
hey to get you a million lines of code
it's going to be 2010 that is way too
far out I need to pull that in I need to
double the team size and I need to do it
in a way that really radically escalates
productivity so here he brought on 25
people in Russia in st. Petersburg and
boom the velocity more than doubled he
got better than linear scalability it
was an XP company that ran this whole
implementation as scrum distributed
scrum and the way he ran it
was very interesting he said I'm not
going to have any isolated scrums I want
everybody on the same page on the same
team I'm going to have every team split
evenly between st. Petersburg and the US
and canada so the catalogue team had
four people in the United States for
people in our for peel United States for
people in Russia and so forth even as
yet he had a small search team of poor
people two of them in the United States
to and Russia and he had daily what he
centralized was the scrum masters were
all in Utah the product on his role in
Utah and the architects we had some
strong centralization that really helped
them out but but distributed teams and
so the guys in Russia typically you know
like a few people like a Google team of
three people would come in in the morn
and they would kind of check in with one
another and by 5 45 in the evening of
the afternoon they would be talking to
the Utah people 745 in Utah they would
be having their 15 minute daily scrum
meeting they found in order to make that
work they needed to send out email
answering the three questions before the
meeting to solve the language problems
the cultural barriers make sure
everybody was on the same page and to
keep the meeting short they also had a
common tooling environment so everybody
could see the burndown worldwide they
built a dashboard that gave them a lot
of test data so people could see the
state of the project everybody
everywhere all the time and here's the
results this is the column that is
really interesting mike cohen who you
had here before wrote a book has written
a couple of books one of them is on user
stories and in that user story book he
talks about a small team 6 Java people
who reimplemented a waterfall
application with 54 person months of
work the original application was done
with 540 person months so he did it with
a tenth of the resources using scrum and
if
you if you backtrack that into function
points there are ways to do that /
developer / month he got 17.8 the
waterfall team was getting to the Circe
dynax with a distributed scrum across
continents got 15.3 / developer on a
project that was huge compared to this
is just a little project so on a large
distributed outsource project they got
almost the same performance as six
people locally in the same room not bad
so maybe this is a googly thing to think
about and finally there's just last I
think I've got one or two slides you
might think about these the type ABC
scrum issue that I've tried here's Ryan
Martin's who is who is the president of
rally development kind of put through
doubt put this chart together after
hearing me talk about this and he said
you know that people start off they have
releases that take a lot of iterations
fixed lengths cycle time for new
requests maybe four to six months when
they start to get organized they
shortened the cycle two to three months
and they're concerned about managing the
product of the product portfolio and
they smooth out the work so there's a
steady flow there's never any stoppage
but you can take it farther than that
you can do you can get the entire
organization involved you can start
releasing every sprint you can do
multiple overlapping Sprint's you can
change the cycle time the weeks and
months that patient Kiba we said what
are the customers really need for a
critical issue they need a new release
this week for the customers we wanted to
bring on onlive we typically wanted four
or five new customers a month we need a
new release every month that has all
those extra features that these new
customers want so our whole system is
designed to put out multiple weekly
iterations a month plus one at least one
big monthly release
our major new applications typically
take three months to get the first
release those are thought of as pieces
of those monthly so they emerge out of
those monthly iterations so as a result
we always have four streams flowing
through the teams simultaneously this
gives us tremendous traction we were
able to do 45 major releases a year and
those are big goal live kinds of things
at big institutions and I haven't found
any other companies that can do that not
certainly not in health care so this is
kind of the picture you know we got
we've got these weekly things going on
we've got these monthly things going on
and conceptually we have this
three-month release going on all the
time and here's how our burn down is
managed over the years we found that we
like to see the work burning down but we
want to manage here's the blue is new
things coming in every day maybe they're
new bugs maybe the product owner is slip
something in there we want to we want to
see what's coming new and new and here
we want to see what's closed so the
yellow better be bigger than the blue or
we know we're in trouble gives us very
early warning on trouble also we like to
manage the cumulative tasks in QA
because QA has to burn 20 at the same
time development does in order to go
live ok so we're watching and make sure
in that QA doesn't get out of whack and
then finally this was the first chart
that we actually got a good fix on we
started with 150 these are this is
number of tasks which their average a
day in size so it's about hundred fifty
days of work we started with 150 days
250 tasks and here we are almost at the
end and we've closed almost 400 we're
going to close 450 by the time we're
done so it showed us that you have to do
three times as many things as you think
when you start thus confirming the
mythical me at fred brooks mythical me n
month assertion that things always take
three times as long as the developer
estimates ok the beauty of of agile is
it allows you to inspect and adapt such
that you can actually overcome that ok
but this is the first date I've seen
that actually graphically shows that
problem and so now we can plan for it so
I think that I get through that into 45
minutes a little bit more okay so we
wanted to have a little bit of time for
questions comments thoughts how many
people are actually doing what you would
call agile now here at Google looks like
about maybe about half of you some of
you at AdWords you are you're not
raising your hands so but probably about
half of you yeah is it working for you
yeah advantage is really like it agile
really good for manages yeah
lots of small projects
Wow
Oh at the factory well
works great
they will try
you've got the same developer working on
program
here you have the
ah
if you have like three or four strums
which i think i'll be bragging
it's dedicated for
police
twice
in 30 minutes
there
it's not practical to have like
every day the same people
to the right objects
what what you have the question is
suppose you have multiple projects being
done simultaneously by the same people
how do you manage that you really have
this problem of multi-threading through
the same people a patient keep we have
multi threading through not only through
individuals but also through teams as
well so you have a type C scrub scrub
problem that means you've got to get
really good at scrum to execute this
well but you know we could maybe talk
about this offline later but you need to
figure out how to implement a type C
scrum I think the major thing we found
in that instance is you do have to have
regular meetings of the whole you're
doing it twice a week so that's a good
start where everything kind of gets
coordinated all the pieces that are made
sure they're in place any other
questions comments
how many of you who are not doing agile
processes now are maybe thinking about
might do it some of you may be about
half the remainder yeah I like the real
world
same
the question is is there anything else
that can bring an organization to the
same level of performance as scrum
rather than just saying no outright let
me tell you I'm working now with a CMM
level 5 organization something that
Google would ever think about it took
them seven years to get to see em em
level five that means that everybody is
using the same process all pro all
processes are monitored they've got so
much data i can ask them any question
and they can give me three answers from
three different data sets the thing
about CMMI maturity levels is it's
designed to reduce rework CMMI cmi level
one companies which is most companies
have about fifty percent rework that's
bugs and stuff that has to be redone
because it's not right by the time you
get to say it's a cm level five you have
only ten percent or less rework you've
added about ten percent overhead for
process management you have introduced
the you haven't increased the
productivity of the real work so they
spent seven years to eliminate to bring
their rework from fifty percent to ten
percent it improved their productivity
by about twenty-five percent they
introduced then introduced scrum they
immediately cut their defect rate by
forty percent they were already really
low they cut their planning overhead by
eighty percent and they doubled their
productivity and now they're bidding
contracts out if you to the Defense
Department in the US for example if they
want waterfall it costs them ten million
if they want scrum it cost them five
million and they've only been doing it
six months I think they can go all the
way like Toyota and get it twice as much
so what I can say is I have real data
that shows that scrum can take the most
mature company in the world and fix it
and I haven't seen anybody else that has
that kind of data
ask the same feature the same benchmark
by using their role
you know I think that scrum is like
Toyotas toyota has this team that will
go around the world helping companies be
better and they did an experiment some
years ago where they said let's find the
most agile company in the united states
and they found this industrial process
control company that had won all kinds
of agile awards they sent the toyota
team in there in six months they doubled
everything it's just like the scrum
example they did exactly what I
describes from did the CMM 05 company so
my view is that there's no company that
Toyota can't fix I don't care how good
it is and fixing it means they will
double every metric in a positive way
and I think scrum can do the same thing
it's based on the same concepts as lean
manufacturing is and I have some data
that other people don't have so I get to
say it other comments questions thoughts
okay we need to break now okay thanks
