actually from our Sydney office here
with us this week in Mountain View and
to be doing a talk on wave for everyone
so this should be really interesting and
also interactive as well I wanted to
kind of segue to large so he can
introduce himself thank you yes hi thank
you all for coming my name is Lars
Rasmussen i managed to google wave team
down in Sydney have you all enjoyed the
conference so far good together is this
the last talk on Friday which means she
either things I'm a really good speaker
or she hates my guts one of those Alan
is after you hate Alan's guts okay oh ok
so I'm going to talk about google wave
which is a product we haven't quite
launched it yet we announced it at our
development conference a couple of
months ago and we have about 10,000
active users that are trying it out it's
really early times have you all gotten
accounts on wave 1230 lots of people
okay so you'll get a chance to try it
out in case you have noticed these are
still early days it's still really buggy
questions all the time at least we have
funny error messages by September 30th
will extend a preview to about a hundred
thousand people and it should be a
little bit more stable by then and then
we'll do a real beta launch hopefully
later in the year although we might slip
into the next year has anyone here seen
the demo we did at i/o there is a
YouTube video one to a few people it's
an 80 minute video I'm going to squeeze
at 80 minutes into about 15 minutes here
which you really shouldn't do i highly
recommend watching the video afterwards
get some popcorn it's apparently the
longest video ever actually watched on
the internet at least at least that
wasn't pirated but i'll try and give you
an idea what it is i'll actually do
three sections to my talk i'll do a
super-fast demo of wave i'll talk a
little bit about what we think is a
pretty cool algorithm underlying some of
wave since you guys are into that sort
of thing and then if we have time i'll
talk
a little bit about some ideas that other
researchers have had about how wave
might fit into your world and then we'll
do we'll do questions afterwards so let
me just buzzed right in wave is a
communication and collaborations tool
that we that we that we have built it
contrasts with email all everyone's
favorite tool in that email sends
messages it essentially mimic snail mail
in wave we we have the notion of a
conversation of a way as a single shared
object hosted on a server in this case
in the cloud that the different users
can manipulate and I'll show you on some
of the advantages here so I want to
start a new wave and you don't want to
sit and watch me type for even 15
minutes we have these camp messages here
I click it down button and then I add my
friend dr. wave when we will all be
acquainted with like this and now the
wave the conversation is live on the
server just has one message in these two
participants I'm going to flip over to
another window here where I'm signed in
as dr. wave I'll try and remember
telling you when I flip over but you can
see who's logged in over here at the top
of the contact panel here is dr. wave so
dr. wave gets the gets the BBQ wave here
and just like an email he can make a
reply here at the bottom and say of
course I will make it you will soon see
that I am the worst speller in the world
like this he can also go and reply
somewhere interior to my message like
this with an inline reply it is always
sunny down under he says there is my
terrible spelling like this so dr. Webb
can make replies outside and inside of
my message and and those are
conversations and I'm showing if I go
back to my own account here you will see
that i now have those messages and i can
say i knew you would like this and i
would flip really quickly over here you
can see that message showed up
immediately now we also let you
added each other's messages here is let
me just see if I can get the right
account here's dr. waves account and he
can actually even though this was my
message here he can edit the message and
say he's a big chocolate fan that he
wants chocolate more chocolate etcetera
like this and now he edited my message
if I switch back to my own account you
will see that that message now bold and
when I open it up we immediately show
you the fact that not the wave edited it
and a highlight of what happened here so
we let people edit each other's messages
i can edit my own message as well and in
fact i'll show you now and this is the
algorithm i'm going to talk about later
if i add my two companions Julian's and
Dan yeah if you guys pop in and we can
all edit this little thing together here
you can see the Dan is there editing up
here saying wine and yes are you in
there against is there as well so now
you can see the three of us can edit the
message simultaneously and you'll see
that I can see what ins and then I'm
doing character by character and in fact
if I just make this browser window a
little bit smaller you'll see that both
I and dr. wave can see everything that's
happening here dr. wave sees sees where
I'm editing as well over here pretty
cool huh because if you like it you're
welcome to you know you're not cheer
applaud that sort of things so that's a
really super quick overview of what a
raw wave can do you can do replies
inside and outside of other messages you
can do editing of each other's messages
and you quickly realize that what before
were two separate tasks of collaborating
on content versus discussing thing now
actually becomes two ends of a spectrum
a wave we like to think of as the as the
union of document collaborating
documents and conversations you have a
question
good creation you feel let me try and
show you that later and so we have we
have some very powerful we like to thank
api's on here which is what we're trying
to sell to developers now that lets you
configure the content inside a wave to
something as specific as coding or
writing an academic paper I'll show that
in a little bit okay I want to first
show you how we use this combination of
conversation and document editing to
construct design documents let's see if
i can find wave overview like this so
here's a little historic design document
sector the first document that my team
produced with the tool one thing a
feature we're very fond of this is
called playback where you get to rewind
the wave and see step by step as it was
created so you can see here that our
trusted server guys stephen started with
a tourist draft here you'll see the risk
text document here is god it's got
headlines and bullet points and
illustrations and lars as a manager
sorry Steven adds to rest of the team we
were only five people back when this
happened Lars the manager says you
really need to do more work Steven
grudgingly adds a paragraph says ear
whatever we have a product manager who
then goes in and edits to content here
she makes a comment down here starts a
discussion here and so on and so then we
use we use this combination to construct
these documents you no longer will need
to separate tools want to construct a
document and want to debate it over here
and in fact what often happens is that
the diesel discussions here turned into
a little thread when we reach a
conclusion someone will go and implement
the conclusion inside the document
itself and then you can delete the
discussion and again because you have
this playback mechanism it's safe to
delete stuff from a way because you can
always play back and you can revert
deletions and and and so we find that a
really kind of well used wave often both
girls and shrinks unlike an
melts right that only ever grows away
will grow and shrink and grow and shrink
and every time we go through a cycle
like that you get a little bit better
product out of it let me show you how
this little story we like to tell about
how when we start using a tool like this
when we see this a lot typically lose or
start using it as if it was an existing
tool like email so we made the client
look sort of like an email client to
capture that familiarity we just try
that again I mentioned how this was a
little bit buggy didn't I don't done
pardon me while I reload my client here
we go like that you just add yet and dan
and I seen that yeah okay so we've had a
lot of fun this week with indexes
falling over we made the grave mistake
of actually invited users in here and
they ruin everything so we we went
through this so we started using is very
early in the year when it was really
buggy and we found that even though we
worked on the tool for a year and a half
we started using it sort of like email
and typically so we barbecue every
Saturday down under and someone will
send out a message like this and
everyone would reply and reply and it
became sort of a threaded things like
I'm coming I'm coming I'm not coming
I'll bring the wine who can give me a
ride and so on and when you're done with
it looks just like an email thread and
it's really hard to extract a list of
people that are actually coming and so
pretty quickly someone had the bright
idea instead of just writing writing
like that and we would say and you are a
name to this list outline i list like
this and that was all that was required
now instead of replying people who were
coming would actually go and edit this
message here put themselves on that list
and now when people would say opening a
wine in who has
right that what happens at a discussion
but now automatically at the end of it
you have the exact list of users so very
simple little change of the way we use
this tool made us achieve the goal of
finding out who's coming a lot simpler
and then of course since we're all
programmers we started realizing that
there was a pattern of behavior here and
then we have api's that lets you target
the content of a way to a specific task
I'll show you what coding later but here
is the super important task of figuring
out who's coming to to the BBQ and so
one of the guys on the team wrote a a
super simple it'll get it we call it
which is now I'm favored it's called a
yes no maybe gadget and it looks like
this and now all we have to do is click
this link here and now if I if I if you
could see these guys screens are you
guys seeing this way so you guys come in
so now you can see in clicks over here
and against transported over here and
now of course it's becoming even easier
it can even set a little status here
there you go i can swing by late i think
says dan and so this is a little gadget
a good ridden it's a totally standard
thing just like the gadgets you find out
I google the difference is that because
we put it in wave it becomes
collaborative that when the state of
this get it changes the wave system
automatically transmits it to other
users and using the same mechanism which
I'll tell you about in a couple minutes
for concurrency control and automatic
conflict resolution this stuff just work
so now at the end we have with even less
work this particular result that we're
looking for of course to show you
another example instead of just having a
boring old address here I can this might
actually break on me but I can highlight
this this ad was here and using a
different extension I can go on insert a
map gadget like this and now again
without the programmer of this gadget
having to do any particular kind of work
let me just add up the wave again
like this you will see I'm having my
fingers crossed below the podium but
when I move the map over here it
automatically moves for everyone else
when I change it to satellite view I
should have had all my toes cross as
well shouldn't I there should on a good
day then you can you can cleverly if we
were to use them up like that thank you
and don't be shy it is Friday thank you
so you can now collab really configure
this map here and I can actually go and
explain exactly where the BBQ is oh come
on kids put it over here and so we can
put markers and draw lines and so on and
again this was very easy to write we
always eat already have a Maps API which
is packaged it as a gadget and then the
wave system automatically takes
transmitting all this data and so we
have I should just say since we're in
this developer preview mode we have a
whole bunch of developers that are now
building these are all toys but actually
building real things including folks on
the actual Maps team I will make this
work for real you guys getting busy yet
it's not quite like the Google Earth
thing out there but who knows maybe
we'll make a gadget my google earth in
here as well okay I will now show you
sheila written scripts you lie I will
now show you how to integrate this with
Twitter so another type of extension
here actually let me show you pictures
that's what i want to show you i'm going
to start in a wave like this and i'm
going to say pictures did i mention my
spelling is above them all and i will go
and i'll drag a stack of pictures from
my desktop into the browser here and
they automatically gets added to the
wave like this would you if you're into
browser application you know that
browsers can actually do this and decide
this particular feature actually choirs
Google gear so we added some modules to
that and to make this possible and now
if i go and i'll add dr. wave again
like this I'll switch over to his
account I'll go check out his inbox he's
got these pictures here as well now i
will add some more like this and so now
dr. wave and i have collaborated on
putting together some pictures you'll
see that i have who dare you will see
that i should have his pictures here to
imagine that those great things were
actually dr. waves pictures now i get to
go view a slideshow and if this hadn't
broken then i would be able to see both
my pictures and dr. wage pictures in
this slideshow here so waves can be used
as a super easy mechanism for
collaborating to put together photo
albums are you guys familiar with
Murphy's Law demos and the success is
the the chance of success is inversely
proportional to the importance of the
audience in other words it's your fault
that everything is breaking like this so
now we have these pictures and i want to
show you another extension that we build
us a little toy but these are is done
with the third party AAP eyes or anyone
could use i will learn what we call a
robot which is a server-side piece of
software it's a web service that
interacts with the way just like a human
can do so there is an API that lets dis
robot which sits on the server see all
the life changes inject life changes add
and remove participants and so on this
particular robot doesn't do a lot I'll
show you different robots later it just
does one thing it publishes his wave so
it gives the world access to the wave
and then it takes and uses a different
API to embed this wave on my blogging
site and so I'm going to go to my
blogging site here and then you will see
so this obviously was supposed to be
hang on a second oh you'll see this is
actually completely frozen isn't it okay
ignore all the errors here look forward
to a good weekend so this should
be the right pictures but you'll see
that the the pictures are better here we
didn't actually just grab the pictures
and copy them onto a webpage we've
embedded the entire wave with all of its
UI on to this page here and so suppose I
wasn't myself here but some some of my
many many fans that read my blog
religiously I could now go and use the
wave you I embedded on this blogging
site here to make a comment nice
pictures holy mackerel I can't spell
nice pictures in particular the great
ones like this and then if I go back
into if I go back into my wave client
you will see remember this is just a
single shared object and so even though
someone made a comment on my pictures on
the blog page because it's a shared
object that comment shows up inside my
wave client and so I can go I don't have
to go back to my blogging site to manage
my blog I can do it all from in here you
are so right about that anyway I really
do this to show you our little spell
checker like this you like the spell
checker you want to see the bean soup
demo let's see if we can make this work
can I have some in soup you notice that
I'm purposefully hitting a correct
dictionary word and still our spell
checker checks and realizes that I'm in
bean soup it sometimes also suggested
beer soup it has now I'll do it in
reverse spin so it has been so long and
again it figures out and bin we've
actually turned on / off a really cool
feature where sometimes our spell
checker which obviously is contextual
and uses the entire web to learn a big
language model and so on it's sometimes
has such good confidence that it auto
corrects the word and so just a few
words behind you comes is really nice
thing and and fixes up all my errors
that are numerous anyway that was a
little aside I'll spell checker apart
from all of the magic it does with
language models is also written with
this robot API it's a row button
automatically sits on all of your waves
the last thing I just want to mention if
I can find the right spot here if I
don't have enough people here helping
with the demo if the person who made the
comment here hadn't been me but another
way the user the fact that they had made
a comment on this wave here would make
the wave automatically show up in there
waving box as well which means that they
also don't have to go back to the blog
site to wait for me to reply to their
question it'll just pop up to the top of
their inbox when I make that answer and
so we have this idea that they'll be
waves sitting everywhere on the web and
you'll go and engage in these
conversations and you can aggregate all
of the conversations of ways you are
interested in into inbox which we
estimate will make flame wars about
three hundred percent more effective you
guys don't do plain words come on you're
not supposed to even know what that
means okay so i want to show you just a
couple more extensions before we go to
the next section i'm already way above
time here so since you asked about
source code do you guys have a snippet
of Python handy because are not actually
program i'm gonna i'm going to start a
fresh wave here i'm going to add the end
and I'm gonna add an and if one of you
guys want to just pop in I'm going to
add in another robot called case in taxi
and and and let's see we can make this
work pardon the mess here I think I
can't even spell Python here this is
gonna work is this going to work it's
just going to work is it gonna work it's
not gonna work it's your fault try it
again remember the Python thing anyway
on a good day what would happen here is
that the robot okay
in taxi sees that there's Python code in
here it grabs it on the server matches
up against a syntax coloration there you
go you saw here that even though against
paste it plain text the robot here now
format it as that's Python and I don't
know if you can see this on this
projector here but the key words here
are in a slight purple color if I go and
delete the be here then it turns black
and the way this works is that the live
changes I make it's transported through
our server to the robot sitting
somewhere else out in the cloud and the
robot and sends back a command to turn
that black and if I now reverse that it
does the opposite on a good day and this
is not a good day there we go it takes a
little longer and in fact you could
write a robot that then so this one just
a syntax coloration you could write a
robot that takes an execute the Python
code here and then puts the result in
this case in the way but the sort of one
of the Holy Grails of extendibility of
wave is that you should be able to write
a full fledged IDE while you do all of
your source and here we'll even write a
debugger so that you can sit on
collaboratively single step through code
that gets executed by the robot sitting
in a central location the benefit of
doing something that crazy would be that
now you're coding becomes collaborative
and you can use all of these discussion
mechanisms to do your coding yes sir so
you would then put your robot on your
local computer and the robot doesn't
have to say locally so that would cost
out of an extra round trip time and we
might we might make it so that you can
circumvent that by putting a little mini
server on your machine as well now we're
getting way too deep into this for my 15
minute demo but the underlying protocol
of waves is we publish that and so
there's a site called wave protocol dot
org where you can see how it works where
we slowly started open sourcing all of
our code we're promoting the protocol
for other entities to build wave servers
including competing ones and you'll be
able to build this too many
and sits on your own machine so you
don't have to go out to the cloud and
also so that you can if you're if you're
keen to have your wave sitting close to
you for whatever reason you can do that
by just taking voiceover putting it in a
closet and then the protocol will manage
communication between different servers
if the participant on a particular way
belongs to different providers yes sir
so currently we don't control it's not
quite linear act so we kind of unravel
when people do things concurrently we
are unravel it a little bit we are
planning and this is not going to be any
time soon but we are planning to have
ways i'll show you just a little example
let's see let's see i showed you that
design document before didn't I don't
then where did it go there so here
imagine we are now feeling when a good
state with this document here so the one
the one feature we do have a deserted
stage is that you can now grab the
product of your work here and copy it
into a new wave I did so now in his new
wave here you just get the current state
which is the product of your work and
you can keep working with in here or
shared put it on blog whatever the
long-term intention is that where this
is just a copy now in a separate wave
the long-term intention is that this new
wave here becomes linked to the old wife
with a pointer back to the version at
which it was created and then the
algorithm that I'm going to tell you a
little bit about in a second will make
it possible for you to go back into the
original wave do more work and then
merge your changes into the new wave
even if that new wave has changed and we
do the algorithm we work with does
automatic conflict resolution I don't
have time to give you all the details
but we'll even make it and this is
obviously inspired by source control
systems will make it so that you can
have a set of we call them work ways
pointing to the same product wave you go
with a team and do some clever it work
in one you merge your result into the
shared product way if everyone else can
pull those things
to their waves merge it with their local
changes and then put the airs up when
they're done I would love to sell this
kind of thing to a site like Wikipedia
and so on I think I think it will be a
very very powerful thing okay let me
just show you the last little actually
two more robots that I'm going to
squeeze in here real quickly you guys
all use Twitter religiously that was a
question of course good so we build a
little demo robot here called Tweety the
twit but she added to a wave and it
immediately parts of four min T waves a
ways can contain forms in fact the
content model of ways very extendable
and I can now sign into my Twitter
account here like this and now the robot
goes and uses my there we go and uses my
password to login to twitter and grab my
tweet stream like this and pop them in
his wave and you'll see that now I get
to read them in easy see because it's
now in a way that keeps track of exactly
what I read and so on and I could just
keep this wave around we haven't
actually built it into to the twin bot
but it could continuously poll Twitter
so that every morning I'd see my new
tweets here and I know exactly which
ones were ready and so on and now let's
see if there is a interesting thing out
here this is as my my colleague back in
sydney she's about to go home and drink
wine and so i can use way to reply to
her as i drink one for me as well please
she'll know on demoing wave when she
sees this and so i will i'll make this
reply and so I've done this inside wave
and what happens now is that the tweet
button sees that I made this reply and
it goes over to Twitter and if I just
refresh the page here you will see that
the twin bot you'll see that the twin
bot put this out into my tweet stream
like that see Aaron so this is an
example of how you can use robots I
showed you earlier you can use robot to
published off you can use robot
two
you
consider this an email you use for
communication our vision is of course
that if we can actually sell these api's
to programmers and I mean you guys of
course and then then you should be able
to use wave as a central hub for all of
your communication and collaboration
okay last thing did you guys attend the
wonderful talk about machine translation
the other day so someone from that team
very kindly build a little robot called
who dare called all staff that's right
called Rosie this is not looking
promising the chances of this demo
working not super high let's see we can
figure it out so I want to start in a
wave and I'm going to add dr. wave and
i'm going to add row c and and i want to
start a new new wave or maybe I'll
proceed to the next part of the talk ok
let's try it dark the wave and Rosie and
I'll give myself a little bit more space
here and then we'll see everything's
broken over here is that was the best
part of the demo to Moses Dante Dante
implanted on with Ultron you've gone
incognito sandbox dr. wave logging in
this is well worth the wait I guarantee
it
ah good question I mean good idea I
accept bribes of all kinds for access to
the sandbox yes absolutely in fact if
you have a name and email address i can
add them after this talk it shouldn't be
a problem no no no you will have to do
without the roci demo sorry about that
pardon me you're going to build a robot
that I can't quite hear you it would be
very extremely possible to do actually
in fact if you're into that sort of
thing I recommend you go look at
google's chart server which has the
ability to take a little late expression
and return an image of a formula for
example let's see let's see how's it
looking over here no knows maybe we'll
work after all I'm not sure okay now we
can't possibly fail so I set up a way
between myself tucked away and Rosie the
translating robot and if i type hello
world it kindly translates it into
French Moser Lomond wow this is a
wonderful demo yes and so you'll see
that Rosie actually translates word by
word what I'm saying and if I go back
over here and reply in my only French
here and you will see that it
it translates it back into English and
so I this this excites as a great deal
actually and it's not just because it
makes things like flirtation a lot more
efficient but you can imagine you can
imagine you could also use this and so
the guys from the the folks from the
research team that built this they have
this vision that excites me a lot where
you could have two people collaborate on
say a research paper that don't speak
the same language and this is a this was
that good luck they'd never speak to
sign language okay so the idea is is so
so rosy if you heard the talk yesterday
it uses statistical methods to translate
and so you train it by feeding it pre
translated documents and it's not
perfect and but you can imagine
something like this I write a draft of a
document and say English a drowsy and it
gets translated to Russian but somewhat
broken Russian and I add my Russia and
collaborate or it doesn't speak very
well english but it's good enough
Russian but my Russian color you can go
and fix up the translation first and
then go and add his pieces to the
collaboration which will it be
translated back into broken English over
in my world and I'll go and say okay let
me fix this translation into English and
I say and now I'll add my things which
then gets transferred into broken
Russian and so these guys believe I
think it would be a wonderful thing that
you can actually end up with with a
collaboratively constructed document
about something even though the two
collaborators didn't speak the same
language and you have trained we're all
say the translator in the process so
that she'll do better next time pretty
cool ok so that's all the demo I'm going
to show you today I think I mentioned
that there is an 80 minute video out on
the web on wave google com get yourself
some popcorn comfortable chair watch it
the best parts are in the end and you
can't fast forward okay rapidly running
out of time here I'm going to tell you
so I think this disability to edit the
same document at the same time
seeing character by character changes
while having an extendable content model
it is a pretty good thing and we're
we're we're proud about the algorithm
Ida had nothing to do with this a couple
of the folks on my team did this work
Alex mine particular david wang sir
unless and christian all or lots of
people were involved in this it the the
method we're using is called operational
transformation it's a style of algorithm
was as been been a subject of quite a
lot of economic research the particular
paper we started with this called high
latency low bandwidth windowing in a
Jupiter collaboration system written by
these four gentlemen here two of them
actually it worked for google now and
i've been very helpful Mike and John
they came out of Surak spark in the
mid-90s and here's here's a very brief
description of the problem so there are
two clients on a server the clients have
their own copies of the document and if
I hit an a over on this client here of
course we want to display that a
immediately and then send an operation
on the wire that explains where are
inserted that a right and now the two
documents are out of sync right and then
the operation travels through the server
gets applied over here and now we're in
sync again the challenge comes when when
two people are working simultaneously
that now they both get out of sync in
operations cross each other and the wire
and we want this property called
optimism that everything that happens on
a client immediately gets displayed to
the local user and it doesn't get
reverted on this after we don't want to
go and wait for round-trip time and so
on and when there are conflicts we want
it to be resolved automatically and
here's how not to do it so imagine the
two documents is is a string ABCDE and
on one side I'll excellently back off a
little bit so the really nice
observation that Jupiter folks made was
that if you have a centralized server
rather than doing it in a peer-to-peer
fashion then the algorithm requires only
to know about two endpoints a one server
one client and the server kind of
duplicates the same algorithm which each
with each client and once it has
resolved an operation from one class
and it pretends to all the other clients
of that operation originated on the
server and that greatly simplifies
matters and so from now on we'll just
talk about how the algorithm looks
between the server and one client and
will claim that an operation came from
the server when in fact it came from one
of the other clients here so let's say
that on the client the user deletes 2d
and the server decides to delete the B
and so so in one direction comes delete
for in the other direction comes to lead
to if you just evenly apply them of
course you end up not having the same
document which is what you don't want
and so instead you do this when when the
delete for arrives on the server here
the server knows the version that this
operation originated from and so when it
arrives here the server knows that
delete to was applied to the document in
between the version of origin and the
version you want to get to and so the
server transforms this operation against
this operation here and it turns into a
delete 3 and now the server ends up with
a string AC e on the client would do the
same thing when delete to arrives here
the client knows that delete for was
executed in between the originating
version and now it does a similar
transformation in this case it's the
identity because the deleted character
here was passed to deleted character
here and now we end up with the same
string and so this type of algorithm is
called operational transformation the
trick is to describe your data structure
which is in our cases of XML document
describe a set of operations by which
you manipulate that data structure which
I'll talk about a little bit later and
then you need a transformation function
that takes any two operations snc for
server and client and produces a set of
operations a'stache can see that Prime I
mean as part
c prime has been a while since I've
talked about algun this and it has to
have the property that for all pairs of
operations and all documents applying c
prime followed by s and applying as
prime followed by c have to land you
with the same document and so the the
tricky part here is to come up with the
right triple of data structure operation
set and transformation function it's
easy to see that there is a good range
of choices of transformation function
even when you've locked in and to others
for example you could fulfill this
property ever easily by having all s
primes and see primes just delete the
entire document all right then you would
have this convergence property but users
are probably not going to like it too
much and so there's a little bit of an
art here in encoding these this triplet
here in a way that preserves the
intention of users and so this was the
work that here's another way of
describing what happens here the
document on the server and client goes
through this state space it's a
two-dimensional state space where the
first dimension describes operations
that originated on the client the other
dimension describes operations that
originated it on the server and then the
solid lines here tell us the path that
the client traverses through the state
space here and a dotted line tells us
the path that the server traversed
through the state space here and this is
this is how we draw the example I showed
you right before the originating string
here we give that version on with
several 0 and then simultaneously the
client goes left the server goes right
like this and then a little bit later
this operation here arrives over here
and moving here down to the parallel
spot here is transforming s against see
and likewise moving this arrow down to
here is to transform see against s and
then you end up in the same in the same
state so this is just another drawing of
the example I just showed you of course
the trick is that
one trigger that server and client can
diverge arbitrarily many operations and
so here is an example where the client
has has executed two of its own
operations by the time and operation
arise from the server and so here what
you do is you do two transformations
against first this one and then this one
in order to get down here and so one of
the drawbacks of this algorithm here is
that if the client and server divert is
quite far the complexity of catching up
is not duplicative and so if you have a
large divergence here the getting back
together here if there is an outstanding
operations here and I'm here then the
complexity is M times M which can be
prohibitive if you have off lining and
so we made what we like to think of some
advances at some point we'll put it on
publish an actual paper about this when
it does settles one simplification of
the algorithm we made is that we when
the client sends an operation it holds
off on all the other operations until an
act comes back from the server and it
has received the first one and so this
dramatically simplifies the amount of
state the server has to hold of course
in a very high latency situation it it
makes it a little slower for operations
to arrive in the other side right so
what happens if i'm typing really fast i
send the first character on the wire but
then I typed three more characters
before that I comes back and then I send
those three in a single go whereas if we
are done the additional work and kept
the additional state on the server then
those three operations could be chasing
each other on the wire and the outer and
was still work but it's a lot harder to
maintain we also added some recovery
logic I think probably anyone who's
actually implemented is algorithm for
real including the four authors who
actually build a reading my system
called you better I put in there so
another thing we did and this is again
about constructing that triplet running
on a time aren't I constructing that
trip though we made sure our operation
space is closed down the composition
that has a very nice effect that if you
have that NM
outstanding thing as long as you can
compose them efficiently then you can
also transform them efficiently I think
the time complex in the end becomes n
log n plus M log n which of course is a
lot better and you get lots of other
benefits but you'll have to wait for
that paper to come out it'll undoubtedly
be written in wave questions yes well of
course there could be lots of potential
applications of this there is one that
could be potentially a very influential
which is helping for developing the
Semantic Web this a mantic web which has
been a tremendous failure so far and in
using wave i think that collaborative
collaboratively enriching websites could
be possible in such a way that the users
contribute some semantic content to
sites even if they don't own this I
themselves so that could be a very good
opportunity for helping the development
as the Semantic Web how do you think I I
think you're absolutely right of course
any application you propose to me I'll
say you're absolutely right but I do
actually mean it the what what we found
is that collaboration it's just like
with a computer if you have a certain
task for a computer the only have one
computer takes so long if you can get a
hundred computers to turn in parallel
that works a lot better and and if we
send this stuff on right we can
collaborate on all kinds of tasks and it
just makes more stuff done the missing
part here is the integration and so we
believe we have all of the api's to make
that happen and if we don't we'll add
them and then it's tough for you to
write that thing whereby you of course I
mean your students yes
ah yeah
yes look see really I mean it is our you
know you're not supposed to be
everything for everybody so we're trying
to be everything for everybody it
doesn't necessarily have to be quite
that dramatic for us to consider
ourselves successful but it'd be very
nice so I certainly much enjoy what i
can do tasks I used to do in a whole set
of different tools that were poorly
integrated when I can now do it at all
inside wave there are not many things in
my life that I can do that with because
all of these integration points are not
done yet but that's what we're hoping
another way actually describing wave so
I've shown you mostly an application
I've shown you a little bit of a
platform to build different things with
but in a sense wave is a is a is a
programming model as well what this
algorithm I barely had a chance to
outline a wave is really in essence an
XML document i simplified a little bit
and the wave client is really just a
thing that knows a particular schema and
displays it in a certain way in a web
browser and manages certainly
interactions with users but we keep
adding new types of contents and it's
really easy to add stuff and then you
you respond to user interactions and it
goes on the wire and automatically gets
resolved the algorithm is very generic
you you don't have to know too much
about how it works in order to design
new types of things like the form
elements radio buttons any kind of thing
we've seen lots of suggestions from
researchers about trying to integrate
scientific tools in two ways and it will
be very easy to display kind of control
panel from a tool and make it all
collaborative yes so one of the
difficulties seems a lot of social media
is often understanding the visibility of
the behavior you do you know if I make
this comment is this globally readable
as it not and so one way you kind of it
seems 20 minutes you explicitly know you
know go to website I kind of see some
different things I know it's assist with
this website so in wave you have this
nice personalized view but in some sense
you've ever gated all these different
interactions on this one perspective I
was wondering if you had any thought
about how you could kind of better
expose to users
the visibility of their changes or if
they kind of understand the play out I
mean it seems some sites like social
networks like Facebook have attempted to
have people set up different groups or
even commenting and that has so far been
pretty big failure at least on that
website yeah so so this this stuff I you
know I can tell you what I think about
it but really distance stuff finding has
to play out when we get actual users and
we've already seen our original super
simple you add individuals one at a time
didn't work super well already at the
scale of just a few thousand users
people quickly want it very strongly to
have groups and we have groups and wave
actually we just don't have an interface
yet by which you can manage groups and
so we offered it all our users to part
of be part of one big group which at the
super exciting effect that everyone
starts away with everyone and then they
sell mourad is cool are you there can
you hear me and that's why it's not
working very well right now but the
we'll figure that out one of the things
we're going to do is to make the
construction on groups something that
robots can do and also something that
people can collaborate about we have
kind of this theory that something is in
a way if it probably should be answer to
you again and so the way you construct
the group is you take away when you
write in all the participants of that
group and that immediately makes it
available to robots to construct groups
a by sinking them up with groups over on
facebook on an LDAP directory but also
means that users can collaborate on
putting together a group we have high
hopes for that but we haven't actually
built it yet so what's on why would you
do I'm just kidding so you erase away by
removing all the participants an animal
garbage collected for you removing a
participant's one of the features we
haven't quite implemented yet it's a
it's a there are some subtle issues with
deleting away I'm sorry removing a
participant because it's a it's a sort
of shared object and so we there's
there's some conflicting desires here
you want to remove people and typically
you probably want to be removed that
someone else wants to remove you because
that we would try to optimize for the
case where everyone has
interest and then put in safeguards to
prevent abuse and so the rule is that if
i add you and I remove you before you've
opened the wave you never find out about
it however if i add you and you have
opened the wave then I remove you to
everyone else on the way it looks like
it is gone and and when we add more
stuff to the wave you don't get to see
that however because you'd open the wave
when you go back to the wave you get to
see everything still up to the point
where you remove then you get an option
to to save a copy and so you go through
all that and then when everyone has been
removed and they'll be just a handle to
remove everyone then we can garbage
collector wave of course someone might
have saved a copy we very carefully
don't disclose to the other participants
who say the copy or even if they got the
opportunity yes yes oh sorry someone
someone has a microphone wonderful wins
one of the problems with texting is of
course the lack of non-text context
information for you exchange visual cues
and what have you have you thought of
using the wave technology to add
additional out-of-band communication
mechanisms like give me an example you
could get a feedback of we speaking
longer on the on the exchange or you
could get you know you could react on on
with emoticons on you know on the CI
module yeah so so the idea would
typically today we're actually running
out of time whose time when I take it
Ellen where is that as Ellen here this
is should probably be the last question
way over time he's on the phone good for
us so the oh there is yes so the idea
the idea of robot says that you can
build all that stuff in there I mean
already you can store pictures in there
you can throw documents and you can do
rich text and it's as long as as a stack
thing is let's maybe talk afterwards and
it's all yours okay thanks Lars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
