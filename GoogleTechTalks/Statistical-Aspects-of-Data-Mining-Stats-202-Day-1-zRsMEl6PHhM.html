background about what's going on here if
you haven't figured it out from the
email so this is a class called
statistical aspects of data mining I'm
teaching it at Stanford this summer
today was the first day at Stanford just
like today is the first day here
basically I just had the idea that I'm
teaching the course at Stanford anyway
it seems like something that might be of
interest to two people here at Google so
I work here at Google and I just teach
the class at Stanford so I thought well
since I'm going to come to work every
day after I teach the class why don't I
just go ahead and teach it here and so
people that are interested can sort of
sit here at Google and take the class
here because of that sort of the slides
and everything you see is basically the
exact same as the slides that I'm
presenting when I'm at Stanford so some
of the things like for example number
four up here the fourth thing we did at
Stanford today was I took pictures of
the students so I could have pictures of
them obviously I'm not going to take
pictures of you because your pictures
are all in MoMA etc so there's going to
be certain things that obviously don't
apply to you and you just sort of have
to be a little bit patient with that but
for the most part I'm going to follow
exactly the script from what I do is
Stanford and to that and the outline for
today is basically to go over the
information on the course web page run
through chapter one on the textbook I'll
talk about the textbook and then talk
about the software that we're going to
be using for this class and how you can
go about getting it so if there unless
there's any sort of pressing questions
before we begin I'm going to start going
through these these slides question in
the back okay so is that better okay
I'll try and stay close to the
microphone um and I'll just try and
speak loudly when I walk over to the
board if you can't hear me
let me know yeah but they said this is
just for recording for the video
conferencing so maybe we can figure out
how to get that to work over the speaker
yeah textbook yes we'll talk about that
right off the bat
okay so textbook textbook okay this is
available on Amazon for about 80 bucks
it's called well I'll show you on the
web page it's called introduction to
data mining authors are tan Steinbach
Kumar we're trying to order some copies
for you guys but there's no way we're
going to have an
so if you come next time I may have some
to give you via some lottery system but
you can go ahead and order it online if
you haven't already it's a good book to
get if you want to just sort of you know
hope your office Mabel order one you
guys can share and but it's a good book
to get and we are going to be following
it quite closely and I'll talk more
about it in a second if there's only one
Edition and I've been told there may be
a paperback available if you're trying
to save money but there's only one
Edition as far as I know part of me yes
the authors are tan Steinbeck and Kumar
and I'll show you where that's up on the
webpage okay so the first thing to talk
about is the web page it's wwsz 202 calm
if you ever forget this if you remember
my last name and look at my last name on
Google you'll find my home page and then
it's linked from my home page but
basically stats 202 calm will have all
the information now again this is the
information for the students at Stanford
but it will be relevant to you and so if
you just go see dub dub dub stats - OH -
dot-com and so this is what the web page
looks like now some things are not
relevant to you you don't care about the
current grades right those are the
grades for the students at Stanford
homework and exam solutions you might
care about right because I'm going to
give homework assignments if you want to
play along and do them you know the
solutions then will be up there
obviously we're not going to grade them
but there might be you know something
extra you can do and then the homework
assignments like I said they'll be
linked from here if you want to do them
it's up to you and I will be posting
solutions for the student at Stanford
lecture 1 is linked here these are just
the PowerPoint slides I have so those
will be up there and apply the most
important thing on the stats 202 comm
what webpage is the course information
if you click there you go to this pink
page and it has so you know don't use
this email use my Google email of course
I'm also you know the email let me um in
case any of you don't know it let me
write it down this is a data mining one
word no underscore over seven at
google.com
that's the email I set up you should
have got an email to that already if you
signed it I signed up basically everyone
on the trick spreadsheet so you should
have got an email to that already if
you're not it's public you can go into
mailman and add yourself to that phone
that's my cell phone it's in MoMA office
hours don't pertain to you ta don't
bother the TA webpage Tetsuo to calm
okay yeah he would get really confused
okay so the textbook we were talking
about there are the author's names right
there tan Steinbach Kumar introduction
to data mining like I said I think it
retails somewhere between 60 and 80
dollars so go ahead and get yourself a
copy of that or find someone else who's
going to have a copy of it and agree to
share it I said we are going to try and
get some but it'll have to be a lottery
because there's no way we have enough
for everyone that's going to be in the
room
course description okay so this is the
Stanford generic catalog description so
data mining is used to discover patterns
and relationships and data emphasis is
on large complex data sets such as those
in very large databases or through web
mining topics are going to be decision
trees we will talk about neural networks
will talk about Association rules which
if you're coming from a stats background
like I am that something new we will
talk about it
clustering you've seen before no doubt
case based methods and data
visualization and then we're going to
basically follow the textbook pretty
closely so first chapters introduction
just sort of a soft introduction I'm
going to go over that today second
chapter is on data basically types of
data importing data caveat about data
we'll talk about that for about two
lectures chapter three is exploring data
and for those of you who know me I love
to make plots of data and and so I think
that's very important even though a lot
of people think it's trivial so we'll
spend I think at least three lectures on
chapter three talking about different
ways of summarizing data through graphs
and tables and chapter 6 then
Association analysis basic concepts and
algorithms I have a break right there
because that's when the students at
Stanford are going to be taking a
midterm if you want I can you know email
you guys the midterm if you want you
know to sort of quiz yourself what it
might mean practically for us is before
chapter between chapter 6 and 4 we might
have a day where we don't where we don't
meet or we might use it as a catch-up if
for some reason we don't get through
because we are only meeting for an hour
where is it Stanford they're meeting for
an hour and 15 minutes chapters 4 &amp;amp; 5
are both on classification that's sort
of one of my favorite areas so we're
going to spend you know a good amount of
time on chapters four or five and then
finally we'll finish with chapter eight
which is the cluster analysis evaluation
you don't care about either the late
assignments you don't care about
technology you do care about so
basically we're going to be using R and
Excel okay so if you have a PC that sort
of makes your life easy because Excel is
probably installed on your PC and R is
of course a free download that's
available for PC it's available for Mac
and you know there is an are users email
list maybe I'll send that around to you
and with a link for how to UM install R
depending on what your linux platform is
I don't really keep up with it because I
tend to use are more on my Windows
machine but I know that we have
installations for Linux and I just
haven't really kept up with it so maybe
I'll try and send around a pointer to
you guys for that
I'll run through today briefly how to
install R on Windows and then maybe from
there you can sort of extrapolate and
figure out how to install it on Linux
but mainly we're going to be using R
with a little bit of Excel which Excel
for those of you who aren't familiar is
just a real simple spreadsheet
application that works well with small
data academic honesty you don't care
about so that's that's all the UM that's
all the information on the web page so
go ahead and use you know stats to
to.com as your reference for things in
this class just remember that the web
page is designed for the students at
Stanford so the obvious things you know
don't pertain to you and you know for
example right don't email me at Stanford
I you email me at at google.com
all I wanted to say about the web page
are there any questions about anything I
said so far about the web page yes
it's a master's level class but it's an
intro class and there's an upper there's
a higher level class there's a 300 class
for those of you who are familiar with
the Stanford curriculum so it sort of
necessarily keeps this at an intro level
which is which I think is good for us
because a lot of us are sort of you know
this is our first time seeing some of
this stuff if this isn't your first time
seeing some of this stuff that might you
know you might think well this might be
too basic for me so sort of pick and
choose when you come or what lectures
you watch on the lectures are being
videotaped they are available on fish so
those of you who don't want to sit here
would rather just sit on your PC and
watch it there so in your machine and
watch it there then you know they are
going to be up on fish any other
questions about anything I said so far
okay so moving on so the the textbook
again we start with chapter one is just
a real soft introduction to what we're
going to be doing in this class but it
is sort of interesting when I said I was
going to teach this class on data mining
the first thing my officemate asked me
you know he said well what is data
mining I said well I'll be able to tell
you that by the time I'm done teaching
the class well hopefully you know by the
end of today we'll be able to say
something intelligent not what is data
mining so the definition in your
textbook it says on the process of
automatically discovering useful
information in large data repositories
and there's many other definitions so
let me just sort of dissect this a
little bit and sort of you know I come
from stats the question is how is data
mining different from statistics well I
think that the easiest one right is is
the notion of large right the fact that
the data set is large so one way you
could define data mining as well it's
statistics with large data sets okay but
there's there's more than that right
there's this idea that I'm automatically
discovering useful information you know
again what does automatically mean well
you know you're not going to write a
script that's going to do all the
analysis for you and tell you hey I
looked at your data and you know you
should be aware that you know there's
some problem with this variable or
there's something strange going on here
right it's not going to be completely
automatic but it's sort of more
automatic than statistics right so in
statistics you might say you know what I
really want to analyze these two
variables and see you know what the
correlation is between them bla bla bla
and data mining you might say look I
have a thousand predictors in this data
set
I want to look at all pairwise
correlations and I want to get an
automatic email every time two of those
correlations goes above a certain value
for example so on some level it's more
automated and and then stats but of
course it's not like a magic thing that
does all the work for you and then the
final aspect I was just going to mention
is discovering useful information right
I mean obviously there's a lot of data
out there and the goal of data mining is
to see if there's anything useful there
and actually one last aspect of this
definition I want to mention is the last
part where it says the data is in large
data repositories right so it doesn't
just say large datasets it says large
data repository so you think of a
repository as some place where data just
accumulates right you didn't necessarily
collect it it's just there right so web
logs are an example right I mean the dad
is just there whether or not you're
going to get any use out of it is up to
you like a whole bunch of other examples
we'll have credit card transactions
Supermarket data the data isn't really
being collected for any specific reason
but it's it's sort of hard to not
collect it the data just sort of
accumulates naturally so the question is
given all this data is there can we find
any useful information in it and that's
quite different from statistics where in
statistics you often say you know what
I'm going to go out and collect data
specifically to answer a specific
question whereas in data mining you're
accumulating the data and the question
is can I find anything useful in this in
this data okay so then I say there are
many other definitions and on the next
slide I say so find a different
definition and see how it compares the
previous slide so this is sort of a fun
exercise to sort of look through and see
what other people say is data mining and
the first thing that you'll notice is
that you know the authority right
Wikipedia it doesn't give one definition
it gives two which already suggests to
you that there's some you know
non-uniform standard for what is data
mining so the first definition is
non-trivial extraction of implicit
previously unknown and potentially
useful information from data and the
other is the science of extracting
useful information from large data sets
or data bases so that second definition
which I think that's a stat reference
right yeah David hand so that's very
similar to what we had the idea is that
you're looking to see if there's
anything useful the data set is large
and you know basically it's the
the ardor the science of extracting that
the first definition isn't too different
it just says potentially useful
information from the data a little bit
of an admission that sometimes we're not
going to find anything useful
it does say here the first one
non-trivial and I'll talk about that in
a second there's a lot of tasks that you
could say look I'm extracting useful
information from data in an automated
way but it's sort of trivial right so
data mining deals with what we'll call
non-trivial and I'll give you some
examples in a second of what I would
consider trivial and non-trivial and
your textbook talks about those other
definitions so you can sort of see I
think there's a few I clicked on earlier
what is data mining says here generally
data mining sometimes called data or
knowledge discovery is the process of
analyzing data from different
perspectives and summarizing it into
useful information sort of not that good
of a definition I think this one was
pretty close to what we were talking
about let's say there's a what is data
mining somewhere down here yeah data
mining or knowledge discovery is the
computer assisted process of digging
through and analyzing enormous sets of
data and then extracting the meaning of
the data so you see the digging through
is sort of carrying on the the mining
analogy there were a couple more maybe
I'll show you one more of these that I
thought was pretty good um what does
this one say data mining is what
analytic process designed to explore
data usually large amounts of data
typically business or market related in
search of consistent patterns and our
system aggregation search between
variables I think this little
parenthetic statement typically business
or market related is telling and we're
looking at it from from a point of view
of you know we're most of us are
computer scientists and so we're looking
at it from more of a science point of
view but it's really things in industry
and and the market that has driven data
mining that's really where the phrase
comes from and it's sort of one of these
you know catchy trendy words that like
oh that company you know my competitors
doing data mining and I'm not so they're
going to beat me so that's you know
that's where a lot of it comes from it
you know if you're cynical it really is
just well it's statistical techniques or
it's machine learning techniques or just
you know these techniques with a new
word put on them but you know it's sort
of that's how things in business and
market get popularity someone attaches a
to them and so this is basically the
word that's been attached to again as
your textbook says process of
automatically discovering useful
information and large data repositories
now I'll say is an aside so you know
like I said I come from statistics and
my officemate has the same background as
me and he said you know all you really
have here isn't to two ingredients you
know to make a disaster right you have a
lot of data and you don't know what
you're looking for you say you're only
you're only going to get yourself in
trouble well you know you can and you
cannot so we'll talk about some caveats
that you have to be careful about but
generally this is the feel of it you
have a large data set and you're just
looking to see if you can find some
useful information in there and what
what he warns about getting yourself in
trouble is you need to make sure it
really is useful and you're not just
telling yourself some story that's
that's completely artificial so I
mentioned to you on some data mining
tasks aren't really data mining tests
right sometimes you think you're
extracting useful information from a
large data repository but it's not
really considered data mining and that's
because it's too trivial right so here
on the on the left side of the screen
you have some data mining tasks on the
right you have some some non-examples
right so for example looking up a phone
number and a phone directory well that's
extracting useful information if you
want the phone number it's useful to you
the phone directory is a large data set
so you're extracting useful information
relation asset but it's not considered
data mining it's too trivial right an
example of something that would be data
mining would be suppose you you have the
phone book and you start to look for
relationships that you previously didn't
know so for example it says here you see
names like Oh Brian O'Rourke or Riley
occurring more in the Boston area and
you say oh well I didn't really you know
know that but it makes sense to me now
because I sort of know you know how the
different you know people settle in the
United States and I know there's a lot
of people you know Sergent descent in
this area so it makes sense to me and if
you say well that's you know I I knew
that already imagine you know giving it
the phone book from India or from you
know Brazil or a country or not familiar
with and you don't know any of these
names and you start to see how they
cluster in the different regions you
know you're learning something about the
data without really knowing what you're
looking for going in you start to see
this grouping so that would be an
example of data mining on the right here
the second one query a a web search
engine
information about Amazon okay I'm
getting useful information from a large
data set right the web is a large data
set but again that's not data mining
something that would be data mining here
on the Left grouped together similar
documents return to a search engine
according to their context for example
if you thought about you know drawing a
picture of all the web pages that come
back for the query Amazon and sorry if
you can't hear me you start to see two
groups right you start to see here's a
group over here and here's a group over
here okay and you say you know how are
these how are these groups right well
maybe you know users that query Amazon
go to these pages or they go to these
pages but there's very few few users who
query Amazon they go to a page here and
a page here right so these are connected
and these are connected but they're very
split so what have you learned what
you've learned that maybe Amazon has two
different dominant interpretations so
presumably one is the retail site and
the other one is the river and you say
well I knew that already hang on us
again I knew that already you know but
imagine doing it in a language that you
didn't know already or imagine having
some automated process that would tell
you when it query has two dominant
interpretations or when it only has one
main interpretation what is your
question oh just when you when you I
don't avoid it have a black marker it
would be easy yeah if someone can toss
me one I don't really have it where Oh
see I have to search for it okay okay
not that away all right so imagine those
are black okay so that is um that would
be an example of data mining and that's
actually clustering and we'll talk about
that specifically as an example of
clustering okay so I'd mind Anna so the
scientific point of view now I'm going
to talk about the scientific point of
view and the commercial point of view
both of these basically have this flavor
like I'm collecting the data anyway so
there might be some useful information
in it and from a scientific point of
view you're collecting lots of data
examples would be a satellite that has
sensors on it telescopes that look
across the sky micro rays you know a
gene expression data was sort of trendy
a few years back generally you know any
simulation you do you can generate lots
and lots of data I don't need to tell
you no you
guys about collecting lots of data
traditional techniques are infeasible
and so data mining might be helpful in
sort of classifying and segmenting data
or informing hypotheses so that's sort
of the scientific point of view the
commercial point of view you know again
the commercial point of view is really
sort of driving the data mining on some
level data there has been collected from
web data from e-commerce right any time
you use a search engine I don't have to
tell you anytime you buy something from
a site online anytime you go to the
department or a grocery store any time
you use your bank or a credit card so
the data is just there computers are
cheap right you can't say oh we can't
afford to store that much data no
storage is cheap oh we can't afford you
know to analyze that no the you know
processing is cheap and then your
competitors doing it right if you don't
want to do data mining well you can be
certain that your competitor is and if
it's giving them any edge well you know
you're going to get beat out eventually
now the one thing I want to talk about
on this slide which I always thought was
interesting the grocery store example is
sort of the very it's like the classic
defining example of data mining which is
that when you go to the grocery store
they have a record of you know you
bought eggs and you also bought diapers
or you bought milk and you also bought
beer you got chips and you also bought
salt so they have a record of that now
the funny thing is you should think
about is how do they have a record of
that right so if I go to the grocery
store today and I buy chips and I pay
cash I suppose I pay cash don't use my
credit card I'm trying to sort of be off
the grid right so I pay cash and I get
the chips then tomorrow I go oh you know
I forgot the salsa so tomorrow I go and
I buy salsa and I pay cash again what
they don't want to know just that one
person bought chips yesterday and one
person bought salsa today they want to
know that it's me they don't just want
to know what I bought that one know who
I am
so the question I'll ask you is how do
they know who I am if I don't pay with
my credit card yeah you have the little
you know your Safeway save six cents on
gas right they have your little Safeway
card so you can think about it you know
that sure they don't get the data for
free but all they have to do is give you
a little card and let you save three
cents on every purchase or whatever it
is and now they get all the data in the
world right and you know you can opt in
or opt out you don't have to use the
card if you really want to you know
don't want people spying on you
you can just not use the card but it's
not hard for them to get the data and
once they do something like that they
have the data so that type of
Supermarket data where they know each
customer at least their ID and what they
bought is sort of one of the classic
examples of data mining data sets you
know where they use that data to
discover relationships between you know
people who buy this product usually buy
this product now what does that mean for
the grocery store well you know use your
imagination if they often buy these two
products at the same time maybe they
should put them in the same aisle better
yet maybe they can say look let's close
down the whole supermarket and just sell
these two products because we know you
know if we just stock those we can make
this much money things like that so
anyway they have them they have that
data because they give you your little
discount card and they give you the
discount card for other reasons too so
this is sort of a fun exercise I knew I
was going to give this one today so I
started thinking about it as soon as I
woke up so I'll give you four examples
it says here give an example of
something you did yesterday or today
which resulted in data which could
potentially be mine to discover useful
information okay so in black I will
write here the four things that I
thought of and see if I can get you guys
to give me some others that I haven't
thought up so I just literally went from
the time I woke up actually I went from
the time I woke up to the time that I
started teaching and came up with some
some examples so the first thing when I
wake up the door on my apartment doesn't
have a key lock it has this um card
right little white card and goes beep
when you when you open it um so you
think well they're not going to keep
that data right what do they want why
would they want to know that data why
would they want to spy on you that much
well actually when I moved in they told
me they said don't use your card to try
and open someone else's apartment door
because will will let will come after
you
you know will get mad at you and I
thought right away I thought that's kind
of weird right I mean what if I just
take the elevator to the wrong floor and
you know I'm half awake right but you
know presumably they're keeping that
data around or at least they have some
sort of alert system so you wouldn't
think it but you know I'll call that my
apartment apartment door you know
presumably that data is sitting around
somewhere where they know what tenants
try to open what doors at what time
if there's any useful information there
you know they can use it what would you
use that information for I don't know
maybe they want to hire a security guard
and they want to know what sort of
traffic whether people are coming going
maybe maybe they do really want to spine
you I mean they can use the data for
whatever they want right and you're
consenting to it because you're the one
using the card to open and shut your
door you're the one living in their
apartment
okay so then after I open the door what
do I do well I go and I you know hit the
elevator button now that one I'm not
really sure if they're keeping that data
around but I kind of you know I wish
they would because maybe if they had
some intelligent system I wouldn't have
to wait so long for the elevator because
you know what's it doing down there on
the basement when everyone's sleeping
they know that you know it should be
sitting off at the top okay after I go
in the elevator then I the parking
garage has another thing but that's the
same as the apartment door as soon as I
get on Guadalupe expressway there's
metering lights and I wish that they
would use the traffic sensors you know
to do something better about the traffic
right so presumably they could know that
they don't need to turn the metering
lights on 87 when 101 is moving so
quickly so you know they could mine that
data too they know who is driving on the
highway one they don't who's driving
they know how many cars are driving on
the highway at what time they don't
really know who you are although if you
had like the fast track I went over the
bridge they would know who you are right
because it's your fast track and then
finally when I get to Stanford they
don't give me like a nice parking pass
so I have to put money in the in the pay
parking machine and how do they know who
I am I use my credit card and I use the
same credit card every time so these are
you know none of these are related to
Internet applications I'm trying to you
know be a little bit creative all cases
where I'm producing data that someone
could be using to do data mining you
know they're not trying to spy on me
it's just I'm giving them the data it's
it's freely available for them to use
for whatever purpose they want so this
is what in-class exercise number two I
called it so I gave you four how about
you guys give me four yeah Charles feeds
the micro kitchen then we run out of
data right so they have to restock the
micro kitchen they run out so they know
they know what we're eating and what
building we live in right okay so that's
yeah so presumably someone's looking at
this data in the micro kitchen
okay one more in green cellphone right
not only not only right yeah so you can
turn that off right but but not only do
they know who you are who you called
what time you call they also now know
where you are because they have that
little you know GPS location sensor in
there and you know I don't know if
you're a paranoid person this isn't a
good exercise for you but you know but
the dad is there you know they could
ignore it if they want but it's there
and they might find information in it
okay another one in the front my badge
right so someone actually asked me this
one time so let me let me just say this
is my badge right which is a badg which
is similar to similar to my apartment
door but this is you know an employer
right we might have a little more
interest in Who I am and where I'm going
at what time and I have when people ask
me I don't know if they ask you this
when you tell them you work at Google
they say well what time do you start
work and you say well it depends what
time I wake up and things like that and
they say well what time does your boss
tell you you have to be there well you
know whatever and then they say but
certainly you know they know when you
scan your badge and they keep track of
that I'll go I guess they could write
but you know knowing Google they're
likely to use that data but not you know
to spy on us more so to sort of just
keep statistics and just know when they
should stock the micro kitchens I don't
know no one they should serve breakfast
okay so let's get one more one more
yep yep yep
so laptop yeah one time well it doesn't
say 'pete laptop one time I was using a
computer somewhere in an office at the
University and the guy called me and he
said why are you VPN why are you using a
VPN connection I thought who are you to
ask me why am i but he was the
administrator of the network right so um
yes any time you use a computer
people are getting lots of information
about you and you know we have web logs
or Google stats 202 comm we have web
logs from that so one of the things
we're going to be doing is playing with
the T logs for that and it'll be cute
because we can see certain spikes when
certain events happened and I can see
what webpage you go to I don't know who
you are but I know your IP address so so
anyway you know you can think of loads
of examples here of different cases
where you're producing data that if
someone wants to they can mine they can
use it to get information about and help
them to make different decisions um okay
so where does data mining come from so
you know this you can tell this book is
sort of a statistical book because you
see statistics and then you see
everything else what's everything else
well you have artificial intelligence
you have machine learning you have
pattern recognition and some people sort
of put databases and things like that
and information retrieval there too but
you know it is sort of like we're
teaching I'm teaching this course from a
statistics point of view but it's not
just statistics of course it's borrowing
ideas from artificial intelligence
machine learning pattern recognition and
all those traditional techniques when we
say that traditional techniques in a
second bullet its traditional
statistical techniques would be
unsuitable why the data is large not
just large like a lot of observations
but large it's high dimensional and
heterogeneous and distributed right so
there's sort of new challenges for
statistics we coin this phrase data
mining what we're borrowing information
from or borrowing ideas from all these
other areas - okay so the book breaks
down into two types of data mining tasks
and this dichotomy is a little bit
forced in some cases but I'll walk
through it so they differentiate between
predictive methods and descriptive
methods and let me sort of write the
shorthand version of these the one
remember is I guess descriptive methods
don't really have one right answer you
sort of know if you found something
useful because it's useful but you never
really know exactly what you're going
after
whereas predictive methods you're going
to look at your classification accuracy
or your precision in your recall so
those are straightforward so predictive
methods this is predictive what do we
have here it says some variables to
predict unknown or future values of
other variables right so basically we're
trying to predict predict future in some
sense right we're trying to use some
inputs to predict the future
classification of some some output
whereas descriptive methods descriptive
for that we're just basically trying to
find patterns in the data okay find
patterns okay so you know the way to
remember this right is sort of this is
the supervised learning and the
unsupervised learning if you will right
so the example I would I would give you
if you think about the Amazon right with
Amazon I found a pattern right there are
two distinct types of pages about Amazon
there is like the commercial Amazon and
there was the river Amazon so I found
the pattern okay suppose alternatively
that I already
so that would be descriptive I described
a pattern I described that there were
two groups of the Amazon webpages
predictive would be more like I know
that there's two types of Amazon web
pages I know there's the convert ones
about the commercial site and I know
there's ones about the river okay I know
that there's two groups but can I
predict given a new one given a new web
page right can I have a computer
algorithm that will predict which one of
these two classes it falls in and the
way I'm going to measure success there
is how accurate am I going to be able to
predict this right what is my miss
classification right am I going to get
90% of them correct 95% of them correct
etc now it's real easy for a human to
read the web page and say oh this is
about you know Amazon the retailer or
this is about Amazon the the rainforest
but you know can a computer use the
human label observations to get a pretty
accurate rule that's predictive data
mining whereas again I told you
descriptive data mining was just finding
the fact that
two groups in the first place so the
topics that we're going to cover fall
into these two categories as follows so
the book talks about classification and
regression is both being predictive so
let me make this so we'll put here
classification classification and
regression regression both of these is
being predictive now classification
we're going to cover in chapters four
and five regression we're not going to
cover in this course however if you take
a regression so if you take a stats
course they're going to cover regression
really the main difference between these
is classification you're trying to say
you know I said I'm 90% accurate right I
have two classes it's either Amazon the
rainforest or Amazon the river right or
you could have three classes or four
classes or any number of classes and
you're starting trying to see how
accurate you are regression is analogous
to that but so trying to predict a class
you're generally trying to predict a
continuous attribute right so let me
give you an example right so so to
change from a web application this is a
book this is an eraser you can tell
these apart right suppose you send like
sonar signals right and bounce the sonar
signals off the book and the sonar
signals off the eraser well they're
going to look different right and so
classification would be to use those
sonar signals and the some labeled
instances some labeled instances of the
books and labeled instances of the
eraser and predict for new cases whether
it's a book or an eraser right that's
classification I'm trying to predict
it's the book class or is it the eraser
class right just like is that the Amazon
rainforest class or the Amazon what
commercial class regression would be
more like can I use the sonar to predict
the size of the book right so you don't
just either get it right or wrong if you
say the book is 11 inches tall and it's
really 10.5 inches tall you're off by
exactly 0.5 so classification you're
basically trying to predict what class
it is or as regression you're trying to
predict some continuous attribute and so
you would measure your performance a
little bit differently classification
you might use recall precision or miss
classification rate regression you might
use like squared error loss l1 loss some
sort of loss function like that that
measures how close you are to the target
we're again we're not going to cover
regression classification is more common
in data mining but regression gets a lot
of attention in classical stats courses
and also a lot of the classification
techniques you can extend a regression
we're just not going to get into them
okay then for descriptive the
visualization we're going to cover in
Chapter three Association analysis and
six clustering and eight and anomaly
detection is in Chapter ten although
we're not going to get to it so let me
just say a few words about these so
visualization visualization is in
Chapter three
visualization as I said before it's it's
one of the most important things you're
going to do if you think about writing a
report or doing some study people are
going to remember the picture right if
you can't tell it with one simple
picture you probably haven't really said
anything interesting and there's sort of
an art in making good pictures and
making pictures that people can see
clearly and so we're going to spend a
fair amount of time in Chapter three
just talking about different ways to
visualize data and visualization can be
two purposes right one is to present to
someone okay you you know what you want
to say and this is just a good way to
present it and the other is to learn
something yourself you don't know what
you're looking for if you're just going
to look at a bunch of pictures you're
going to look at one picture that's
going to tell you what's going on so you
can discover both of those are
visualization tasks they're both
descriptive and we'll talk about those
in chapter 3 Association analysis
Association analysis this is something
that doesn't really make it into
mainstream stats too much we're going to
talk about that in Chapter six this one
is the classic supermarket one right the
people that bought the people that
bought diapers often bought beer right
the people that bought chips often
bought Sal salsa this is the type of
Association analysis and we're going to
talk about that in Chapter six in
particular that Market Basket example I
just talked about clustering chapter
eight clustering okay clustering example
the canonical example there would be
like the Amazon search engine versus the
Amazon rainforest right you see two
distinct groups emerge you know some
things go
and of course that example examples
trivial but suppose I give you a query
in a language you don't know can you
tell me you know what sort of pattern
there are in those web pages are there
two main interpretations is there one
dominant interpretation and one slightly
less common interpretation so you're
just sort of looking for four patterns
and the data and grouping is one pattern
and that type of grouping is called
clustering news stories right can you
can you group together different news
stories these are about sports these are
about politics can you see different
groups emerging in the data even without
having labels on them so it's
unsupervised it's it's clustering and
then finally anomaly detection we're not
going to have time to get to but you
might want to read about it in only 1l
right you might want to read about it in
chapter 10 when we do chapter 3 we'll do
some of it um because when we make
pictures of data sometimes that's
exactly what we're looking for things
that are strange anomaly detection is
probably you know as I say Association
analysis is one of the classic examples
of data mining anomaly detection is one
of the ones that gets all the press
because shoot I had a news story I don't
know if I can find it you know you
always see data mining in the news
because they're using it for purposes of
you know credit card fraud detection and
they're using it to find terrorists
right and both of these things are
anomalies right so what is a credit card
fraud right someone you know you have
your credit card and all of a sudden you
spent a whole bunch of money in a place
that you've never been before that's an
anomaly their credit card flags that the
sooner they can fly get the more money
they can save so that's anomaly
detection with respect to credit cards
with respect to terrorists what are they
looking for strange behavior right
something that's that's indicative of a
terrorist now you could argue well in
that case maybe this should be up here
because you're trying to see how
accurately you can you know spot the
terrorists but you know that's why I
said this line is a little bit blurry
but your textbook tends to classify
anomaly detection as descriptive because
you don't really know exactly what
you're looking for okay that's all the
chapter 1 notes I want to talk about now
I'm going to talk a little bit about the
software but let me stop and see if
there's questions question so we end up
giving yet more
divining meal because every time we're
planning the trip we have before every
credit card company that we will be
mining stuff abroad right yes so they
really the question is if you don't want
your credit card to sort of you know
call you and cancel your card because
they see something weird some people
will call the credit card company ahead
of time and tell them look I'm going to
be traveling overseas but then the point
is that they can also use that data to
you know feed into the data mining
framework yet some people will do that
um some people every time they're going
to travel they let their credit card
company know ahead of time because they
don't want any problems actually a
friend who's a pilot who uses cash only
which is surprising in this day and age
but for that very reason he doesn't want
to call the credit card company every
time he goes somewhere and you know he
does flights that look as though they're
anomalies right so anyway any other
questions anything I've said so far
before I talk about software question
okay so what your question is what's the
difference between clustering and
classification okay so they're very
similar clustering is unsupervised
classification is supervised so the
thing is let's see let's go with the
webpage example right with the Amazon
Amazon right in one case I have all the
label all the two instances labeled this
one is about the rainforest this one is
about the e-commerce company and I'm
trying to predict for a new observation
which one it is and I'm going to measure
how accurately I'm doing that's that's
classification that's predictive I want
to see how well I can predict a new
observation into these two classes okay
clustering on the other hand is the act
of actually discovering that there are
two classes because I didn't know that
ahead of time I was just looking at a
bunch of different queries looking at
how things grouped together and I saw
two distinct groups emerge for for
Amazon now the clustering is you don't
really know you're right you know are
there really two groups well in this
case you do but you you're just sort of
trying to discover a relationship so
does is that good is there anyone else
that can give a better definition than I
just gave there's a lot of people in
this room are experts on machine
learning and they can tell you
supervised learning on supervised
learning in the diff but that's that
sort of my take on it it's a little it
can be a little bit blurry
especially after you do the clustering
if you say oh I really did learn
something that was right that you know
it sends
have a little bit of a classic
classification feel but that should help
okay other questions yes yes to a large
degree to a large degree and there's
some subtle differences and you can you
can read about that but yeah generally
an anomaly is an outlier and vice versa
generally speaking yeah an outlier you
can sort of see the word outlier
something that lies out a restaurant
away from the rest of the data it's an
outlier so in some space and anomaly is
an outlier but the key might be to find
that space other questions about things
that I've said so far
right right so so Charles was making a
point about the relationship between
outliers and anomalies I don't want to
get too much into that distinction but
but yeah there's a relationship and some
subtle differences other questions on on
what I said anything I've said so far
okay so let me see how are we doing here
so okay we're doing good on time so like
I said Stanford this is an hour and 15
minutes but here we're trying to stay
under an hour obviously so I go a little
bit faster and skip a few things that
don't matter for you guys okay so what
are we using in here we're using Excel
and we're using our now Excel if you
have a PC you're in good shape if you
don't you know I don't know tricks
probably won't give you everything you
need you know no offense you know but
it's just not the same product
OpenOffice might give you everything you
need but if you have a PC you're in good
shape if you have a Mac I'm sure Excel
is installed on there if you don't have
either of these if you're sort of a just
a strict Linux user I don't know I could
I can't really speak to OpenOffice but
it might it might get you through most
of it but we are going to be using excel
not primarily right excel isn't very
powerful it doesn't handle large data
it's very slow it's you know but for
some purposes it's good and it is good
to sort of have a spreadsheet
application sort of that you're
comfortable with because sometimes you
can do things very quickly that you know
you don't really want to take the time
to script up so so we doing some things
in Excel and so you should have access
to that but then primarily we're going
to be using R which is free if you have
Windows I'll go through how to install
it on a Windows machine right now the
same installation instructions will
generally hold for the Mac and for Linux
like I said I'm going to try and send
you guys a link to something on the
something I can get from the our users
which talks about installation but
different people do different
installations depending on what they're
doing and so I haven't really kept up
with it but let me take you through our
and give you a little preview of that
and show you how to get it installed on
your Windows machine I have a Windows
machine right here obviously so I'm
going to whether I go through examples
I'll be doing it on the Windows machine
so you know you might if you have a
Windows laptop just install are on that
and use that for going through examples
also it's easy you can bring it with you
and you can sort
play along as you're sitting here okay
so how do i download our so you go to
this webpage right it's it's some sort
of a little bit tricky for a while on
google if you just you know query to are
you wouldn't get it I think you can now
but let's just go to cran um let's see
there we go okay so we're going to be
good with them you know I have a Windows
machine so I'd just hit Windows 95 or
later and then base so it's a open
source and different people contribute
different packages if we need anything
special I'll let you know but for now
base is going to do the trick and then
if I go down to this one here this is a
self-extracting
exe file it says I have to get it from a
mirror near me but it turns out if I
click on this late right now the
behavior is it's just going to give me
one and I can just save it then you
double click go through all the defaults
let everything as it is is going to be
fine and it will get you are and once
you do all that you can see what it
looks like here let me let me just run
through those screenshots again so these
are up on the PowerPoint slides if you
sort of forget what I said so go to
crayon our project org
and for me I would click on Windows 95
and later just click here on base and
then two point five point oh I think I
have a two point four version the
version shouldn't matter too much if
it's you know within the last year you
save this to your machine and then it
will just install itself and all the
defaults are pretty good once you do
that okay you get something that looks
like this so here I have actually two
point four point one on my machine and
it's sort of command line right it's not
a spreadsheet at its f it's sort of
command line let me see if I can make
this a little bit bigger for you so you
can see let's change the font size from
10 to try 20 that's too big probably
right looks like a cartoon okay so um
you know it's sort of my online right I
can do ten plus one and figure out that
that's 11 okay you have functions in
here right so let's see let's think
about it easy func
exp is exponential e to the 0 is 1 okay
so you functions you can look for help
on the function so I want to like help
on the exp function if I type question
mark in any function it brings up a
window and tells me you know that this
is log computes natural logarithms log
10 computes okay and it gives you some
examples so the help is pretty good and
you can look things up online because
there's a lot of documentation so it
sort of has command line you can write
your own functions you can you know sort
of use it as a little bit of a scripting
language but also it's really good for
plotting right so if you type like okay
well sequence 1 comma 10 is the integers
1 through 10 so if I made a plot of well
here here I'll just show you so let's X
let X be the sequence 1 through 10 and
if I plot suppose like X comma let's say
X plus 10 then I get a plot right and
you get to change sort of almost
everything you can change on this spot
you can change the plotting symbol you
can change the font you can change the
color you can make it clickable you can
label things so the plotting in ours is
really good and it gives you a lot of
nice tool for making plots very quickly
and we'll go through a lot of that when
we get to chapter 3 but I think in the
meantime go ahead and make sure that you
have a machine where you can it you can
use R and get it working and next time
when I get into chapter 2 I'm going to
go through some example data sets and
we'll talk about you know manipulating
them in R and Excel a little bit but let
me just take you know the last minute
here and see if there's sort of any
questions so I'll just run through in
case you missed at the beginning the
whole point here is that this class you
know I'm teaching it at Stanford so it's
not too much extra effort for me to come
here and teach it here it is being
videotaped so you can watch all these
you know on your on your machine at your
desk
it's an hour even though Stanford
classes an hour 15 minutes and you know
you're you can sign up on mail man
you're welcome to come to any lectures
you want everyone's invited
this is the textbook we'll try and you
know distribute some of these next time
but there won't be enough will have to
do by lottery so go ahead and buy one go
to WWF
- OH - dot-com for all the information
about the course and make sure you
subscribe to the data mining o7 at
Google comm and so I think that's all
the organizational information we're
going to meet Tuesdays and Fridays from
1:00 to 2:00 I can't think of anything
else that I might have said let me just
stop and ask if there's any organization
questions or anything yeah question
no actually I mean I asked about this
and they said like well you can but you
have to go through another process so
this is the biggest room the Google edu
folks had and so the machine learning
you talk to a lot of attrition yeah so
we hope that a lot of you we hope that
mister because you're sitting on the
floor that's I can talk to the Google
edu folks about that I mean they've been
extremely helpful it was sort of a
challenge to estimate the attendance and
we knew the tricks was an overestimate
and we didn't know with the
videoconferencing how many people would
actually want to come and I think I
still don't know how many people
actually want to come right I think
we'll know more on Friday I think if
we're still over overflow overflowing on
Friday then we can you can really try
and see if we can do something better
than having people sit on the floor
other organizational questions no other
organizational questions okay hey
there's free lunch in the cafeteria</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
