coming my name is Matt time it's my
pleasure to introduce Jonathan Cohen who
has been doing woodworking and furniture
building for 40 years now
I actually met Jonathan a few years ago
when I moved into my house in
Wallingford he lives across the street
and you know we were chatting you know
talking about what do you do and and you
know he says I will I build furniture it
just so happened my wife and I at the
time we're thinking about getting some
new furniture and we said well would you
be at all interested in you know
building a Media Center for us and and
so you know after spending some time
talking about this you know we met at
the coffee shop and you know discussed
his work and everything like that it was
just fascinating learning so much from
him about you know the process in the
artistry of building furniture from
scratch it's not something I've ever
thought about you know my my experience
with furniture building is mainly IKEA
and you know over the course of several
months you know it was amazing to watch
this this massive wingait wood the media
center that Jonathan built for us
materialized and get to see it through
all the stages of its development
because this workshop is his garage and
while in Wallingford and then then came
the fateful evening when we got to bring
it over to our place and you know we how
are we going to get it over there well I
guess you know we can kind of put it on
this dolly here and we go over to pick
the thing up and it weighs like
literally 800 pounds or something I mean
we could barely lift it let alone get it
up the stairs we nearly destroyed it
trying to get it into my living room but
fortunately I survived and it's there to
this day and getting plenty of abuse
from the kids so it's a my pleasure to
introduce Jonathan and I guess as we go
along if you have questions let me know
and I'll have a mic we're recording the
talk we're gonna put it externally as
well as part of the google Tech Talk
series so let me make sure I give you
the microphone so that your question can
get onto the video thanks and Jonathan
take it away thank you man hello thank
you all for coming actually don't do
this for a living so if it seems a
little clumsy bear with me although I
will say I taught at the University of
Washington came over here in the design
department and I do talk about my work
occasionally but this
a rather intimidating audience health
I'm managing I was thinking about this
last night I was thinking you know you
see all these guys getting trophies
you're going out in front of everybody
and they always say it's an honor for me
to be here and I think maybe it's just
me but I think what they're really
thinking is it's an honor for you people
that I'm here but I don't think that's
the case here I really do feel quite
honored that you guys would take the
time and and everybody out in video that
would listen to what I have to say
because this is my life's work
Matt overshot the runway by a couple of
years it's been 38 years but this is
what I've done my whole life and
interesting ly enough I didn't really
plan to I'd actually plan to go back to
law school because I like to read but I
had this sort of Epiphany but I had this
vision of myself going in getting to law
school if I could pass the bar if I
could get hired if I could and then then
we're gonna stick me in this little
corner office right new guy and I'd have
oak Formica desk and I said no I'm
making well not any and silver and then
I figured the next thing is the clients
start coming and say well I don't know
what you know about the law but could
you make me a desk so I figured I just
take the short cut start making thank
you furniture that's that's actually
true that's for how I became a furniture
maker and I and I I really thought it
would keep me interested for two or
three years I mean I can't imagine
there's anybody sitting here right now
who isn't it pretty jacked up and pretty
excited about what you do it's it's it's
it's brainy invigorating stuff and I
thought this might have that effect on
me for a couple years but we just don't
said it's about thirty-eight years and I
still find it kind of amazing and I hope
that passion will come through I hope to
infect you with a little bit of it but
the other thing I did before I came down
I saw a little bit but just some words I
wanted to say immediately I'm just gonna
go into showing pictures of the work and
I encourage you to interrupt me or at
least let me know you'd like to say
things and everything's on the table in
fact there's some things here on the
table for you as well later but
everything's on the table what a perfect
analogy for euphemism for now you can
ask whatever you want you can ask if I
was wearing Crocs you can ask if I just
won the Super Bowl you can ask what a
piece costs the questions
tend to be slightly more of a technical
nature and I love those and why I chose
the wood with wit and anything you want
to ask the names of it it's all fair
game but I didn't want to read this one
little blurb I wrote because for me it
really is about let's see if I can do
this to me it really is about the wood
there's a piece of ebony with silver
inlay in it and what I really hope you
take from this or you enjoy about this
is not really that much about me but I
hope you will get what Matt seem to
either grasp or already have our grasp
immediately like he tends to just this
sort of in fact over the years the
nYSSA's kind of vulgar to some people
but I mean it to be very visceral I
caught the wtp factor and that stands
for wet the pants that means if you walk
in and you don't do this there's really
no purpose and hired me because you can
go to Ikea as matt said or you can even
go one of those middle-class furniture
stores that mark the half that marked up
the price is horrifically don't give you
much but if my choice of woods in
materials and maybe a little bit of my
design working with it doesn't make you
do this there's there's really no point
luckily there's enough people that do
this too it's been good but it's really
about the wood to me and I wrote maybe
something of an homage
I'll read it real quickly if you'll
permit me Wood is an imperfect material
which to my way of thinking makes it the
perfect material it is far more fickle
and tempestuous than either metal or
glass or clay for example these tend to
have somewhat predictable tones rather
foreseeable densities and movements and
when working with them nearly calculable
results a piece of steel produced in
Pittsburgh is nearly indistinguishable
from a piece made in a shower or in
Prague but wood even if it comes from
the opposite side of the same tree often
varies greatly in hue and in density and
in temperament that word temperament
will come back the other materials are
like a companion who is well
companionable but wood is like a dance
partner with flashing eyes and while
the athletic movements who can explode
off the walls and then mellow to soft
billeted movements working in those
other inert materials leaves one
satisfied with wood the end result is
much more akin to exaltation just ask
yourself would you prefer to dine with
someone special over cold glass or hard
steel or abrasive clay all rolled out by
a machine or would it be more sensuous
experience over silky smooth warm
sumptuously figure timber
hand planed and polished to perfection
people are like wood infinitely variable
and therein lies the beauty but this is
just my objective opinion I actually
don't need that that is points if
anybody would for some reason like those
you're welcome to them and other than
that I've got no prepared notes or
anything I need to say except for really
to answer any questions and hopefully
explain articulately what we're looking
at here let me do this so I start
generally when I talk about my work I am
NOT a cabinet maker this is not a
distinction that I can imagine makes
makes any difference to anybody but me
cabinet makers to me make cabinets
cabinets are generally by their very
nature boxes and I'm thinking holy cow
thirty-eight years of making boxes I
tend to like furniture pieces which to
me are more like desks and chairs and
and anything that's not a box really and
a lot of guys who can do one can do the
other but I like to think of myself as a
furniture maker and perhaps even a
furniture maker slash designer that's my
training I studied graphic design at
Cornell centuries ago and it sort of
morphed into this but the the nicest
thing about tables for me and specially
small tables is they have they make the
least demands they they are oops sorry I
should probably start off with one of
them they make the least demands they
need to do the least functionally I
don't have to stuff napkins or
toothbrushes or
so we're already or Inc blotters into
these things they are really just a
surface that you can work with and the
smaller the surface the more freedom I
have as a designer and I bring this
piece up first because one I'm fond of
it too and you'll probably hear this
reference during the discussion today
about calligraphy a lot I trained as a
calligrapher and actually talked for a
while and so I didn't plan it this way
but I realized as I design to me a lot
of my work has calligraphic elements in
it which i i'm delighted they they
showed up like this this tables actually
called the halberd wing table it's the
first of only I'd probably book 500
pieces in my my career this is one of I
think three perhaps four pieces that
actually has a person's name attached to
it for a lot of reasons he's a very it
was a very very wealthy collector and he
asked for a piece in fact if I can
digress for a minute it's kind of a
funny story because I was about 23 or 24
I had just opened my studio and this man
called me and I knew who he was
and I knew how important this Commission
could be to my career and I did
something which I don't
characteristically do I froze up I was a
little overwhelmed with how important I
thought this piece and this man might be
and I just couldn't come up with
anything for a while and finally one day
I said you know something Jonathan
that's like not even standing up at the
plate sorry sorry for the support
technology but I mean you're not even
swinging for crying out loud so I did
something that to this day I can't
explain I actually pick up the phone
remember the kind with the little
pigtails and I called him and I said mr.
Hogg this is Jonathan he said I was by
example doing he's not only a big guy he
was a big guy and I said oh it's great I
got something right here I think you'll
like I had nothing I had no notes in for
me I had no ideas I don't know why I
said I just I said he says great bring
it down tomorrow we'll take a look at it
and and I have a photographic memory I
can tell you the shirt I was wearing
that day is about 35 years ago and I
remember I had the phone to my right ear
and as I lowered the phone down what is
that motion ticket 310 three-quarters of
a second something into three quarters
of a second from my ear to the cradle I
saw I saw the table exactly like that it
it just I'm not saying it's a great
design or not but that's what I got from
it and he saw it and he liked it and I
built it the original one here is made
out in booyah which is a South American
one which is quite beautiful they call
it South American walnut but it's much
more mysterious and then the three
risers are made out of Ebony this the
only table I've made like this have made
the wing table several times but I make
it the way I prefer to which is I make
it out of a black ink black wood like
Wayne game or East Indian rosewood wood
like that and then the three risers are
in white Hawley and they're made to look
I mean most people's walls and most of
their houses are white it's made to look
like the top that's just floating with
no support then the interesting thing
about this piece well number of things
but that piece I over the course the
next ten years that piece result in
being about almost a million dollars
worth of commissions nobody ever saw the
piece it went to his house that photo
which wasn't a portfolio here resulted
in about a million dollars worth of
commissions in the next year's and no
those aren't Google figures but those
are Jonathan Cohen fine woodworking
figures that listed and again not the
money really it was just this you know
as a person who designs and signs and
puts the names the reaffirmation of the
affirmation of the respect I thought
came from it was very heady stuff for me
and most of my major clients in the last
25 years have referred to that piece as
as the one that that interested them in
my work so I'm pretty fond of that and
he does anybody have any questions at
this point or any about way things were
curved or woods or things like that oh
I'm really curious how you got the the
slight Bend on the two ends well
that's actually about 50% of the work in
the whole table that bad I been almost
everything I can I don't think it will
take most people very long and then with
this group with the firepower the
intellectual firepower and power you
figured out before you saw the photos
but I don't particularly like straight
lines in much of what's written about me
or that I write I talk about the
elements being straight lines pulled in
detention so for example this is not
straight this has got about 5/8 of
abandoning the top line is straight and
the bottom has the slightest slightest I
don't use the word curve I don't like
curve curve to me is heavy-handed and
goopy and obvious and these are like I
say it's almost like the material was
elastic and I pulled it and it stretches
and that has a bunch of interesting
effects one does it takes twice as much
time to do it but mostly the piece has
become in a more subliminal way they
become more organic because what you see
here is when things are thinner here
they're by their nature generally
thicker here and that's the way that
human bodies built that's the way trees
are built that's a lot of other things
in nature are built they're built where
you put more mass and strength or you
need it you don't need it in certain
places and so again these these are not
too hard to miss that they're they're
bending they're also tapering a quarter
of an inch and you'll see other pieces
right Bend and taper because I just love
this sort of you know almost balletic
I'm on point kind of feel to it so
repeat your question for me so I make
sure I answer this there's much like how
you did that oh the one curve here with
me and to me just I think in my
portfolio it says and I've always used
this phrase I don't like squatty
earthbound furniture I like to be
uplifting and light and to me just to
put those almost wingtips in and tend to
lift it was the way to do that and what
I do actually is I take the chunk of
wood if I can get a board is why there's
the table and these tables are around
twelve or thirteen inches deep
it's you can see the proportions and the
scale of it straight on them but the top
is only 13 inches wide and I take my
bandsaw and I tighten it very carefully
and I sharpen the blade and then make
one cut just by eye down in fact the saw
blade is doing this perpendicular to the
picture and I just could make that cut
and then I take my hand planes and the
most influential tool in my life has
been a plane called a compass plane
I'm guessing much do you know what a
hand plane is this one actually has a
curved sole and you can actually turn a
screw and you can change the arc and
from concave to convex in the same plane
and I you it's over all my work so that
actually I take a curve soul plane that
has to be razor-sharp it's super
accurate and I just come down and come
and playing this down here it's all done
by hand
ninety percent of what I do by hand or
more so let's go back know and I'm going
to go through these a lot quicker so I
don't waste your time too much and then
that's a detail of that same piece it
was supposed to have sort of a pottery
sort of almost archaeological feeling
that's why I chose that wood Oh
Matt said I can do this oh yeah I
promise he's a cursor okay this is just
another little what I call wisp of the
table just these tables tend to feel
beautiful little spaces you're always a
little bit too wide this kind of narrows
it down and defines it this they're
called sofa Hall tables in my my lexicon
this is just there's another version of
the Ring table done for the son-in-law
of the original client this is done in
bubinga and blue Binga is one of my
favorite words to use you'll see a lot
of it it's sort of a blood-red wood with
more life than you could imagine
and it weighs pretty similar to what a
piece of marble of the same size would
weigh whenever I had a personal piece
simple being the reaction is always oh
my god and it drops it's got this
incredible weight to it and it's a
beautiful wood besides I'd love to say
the name well-being got thought of
naming my first kid buu Benjamin I
didn't this is one of a series I did
that were tables that were supposed to
have sort of an Egyptian feel this is
made out of East Indian rosewood which
Matt and I have talked about is because
of the Martin guitar company is now
embargoed in this country and you have
to be goal certificated and so forth I
actually have a little bit of it I
bought 20 years ago so if it interests
you let me know sorry this is another
table that had kind of an interesting
boost in my career and generate a lot of
interest Matt actually has a version in
Cherry it's called the deer leg table to
the fellow who asked about the curve in
that the top of that one that winged
table the legs here seemed to insuring
people's to try to its most of my work
is not meant to be secretive or elusive
it's meant to be incredibly non elusive
but but you know understood but that leg
seems to confuse people and when we're
off the record I'll tell you how it made
it actually I'd say it on the record
doesn't undo there's a detail of the leg
and booyah the other would I sometimes
make it in this is a piece I enjoy this
is called the signature table and it's a
Macassar ebony with silver and very
similar to the leg mats piece you'll see
that this piece comes down you can see
the bend and if you notice it also
tapers in the combination of the bend
and taper make it quite difficult to
make but I think the result is just so
much more dynamic and mu and pretty
that's called the signature table just
because that that leg looks a little bit
like the J and my name's Jonathan it's
not an ego thing it's well maybe it is
there's a full version of it again sort
of a wisp of a table these are all these
early tables they're all twelve thirteen
inches wide and they come in in the
hallway and you throw your mail on it or
or you need some space behind the sofa
that's what these were for and then this
was just
I took the mold that I build that with
and thought what would I do if I just
played with the curves in there and I
made a little sort of wall-hung desk
that's zebra no or zebra wood some
bedside tables again in bubinga and I
started experimenting at one point with
lacquering because I felt as much as
would give you a palette you can't match
with any other material I mean they're
almost nothing you'll ever see in any of
my slides is stained people say all the
time I never stain there's so many
beautiful kinds of wood that you work in
the wood that you think gives you the
color palette you need however I did
lack are these that greenish it's not a
good photo but
supposed to be teal green and I start
experimenting with color in it but I
didn't stay with it very long there's a
and I like the detail shots this is that
zebrawood
wall shelf just showing the dovetails
little coffee table in spalted maple and
solid maple there's a detail for
obviously a different version of the
wing table and you can do all kinds of
things with wood just by turning the cut
you can take a tree and cut it a certain
way
cut it and and and then consequently
turn it and cut it on a different bias
change the complete nature of the wood
the strength of it the appearance of it
even the cost of it so this is what I
like to call architectural maple very
thin pinstripes quarter-sawed and very
very stable and quiet and that's just a
contrast what's going off above because
the table that was built all like this
would be like three main courses on your
plate it might be a bit much so maybe
this isn't the way to describe it but
maybe this is the main course and these
the vegetables and this is the starch
it's just trying to balance and it's not
just done for visual reasons it's done
for structural reasons when you get
highly figured woods like this they tend
to be unstable and difficult and then
when you have all the strengths of the
table in this mortise and tenon joint
locking this leg you need the strength
so I chose that wood little - it's
actually for nestling tables I did for a
collector on the east side black figure
black walnut that's the detail I'm going
to wait for more in description until I
get to a better picture of this but
again that table top is called spalted
maple and I'm not sure it has anybody
ever heard that term spalted oh you have
heard it yeah and you know what it
refers to it's a fungal growth that's
that's preceding growing into the tree
it can happen as far as I know in any
species I've seen it very rarely in
walnut ninety-eight percent of what I've
seen happens in maple
and it happens out here on this coast
much more on the East Coast in
woodworking and it's and in wood people
often make the mistake of saying oh it's
East Coast maple or West Coast is those
names mean nothing when you're talking
about East Coast maple you're talking
about ass Acer saccharum sugar maple
it's a species it's much denser than the
one that grows out here which are the
big leaf maples or Asia macro phylum and
I have had so many generally comical
sometimes a little pissy pissing match
kind of arguments with people about what
the wood is called and if you use common
names you're in trouble because they
don't mean that much although we all use
them but this is spalted maple I think
I'll hold off for just a second to a
prettier picture of this no I'd like to
talk to you about it a bit more by the
way the words faulted I thought it came
from I looked it up I googled it
actually which is what we all do about
anything when we're feeling in it and it
said fault it comes from a German word
Gestalt and it means to divide and I
thought that's kind of cool because the
wood sort of divides up that's nothing a
derivation actually it comes out from
the old english word spoiled like we
used to use for I think they're called
participles when you end the word in IDI
in the past tense that's a participle so
walk walked spoiled we say spoiled but a
lot of our words in English in the turn
of the century were ended with a tea we
still do that familiarly with words like
Neil we don't say Neil we tend to say
knelt and spoiled became spoiled and
they know guys when they had whatever
they had in their mouth chewing tobacco
ash damn tree spoil and it became
spalted from there because the tree was
rotting thank you I kind of like that
yeah how do you choose the type of wood
for a certain design that's a wonderful
question thank you I'm not really hoping
you'll ask questions so you'll I'll be
able to answer your question I'm asking
so you hope you'll remind me of all the
things I forget to say thank you very
much
choosing woods is interesting as you
might expect for someone who's had his
hands all over wood for more than
forty years and actually much much
before that woods have personalities I
can pretty much guess that with all the
people in this room there's not a whole
lot of overlap on the ways you see
things and taste things and what is they
had their own flavors if you will that's
again what I was pointing out about clay
and metal and glass I know they're
different kinds of glass not many and
there's but wood is is not only variable
for the thousands of species but each
piece I started off when people came to
me trying to get a feeling for you know
where this piece would live if it left
lived in a very closed room dark woods
would not be a good choice she'd choose
lighter woods to light in the room if
the whole room was glass maybe you
choose a darker wood to anchor the piece
in there but I used to term that
frustrated me very much for some reason
and I don't know but but woods tend to
fall into three categories in terms of
colors there are obviously variations
but they're what I call the blonde woods
which are maple these are ones you're
probably most familiar with maple birch
oak elm ash birch these sort of beige is
more than blondish but light blondish
woods we call I called them the blonde
woods there's a smaller category in the
middle which I call the redheads and
they tend to be things like cherries
probably the most common cherry mahogany
will being a very warm woods and I
usually word warm on purpose because
that's what they feel like in your room
and that's very nice in a bedroom or a
place like that and the brunettes and
the brunettes are the most common least
expensive is the American one which is
black walnut but then you get into what
M&amp;amp;E and you get into Wang gay and you
get into East Indian rosewood and
there's a couple interesting things
about those they tend to go in price by
color almost all the blonde wigs are the
least expensive ones the redheads like
mahogany's and cherries a sort of middle
priced and most of the really dark woods
I can't think of too many exceptions
most of the really dark woods are really
expensive so the price comes out a
little bit when I first talked to a
client because unless you're someone
like that well that's got to be in it
that's got to be an element
certainly is for me but mostly the feel
in the room and I and I tell people I
used to tell people think of as you
start to see this piece come in your
mind as I'm starting to see it come in
my mind I don't generally encourage
people to take and I'm gonna offer these
two to any of you who would like to take
when I printed this while back and I
know nobody uses print for information
but here's a folio that I made of my
work which I'm kind of proud of and I
have some if you'd like to take them but
I refer to them as blondes redheads and
brunettes and someone pointed out to me
that it was kind of sexist and I said
how is that sexist I'm a brunette and
Tim he's a bla I didn't get that it
wasn't meant to be anything sexual I was
just meant to soar familiarize things
but I tend to think them in those three
groups and then if you were talking to
me or someone else and we're talking
about a piece that didn't exist yet and
you were going there I would start to
say think of the woods in those general
groups think of the space you think this
is going to go your bedroom our deck
your office and think of the effect you
want this piece or the feel you want
this piece to have when you walk in you
walk into your bedroom and it's got a
just a polished beautiful sensuous piece
of cherry there and a beautiful
bedspread on it and that cherry bed is
probably going to give you a bit of a
warm feeling that's what it does for me
a blonde would might be more technical
and quieter and and the dark wood is
going to be sort of mysterious and
powerful and I I don't actually design
with a pencil
I have no drawings of my work that that
raised I look that you gave me is
exactly what I get from my students
every time they always say where your
drawings and I say there aren't any I
like people to look inside and sort of
see what they think this piece they
might like and I don't mean necessarily
client even as someone who might want to
build a piece which makes me lead into I
don't draw my father was an architect
and he drew but I'm not an architect I
don't draw people say well how do you
how do you how do you how do you design
what you're doing and I said well I
don't draw because when you draw you're
looking generally at a piece of
white paper brunette I'm a blonde it
with graphite so I'm gonna graphite or
ink running across it and I've never
seen a piece of furniture that small
two-dimensional pure white and the
graphite outlined so they're drawing to
me doesn't even come close and it's just
too small anyway they said well why
don't you do a full scale drawing I said
that's just a bigger version of the same
thing and then the students would always
ask well why don't you why don't you do
a mock-up and I said well my words are
things like ebony and Wayne gay and and
woods like this there are quite sensuous
they don't look like what you make a
mock-up of which is you going to dung
lumber and get a piece of 2x4 and you
make a mock-up it's quick it's cheap I
sort of I sort of dare you to sort of
make a mock-up of that without using
wing a mahogany or the ebony piece and
they'd say well once you do a full-scale
markup a mock-up with what you're using
I said I do and then I sell it I see the
piece I make it anybody who's I've ever
built for has the right 50 years after
they received the piece to say they've
changed their mind
nobody's ever sent a piece back maybe
they're too polite I didn't so that's
the process yes
what are your thoughts on using
additional coloring on the woods you
know different stains it looks like most
of what I've seen here is your pretty
natural yeah there is only one piece in
the entire series in my like the network
there's only one piece that I stay and
that is I could go back to it real
quickly I think it's growing no no well
the wing table the dark dark wing table
that to get the black is very hard and
you get the stability out of it so I
actually make it out of mahogany and I
dye it black because I want the jet
black like India ink like calligraphy
and to offset the way it's the only
piece I make that I that I die as I said
there are so many so many tones and
colors like I said as I also said are
already on various one side of the tree
to the other you can get incredible
color ranges I'm pretty familiar with
the material after all these
and I can almost always find if someone
said I absolutely want this to have a
purple issue I'd consider dyeing it for
them it's just it it's come up so
infrequently it's not part of the way I
normally think I'm not opposed to doing
anything that I think is not
disrespectful to the client the wood or
anything else but I don't think that it
make you close to a problem there's no
way yeah another question about finishes
I'm so what are your thoughts on kind of
plastic like varnish finishes versus
waxes and polishing and oils well if you
use the word plastic I'm immediately
opposed to it again you can go back to
the see above where it says glass steel
and clay I don't there's anything my
material in my work is anything but
plastic but but at least in that sense
of the word my finishes are all hand
rubbed oils I have a friend who's taken
over most of my more dining table he
coffee table things which take more of
beating than let's say a chair if you
think about it really the most contact
you have the chairs your hands and
actually like you can actually put no
finish on the chair because your hands
will boil it dining tables see wine
glasses and I don't know about Seattle
but in some parts of the country
cigarettes and you know things like that
and they need a tougher finish so I have
a friend who's been working for me for
about thirty years and he sprays on a
lacquer finish but not in a heavy
commercial one time have you he puts on
seven or eight micro coats and rubs each
one out which means he's taking 90% of
the finish off each time he puts it on
and it builds this beautiful gentle
finish it's also quite strong to resist
things that's the best I've come up over
the years the piece here that I'll
encourage you to come up and take a look
at afterwards I brought one in for sure
to audience participation that's just
got a couple coats of hand-rubbed oil
and the tiny bit of wax melted in it but
that's not going to have wine glasses on
things like that the oil as I use our to
eat youth I haven't really oily piece
until this for a long time there there
was a famous woodworker who all of us
admire who
years ago and he came up with a finish
called 1 2 3 which is spar varnish and
mineral oil and beeswax
that's an exquisite finish it's not a
very tough finish but it's exquisite but
we're going a piece like this I'm happy
to answer any more of your technical
questions like that either at the end of
this or maybe after but I'm a little
worried about timing okay
and the other reason I'm a little
uncomfortable asking your questions I
don't really finish any more I did four
years but it's it's a chemical in the
shop I don't particularly want it's
really its own profession I mean it's
like saying well I'm a farmer that
doesn't make you a necessarily a gourmet
cook or vice versa you can be there are
a lot of guys who do their own finishing
but I have always had a pretty big pile
of commissions to get out that's been
I've been blessed or whatever that would
have fortune about so for me to stop and
spend weeks and weeks finishing a piece
and I'll give you an example by the way
if I can do this again how come that
guy's trying to go trying to get to that
menu at the time oh thank you
let's see I'll show you a piece if you
want to ask a question about finish and
this is called I'll give you an overall
view of the piece quickly this is called
the kimono cabinet
this is Macassar ebony gold and maple it
took 14 months to build
I hesitate to say this in front of
people because they think this is all my
work this is by far the most expensive
piece I made but was $90,000 I lost
money that year because I have about
half that in gold and ebony and when I
say 14 months I don't mean 3 hours a day
I tend to work 16 to 18 hours a day so
that piece drained me but I love making
it and it's in I'll show you some more
about the piece then later if you like
but there's a detail of the handles on
the piece I like this photo quite a bit
these are Gobbo and ebony dr. Makassar
which has the coffee color streaks this
is pure black gavone M&amp;amp;E and the handles
are gold or the pins are gold and the
main part of the case is Macassar ebony
and I had my finisher come to my studio
and it took him
and I have to finish this and it was
seven thousand dollars just for the
finish yep I said make it look like a
Ferrari and I think he did a pretty good
job that that is way over and a Byung
price-wise scale wise but this was a
very good client of mine from Microsoft
and he turned 40 and his wife said make
them whatever you anything you can think
of so I pulled out every stop I could
think of and this what I came up with
but that finish was my friend brushing
and rubbing out and brush the ribbing up
for a month and then polishing that's
the farthest I can go with it and I know
what's the finishing process not
nestling to finish but the ending of the
piece the question is when a client
picks up a piece what is the sort of
finale oh the last thing I do I said she
meant the actual pick up last and when
Matt and I struggled to get his I told
Matt Matt lives literally across the
street from me I said Matt deliveries
gonna be free for you actually I deliver
free anywhere in the northwest other
than that I ship it around the country
and it's taken care the last thing
that's done with this it's just rubbed
out and again it depends on the piece a
lot of people will there I'm sure you
all know what sandpaper isn't that there
are different grits and the higher the
number the finer they get most people
will finish a piece at about 150 and
lacquer it and rub it out some of my
pieces we finish it at 400 and then we
actually sand them with a piece of bond
paper just right on your printer I take
a piece of paper and we sand because
even that paper has grit when you're
sanding with a piece of bond paper
you're really sort of saying you might
need some sunglasses but this piece just
wanted to be taken as far as it is it
could be so generally it's the last coat
of lacquer rub drying and left to dry
yeah
so I had previewed that piece actually
on your on your web gallery and it's
looks like you have been more of a
Eaters here yeah I was really interested
in the secret compartments though we're
tensioned and if you had a chance to go
over those I'd love to sure I'd be happy
to this is the back of it by the way
this is the part that goes against the
wall I thought even that was kind of
pretty but my I have the drop pencil
theory of things I don't leave glue on
the bottom of my pieces
my theory is who knows when someone's
gonna drop a piece go down the look at
it and say oh my god guy doesn't really
finished his work my purpose is that the
back of the piece isn't that different
than the front of the piece I don't know
where it's gonna be seen and I'd love
the fact I like the idea that the image
in my mind is the person isn't going to
drop the pencil the first day I deliver
the piece it's going to take 8 10 15
years that I'm gonna own the piece whole
thing you love the piece maybe they're
already starting to pass it down to
their family I don't think of my pieces
in terms of my client I think of them in
terms of their grandsons grand sons
grandsons grandsons there's nothing I
built that shouldn't last 110 years
nothing so I had my ideas they dropped
and 20 years later and then they look
and say wow I'm glad we hired that guy
he really finished the thing so there's
the back of that piece and I realized
your question is about the secret
compartment there's one of them what
happened oh there's one of them and I'm
not sure why this isn't focusing a
little bit better illness okay
so again please monitor me a little bit
of on time because you know there's a
lot of work I've been showing I'll
breeze through it quicker two minute so
you might think but this has humne that
draw alone let me see if I can go back
to the overall yeah sorry there's a
little bit of idea where that drawer
comes from that drawer you're looking at
is here there are six across there this
was Jonathan tries everything he's been
too afraid to try so these are tambour
fronts timber as in roll top the correct
term is timber these are wooden pieces
of maple that are on a cloth backing and
they slide back into the cabinet and
they're not flat they have a series of
waves carved into them so they sort of
way
even as they go by and that opens
without any trouble and then there are
six drawers here and your question was
what happens oh the other thing that I
had fun with was my regional idea
although I call it the kimono cabinet
was it was kind of like a man or woman
standing there with a set of tails on
the black tails and sort of pulling them
back in this sort of posture and that's
why the doors are pulled back like that
visually just as if the fabric was
pulling back and then the two most fun
things on this cabinet besides the
secret drawers are one the cabinet locks
the cabinet locks by by putting a piece
of wood on the cabinet you have to know
where to put it and it's got its evany
and it has magnets in it and because
it's got magnets you can store this key
anywhere in your house just put it
against the wall and whatever there's a
screw from the sheetrock you guys hang
it like a little wing sculpture if you
want to bring it back put it on the
cabinet it pulls magnets out on the
doors and they open so the doors open up
and then I put in a delayed ramping
light system and then I you guys all
look like you know more about what I'm
talking about than I do they just come
on the market so when you open that door
nothing happens four point five point in
about 0.5 set about a half a second and
then the light ramps up very slowly like
in a theatre then it goes from nothing
to to full full-blown glow in about 1.2
seconds so it's got this open the doors
pull the curtains back and the lights
just rise up in it and that's really a
pretty effect as well and then there are
these secret compartments and there's
one of them right there this is curly
maple or Tiger maple or fiddled maple
and that is impossible to cut dovetails
because it throws your chisels in every
direction but these are all hand up tail
and the six drawers across the cabinet
and of course they all curve they all
have a belly they're not flat they're
cut from the same piece of wood anytime
I do a series of drawers and their hand
dovetailed the first set of dovetails
have to be perfect that's what you're
doing here
second set now they have to be perfect
but they have to be more perfect cause
he's blown you've already ruined the
first set and by the time you get to the
third
fourth drawer you turn your phone off
you turn the phone's off and nobody
comes in because if you just hand up
till three or four drawers and blow the
last one you can't put another piece of
wood there so it's a little bit nervous
I get at this point and again these are
spalted or curl and that's ball two
they're curly maple which is ordinary as
can be my understanding is that quilted
like fiddles or fiddleback maple is the
result of a very very heavy tree having
a hard time with its own weight and it
actually just wrinkles under the weight
of the tree and that's why you get this
beautiful look
so it's hand up tail and then each one
of these drawers had let's do the men
look like nine individual compartments
that has this little wooden pin latch
that I carved the pin latches and each
one Springs open and opens and has a
keychain
the client has I think about sixty
Ferraris so I make one for each of you
so easy
that's yours that's you I I'm not a car
maker I'm a furniture maker so a 275
whatever the heck it is this
probably something 1 Mille Miglia in
1920 in Italy I don't know but each one
of those key chains has its own
compartment lined and so there's another
let me see if I can find this for you
there's a detail of the Tambor's and the
drawers there's some spalted maple your
question about secret drawers so for
example you can't open this panel by
pulling on it you have to walk around
behind the piece slide a panel which I
can't tell you if I tell you I have to
kill you tell you where the panel is I
did a lot of work on gates this house
and that's actually closer to the truth
you guys can't repeat this this isn't
going out the web you can't find it less
you know it is you slide a panel in the
back you pull a pin out you walk back in
the front of it opens so you don't need
keys or memorably kind of memory and
there's four others and only three of
them I can remember where they are
anyway does that answer your question
about see this piece was as a result of
the second one-man show
which was called furniture that keep
secrets and all the pieces of furniture
had secret purposes or or drawers or
places you could access and that was one
of the most fun shows I ever did and if
anybody ever wants I just finished
I believe through Matt but I have a
couple in Palo Alto at the Google of
their Google people I just finished
building my desk you'll see a version
about there and it's got secret
compartments and they said oh we love
that but it's part of Simon sure let me
try and get back on task which is okay
now I'm just gonna whip through slides
okay let's see first I gotta get back
and skate let me click one and I'm just
going to click forward because I
actually like or stuck burn cabinets
here is this too fast
you can always call me back to a photo
you see at any time this piece is called
almond omage - Georgia O'Keeffe you see
the sort of dry desert images in the
panel - sis faulted maple I also did it
my third show was called one tree and
the entire tree came from assaulted
maple tree right here in Wallingford
that people asked me to take down and it
was most extraordinary piece so I spent
a month hand sewing eighth inch hand
selling veneers which is a very
laborious and expensive and nice process
and I made 18 pieces from that one tree
and the show is called one tree the foot
is pretty amazing
that means I'm at the end of that group
I believe so that's Gabe back to the top
and if we do a quick look through dining
tables a lot quicker again from this
vaulted maple show or the blanks I
didn't do a blank screen show but it
looks like a no mr. wizard
here we go detail this vaulted maple
again you see the hard rock solid maple
and the aprons and the legs for strength
this pulse to make was very fragile
there's a detail of a shot I called the
nuevo comedy hall table the new new copy
old table
the traditional cabriole table like I
find extremely unattractive but cabriole
comes from word cabra which is go the
definition of cabriole as in Volkswagen
Cabriolet is the shape of a goat's leg
is it's scampering across a meadow I
love English
really it can't be walking or trotting
it has to be scampering across the
meadow that's what cabriole comes from
and that's my version and I took out all
the horizontal strength members called
aprons or stretchers you'll see none of
them between the legs I cast my own
pieces of bronze and so there's no no
stockings getting ripped or knees
getting whack it's an apron less table
this is a this is a fun piece so this is
fact I think Matt said this one out on
the flyer this is called the oak table
Oh Table Rock table was a Spanish
ordinal for eight or eight and it has
eight pieces this is a piece that
metamorphoses from that in this close
position to that in its open position
and I love the math and the geometry in
this this table seats four comfortably
not really room for more than four there
are four leaves hanging on the wall in a
sculpture rather than a closet getting
dusty and when you put them in the table
now seats ten comfortably and I've
always loved math and particular
geometry I still can't figure this table
out but it's a lot of work but that's
the otago table that's probably my most
built piece it's a it's a trestle table
unbelievably versatile and what you can
do with the table like this it's got
everything wedges so you can take it
down to ship it or move it away for a
dance party in fact Matt I think you
have this don't you yeah it's just a
very simple I think elegant and so
completely functional table and
strangely it's one of the least
expensive pieces that make it it's
pretty simple Tom for stable and in
booyah for the east side let's go back
to
dining tables dance we'll do a quick
thing about desks this is a the original
version of the piece I just shipped to
your colleague in Palo Alto
I have Scott this isn't booming of the
wood I like so much and it's called the
tiger desk this one also has six secret
drawers in it I will explain them all to
you but for example this one here the
top one it's got a pin it's got a groove
in a pattern routed to the bottom of
them and the divider here which looks
like a drawer divider in this these are
all fixed this one's knob is actually
glued beside the drawer and you can't
pull the drawer out you actually have to
push it back away from you which is
counterintuitive
slide it to one side pull it back to
front slide it back to its original
position and now it comes out and then I
just think things like that are fun so
there that was part of furniture that
keeps secrets this is a reception desk
for a law firm Mesa I'm sorry these got
a little out of order there of course
there's the tiger desk again and I'm
gonna admit something most people think
it's called the tiger that's because the
striped wood it's actually
embarrassingly the shape of the legs as
a track shoe called only took a tiger
track shoes and that's kind of their
logo
and then when I designed this I thought
but don't don't tell anybody please ask
questions as we were I'm gonna really
flip to these these are some older
pieces this is the pet Mondrian desk for
the different black lines and panels
there's your spalted maple again there's
a desk that's built on a lot of
geometric progressions for a collector
in Seattle and I think I can whip
through the two categories
I hope this you said I had plenty of
time did Ghana me did you okay sideboard
seating Ben let's do these really side
boards which is a pretty useful piece
this is probably the closest to what I
would consider your piece man I'm the
one of the capper
like desks what was the foot the foot
pad you had a maple very dark
oh I know it's pshh you're talking about
that which is close to I don't even know
the terms historically I really don't
spend much time on what's happened but
that was supposed to be it's sort sanim
booyah desk golden brown and it's got a
black Lengai foot to it and then i
inlaid a white holly round aden is that
it was literally like a 3-2 3/16 of an
inch a black of black I'm not quite sure
I almost never do that it's a kind of a
fragile place to add such a little piece
of wood what you might often be seeing
is I tend to bevel that legs I like
everything to look like it's floating
I'm a shadow okay I don't like straight
lines hitting the floor in a easily
discernable connection I like it a
little more mystical and floating so
it's very possible that's a shadow line
I wrote the shadow lines a lot you know
instead of going through individual
pieces maybe this is even more fun to do
it this way you see thee I call the Andy
Warhol piece the architect commissioned
this one with ellipse and I'm excited we
called it Mick as in Mick Jagger this is
a piece that's becoming very trendy
right now it's called Wayne edge or
natural ed boards and furniture it's
actually belongs the the genesis of it
the whole creative belongs to a
furniture maker who died some years ago
named George Nakashima was originally
from Seattle and he was very into these
organic boards now everybody in a head
with a chainsaw is slamming their trees
in the backyard sticking for metal pipes
on it and saying I'm an artist it's a
little frustrating I think when you use
those natural edges of trees subtly and
in the right places it's extraordinarily
pretty it's just a matter of knowing
when to stop but this is an early piece
I did with that that same thing there's
the detail of the duck and by the way if
we go back real quickly you'll notice
that the figure the figure people talk
about wood having pretty grain wood does
not have pretty green it has close green
open grain and it's pretty figure even
woodworkers make mistake so the figure
in this drawers which is the look of it
you'll notice it runs all throughout all
four drawers and if you remember what I
said earlier by the time you get to the
fourth drawer you better be pretty
focused because if you blow that one
it's no good let me get you a couple
more pictures please starting with any
questions you have I don't do a lot of
seating just because it is so expensive
it's I can make a dining table handmade
book max woods woods been stored in age
for 15 years I can make it for almost
the same price as a furniture store
sometimes I can make it cheaper and if
you buy a four thousand dollars or two
thousand dollar dining table for me it's
two thousand dollars worth of work and
would you buy a $2,000 piece of
furniture from a commercial enterprise
there's at least three middlemen in that
that table probably cost one hundred one
hundred and fifty dollars to make and so
I don't get why you would not make by
handmade piece of furniture here it's
all value an individual chairs are
different chairs because the relative
uniformity of human bodies and scale
they can be standardized to some extent
and so they can make chairs way cheaper
than the handmade chair maker but I
don't think they can make a chair like
that or a piece of seating like that
that's actually East Indian rosewood and
silk oh let's get out of here it's game
and go back speeding will do a little
bit of beds miscellaneous there again is
this bolted maple from that show with a
black ebony sort of stringer
strengthener detail and again for me the
the biggest thing in designing and into
relating or let's say interacting with a
piece of furniture it's really light you
don't see the piece if there's not light
on it and so what I try and do is bend
light whenever I have a curved element I
put a bevel on it so that bevel just
bends where that shows off the light and
when I want to you see the bevels here
it's all about highlighting the piece
and the shadows that's kind of what I'm
for here after here there's the there's
a detail of a staircase I've built from
my house and cherry and everything
there's the cheap Aisha
evany carving for the handles
there's a moose I have to ship this
afternoon back to my niece my older
brother six per day when his son was
born we thought he's going to be big
he's not but I'm in fact maybe see okay
whoo let's let's get out of that quickly
that's me you know when I was 23 and
apprentice II I don't think unless you
guys have specific questions about any
piece like your question about the
drawers or about certain pieces I'm very
happy to talk about a certain piece I'm
a little worried about my skill at
pulling those pictures up that quickly
so but it sounds like we have five or
ten minutes left and if there's any
other questions or you'd like to see a
second piece again yeah feel bridge
feels bring me a brownie and ask a
question what's your feeling on CNC
machines in the realm of fine
woodworking do they have a place you
guys sitting down I'm carefully
measuring this response look I mean I'm
a furniture maker I make things I think
that's the simplest and I think most
flattering term that I could hear you
someone who makes things I just built
the house I did the plumbing I did the
wiring I did the copper roof I blow
glass I weave like it's all the same
thing
you see things and you want to make them
I am a maker and I'm really proud of
that actually um that's not what people
my family have traditionally done but
okay so anything that helps you make
things to me is fair game I have a SHOP
full of tools if any of you guys are the
slightest bit techy come by and visit
our neighborhood enough to show you in
my studio it's hand planes as far as GPT
and German chisels which I cut the cheap
handles off and put ebony and bronze and
I work with tools my my way of looking
at my work is solving problems in fact
if this isn't too pretentious I think my
way of resolving problems is kind of
binary and I'm on thin ice here with you
guys but I believe binary it comes from
the buyer is a root of two you got two
choices you guys use us and ones right
yes is our nose when I design I don't I
don't design something it should be this
way I'm gonna make a desk for Matt's son
for a high school graduation should it
be this high no that's too tall too tall
should I lower down here no that's too
low but you keep going with the nose
until you get it yes is another way a
computer works I think it is and that's
designing it's just reacting and and and
seeing the look of it and to get that
look I want I use my tools tools are
obviously hand planes and chisels and
table saws and and measuring tapes and
all those things but tools are also and
the CNC routers close to those tools
were also a lot more SN terrorists than
just piece of metal nut shaped something
but a CNC routers a very cool magical
machine that can help you make things in
my work I would say every single thing
you've seen here has got whatever amount
of hours in it the amount of hours that
there was a machine or a motor or
electricity or something making noise
it's probably 5% almost everything is is
sawn by hand everything is hand planed I
I rarely use sandpaper I find it very
coarse and grinding and abrasive
literally and you're crushing the wood
whereas an extremely sharp hand playing
slices and lifts the wood and cleans it
and makes it brilliant so I don't tend
to use a lot of machines it's just not
the nature of my work and it's not very
satisfying and if I was after precision
and some people are I'd get a CNC router
I'm not after precise I I can't even
tell you there's a certain detail in any
of these pieces in my work that's the
same measurement on one side of the
other island I couldn't care less
you remember that term I used at the
beginning the wtp factor I'm not
interested in an engineer coming over
from from Brussels or something putting
a tape as bronze is incredible it's
exactly 132 look I'm I'm interested
someone coming and saying wow I don't
even get what this is but there's that
factor again that deputy
if it doesn't resonate with you if it
doesn't speak to you if it doesn't give
you some kind of visceral response I
don't think I've done my job and the CNC
router is purely about precision and
