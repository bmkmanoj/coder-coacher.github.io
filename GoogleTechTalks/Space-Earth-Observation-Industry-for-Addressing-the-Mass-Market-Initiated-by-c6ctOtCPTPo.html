the pleasure to introduce you
sir Giacomo who's sort of the the French
father of the of the space a Frenchman
space policy and and one of the creator
of what we call knez which is assault
upon us in a digit speciale which is the
sort of the French NASA while reading
the resume of a professor Jack blammo I
basically realized that he he did lots
of the things that I'm drinking of way
way before I was I was even born
so just to give you a very very brief
overview he directed in 1957 the first
launch of the French Vernick rockets in
62 the creation of knez he was that
appointed Technical Director in 72 he
became the chief scientist and advisor
to the director of NASA and who is I
mean he's still even now an advisor
today to the knez president mr.
professor blammo discovered install our
interstellar winds in so in the 70s did
the first measurement of atmospheric
temperature and did the first
measurement of Einstein's general
relativity of the red of the redshift of
the Sun he got a tremendous amount of
awards such as the NASA Medal of
exceptional scientist achievement in 72
and the Gagarin medal of the Academy of
Science of the USSR in 85 so please help
me welcome professor glomm oh thank you
thank you very much for host to a very
informal talk it's marked that I am as
advisor to the class president which is
quite true but I'm not speaking for folk
nessam it's just my personal view which
I would like to present present to you
and so it's very informal way of
presenting I hope that you will feel
free to interrupt and to whatever when
there is something which which I say
which is poor English then please not
agitate - asthma - Oh Peter I am here
this week as a visiting scientist at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and so I've been
I've been a visiting scientist at JPL
for something like 25 years and so and
I've taken party to a number of
planetary project with them and just so
I just took this opportunity being in
California to come and see you or for
this talk and so my talk is how can
Google Earth always meet customer demand
for space images so this is a title of
my talk and the thesis of this talk will
be the following you have created a need
for images and today you are essentially
purchasing images to know what's going
to happen what are your customers
expectations now as a person who has
spent his life in space I want to
mention that so space applications
have enjoyed some kind of revolution in
the last 10 years which may be 20 years
that we did not expect first of all it
happened with a television and
telecommunication space systems they
were essentially although space system
had been developed by agencies by
government by taxpayer money and this
was true for everything now in 1988
there was the first launched by a
luxembourg company called astra of a
telecommunication satellite which was
private with a direct diffusion to the
public and it was first of all used on
on england then afterwards on germany
and the operators of telecommunication
discovered that there was an enormous
amount of money which could be made by
operating the spacecraft and operating
the space segment
therefore they took over they decided
that they would launch the satellite
they would operate everything and so the
agencies the government just were left
out and so right now today 20 years
afterwards it has become private to us
it was a public manner it was public
operation now it is completely private
and so we have something like 20 per
year we have 20 geostationary satellites
which are paid for by the market now so
this evolution of public to private is
now also the revolution of of the
localization by spacer techniques like
GPS basically GPS has been developed for
the US Navy at the beginning there was
only one customer other u.s. submarines
a wizard a system called transit and
then after us it has moved to GPS it was
discovered all 19
19 during the first wall is first Gulf
War that this system could be could be
used by Airmen and so to localize their
their position and source it has been
slow but it has suddenly become in the
last two or three years an enormous mass
product with the same with the same
space system which is essentially
providing a signal free had been paid by
the DoD you have had in all five you
have have eight million receivers which
have been brought by the public and it
went from eight or no five to 15 in oh
six with an enormous increase in this
market and that means that you have the
injection of a of millions of people
using a system which was not supposed to
be developed for them and it's expected
that we will have something like 50 at
least 15 to 20 million people using this
next year now
you do Google you have done something
similar to in an area where we never
imagined that it would happen the
aerospace imaging and therefore we are
moving for the space images as the other
space applications form a public system
with a public public customer to a mass
system where the customer is not still
there is a lot of public users but the
the customers are now millions and so
this is a creation of this image need
now that's just what I said that this
model
we'll replicate telecommunication and
GPS evolutions and therefore thou what's
going to happen in the image market you
can decide the first way is to to design
that you are stuck with systems which
were developed for the public users and
this will I think mean stagnation but if
you want to go then you have to do
something else and this is what I want
to suggest because I think and this is
my contention that the users are going
to need not only resolution but also
near real-time now what do we have a
satellite this is a list of the u.s.
satellites which are now either flying
or to be flown listen very soon and they
as you know they all are in the ballpark
of resolution of order of 1/2 meter or I
would say more like 1 meter because the
resolution of half a meter is only for
nadir pointing so these systems have to
be complemented by others like the
French support of laird which I have not
mentioned because I always wanted to
have us systems here now what my
contention is that the demand will want
to have spatial and temporal resolution
and that those systems which are here
cannot meet this need this present
system is our limited by to something
like seven hundred thousand kilo meter
square per day
now I want to call your attention to
this to this diagram where you have
essentially in an abscissa you have the
unit price of one image for instance it
so it goes from let's say up to let's
say $1,000 that kind of thing
and this so you have a in the ordinates
you have the number of customers so you
can see that we have a bimodal curve you
have the yellow part of it with
institutional market which did exist
since the beginning of space imaging and
is still with us and essentially peaks
at let's say a few thousand dollars for
a few thousand users but now something
has happened which is the impact of
Google such as creation of a second mode
in the curve as a new generation of
customers which by image for zero dollar
and number by maybe for a few hundred
millions so instead of having an
institutional market of a few thousand
people with a small amount of money you
have now something completely different
and this is your problems I mean to to
meet the needs of this mass market which
I I which you have created on which I
call maybe the Google Market or the wiki
markets are a chaotic system where in my
view what is essential will be
resolution and the
and the real time now these needs now
you have to satisfy those needs and the
problem is that the next few satellites
which I've just presented or any
satellite have been designed all the not
only the satellite was a system the
space system have been designed for the
institutional model but they have not
not been design for the chaotic model so
wicky-wicky market and so the the
satellites which we have now in orbit
are limited to certain surface pair
orbit and therefore this is not possible
to obtain at the same time resolution
and revisit a proper revisit time so now
what about the future system there
should be driven by the needs evolving
needs of the second model and the only
way the only way to obtain a Revathy
time shot every time is by a
constellation that means a number a
number of satellites carrying it says
imaging systems this this is an example
for very good satellite IKONOS which
shows that the thought in order to have
a revetted time which would be of maybe
one day which is a couple ow
you have to look at a large angle from
the nadir and of course you have a less
satisfactory resolution but anyway a 1/1
you measure
when when you decide to look at a
certain site then of course all the
sites which are near are not seen so you
may have a very easy time of one day for
one place but maybe the place which is a
how about kilometers away from it will
not be harvested with one day so the
only way is to go to to a number of
satellite so there was a this a study
which was made by Magnus called echoes
echoes means that it essentially in for
essentially Internet and it's a a
constellation of which is using relayed
observing system relayed by cellular
ground processing environment now it's
this is only a study but essentially it
is based on the idea that you have a
enormous progress which is being done on
the bandwidth of transmission system
especially on the ground that you can
now have a constellation of a number of
spacecraft which are providing in all
the time imaging and this imaging is a
downloaded to a number of concentration
then they have a network which has has
bandwidth of the order of tens of
megabits per second and therefore the
public or the customer can receive in
quasi real-time a large number of images
so this this is the idea that there are
three layers you have the space layer
with a number of satellite which
therefore you have the telecommunication
layer
and then you have the ground layer for
processing now this this is a
description of the of the eCos concept
it's multi-plane constellation that
means eight planes with all the order of
magnitude of eleven satellite per plane
it is not sun-synchronous orbits there
in their studies they came with hundred
and four satellite with one meter
resolution and to their visit and this
just essentially shows the limits now as
they also came up with an instrument
which could be carried by the
constellation which mass is fifty kilos
and provide essentially with their
altitude of 600 kilometers a resolution
of one meter but they are show you this
as an example of modern technology for
optics which can provide with a small
mass a powerful instrument now something
happened the problem with a course is
that it won't exist because because they
who is going to put in orbit hundred
satellites now so how to do how to make
it happen then something is happening
something is happening this is a
proposal by iridium next iridium as you
know I was a constellation which was
essentially invented by Motorola and
then the they went into orbit is about
10 years ago and they they everything
was bad they are marketing their systems
on the ground systems it's very
expensive that everything
home they were locust ever since they
got one cooked and they were saved by
the bankruptcy law and then afterwards
they were transformed and they kept
afloat by the DoD now they they are in
orbit and they are making money as they
have 66 satellite I will concede now
they are thinking of their future and
they are proposing what they call
iridium next iridium next essentially is
our peat of their fleet plus something
which they call oxa di-pi Road now on
the auxiliary payroll you have to
consider what they what first what they
proposed they propose to place a number
of small instrument which I will briefly
describe which would be placed on each
satellite and with which would use about
one-tenth of the of the resources of
each satellite and therefore they are
trying now to convince the international
agencies especially people who are
interested in on the almond to
participate to the to the constellation
they figure out that the concession will
cost about six billion dollars and they
consider that the the price of these
instruments would they have priced them
about two billion for twenty years about
order of magnitude of hundred millions
per euro so here I want to introduce a
new idea
compared to what iridium has done it's
at you cool instead of people using only
five to ten percent of the capacity to
add a camera on each of the 66
satellites to
meet Google image we need and therefore
right now you find out that the system
looks like much like he caused the I
mean the eCos study just just goes to
essentially something very similar to
the Radeon thing so this this is a
iridium spacecraft you can see 66
satellite in six planes so looks very
much it is not as big as loud as it goes
but it's not that bad the orbit is a bit
different that is acceptable and there
are a number of issues the payload
weight the payload power and the payload
data height
all of this can be accommodated as a
matter of fact I'm sure that the let's
say the 70 kilo camera plus electronic
systems that would have been defined
well so a course would fit in the
iridium spacecraft the payload power can
be also negotiated and the problem still
to be resolved is a bit height which
they are offering one bit right when one
megabit per second and as we'll see we
need something like 50 times more
you mentioned with me
you mentioned the advancement that could
be gained from having this sort of
spatial remote sensing the spatial and
temporal resolution of this remote
sensing constellation can you talk about
a little bit more about what things
could be improved by having this
constellation of imaging satellites
there are a number of things but let's
let's say that the first is a revisit
time with a constellation I'm talking
and matching you have a revisit time for
every point on earth of two days this is
a main point two days for every particle
to see if you look at the systems you
have now they have saying that they have
a revisit time of one day for something
like I've mentioned but it's not true
it is true for one point and a small
point yes so not the imaging satellites
with the current commercial imaging
satellites but you said something if you
go back a couple slides you said
something about disaster monitoring and
I'll come back to that later
yes yes yes yes I certainly will
we'll come back to it you right now I
just want to mention two up to answer
your question that the revisit time is a
big deal a very you have you you have
for every point maybe not every point
because you are not going to major
succeed and well may not image the
mountains the system is extremely
flexible as we receive here I'll come
back to you so so the first the first
thing is that is the time but it's not
that's not all the second point which is
equally important maybe is a management
of the fleet and the management of the
acquisition of data right now the data
are acquired with a complicated the
tasking system and then you have a queue
you have to go so the q2 of your your
images this vanish in with the
constellation you are
on smithing all the time so you all the
problem of tasking all the problem of
let's say managing the fleet disappear
and of course this is extremely
important for for for the customer of
images so it's this is a very in my view
and maybe more important as our visit
time because it makes a rule system
completely flexible no sense let's talk
about flexibility for what we can do
with arrange on camera because camera
for a homicide right so that would be
four channels and now we have want to
have adaptive compression it just
happened that I developed the first
space compression I wish through this
inner in the DoD missions are called
Clementine which provided the first
digital cartography of the moon so I
think I can speak a little bit about
this problem essentially what we have is
that we can go down with modern systems
to something like three three bits per
pixel to keep providing practically I
don't want a not like this world but
let's say no laws no rules in inter in
the information and of course as there
are a number of areas where we would
only have 0.5 bits point sensor areas of
less interest to the public but anyway
you have to have adaptative compression
and this is a very important point you a
selection of priority targets
that's also an elimination of non value
image like duplicated image or clouds we
may know that on earth statistics of the
spot system since 20 years I think 88
percent of the images are cloudy
so that means that if you take you have
50 100 images only ten are useful and of
course this means that you want to fly
and this system I'm mentioning you want
to fly a system which would eliminate
the cloud onboard and I think by using
the compression algorithm and the
compression essentially chips which are
involved you can remove the clouds and
that means multiply by 10 the number of
images which are of value so this this
these features are essentially related
with the with nature of the
constellation so it's one more third is
a third in advantage I said a visit then
I said management of the of the system
then now are talking about management of
the images so
then you have to you have to of course
make a choice of the part of the Earth's
that you you want to image and this
essentially can be done easily with an
Iridium avidians system now my
conclusion here are that the wait for
iridium is very close to the cost
estimate and can be negotiated the
volume can be accommodated so energy is
not a major problem from what I
understand with talking with with young
people and that the only problem is a
bit right and then it would mean that I
have I want to stay much on this this is
a estimate of the volume of images that
we would want and the volume in total in
terabytes and then the kind of bit rate
that we would want on this this bit rate
is obtained for one channel so we want
to multiply maybe something like like by
like with harm due to effect often
basically so it means that what I would
say as a message here that if you want
to have a revisit time of two days then
you need something as just mentioned
before a 50 megabits per second system
and that means that it cannot be
accommodated with Iridium system as it
stands so we have to have a transmitter
a special transmitter added to the
camera which is not a big deal
all right so now I go to answering your
question about the oxa di-pi road
scientific accelerator and I figured
that this would be of interest to to to
Google to participate now let me explain
out Stan there are a number of
suggestions which has been channeled to
Iranian solve the following system there
is a international grouping of something
like 70 70 nations plus plus
non-governmental organisation which is
called geo and he is essentially getting
together the needs for a as far Space
Studies of environment parameters and
they saw geo group which is based in
Geneva has started to make a list of
instrument and offer let's say domains
where they could have instrument paid by
governments to in order to fill the
hundred million dollars a year request
for of iridium for there the auxiliary
payload now there are a number of
instruments which have been there for
more or less I wouldn't say selected but
just thought about and it's it is in the
process of being selected well I I want
to come back to this now there's been
also a study made by GPL about the kind
of equipment which could go on doll
let's say that all the instruments are
in the ballpark of a few kilos let me
give you some example one of them is
something which has to fly on the radium
fleet to the GPS receiver why
because of course we need the GPS GPS
will be very interesting for localizing
the displace car but with this system
you can have a measurement of the solar
occultation radio occupation which would
provide you a vertical profile of the of
the atmosphere density and temperature
and electronic density and so this is
extremely interesting you have a
complete mapping of the of the
parameters of the high atmosphere leaves
above 50 kilometers for something like
1.5 kilo a second example is a altitude
of the spacecraft compared to to the sea
level now let me remind you that this
kind of thing has been achieved by a
joint French NASA and NOAA program
called it was called beginning topics
now it's called JSON and this file make
makes a measurement of the sea level as
a millimeter level of in sensitivity and
it is one of the most important fact
which has been supporting the problem of
global warming because it has been found
the first topics satellite was launched
in 92 and since 92 we have been able to
measure the increase in the altitude of
the sea which is 3 millimeter per euro
and this this is a solid number so it
has it rules out some kind of
announcement by surprise that the sea is
going to a sea level is going to change
by meters is a next century right now it
is 3 millimeter per year and this is a
solid solid figure and but it's not
everywhere the same there are a number
of places on the ocean where it is
different because the ocean is is kind
of active and therefore assertive
element we
aperi ways also a few kilos certainly
would be a major contender now if you're
interested that we would go i could go
more in the in the in the detail of this
list i have it last couple of weeks ago
there was a presentation organized by
the GEO Group which i mentioned before
in London at the Royal Society to have a
discussion with the Iranian people of
what could be the science benefits of
this and I say at that time they had a
leaflet which describes the few of those
measurement and be glad to leave a copy
of this leaflet to you if you wanted
that I believe that it would fit some of
your your interest to take part in this
program would be there would be a number
of them maybe six different instrument
which would not be flying on all the
satellite but maybe on five satellite
but would be enough so the two to two to
the vertical structure of the atmosphere
to the altitude of the sea I would add
the color of the spacer on I would I
would add something extremely important
evidence of the Sun and irradiance other
of the Earth's atmosphere
which are basic parameters for the
climatology and so so something like
about six good instrument at least which
has been which which will be considered
so there is some hope that the
government a number of government a
complete could including the US
government will take part and that a
good part of the hundred million a year
will be will be found however I believe
that this would be something which
wouldn't ask you if you if you are
interested in this auxillary payload
which I would
do imaging you may also be interested in
the auxillary pedal which is doing
extremely important environmental
science now I want to go to what should
we do this this is essentially what I
said that the radium concept provides to
the Environmental Sciences a coverage
data delivery in real in real time by
the Iridium communication network as it
exists now which is essentially Street
Station the temporal validity that means
one half of disaster early warning now
you have to be very careful because very
very careful because this since have
been claims by space is space people
that they could be playing a major role
in disaster management and it has not
been proven right for instance the
famous tsunami of December all four
obviously that was the system which was
existing did nothing nothing it was and
all the data which were given which are
provided by the system we approved to be
practically impossible to add to to use
so now there is as I've said an
international effort federated by by Geo
remember if I said you they say they are
situated in Geneva now the action plan
which have proposed essentially has to
meet a selection of essentially
everything in the middle of o8 so that's
why I came to see you that it's it's
your plant if you you have you have the
Iranian opportunity there's a first
fleet which can which can fly for the
next ten years and then you have the
opportunity of having first of all all
the buttons all the important feature of
improving data collection of images and
also a very interesting also scientific
network and this is happening and it
won't happen again for a number of years
so some thinking has to be made right
now right now because the the deadline
of alidium people about the end of this
year now I want to add something on
these there is another option which is
fairly enticing let's suppose that you
there would be some use of the existence
of the Iridium program which essentially
is going to fabricate 66 satellite plus
10 plus as players Akashi all altogether
of 70 all so it could it could be quite
possible that so cetera are going to be
very cheap because as its mass
production so as few million dollars it
is very very very very cheap why not use
some of them without without the Iranian
telecom payroll
and and have a real imaging system
voices then it would be a very very
cheap because you just have to use a
some models which would be fabricated by
radium on the top of the others for a
for a very cheap price then you could
have a few of such maybe I don't know
five ten which would have a pretty high
resolution
I mean 0.5 meters and and they would
they would they would have all the
benefit of the consolation which I said
yes yes but you swap the telecom payload
for yes so to what extent are
to people who don't know so much about
settlement to what extent are the needs
of the backbone of the satellite the
same between those two in other words
imaging for anyway you have a you have a
it's a a pointing accuracy problem it's
not accuracy it's just that you want to
maintain the system the optical axis in
one direction recalled afterwards you
will reconstruct the place where you are
looking at so it's not a question of
pointing accuracy it's a question of
stability now we believe that this
stability the stability which is needed
for obtain for obtaining images with
iridium spacecraft can be managed by
adding some modern wheels in reaction
reaction wheels and so so you you would
have I think you have the opportunity to
by adding a number of such a spacecraft
with just a camera and also maybe the
science some science instrument you have
the possibility of realizing something
like echoes but not at the billion
dollar level just image a much much
better bargain and so this is this is I
think my my
last well essentially so why what to do
what to do I think that the way it would
be organized would be the following
you have the Iridium satellite system
now you have to have a space segment
which they would manage essentially what
that means I would subcontract iridium
is nothing it's just it's it easy in an
office so they would subcontract a space
segment to some company
then they there would be a prime
contractor for the auxiliary payroll
whatever it is and then a prime
contractor for the payload data
operations which could be one of the
operators of today likewise for
tomorrow's process so this is what this
this is organization which has to be set
up now here is what what the alidium
plan and schedule is officially
announced definition of the mission this
year let's say for something like August
I suggest those dates can be
accommodated and then start production
in 13 and lounge and therefore the
system would be fully operational about
for 15 years to a 2016 to 2030 now what
would we have to do we would have if you
are interested by the concept to define
your requirements and because this
system is what is new is that it would
be defined by the system by the
requirement of the mode peak which I've
described that means by by the wiki
world by by by by your your customers
instead of being defined by the
government for specific
like cartography insanity then you have
to evolve a number of requirements then
a work has to be done once those
requirements are out to make sure that
they are compatible with iridium next
and then afterwards creation of a
business plan and funding method then
maybe what should be in necessary would
be the creation of a specific
implementing at applies with
international contractors and then start
implementing the program starting in
online okay that's what I have thank you
questions thank you besides the visual
spectrum what are the parts of the
spectrum are our internet to be detected
actually
besides the visual spectrum what other
parts of the spectrum infrared also our
support well interest in the eco studies
there was always something like
practically I think echo knows and or
spot for for bandwidth and respond whole
so the regular the usual bandwidth it is
not a high of a respectful system I
think the question was more if you would
be interested in different bandwidth
would you be interested in adding an an
RF filter for instance in this type of
mission specifications are up for gaps
no what I said essentially it is for the
customer to specify what he wants this
is a good idea
how would you or what are your thoughts
about addressing security I'm imagine
there's a lot of organizations that
don't want their things pointed out what
are your thoughts about that how would
you manage that to ensure that you know
rush of the United States all the
countries of the world that have secure
facilities that they don't want
satellites pointing out
III don't know this times a question
excuse me well this kind of a system
where people could look at or pre-buy
see ya on government privacy also yes
that's true are you do you see that as a
problem with you know many governments
feel reassured that you're looking out
for their security this is a question
which in my view is very I mean with
time in 2000 before 2000 everything
which was below 10 meters a better
resolution and 10 meter was considered
as classified now suddenly the Russian
come and they declassify all the I made
at 1 meter and then suddenly suddenly
the all the security people and those
people were faced with the fact that
everybody had one meter images coming
from the oceans so they decided that one
meter is not the limit anymore it's
going to be the limit and afterwards
they had to go down to 50 centimeter
with a cone also vacancy so essentially
the security public security people met
with a situation where the modern
technology and the modern system we call
modern markets are swamping their
efforts you cannot resist a thing so
they will be unhappy with it there have
been reported by British intelligence at
the
rebels in in Basara used Google Earth
maps - for directing the Rockets against
the British folks what can you do about
it you are not going to stop Google
Earth and so it's going to be the same
here there will be a lot of fights there
will be a really resistance but the
Osiris none will be swamped that's
that's what I want what I feel that's
what history tells us maybe maybe that's
not a good answer but I think it if you
have to see that the Google Earth after
after the Russian thing completely all
those things are completely
destabilizing completely destabilizing
the space is a space imaging system so
you are we are in a state of flux where
initiatives are creating the history
any more questions with the with the
plan that your outline here I believe
you had a one meter resolution
yes yes one-meter resolution if this was
to be at half a meter resolution is a
plan like this still feasible it's a
play it's a question of number of beads
so you have to transmit the optics then
the optics has to be a little larger
I've taken here I'll be the optics of
the echo scope which was giving one
meter now if you want to to go to 50
centimeter you have to increase the
diameter softly to 50 centimeter so you
are imposing more on the system and of
course this would be in a very
convenient it would be adapted to my
suggestion at the end of my talk that
you would have dedicated spacecraft you
have a nuridium spacecraft where we will
just all move the the telecom payload of
iridium and you replace it by a camera
of 50 centimeter six is a divider in
diameter this would fit okay and then
you have a problem of betrayed now the
problem arbitrate it's not a problem
once you have your own spacecraft
because then you have your transmitter
and so it should be quite easy in my
view can go okay could go to 50
centimeters if you have a dedicated
Iridium system when you have a you have
removed the payload now if you don't
then I think you'll be limited you have
a choice you have a choice between the
revisit time and the resolution because
it's a question appetite you wither okay
any more questions I think okay I think
we we're done far of this tick-tock
