Kennedy I'm a web search sre and I had
the good fortune a few years ago now to
meet David schwate through mutual friend
and it's been really exciting to get to
know him and I'm still getting to know
him he's a very interesting guy I'll
tell you a little bit about him before I
let him take over he has a master's
degree in applied math from Caltech and
an MBA from USC he's worked at IBM EDS
adaptec semantics and Silicon Valley
startups he's authored six commercial
software programs for a variety of
machine architectures in several
different languages dozens of articles
and ten technical books he regular
regularly presents at Silicon Valley
companies like Oracle Sun semantics and
Google as well as universities like
Stanford MIT and Naval Postgraduate
School his october two thousand seven
MIT innovation lecture was selected as
the best in the conference and his
soon-to-be published eleventh book
follows more than ten years of research
and is titled innovation survival
concept courage chance and change this
is his fourth Google innovation
presentation please welcome David
swatter
thank you very much it's a indeed a
pleasure and a privilege to come back I
always loved good audiences this is a
good audience that said this is not a
leisurely walk down innovation lane fair
warning we got 81 slides and as Captain
Kirk says on the bridge of the
enterprise we will do this are you ready
strap it on hang on take a look at the
sky here if you live a life or any of
your friends live a life a devoid of
innovation it greatly increases the
chances that you're going to look like
this guy on the other side of the coin
if you live a life full of innovation
way out there on the edge chances are
you've greatly increased the probability
you're going to look exactly like the
same guy okay innovation is a two-edged
sword what you find is that most
people's perceptions of what it is are
completely wrong and we're going to be
getting into some of that and if you're
surprised by some of this lecture
material you will enjoy now notice this
poor guy maybe on the street for a
variety of reasons none of which are his
fault it's a wonderful article in
Atlantic magazine you can search on
jobless era and transform America
Atlantic magazine blue and it'll pop
right up talked about the various things
that have gone wrong in the country like
marching to Wall Street's quarterly
earnings expectations patent system
breakdowns and things like that so
people can lose their innovation so can
companies look at the late great
Polaroid corporation look at what has
been going on in kodak the inventor of
the digital camera look at what's
happening right now over in milpitas
that adapt that corporation once a
billion-dollar corporation it's always
the same story companies can lose it but
if companies can lose it guess what so
can regions here is the 2010 Silicon
Valley index recently out of a couple of
months ago it says that the standing of
the valley in innovation in the world as
far as new technology is at risk should
not be complacent innovation innovators
and things like that appear 65 times in
this particular report so if regions can
lose it guess what countries can lose it
as well
this is a article in The Wall Street
Journal about India and innovation and
how they have decided that they will
observe patents all across the world
except in drugs and they'll only do the
ones there that they feel are innovative
to their to their specifications so
countries can lose it which affect
regions which affect companies which
affect guys like that in the beginning
slide now my name is Dave swatter I have
studied innovation diligently for 12
years in six different contexts since my
fourth presentation here the previous
three at Google are the underlined ones
there is one that I have not non
innovation and sports evolution of the
surfboard today's lecture is innovation
in science and by science you know
there's a to z avionics all the way to
zoology i primarily mean earth science
you will meet the work of these five
gentlemen in this presentation the two
on the left died about a week after just
a couple of days after that picture was
taken on the on the ice shelf out in
Greenbelt 19th Greenland in 1930 the
other three were ardent supporters of
the gentleman all the way on the left
who was one of the greatest living
scientists at the time that and actually
one of the greatest ever so this is
dedicated to them there is one other
topic so in the movie Dirty Harry good
old Clint Eastwood asked says got to ask
yourself do I feel lucky well ok there's
pictures of six people on the next slide
and I will count to five when it shows
up if anybody can name all six in the
count to five the first person i will
give them this 100-dollar bill and for
those of you cannot see in the back this
is what it looks like right it's
non-negotiable right didn't break any
federal laws all right are we ready so
you got to ask yourself do you feel
lucky here we go one two three four five
times up how about five anybody up for
55 55 DB 55555 povo or 44 44 all right
all right so I'm gonna make it real easy
I have a genuine wooden nickel here
to the first person that can name one of
these people don't worry time's up you
didn't do any worse than anybody else
has done on this presentation when it
comes to money the game is always rigged
okay here's how they are don't worry
about it it's not important because
you're going to meet them and you're
going to meet them through the agenda we
have five case studies wonderful case
studies these are representative of
innovation and science so here they are
well have a conclusion and a part of
thought let's start discovery of the new
world yeah we all know way back in
columbus day everybody except columbus
thought the world was flat like how did
that happen right it is thought it was
flat so to get to from Spain out to the
Spice Islands the Spanish and the
Portuguese and everyone's like that
would sail all the way around Africa
East look how far they had to go and
they wouldn't dare step off the ship
because if they stepped off the ship on
to Africa they invariably died and we
now know you know malaria dengue fever
hideous parasites go a go do a web
search on guinea worms oh boy that's the
big one okay so they will go all the way
out there the reason why they did that
they thought the world was flat well
sailing East was great distance Columbus
comes along and says hey new innovation
Toscanelli and I have been sharing some
starbucks and guess what world is round
you don't have to go east you can go
west he picks up his his Blackberry he
tweets Isabella Ferdinand king queen
Spain and he says hey guess what shorter
Western route they invited Mindy gives
me the 30 second elevator pitch and
google maps we have a wonderful google
map here of gentleman in the in the
audience right now okay I look at it I
mean this business case speaks for
itself imagine you know the internal
rate of return return on investment you
know throwing some stochastic Monte
Carlo future value of the doubloon you
know analysis in there you just look it
just speak it's easy trivial so Isabella
fernan say you know Valley where
we're not navigators like you we
understand that yellow line is shorter
let's turn it over to some guys who take
a look at it they turn it over to the
ghoul the tablet talavera Commission
guys hang go look guys it turns out that
everybody in the world knows the world
is round this this world is flat thing
was made up by Washington Irving in 1831
it is complete bum no basis for it
whatsoever it's complete trash so so
yeah we know the world's around oh by
the way that little yellow line that's
how long the yellow line is you know
count the dots now we now know that that
Columbus's estimation of the distance
from Spain to Japan was off by a factor
of 4.5 we know that the distance between
Spain and China was off by 3.31 well so
how is it that these guys knew what the
real distance was and the answer is as
they were aware this guy who's 17
hundred and twenty-eight years before
had calculated the radius of the earth
the circumference of the earth and hence
the radius and it was a Aristophanes he
was he was a Greek he did it in Egypt
beautiful very simple trigonometry
within one percent of to use the right
unit of measure for for his calculations
so they go back and they think about it
and then come back in the report to the
Queen they say look the guy is bogus
it's it has no merit whatsoever it's
completely bankrupt here's why right
it's going to take him three years to do
this trips not a short one right the the
ocean out there off to the west is
infinite and and and we're not even sure
you can get there but but if he gets
there you can't get back but there's no
no there there because there's no land
ask st. Augustine trust me don't don't
tamper with that one st. Augustine's in
the way here he's going to go through
uninhabitable zones and guess what so
many years after God created the earth
it is highly unlikely that any new lands
of any value whatsoever will be
discovered Wow king and queen they sit
back they do there you know future
analysis present value money everything
else like that
they say expected value of this is close
to break even but let's do it pick up
the iphone boom they say Anchors Aweigh
and Thank You Toscanelli for that
wonderful map and that's the map
basically let's believe that uh Columbus
had it is there something wrong with the
projector here I there's this I don't
recall seeing spa well it's probably not
important oh my goodness look at this
here we go well it turns out that there
was a problem unexpected development and
you know test organizational agility and
you know thinking on your feet and
things like that so how did it work out
for Columbus in the end here's how it
worked out not my words one of the
greatest biographers of them it was a
great great navigator he accidentally
discovered the new world looking for
something else what he found nobody
wanted they spent the next half century
trying to figure out how to get around
the obstacle because they wanted the
real thing and oh by the way they named
the new world after somebody that had
nothing to do with it its discovery
ladies and gentlemen welcome to
innovation 101 case study number two of
five tomm mental dripped now that
beautiful beautiful google map here
satellite view of all the world if you
look at that west coast of africa it
looks as though that east coast of South
America could just slide right up in
there beautiful I noticed it in the
fifth grade I would scare at this giant
map in my fifth-grade class for hours
taking poison that weird look at that
well I wasn't the first here's the first
published version that maybe there was a
giant continent that had broken apart
and drifted apart was done in what 1858
and look at all the people here that be
there's one of the gentlemen but you
didn't know he did it in 1596 right this
is right after the new world started you
know maps of the new world and Africa
and everything started getting a little
bit accurate so these guys are right on
may I draw your attention to the lower
right-hand corner Frank Bursley Taylor
Frank Bursley Taylor 1908 gives a
presentation and he talks about how
there's a sting discovered in 1870 out
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
called the mid-atlantic ridge and it
looks as though Africa and South America
are moving away from it in opposite and
roughly parallel directions boy that's
got some bite to it so the problem with
him is as he wasn't a member of the club
he wasn't credentialed he had absolutely
no basis to be talking to geologists
about these very profound things so he
was ignored and but when he wasn't
ignored he was criticized here's a
gentleman named Bailey Willis and his
comment on it says sorry everything's
permanent you know changes are only
gradual there's been no changes thank
you go away don't go angry just leave so
we'll meet Bailey later in the
presentation well here's a gentleman
that did not speak read write English
what service only German brilliant
thinker named Alfred Walter begginer and
he came up with the idea as well and
instead of just continental shapes and
drifting and things like that he
wouldn't he looked at the snails on the
tips of both South Africa and South
America he looked at the earthworms he
looked at the glaciation marks he looked
at the wandering poles it looked as
though the polls have been wandering
around but he said you know maybe it's
not the poles maybe the polls have been
constant and the continents have been
wandering around things like that in
addition to that he knew about Sabine
island this island right off of
Greenland you go to Google Maps type in
sabina island greenland boom there it is
right it looked as though about every
30-40 years it was moving a quarter of a
mile west from europe every 30 or 40
years now it is moving but he was off by
a factor of 200 to 800 it's moving about
an inch and a half a year by golly it's
moving so what does he do well in 1915
people she's a book as titled what is it
the origin of the continents and the
oceans but it's only in German nobody
reads it he goes to world war one gets
severely wounded comes back wars over
right put puts out second edition in
1920 German only nobody reads it puts
out the third edition in 1922 translated
into four other languages one of them
English and boy that was the the Exocet
missile hitting the aluminum ship I got
Italian to respond to the to the
suggestion in 1922 there was an annual
meeting of the geological society of
america and he says hey somebody said
hey if we're going to listen to this guy
we have to forget everything we've
learned in the last 70 years and that's
why we're all coding today ladies and
gentlemen in machine language you know
none of this assembler stuff right none
of this high-level language you know
none of the scripting because we know
how we know we understand how machines
work right so like you know these
registers and on condition codes you
know predicates you know branching
conditions no instruction failing and
Itanium all that stuff right Rock they
didn't want to abandon their
intellectual property base so they said
this guy's got to be wrong now this is
science and with science you can always
know in advance that the discussions are
going to proceed on a collegial nominal
friendly basis of discourse and exchange
well 1923 this guy says you know what
he's in a debate in the Royal Society
says well we discovered all this and
anybody that values this reputation
wouldn't be saying this stuff and but we
thought of it already even though it's
bankrupting has no basis whatsoever we
already thought of it so and by the way
we beat him in the war so there you have
it so um this is what he said wagner
said there was a big continent it broke
apart this is right out of his book and
it's kind of an ugly fit because the
coasts don't want to go together but
he's
you know maybe it's not the coast maybe
it's the continental shelves but he
didn't have the well satellite data all
right he didn't have you know he didn't
have a mean square feet or any of this
other stuff so he says uh golly I don't
know so these guys were called mobile
lists now he got a mixed reaction across
in the world Arthur Holmes in the UK one
of the greatest geologists that's ever
lived maybe the greatest he said
absolutely is this we gotta look at this
all right Alexander Dutoit South Africa
move right on the money Reginald alien
Canadian at Harbor says man look this
looks pretty important to me Warren
carried out in Australia United States
absolutely not right there seen this
guy's this guy's a shankapotamus you see
you know meteorologist armchair
geologists you know he's and I picked up
this line just the other day a heretic
imrat bag flat earther that was out of
warranty respond by interviewing that so
but at least it preceded you know in a
nominally civil manner or not hurry up
there's some of the comments here and
look at these guys you know John Hopkins
University cambridge university
presidents of a very important societies
on and on alone and they are all piling
on this for her german guy who is trying
to actually get ready for the trip to
Greenland that that will kill him and he
will actually die on so let's move on
Yael Yael ways in this is a textbook 15
years after that american association of
petroleum john geologists meeting where
they threw him out lock stock and barrel
and he says now there's never been any
interchange now everything's kind of
where it is and so i actually got this
out of the library and checked it out
myself i don't know about you guys but
you know they look like those East Coast
types you know kind of kind of tightly
wound all out of the stuff wouldn't we
all feel rejuvenated we had that breath
of fresh air West Coast flavor well look
it's Bailey he's back now he is chairman
of the department of geology at Stanford
University and he says you know we could
take this theory and just dump it in the
trash can all it does is encumber the
literature befogged the- dude
this antiquated as a pre cheery physics
it is a fairy tale so this is 18 years
after their still beating this guy up
even though you know the dead horse is
laying out there on one on one and you
know shoreline overpass so and of course
you always want uncle walt's away and
here he is Columbia he says no no no no
and no legs there just forget it so I
don't know about you I think we can sum
this up right now we're all intelligent
people let's make it so simple a
Pentagon general can understand it we're
ready here we go boom continents can
rise and fall good continents moving
around laterally bad and what are we
going to do to anybody that says that
they move around laterally we're going
to lay the template of traditional
geophysics down on all the reports and
we are going to exterminate with with
scientific antibodies anybody that
breeze mobilism that's what we're going
to well remember that thing out in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean was
discovered in 1870 it's called the
mid-atlantic ridge and if you look at it
closely this is a shot of it from maps
again right there's a big crack there in
World War two there was a gentleman by
the name of Harry Hess and he was out in
the Pacific Ocean not the Atlantic the
Pacific Ocean and had this newfangled
device that was good for finding
Japanese submarines and what's called
sonar and he left it on all the time
even when there weren't me submarines
around and he was mapping the bottom of
the ocean and he discovered volcanoes
down there since you know why this is
really were either volcanoes down there
and it began to think that maybe there
were cracks in the in the ocean floor
and there was a movement lava coming up
and he didn't name it this gentleman
here named it Robert deeds and he
referred back to that greatest geologist
perhaps it's ever lived Arthur Holmes
and talks about a conveyor belt effect
that there's a big crack and the earth
is moving away from the crack like a
conveyor belt on both
AKA frank bursley Taylor and maybe lavas
coming up on the inside and and the way
it would work would be you would have
right at that crack you would have
crystallized basalt and as it passed
through and cooling to pass through the
Curie point its magnetic materials would
lock on to the direction of the magnetic
field its direction and inclination as
it turns out well as it spreads apart
cracks on both sides you get something
like that and guess what it turns out
the Earth's magnetic field reverses
itself about every 10 15 million years
so sooner or later you wind up with
something like this well three gentlemen
working a the bottom two together and
the top one independently who got
absolutely shafted because he tried to
publish and he got thrown out by the
journal that published the report on the
other two guys he said if this is all
true when we go out to that crack it
ought to look like that I mean went out
and they looked at it and it did look
like that and it talks about how this
conveyor belt is actually a tape
recorder of magnetic direction over time
or symmetric wonderful YouTube thank you
again Google video Wilfred vine
explaining this out on youtube how this
all works absolutely beautiful so fast
forward a few years 40 years after this
this conference this gentleman here says
you know we had to go back and revisit
this continental shelf it thing the
continent you know the shoreline didn't
work let's do it so he and two other
gentlemen get together and they do their
least squares fit and you know crunching
and everything else like that on
computers that begginer had no chance of
having two years after they did that
this gentleman Reese Ewing from Columbia
University an absolute powerhouse in the
discipline comes up and says you don't
believe all this rubbish do you well let
me ask you how does the fit look it is
spot-on like a four percent error it was
absolutely devastating now if you look
at that picture up there in the upper
left there's there's a Alfred Wegener
and his guide to both died
on a mercy mission that was unnecessary
that they didn't want to do so they were
already dead by this time 35 years after
this thing here so so like he never got
to hear this so how do you sort all this
out well it moves directly into plate
tectonic theory and it's still a theory
there's things there are big holes in
this theory hypothesis by the way and
this is but this is something that's
very close you see the blue bulls eye in
the center that's Haiti seven point 0
earthquake right and that's that's a
problem with building codes right the
the yellow one there off South America
on the west coast that's chilis 8.8 it
was 68 times stronger moved an entire
town 9 feet west the green one is the
one that's cocked and loaded on the
Cascadia subduction zone right they know
to the hour when it last cut loose it
does so every three to five hundred
years the hour if glass cut loose was in
a day and 1700 in the math is very easy
when that thing hits it's going to hit
at Crescent City Eureka Eugene Oregon
Portland Oregon hillsboro oregon Astoria
Vancouver Washington Tacoma Washington
Seattle and the victoria and vancouver
british columbia that's going to be the
big one that's going to be a hundred
times stronger than what happened in in
haiti so notice that it's all happening
basically out on the oceans or just off
the coasts right so how did it work out
well did the geologists now all get
together and say mobile lists were sorry
you know we're fix this we were wrong we
love you absolutely not the oppressors
became the oppressed and the oppressed
former oppressors became the oppressors
and they laid on to these people let me
paint just tore into them right and a
reign of terror and if you dared try to
publish anything that had not been
tectonic washed you know
green data centers and green washing and
all that stuff tecktonik Wash U or
runoff you were run out of your run out
of the discipline so the other side
effect of that is is that the the
literature itself became very shallow
and meaningless for about a decade and
there's a lot of problems in it now that
being straightened out so for alpha are
Arthur Luther begginer right turns out
he was the real scientist not the other
guys that were criticizing him they were
upset about the fact that he had a
single theory and was attempting to
prove it in United States they wanted
multiple theories bouncing off of each
other sometimes that works it didn't
work here in addition to that he also
had some errors because he thought the
continents plowed their way through the
crust when in fact they were like corks
being conveyed by these tectonic plates
things like that so I did about a
thousand other than that this is Lincoln
John Maynard Keynes better to be you
know roughly right and precisely wrong
and in by the way he'll a lot of bad
things can happen for a long time and in
the long run we're all dead Wagner was
dead welcome to innovation case study
number three thunderstone of incense I'm
does anybody look at this is really I
don't know what this thing is this this
bugs did Columbus is off of Hispaniola
or Cuba sailing around and this thing
comes barreling in in about noon one day
big big contro the curling flames and
sonic boom and it just smashes and
buries itself into the ground villagers
dig it up emperor maximilian is coming
by takes a look at it and says this is a
good sign a good omen for my battle is
coming up so want you to chain it down
in a church because we don't want
anybody stealing it we don't want it
wandering around at night we don't want
it leaving in the vomit man arrived and
oh by the way stopped chipping pieces
off of it
you know I had lost about half its
weight this time so so you know I this
thing I don't understand this kind of
round sonic bloom again so I tell you
what if anybody here feels lucky I got a
twenty-dollar bill there anybody that
will tell me what is this thing's it
ain't no but have a look this good this
thing possibly be who's who did you meet
her
you know what I like about a great
audience ladies and gentlemen is there's
always somebody that wants to see if I'm
in on the gag we all know there's no
such thing as meteorites I did they
don't exist and but you know what since
you're such a good guy in such a
gentleman and enrolling sport I tell you
what you didn't get the answer right
because we're hauling on the gag right
and so I'm willing to give you ten bucks
so how much is ten bucks and we respect
to 20 it's about it's about half ago
okay well presently okay so okay so
let's let's move on we now know what
it's not right we're all in on the gag
so here we go the reason why I know it's
not of meteors because I did the social
math Aristotle says there's no such
thing as meteors Isaac Newton says
there's no such thing as meteors Thomas
Jefferson one of the founders of our
country says there's no such thing as
meteors how many neurons you gotta love
it when you tap into that hive mind of
conventional wisdom you know the wicking
gnomic long tail strategies of
everything of a pod collective consensus
science yeah get an answer really fast
it's easy in it's expedient it's simply
called appeal to Authority it's a winner
we look at these guys here who's going
to vote against these guys well
so we know what it's not and here we go
here are the candidates that I found
that it can be and these are the ones
that were prevalent I take a particular
shine to that lunar volcano because you
know you can see the moon up there and
there's all these craters and stuff
right if there's no meteors what causes
craters volcanoes and let me tell you
but Tom Hanks and I went to Starbucks
and we talked about the you know the the
problems he had with this Apollo 13
aircraft you know I said hey I think
that's it Tommy says maybe you're on the
Sunday you know look into it and of
course there's a perennial favor here
God is all-powerful and he's up there
throwing rocks at us so you know gotta
love it so I I don't get it yeah I mean
like I I appreciate I appreciate your
effort but yeah so there's this
gentleman Peter Simon pull offs and
Catherine of Russia really likes this
guy's extremely intelligent he gives him
a post in the Academy of Sciences in st.
Petersburg and in 1768 he decides he's
going to go do a survey of a whole
wealth and riches of their of Russia so
he goes out and four years later
villagers bring him that thing that's
another puzzlement for eternity i gotta
tell you i don't what that thing is and
he looks at it he says who this is
definitely new never seen anything like
this before at 21 years later this
gentleman is talking to one of the
greatest thinkers and scientists in the
world named George lichtenberg and
lichtenberg says you know these things
that are barreling on you know sonic
booms and sticking in the ground and
stuff and plus he says I think they come
from outer space he's not in on the gag
well Chladni says all going to look into
this and he goes out he interviews
eyewitnesses as many as he can find and
in 1794 he publishes this long-winded
book about these things and he says hey
these things come in from outer space
really well it's very controversial me
in they ridicule
and I mean can you imagine the guy
actually went and interviewed peasants
out of you know I don't know more I mean
these peasants probably don't have
facebook pages or LinkedIn profiles wait
who that who are they so yeah so he's
getting a distant written off well it
turns out 60 days later the skies break
loose in siena italy and all the
Italians are out there so no confused so
these things are rocketing in you know
down to the ground the Royal Society of
England since ever homes out they gather
up a bunch of them they look out and
real careful they find this formation
and cite this thing and they call them
chrome roles like one of these things
never seen these before nine years later
the mother lode happens boom Normandy
France sting comes in domes three to
four thousand large stones over this
village in this ellipsoidal area and the
french academy of sciences sends out
jump a piece Beale he says that that doe
named la Monsieur but I've looked at
this stuff and guess what meteorites are
cosmic they come in from outer space and
meteorites exist so small matter of 311
years to get to the right answer on the
Thunderstone of innocent sign I mean
who couldn't know
these are all small stones right all
small stones the reason why there are
always small stones is the atmosphere is
impenetrable to large meteors large
meters can't get in all right and
there's this a big hole out there
between Flagstaff and Kingston when
excuse me Winslow in Flagstaff Arizona
so the USGS the end States Geological
Survey since I grow up Carl Gilbert 1891
says what does that whole doing out
there well he sees all these meteor
fragments just happened to be
coincidental around the rim and
surrounding area but there's no magnetic
anomalies down on the bottom so he says
there's a volcano 90 miles away and some
lava probably one underground and hit
some water and boom it's a steam
explosion it's not for its at Inter
Eugene Merle Shumac and this gentleman
was a PhD student in Princeton and his
PhD thesis advisor Harry Hess you know
the guy was sonar is telling him Eugene
it's time for you to leave time for you
to get out write a PhD thesis you know
taillights a car exhaust that's all we
want well he's not liking what he's
working on so he thinks maybe this thing
has been caused by a large meteor impact
and what he does is he goes out to yoga
flat where they've been shooting off
nuclear bombs underground investigates
the craters that are out there he finds
this new mineral called shocked quartz
goes out to the crater what's on the rim
guess what he finds shocked quartz
everybody says okay Jane you got us on
that one that's your gimme but it
doesn't ever happen anyplace else he
said you know I'm not so sure so he's on
his way to a conference in that center
picture there another great great
satellite picture from google maps aside
life if you know there's just depression
in Germany with this little town in the
bottom of it it's 15 miles in diameter
and it's call about nor Lehman and
there's a rim on he says I bet you
that's 12 so he shows up at night camps
on the rim he
samples of rock from the rim he takes it
down town the next morning to the post
office and males him to look at them
back at when he gets back to Princeton
and his wife says oh honey we're hearing
this really nice walled city there's
only three of them in the world let's
play tourist he goes oh okay and so
they're walking around you can actually
see this church in google satellite view
calling it right in dead center of the
town he walks up to the stone church
made out of rock poured in the local
area takes one look at it pulls out his
magnifying glass lo and behold it is
full of shocked quartz so he's got it so
now they know okay there's there's a
whole bunch of them now if you're like
me after you watch dumb Jurassic Park
you know you kind of like wanted to have
one of those velociraptors in your
backyard to take care of the pesky
neighbors pets and things like that well
it turns out that 65 million years ago
something like this happened and that's
why we don't have them right now
everybody seems to think it happened in
Yucatan and there's been some consensus
here in the last couple of weeks that
had happened in Yucatan don't be so sure
there are people that are pretty
intelligent to think it actually might
have happened over in the Deccan steps
of Deccan Traps of India there's a giant
volcanic area in there it's just did all
sorts of bad things to the surface of
here and oh by the way did you know that
there was a major asteroid impact in
Eastern Oregon as well so none of these
things are settled and of course if
asteroids and meteors can hit comets can
too and shoemaker was in on the
shoemaker-levy 9 comet in 1994 then
impacted Jupiter if that had hit had a
hit the earth we wouldn't be having this
meeting I guarantee you and there is a
what is believed to be an impact chain
from a series of comets on one of
Jupiter's moons over there now the
reason why this is important is is
there's a black layer particularly in
North America of a very carboniferous
material and it is laced with nano
people believe that spot to two thousand
nine hundred years ago three thousand
years ago comet came in and maybe that
is the reason why all of the mammoths
and everything like that got nuked as
well as the Clovis people in a bunch of
other stuff they don't know it's still
ongoing so large impacts case study
number four now this one I'm really sure
about I can tell you with full certitude
and no mental reservation whatsoever
there is no oil in Texas and the reason
why I know that is because of this this
kind gentleman here and back in eighteen
eighty five he was notified about the
fact that there might be oil in Oklahoma
and that was his statement and let me
tell you when you get a statement that
is this delicious you man you better
document it and so I've got three three
places where I've seen this quote I had
somebody pound on me and this can't be
true it's too good so how did this all
work out well it turns out he was afraid
he was a executive in Standard Oil and
he was under the impression that they
were running out of oil and none would
be found so he made the statement and
shortly after he sold a whole bunch of a
stock at a discount like all good Wall
Street people you'd want them to do with
Inside Man oh now there's always ten
percent of the people that don't get the
word I mean do you guys work in a large
organization right there probably a
whole building over there people who
think there's a while in Texas I don't
know this guy was in this day he didn't
he thought there was possibly oil in
Texas and he'd gone out to this this
area called sour spring mound also his
big hill outside of Beaumont Texas it's
his bump 46 feet above sea level it's
about a mile in diameter and he could
stick a stick in the ground and it would
bubble in the water and he could light
it and it would burn he says if there's
gas there there's oil there so he wants
to do a series a IPO on his theory and
you know take it take it to the street
you know so he calls up you know lehman
brothers and they say no
we're finding important things faces I
need some credibility so it calls up the
state geologist William Kennedy comes
out the Texas walks around with him
shows him that shows him the gas shows
him this shows him that Kennedy says
you're wasting your time and money and
add insult and into injury he writes an
article in the local newspaper saying
disguise bogus do not touch this
investment he does not know what he's
doing I didn't work out too well so he
goes again see Willard Hayes Parker of
USGS come out he says listen to your
state geologist dude like nothing's here
that doesn't work so he brings he gets
Standard Oil to bring this guy out is
one of the top standard oil petroleum
geologists in the corporation and he
says you're not going to find anything
here now how many strikes is that is it
one two three no it's for because six
years he had already written the
executives in Standard Oil in Cleveland
and he had said hey gotten this response
back from Frank Rockefeller John Dee
Rockefellers brother and what they said
was is no we know what we don't want to
invest in your stuff and oh by the way
it's too much guesswork and notice that
they saved a nickel bye-bye crossing out
the name of a former treasurer using a
different type there you know the state
of the stationery and add insult to
injury they misspelled his name there's
two T's in his name so that's four
strikes well you know I'm sure that
they're glad they did this because if
there was one to ten percent of the oil
that Pattillo Higgins said there was in
this area what if they drill down a
thousand feet admit squirting in the air
and it's just utterly preposterous
because it's just texts prairie land
well that's embarrassing
maybe I need to prepare better for these
talks my goodness okay well okay all
right so all right so maybe they maybe
they drill down a few feet and some salt
water pumped up I mean like I I can
assure you that this is not what it
seems to be here and and the reason for
that is is that well if there was really
oily air under that much pressure they
could have drilled it like a pin cushion
and how many how many oil wells do you
see there it's ridiculous right now it's
just wrong okay so there were a few
there were a few Derek's out there
wouldn't Derek's out there and but this
probably is is just some fake digital
image that you know Kodak George Eastman
put together in 1895 because you know
they were going to invent the visual
image for individual camera in the 90s
later so the reason why we can be
assured that this is is it couldn't
possibly have happened is that if it was
really under that much pressure in this
many oil was they would have lost
control of them and there would have
been like lakes of them out there lakes
out there with oil millions of barrels
of oil well ok ill this you knows
obi-wan Kenobi says you know these
aren't the droids we're looking for
let's move on because this is probably
some catfish pond somewhere like in
lower Alabama or maybe a third settling
pond in lv so that's it yeah that's
alviso it's over there so because look
if trust me on this you could take this
to the bay it's from the heart if there
was that much oil exposed under that
much pressure can you imagine one spark
right one careless match a cigarette why
everything would have been burning so
the bottom line is is in that hole they
found 150 million barrels of oil that's
what they found so what was all the bad
acting about that I was doing there for
four slides it's to drive home and
experience called the symbolize reflex
it is the automatic rejection of the
obvious without thought inspection or
experiment with innovation this is a
regular
Curren regular concert a lot of reasons
for here's one of them moral cowardice
if you're going to be an innovator you
better have some courage and you better
get ready for a scuffle so if you
thought that was a big oil fine how
about 135 times bigger ok this is the
black giant 30,000 oil wells in this
area so how we want world war 2 it drove
the price of oil down to six cents a
barrel right and I went in the time on
her tongue I'll drink every barrel of
oil you get out of that hole now last
time I look California California is
Weston Mississippi right well top two
pictures there Huntington Beach late
1920s that's what it looked like it's
not a little bit different from surfing
USA Today down here this is the greatest
gusher that has ever occurred in the
mainland United States this is about 35
miles west of grapevine on Interstate 5
right it shot 200 feet in the air 20
feet in diameter the wind blew the oil
for for 10 miles the farmers and the
ranchers were terrified that this thing
was going to explode and incinerate all
of their sheep and cattle that were out
there and it almost did 11 well actually
did created a 60-acre Lee they was going
a hundred thousand barrels a day in its
maximum they couldn't shut it off for 18
months it was just I mean it was it was
beyond conception of this one thing here
drove oil at the time down to 36 in
Maryland so here's the question Standard
Oil you know they weren't they weren't
in on any of this in the beginning so
you have to ask organizational it was
Standard Oil stupid the answer is no
they were not stupid right they were
handicapped by knowing too much about
too little and this is a condition that
we all suffer from and it's important to
realize that we all do this right
electricity was on its way as a result
market for kerosene illumination was
diminishing oil is everywhere is
probably right under this building but
it's not there in enough commercial
quantities and the primary market for
oil back then was production of kerosene
you needed paraffin to do it Texas did
not have the right quality of oil there
was there were no geological signatures
like in the Northeast United States or
any place that anybody had ever seen
there were no refineries no trailheads
no nothing if they did find a bunch of
oil how to get it out of there there was
no awareness of the role that salt domes
could play this oil was used for fuel
and a blindsided everybody because the
internal combustion engine didn't even
exist at the time gasoline was an
obnoxious byproduct of the production of
kerosene they've reported into ditches
burnet are they to support into lakes
and streams so if you're a human like we
all are want to see if this applies to
something that you're invested in Thank
You Arthur case study number five
honeybees we're moving away now from
geophysics now this gentleman here won a
Nobel Prize and what 1973 for his is
studying of honeybees and their
interactions and on how they communicate
and find honey nectar so 1937 he was
fully signed up for one hypothesis where
they smelled it and then they zoomed in
on the wind plumes and things like that
1946 he changed over to the other
prevailing one called the language
hypothesis you know that's the waggle
and wiggle and you know son inclination
and you know magnetic field and you know
storms and Eric pressure and a lot of
stuff so here's a history of these two
through timelines we have the odor
search and he shows up in 1937 in degree
and he moves over in 1946 well 1962 16
years later there's another gentleman
you'll see in the next slide he signs up
he's on the bagging he adds sound it's
just they can communicate with you know
intensity of flapping and all this other
stuff and I but he moves over in 1967
five years later now what happened
ladies and gentlemen Adrian winter
professor emeritus at University of
California Santa Barbara what happened
was he micholi supported what this guy
did and the thought collective he
supported it he went out and ran a bunch
of experiments and none of it added up
none of it added up and he says this is
bogus this is broken this is bankrupt it
doesn't work and he tried to publish a
paper that said that and he was
completely thrown out of these of the
discipline he was not permitted to ever
publish anything he was not even
permitted to respond in writing to
anybody that criticized his work or his
responses whatsoever it was on the
street and he wrote a book about a title
anatomy of controversy you'll see it in
just a few minutes as we as we move
along and he says they don't have him to
do with evidence it has to do with the
sociology of the club oh he finally does
get a paper out in the Journal of insect
behavior Vaughn 15 number six November
of 2002 but only because a previous
student of his who was who gave 150
thousand dollars to establish a chair
whose life Adrian winter had changed was
co-editor of it it took him two years to
get it in versus a couple of months they
pushed back they did everything they
could to stop it he fought back and
finally got it published I gotta tell
you I've talked with this gentleman
several times I wouldn't bet against him
I and but you know how long when we're
all dead and these guys can wait people
out a long long time so here's the
thought from carl sagan here that
suppressing unpopular thoughts has no
place in science but guess what guess
what it happens all the time this is the
gentleman that is responsible for the
air sibo radio Observatory in Puerto
Rico right here he didn't bat a thousand
he thought the astronauts were going to
land on the moon and sink out of sight
and forever into moon dust didn't happen
a couple of other things you can do
he is an absolute science heretic and
absolutely brilliant man he says it
happens you know the suppression of
conflicting information happens all of
the time so and here is mr. dutoit this
is the the introduction to his book that
he put out that was roundly ridiculed
and mocked turns out he is probably the
greatest living field geologist in all
of history here and he was basically
dead right so you can be driven out of
town right even though you're dead right
you may think that I have cherry-picked
examples actually the experiences are
present in in in virtually every
instance in every scientific discipline
here's just a few and there's a book out
called the politics of excellence and it
actually publishes the the letters that
were exchanged by the people who were
picking who is going to get Nobel prizes
right about all of these gentlemen are
correct Emanuel Blonsky affair right the
guy was dead wrong but boy they they
wrote him out of town and apathy on the
worst beating that's probably ever
occurred another really good one is the
Washington channeled scablands I have
that fully developed but we can't get to
it today okay so now we're winding down
home stretch here resistance to change
is probably a biological reaction to
novelty it occurs in everybody with
different intensities you need to make
sure that if you're going to innovate
that is is welcome if it is unwelcome if
novelty and new news is created or
treated as bad news right don't even
bother talking about it our regards of
where you are innovation is very
disruptive it is an insult to the status
quo and people are pretty happy
generally without status quo unlike Wall
Street that privatized gain and
socialized loss
right unwanted innovation socializes the
gain and privatize its risks you will
look like that person that's
unemployment I guarantee it because it
gets the managerial antibodies up and
going because we have these templates we
lay over every every situation and we're
magnificent at spotting deviation from
the Templar we are deviation machine
innovation typically involves a
four-letter word now I value my
invitations to come to Google and talk
so I'm not going to say that four-letter
word and i'm not going to spell that
four-letter word I'm going to let Tom do
it that's it so if you want to go after
a competitor what you do is you go in
and you look at the industry that you're
going to compete in and you find out
five or six different ways to compete
that are different from what your
competitor is doing and when you do that
it is so unpleasant it is so inauthentic
that you will likely be ignored for the
runway that you need to get up to speed
and overrun them it takes a lot of work
ok last conclusion do not beep Anglo
seein you know Pangloss and candied best
of all possible worlds just try and be
realistic about how it's going to go
brace yourself because you can be
absolutely blindsided by the reactions
to innovation I mean a lot of people
there's no there there for them to put
it so it just it just can't get in there
right thought collectives do web search
on the term thought collective and
little bit flac beautiful concept it's
it's like groupthink but it's much more
powerful you're going to have to hang in
there you're going to have to get
cheap-shotted and you want to save the
easy downhill competitive path for your
customers right they'll do a great book
titled innovation attackers advantage
list the the the defenders hubris dr.
seven of you try and listen to everybody
to the point where you got a ship
there's a difference between ignorance
and stupidity with ignorance you can go
in you can pop and you can go in and
reflash and you can give a new load
module and boom everything's off and
running stupidity is nothing you can do
about just because somebody doesn't
agree with you and as arguing with you
he doesn't get it please just like
Standard Oil they're not necessarily
stupid they're just unaware and they are
living in within their cognitive bias
envelope nobody bats a thousand or is
omniscient or infallible to see that
everything I mean like you guys do a lot
of projects and you put them out there
and and you know they go out there and
said well you know what didn't work so
let's salvage what we can and let's
let's pull the string on it that's what
you have to do wonderful quote by Harold
be harbor he says science and companies
and social activities usually are just
the best things that people can do at
the time with what they have right there
things change so you need to you need to
move with the changes as well great
article he wrote why wars are lost and
it's by hanging on to the past too long
where's your Fineman have lunch with him
someday incredible by expanding the
frontier its scientists and expanding
frontier of ignorance and so Fineman is
saying this Nobel Prize winner I got to
tell you this this guy was electric
absolutely electric say this is my take
on it omniscient infallibility that's in
short supply haven't found any yet I'm
found anybody I'll welcome to the human
condition so innovation is successive
realization there's lots of surprises
you're probably well served by not
considering a surprise and labeling with
the word failure there's a parting
thought now we're all in a big
scientific struggle right now on
anthropomorphic global warming agw I
have to tell you I i wrote the corporate
white paper for Symantec Corporation on
the green data center actually use some
of your guys research and believe me I'm
all for renewable energy
and you know green data centers and
energy conservation everything else like
that i have to tell you the science on
this stuff yeah it is not done it is not
over there's going to be a lot of
surprises in this stuff here i I'm
neither an advocate or a detractor to
the proposition of a GW I honestly don't
know the problem is is that we don't
understand exactly how the Sun works
they just admitted that about three
weeks ago and you know the good old
thermohaline current seem to be doing
just fine right now Oh surprise surprise
and there's these wild cards of India
and our good amigos over in Beijing we
don't know what they're going to do and
I haven't seen in many instances that
they get a plus on playground behavior
so it's going to be a real problem even
Al Gore says scientific enterprise will
never be completely free mistakes I will
follow al anywhere but only out of
curiosity the other thing is a wall
street has placed bets here right we're
from wall street with her helm right
here we have Dick Fuld and mr. repo 105
who didn't know a thing about it right
yeah right and then there's Bernie boy
who's cooking over in Tennessee or
someplace like that right I there's
there's a lot of things that we don't
know that are going on a lot of a lot of
forces that are employed here's a
thought idealism is great but its
approach this reality the cost becomes
impotent and the guys over in East
Anglia I think been pretty thin skinned
the good news on East Anglia's is that
we're all finally going to get the data
that everybody's been asking for for
about five years so maybe something you
know can come of this but this is George
lichtenberg the guy that said Chladni on
his meteorite so here's some books you
may want to read calculus or sleepiness
versus Newton longitude how how how
industry tried to rip off the guy to
solve from addington excuse me of how
Eddington shafted a Chandrashekar on
black hole of course there's the
standard you know on structure of
scientific revolutions this book here
it's a very easy read it was written 60
years ago it is virtually forgotten it
is magnificent on unbiased critical
thinking it's one of the greatest book
that red brett's is flood the Washington
scablands controversy right sided a look
on the hazards of being pangalos ian and
hopelessly optimistic and of course dr.
Adrienne winters anatomy of a
controversy I'm Cornell so this is what
it takes for me to put together a
presentation like this this is just part
of my bibliography here and it takes
enormous effort because when you get
involved in the middle of these things
you find out that what is documented in
a lot of places is incorrect I've tried
to go back to the original source of
some of these books go back into the
1800s and in like in my battleship
evolution talk that I gave here actually
did used google books encyclopedias that
were published in eighteen eighty five
at the University of Michigan so it's a
lot of work I'd like to thank everybody
for being so patient and for the
gentleman for trying to pull my leg on
the auto meteorites game there it's been
a privilege and a pleasure thank you
very much I'm here for question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
