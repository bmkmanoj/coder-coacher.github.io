putra who is from the University of
Waikato she is Ian Witten student there
she is working under a Google
scholarship to study ebook user
interfaces and she's going to present
some work that she just presented at the
joint conference on digital libraries
Veronica so I think first of all I wanna
say thank you for giving me the
opportunity to talk about my PhD project
which focusing on simulating electronic
document using the book metaphor for
today's talk I'm gonna explain about how
to turn the pages of an electronic book
so that line of my talk will be first
I'm going to explain what the book
metaphor the evolution of the book users
reading behavior and techniques to
Moodle page turning then i will show you
my book for top example that uses one of
these picturing mechanisms and I will
summarize metal so it will be a very
short roll
there are actually lots of debate on the
use of the book metaphor some people
believe that it is useful using the book
metaphor because people already familiar
and have experience with it the others
believe that it's actually useless using
the book metaphor it actually met the
potentials of an electronic book it may
even lead to a poor design they believe
that it actually doesn't matter how the
new representation look like once you
start familiar with it they will no
longer rely on the book metaphor and so
they are saying don't judge a book by
it's cover judge it by its content and
those expert belief that's only the text
that is important the physical
properties of the document it doesn't
matter at all however this is not how
human are trained our human brain
already trained unconsciously to use the
physical properties of the document to
tell us about the documents age usage
and quality using the right text format
is important because it essentially tell
how the knowledge is organized and
presented which in turn affects how you
serve reading comprehension and reading
experience
to refer thousand years of its history
the document format has gone through a
series of changes the main motivation
for this chain is to find a format that
is economical portable and user-friendly
surprisingly we can also find the same
evolution in the development of the
electronic document format so the three
main document format are Scrolls
concertinas and the codices in the
scroll format document is represented in
a long five pages right and the user
need to use so if it's a electronic then
you have web pages the user have to use
the scroll bars to basically roll an
unreal document to search for a passage
another example of the scroll format is
the teletype wallpaper the second format
is the concertinas this is the
intermediate format between scrolls and
Cody sees it was preferred over Scrolls
because when it is I'm looking for my
props okay so when it is folded it
resembles like a book you can randomly
access any page an unfolded concertina
is essentially a scroll providing a
backward compatibility an example of
this format are the central printing
papers adobe acrobat reader and
microsoft word print preview where users
can either use the scroll bars or the
page up and down button to go to the
next page a user study shows that for a
short documents users prefer scrolls
offer the concertina formats because
they already used to using scroll longer
than concertinas however for a long
documents user actually do not prefer to
your Scrolls because they can easily get
lost in the flow of information just
moving the scroll bar slightly can
change the screen content completely
that's why the OSU's page up and down
buttons when the concertina although it
helps user gain better understanding of
the documents logical structures they
are still find it hard to know where
they are on the documents
and the length of the documents itself
so this brings me to the last document
format which is the Codex format this is
the standard document format it was
preferred over the concertinas because
it uses less material which means that a
cheaper is easier to read em store and
is portable and recently many
researchers try to simulate electronic
document using the book metaphor they
find that the user gain a better
documents like understanding about
documents logical structures and also
that the user already understood the
book metaphor so they know exactly what
to do without they need to say oh you
need to turn the page or something like
that adding functionality such as
annotation highlighting can increase
readers engagements and fulfillment so I
guess everyone already seen this video
so I'm just going to skip it yeah or do
you want to watch it okay sure
I'm Willie left the door open all the
lovely samba school ap photo/kathy coke
a couple to the hell yeah yeah yeah yeah
done that's a song on cornell so okay
then let's all stop the talk was right
at certain locations because we love
them together well i can i'm only gonna
gimme a hug so need you to concentrate
in this ed hello get texting some comedy
there's the tory talk e and put it on d
I'm of my god daughter will unless you
sing alongs up for check the text night
the blondes okay regarding when the
baccalà a lobotomy Lord is about can
cut off that ok flipped it on no school
up ahead store this almond 30 minute
yeah I'm up tonight so it doesn't he get
along tonight okay did you get booster
super to you Fred you have that
fraternity successful students okay I'm
fried a little bit of the novel format
man let's get through this huh satara
etiology though oh my kids of law in
Lyon Burke
yeah pretty good okay okay yeah oh no
son okay oh so we're gonna lie and blah
blah blah them all Tabaka oh la la liga
liga yeah oh my god let's go up on it so
ball you can I hope it that can be kinda
it's all cool photography she definitely
keep it up or down said night so that
tunnel okay so as you can see that face
turning is the important applications in
a book a user study done by Catherine
Marshall actually shows that page
turning is actually a combinations of a
complex lightweight navigation as i will
show you in this series of photographs
so here we have a girl that reading her
favorite magazines and as you can see
that she already anticipating herself to
turn the page what is the reading the
first page and then she partially turned
the page and see said that it's because
you want to look ahead the content of
the next two pages you want to get more
context of what's happening with the
articles once you fully turn the page to
make the magazine into a double page
display again she said that you want to
get overview of how long is the article
going to go for and about the art about
the context that she is going to read
and when she satisfied with that you
fold the magazine into one page spread
and then focus yourself reading on the
last page so while reading users are
always anticipating themselves to turn
the page the same behavior also can be
seen when they're reading an electronic
documents or using an electronic book
readers they always place their mouths
or their scroll bars near the
navigational buttons or the scroll of us
and
although clicking educational button is
defectors user actually briefly lose
contact with the text which means that
they cannot sadly look ahead the content
of what is the next page while they are
still reading the first page they always
just have to go to the next page there's
no middle bit this is why simulating a
realistic page-turning is important when
we want to simulate a realistic
page-turning we always have a trade-off
between the accuracy and the speed if
you want our page turning to look as
realistic as possible then it will be
complex to compute which means that it
is slow to render there are two top of
simulation geometric simulations and
physical simulations in the geometric
simulation the appearance of the page is
defined by a set of mathematical
equations which means that it is simple
and fast to compute but it may not be
accurate and is also restricted the
second simulation is the physical
simulation in this simulation the
appearance of the paper is defined by
the material properties of the paper and
the forces that we apply to the paper
which means that the simulation is
accurate and flexible but it is complex
and slow to compute when we want to
create a realistic page-turning we want
to find a model that not only look
sufficiently realistic but it has also
to be scalable to handle large page
count and computable in real time
sorry what is accurately means look
realistic like look like a real book a
real page sorry okay so for this stuff
I'm going to explain about 30 page
turning techniques that have
investigated implemented during 6 months
of my PhD project the peeling method
particle method and the finite element
method but before I start explaining
about the page turning models that I
implemented I will explain but the
British Library turning the pages
project because this is the project and
inspired me to actually find my own page
turning and techniques signed it British
Library turning the pages project read
your sets on it like a touch screen
display big touchscreen display and they
can basically metaphorically grab the
corner of the page and swipe their
finger across the display to turn the
page and as you can see that the band is
luxury dimensional and the binding move
in sympathy to where they are when they
turn it and I will show you a video of
their promotional real so many years
people have been asking to see more
pages than we can display any exhibition
galleries more access to those important
books the British Library is committed
to a digitization program that will make
our collections available to the widest
possible audience now what windows vista
allows us to do is deliver some of those
programs in very creative ways we're
going to make the turn pages toolkit
available to libraries throughout the
world and they can quite simply put
their collections online
10kg seems to appeal to everyone and and
we've had positive feedback from people
from all over the world saying that this
is exactly what the internet should be
useful okay so as you can see that
Microsoft actually supporting this
project at the moment and the way that
the simulation work is actually by
taking photographs at each intermediate
page turn point so for example if you
have to book and you want to turn this
page then they take photographs on this
this this and this and so essentially
what is shown to the user is not the
computed model of the book but if your
series of images which means that the
turning pub is predefined so the cost of
creating your book into the stirring the
pages book if you have a thick book then
if 200 US dollars right if it's thin
book it's 2,000 years dollars and you
might think that yeah that sounds
reasonable thick book two hundred US
dollars but is actually per page right
so Microsoft willing to pay about 10,000
u.s. dollars for a 500k you spoon so for
like my presentation which is 32 pages
then you will cost me 64,000 US dollars
and I don't have much money like
Microsoft so I decided to create my own
page turning models okay so the first
method is the feeling method this is the
example of the geometric simulation
method in this scaling method the paper
is divided into three sections the
physical part of the page bing turn the
group green but the crease polygon and
the refilled area underneath the page
bing term because we ignore the
translation in the Z directions meanings
that the crease polygon is the exact
reflection of the refilled polygon and
it can be computed by drawing a line
that is perpendicular bisector to the
line CP because in this method we
actually computed the model of the book
that mean that the turning part is not
predefined which means that I can
actually turn the corner to the place
like whatever it's not just one one way
like in the British Library turning the
pages project however because this is a
geometric simulation model that mean
that for each different type of paper I
have to create a new set of mathematical
equations so for flexible paper we can
use peeling but for our sticks oops
sorry
how do you right click in this I'm
serious okay so basically it's become
not universal so in this simulations we
choose a physical simulations and the
physical simulations because we take
into account the material properties of
the paper and the forces that we apply
to the paper this means that it can be
used for any type of paper just using
one formula it consists of four major
components the misrepresentations the
internal forces external forces and the
time integrations so the first method is
the particle method I do control okay
because yes so I can show you this
teflon hang on sorry so if it's a stiff
paper then it will look like that right
so we shouldn't we using a shearing
method instead of the peeling method
okay thank you
okay so in a particle method we divided
the papers into n by n particles that is
connected with oops with three different
types of Springs stretched spring here
spring and the band spring for each of
this type of spring we can choose a
different spring constants which means
that we use the spring constants to
simulate the material properties of the
paper so for example if you have a
normal flexible paper it's not easily
stretch and here but this can be easily
been then you choose a high spring
constant value for the stretch and here
spring with small constant value for the
band the second internal force is the
damping force this is the friction force
within the deform material and the two
extra of and the two external forces and
the applied to the paper is the gravity
force and the user force and we can
calculate the position of the paper at
the next time step we're using Euler's
explicit time integration with just a
normal Newton's law however because we
do not want to create the pet stimulate
page being torn from the book we have to
use a limits training which basically
says that the paper cannot be stretch or
shared more than ten percent of its
original length so if we have two
particles particles I and J and then we
basically said that say if the original
link is one and at the next time step
the original aim is to then basically we
move both particles closer together so
the length become only one point one
however if one of those oops
sorry
that's weird never happen I think us i
use windows sorry okay i can just back
in time sir so basically ok so that's
particular if it's in fixed positions
for example it's on the spine of the
book then we move a particle j closer
together to particle I so you can see it
so we just refresh you
um I can do it rustic so
okay so
this is how it look like so if you can
see there's actually the pink pit which
is actually the force so this I'm
simulation it look more realistic and
appealing method however it's the paper
still look rather springing because we
use a spring this is why I use a final
element message next one so in this
finite element method the paper is
divided into M by n elements and each of
this element is then divided into three
layers the bottom layer the middle layer
and the top layers for each of this
element we then calculate the internal
forces the external forces and the time
integrations so the first internal
forces is the stress this is the force
that we applied on each patch it can be
calculated by multiplying the
deformation matrix with the strain so
strain is just the deformation of the
paper and the deformation metric
characterize the stress-strain
relationship so this metric is the one
that define how the paper should react
under certain forces it defined by three
constants the young modulus of
elasticity the poisons ratio and the
shear correction value so this for bed
at the top is basically saying that if
we have a paper that is elongate on the
X direction even though just a little
bit then it will be compressed on the y
directions but if you have paper that is
compressed on the X direction then we'll
be along it on the y directions so the
strain is actually the spatial
derivatives of the point displacement so
instead of calculating every
displacement on each point in the
element we define eight reference points
so that we can so we put the red
reference points on the middle layer and
by doing this we can define the position
XY position of any points in the element
relative to this at reference point then
we define normal factors of the middle
layers at each of these at reference
points so by doing this we then define
the dead positions of any points in the
element
so the so we have to use the middle
layer because we want the x and y
position and then the thickness is to z
but that's why we use the normal vector
so basically is using this formula where
the w is actually the interpolation
functions and the sci ETA Zeta is
basically the XYZ local coordinates in
the element right and because we can
write the displacement is basically the
position of the point at this time step
minus the position of the point at the
next time step and because we can define
the position of any point relative to
the positions of the reference point
that mean we can write the displacements
of any point from the displacements of
any reference points and so we can write
the stress is equal to K times Q where K
is the stiffness matrix and q is the
displacements of the ape reference
points if you see this closely is
actually look similar to the spring
force only we use metrics instead of
spring constants so again the two
internal forces will be stressed and
damping and again we use match damping
matrix instead of jumping constants
similarly with the external forces and
so basically using again physics law
internal force equal external force and
by doing this we can find the
acceleration using the numark implicit
time integration install this is a look
like
so this one is look more realistic than
the particle method however this is
actually just a video right in real time
actually take about one hour to do this
page turning yeah so it's not realistic
to use it in real world especially in
just a normal workstation pc so this
means that out of this for pestering
model of course we can't use the british
library is too expensive the finite
element method it's basically too long
so we have choice between peeling and
the particle method will well the
peeling method is look not so realistic
it can be done just by using a
lightweight programming environment like
here i use flash it's because um in
feeling is just one mathematical
equations well in particle method we
have differentiation integration which
means that we need a stronger
programming environment so we have to
use something like java applet and
because the goal of making the book
prototype is basically to create a joke
new document representation that load
fast so people can view it quickly then
we can't use the particle method and
this is why i choose the peeling method
because i can do it just using flash
instead of Jaffa Jaffa but where users
need to install more software's so now i
will show you my book part up example do
i get internet connection here internet
connection
oh she just kick um okay si si si things
okay just open it
not working for my can play yep
oops
ok
sure so what I show you before was
actually taking from my Microsoft Word
Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and
then I comfort them into flash so i can
have any missions and video but my
portable application also can accept
like a PDF file so if you have one PDF
file you tell me the file name and
actually i will run a script to make it
into like a book so this is an example
from the internet archive collections
the robin hood one and then the way that
this loading work not only because flash
load faster than PDF it's also because
the pages that a lot is only the pages
that users want to see so in I don't
download like the whole 1005 just four
pages at the start and when you serve
when user flip again then just utter two
values and it's all cash so you sort
don't have to do it again yep and this
work
tops
yeah then you can zoom in and zoom out
as well okay and they can jump into any
page bit low so sorry so basically that
as you can see in here right if it is
you're in a PDF you can actually say
where you are on documents or how big
exactly your documents right away just
by looking at it but in here you can
actually if you get through you know
using the side edges of the book and you
can sell exactly where you are under
documents and how big is your document
so this is an advantage again to the PDF
format and so I go back it also can
accept an HTML file so if I have one
HTML file Q this is taken from the Green
Zone humanity development library sconce
control
so this is like the HTML files right and
if I few Souls then basically you have
the metadata of the section name and
what's the content of the sections and
because i have this then in my book i
can have this bookmark and create
automatic table of content of where they
states objections and section started
you can jump into a page course and they
can go to the bookmark and if you want
to feel where all the pictures are then
you just change it snap to pictures and
you know exactly where all the pictures
are so as you can see that this is
really fast that mean like I can add
more functionality to the books without
like any added computational time
because it's all really fast and if you
want to be saved for example this is my
favorite example from my supervisor he
said that book is really you know you
can't change the real book from
hardcover softcover right so let me
change that to discover
okay so this is like the advantage of
having digital book right so you can do
more things that robot book can't okay
so if you want to play around that's
basically the URL you can buy wrong with
my books okay to summarize so patient is
an important education feature in a book
all the clicking navigational button is
effective in digital settings user
actually briefly lost contact with the
tax which means that it's become
interruptive this is why simulating a
realistic positioning is an important
feature it's not only engaging users to
like start turning the page and look
pretty as well but it actually also
allow user to brief you look I have the
content of the next two pages and this
doctor have presented three picturing
models the peeling particle method and a
finite element method where the peeling
has become the chosen one because it
required lightweight programming
environments and the finite element
method is the one that's most realistic
so my next step of my project it's
basically to add more functionality to
the book just to make it more usable
like searching annotations bookmarking
highlighting in like Bill so maybe
adding some recommended reading stuff
like that and then I will evaluate this
prototype against the conventional
representations which I have to think
about or so yeah thank you and if there
are any questions
yeah I mean you've shown a lot of
examples basically argued that it repeat
um good my question is really you've
argued that page turning is really
important and I'm wondering what's the
evidence for that so I mean we've seen a
lot of videos of things but what's the
argument that page turning is a actually
important functional part of the book
experience okay so I have the first one
is because people actually when they
look at the patient they know exactly
what to do unlike scroll saw when I'm
sure to users this is not text heavy
user right they look at my book they
know exactly what to do they say oh I
want to turn the book but net scroll
there like a bit confused what to do and
then do you have any evidence for that
yeah I have done informal your source
sandy I don't bring it here yeah I'm
sorry and the other thing is also people
of options so for example if you want
just you know efficiently just clicking
the next button you can so it will just
go flip flip flip flip or if you want a
stirring then you can it's just another
options for users as well because it
doesn't add those you know adding
overhead on them anyways so I guess what
I'm really trying to get at is this is a
lot of work for something that may not
be crucial for the user experience
that's what I'm trying to get this sense
of whether or not it's really important
and why you believe it's important well
well when I did my initial you know
informal your society they actually show
that they want this page turning so
that's why I don't
yeah you fight away when you do the a
spinning do you do you provide a way
when you do the page turning to turn
multiple pages I see you turning just
like to the next page but can you turn
like pick through a little bit so at the
moment see this is just a prototype
right so you mean like if you want to
god Rick left a few pages like two or
three and see the content like three
pages down you know sometimes when you
thumb through the corners of a book
you're looking for something okay yeah I
have an implement that functionality
yeah yeah but I will I was just
wondering if you had thought about what
the how the user would do that you know
how would you distinguish picking the
very next page from picking two or three
pages down yeah inter out the UI yep
okay so basically at the moment I use
heuristics that if the pages is about
like ten five turn sorry then you will
do like those flood which are will
implement but if it's like far then you
would just throw it away go to that page
so you sir don't have to do it but of
course there's an option that user can
change so if they want to continue to
flip then they can as well okay thank
you any question yes
yeah so that will be manic for sure yeah
I'll annotations and highlighting and
searching basically just to make the
book more usable and yeah that will be
neck my neck starts any other questions
