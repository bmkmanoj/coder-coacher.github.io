your host for this talk our speaker
today is dr. Justine Cassell she is
currently the director of the
human-computer interaction Institute at
Carnegie Mellon University which is
certainly arguably one of the best
places for a research and human-computer
interaction in certainly the country to
arguably the world and she's going to
tell us a lot about the kind of work
that goes on there and how they think
about users and what they do with
computers before that Justine was at
Northwestern University and was director
of their Center for technology and
social behavior and then before that she
was at the MIT Media Lab and she has an
even more checkered career having
started out at Frances University -
Bence a song with Dartmouth and also the
University of Edinburgh apparently she
went to get all her travel out early in
her life and then did her doctorate in
linguistics in psychology from the
University of Chicago she's done a lot
in conversation either between humans or
between humans and computers and that
has led to an interest in storytelling
which has led to side interests in
things like autism spectrum and embodied
conversational agents which I'm sure you
will explain to us and so with no
further ado I'll let her get started
thank you
thank you so actually today I'm not
going to be talking about a particular
strand of my research which is usually
what I do when I give a talk instead the
argument that I'm going to be making is
a meta argument a meta claim about the
field of human-computer interaction I'm
going to be claiming that whereas
studying the user usually comes fairly
late in our process first you do your
work and then you add a nice layer of
what the user does with your work
instead we should be studying people
early and often we should be studying
people before we have any technology in
mind and then at every step of the way
through our design process and then
again and the argument that I'm making
today is that that kind of integration
of understanding human behavior with
implementing technical systems allows us
not just to build better technical
systems but to better understand the
people of today who are increasingly
tightly integrated with the technology
they use now I'm contrasting that view
with some early views of the role of
studying the human or the role of the
human in human-computer interaction and
I'll start with this quote from lick
letter 1960 which was really perhaps one
of the early statements about the
integration between people and computers
and the name of this was man computer
symbiosis the hope is that in not too
many years human brains and computing
machines will be coupled together very
tightly and that the resulting
partnership will think as no human brain
has ever thought and processed data in a
way not approached by the information
handling machines we know today that was
pretty radical for 1960 it was pretty
forward-thinking but it's left a legacy
it's left a legacy where the integration
of cognitive psychology and computer
science
is in fact the science of a man a
middle-aged white man sitting at a
computer thinking through a math problem
with his brain and a desktop all by
himself and I'd like to claim that
that's just the tiniest bit outdated
perhaps you don't agree but I think that
today we might argue that that
middle-aged white man lik litter and his
friends may have been replaced by a
plethora of users and that the issues of
ethnicity and culture and race and
gender and age are no longer icing on
the cake but aspects of our work that we
can't ignore and that sitting at a
computer as liquid or said is really no
longer what we do with computers because
computers are in fabric and toys and
phones and clouds and thinking that
thing that liquid or thought computers
were going to help us with is no longer
the only thing that a computer is good
for because today computers are
integrated into feeling and sensing and
moralizing and relating to other people
and that famous math problem that
computers were going to help us solve
has largely been forgotten in favor of
telling stories learning to read finding
friends saving the world and that dyad
that liquid are set up between the man
and the computer is no longer the only
unit of analysis that is important for
us to analyze because we work with
computers as dyads and societies and
collections of neurons all of these are
changes that have happened without their
being explicit changes in the field of
HCI to take into account the
importance of these different units of
analysis tasks populations and computers
and it's no longer the case that we
harness psychology in the service of
building interfaces these days we also
harness interfaces in the building of
psychology so the goal of the HCI that
I'm going to propose today is a new
conception of tasks and populations
computers units of analysis and human
abilities and if that goal is achieved I
think we'll build better interfaces and
we'll understand humans better so what
I'm gonna do today is rather than going
over individual projects of my work in
great depth I'm going to pick and choose
between some projects that I've done and
some projects that my colleagues have
done at the human-computer interaction
Institute at Carnegie Mellon to go
through this new conception of tasks and
populations and computers units of
analysis human abilities every single
one of these projects is you're going to
see is a 50 minute talk so I'm not going
to do them justice you can ask questions
but you might also want to check them
out in fact I hope that these will be
evocative enough that you'll want to
check them out on the web pages of the
people concerned so let me start the
outcome of what I'm going to show you
today I hope is deep knowledge of how
people play and work and learn alone and
in collaboration with others either with
or in the absence of technological
mediation and I think that by the end of
today's talk you'll agree with me that
this way of perceiving things could lead
us to a deeper ability to design
technologies that support human thinking
feeling relating to and with technology
so I'll check back in with you at the
end to see if I convinced you
so I said that the goal was new
conceptions of tasks and populations
computers units of analysis and human
abilities let me start with tasks it's
no longer just the case that we solve
math problems or that we find the place
where an aircraft is going to be by the
time our missile reaches the aircraft
that's not just the goal of computers
anymore these days the tasks can be
living hanging out so here's a first
project by my colleagues John Zimmerman
and Jody for Litzy and their students
about virtual possessions
once upon a time starts with the story a
long time ago we owned books and when we
owned books we didn't just love our
books because of what was in them but
because of the objects they were we
loved those books when we were little
until they were shredded or in my case I
felt it very important to write
annotations in the margins of course
since I was 4 the margins were mostly
the pages and when I got older I went
back to my parents home to retrieve
those objects so that I could share them
with other children in turn because
those book objects were important to me
with their annotations you can also look
at Karl Lagerfeld's house and his books
it's clear that his joy in possessing
those books his joy in the display of
those books is not limited to the
contents but the objects themselves so
the value of books is more than the
value of reading Kindle or not so we're
of our possessions gone well the cloud
and social computing ever-increasing
number of virtual possessions in such a
way that our objects are losing their
physical form these days we have books
and music photos plane tickets money all
in virtual
form and we have objects that never had
material form that we never would have
dreamed of video game avatars electronic
messages profiles behavioral logs and so
the question we might want to ask is how
is the next generation going to conceive
of things
what is a thing going to be what's the
nature of stuff in the future and how
can we design stuff to make it more
valuable this has led John and Jodi to
an extremely pleasant year following
teenagers around and watching teenagers
in their bedrooms this is just a small
number of snapshots from their gallery
of snapshots of teen bedrooms I noticed
they've chosen the neater ones so they
interviewed 21 teenagers boys and girls
about how they construct a value with
both physical and virtual possession and
then they followed those teenagers
around as they hung out in their
bedrooms alone and with their friends
they focused particularly on their
practices of engagement with stuff both
physical and virtual with things in
their room and with things in the world
and they found some really interesting
results they found for example that
photos to kids today are more valuable
when you scribble on them our parents
would have been unhappy if we scribbled
in photo albums but their photos are
virtual and so scribbles are meta data
they are comments from their friends
they found that it's important to young
people not just to own things but to
have those things have a presence that
transcends time and place so for example
a lot of the kids that they talk to
because this provides a particularly
interesting situation to think about
stuff our children from the
forced families and one of the girls
that they spoke with had a very precious
pillowcase that all of her friends had
written on when she moved so it would
have been weird to take that pillowcase
with her everywhere her friends would
have teased her so she left the
pillowcase in her mom's house and she
took a photo of it on her phone so that
it could be with her and she could put
it on her pillow in her dad's house in
its virtual form
they also found out that kids are deeply
invested in the transition from physical
to virtual and back again so one kid for
example customized an avatar he drew the
avatar on a large poster board for his
room and then he took a photo okay we're
now two steps away from the original
avatar he took a photo of his drawing of
the halo avatar and put it on Facebook
where his friends could comment on it so
there's this back and forth between the
physical and the virtual so what they're
doing today is they're looking at ways
of making possessions fit that future
model and that's the design perspective
is to think through how we can conceive
of a future that fits our desires our
beliefs our needs and our images of
ourselves so what you see on the left
and on the right is a teen bedroom that
they have built in the human-computer
interaction Institute
it's a comfy bed by the way I can vouch
for that and they have teens come out
and hang out in this conception of the
bedroom of the future what you see on
the right is the way that one of the
teenagers in their study chose to
project himself to different groups of
people in his life so that's a way of
thinking about identity with respect to
different groups and projecting aspects
of identity so what are the implications
of a
study like this well the implication for
our conception of tasks is that
something as simple and mundane and
kinda silly as hanging out is a worthy
object of study for people who study
human-computer interaction that the task
of living is in fact something that
involves computing even when we're not
doing anything per se the complexity
that's entailed by kids who have
multiple homes and multiple possessions
can lead us to examine that hanging out
as a useful task for the person who
studies human computer interaction and
the flip side of that is that HCI design
methodologies with focus fahsai I guess
on prototypes and iteration and
conceiving of possible futures can bring
us to understand better teenagers in
today's world let's go on so I said that
there was a new conception of tasks and
a new conception of populations the
study that I'm going to talk about here
one of many studies I could have
discussed some of my own work on the
issues of ethnicity and literacy and
this derives from reading about the
persistent and almost unshakable
educational divide between children who
speak non-mainstream dialects and
children who grow up in homes where
mainstream dialects are spoken so
there's an educational gap that only
grows larger as kids go through school
it's not just that children who speak
Appalachian English or southern English
or African American English go to
schools in places where the resources
are worse because it turns out that if
you hold socioeconomic status constant
and you compare children who speak aave
African American vernacular English
those children who speak a v' do less
well on reading tests than kids who
speak mainstream American English even
if you hold the resource access constant
so that led me to look at work yeah with
pleasure sorry about that
so 12% of african-american fourth
graders reached the status of proficient
on the NAEP the National Assessment of
Educational Progress in fourth grade
already 61% of African American kids do
not even receive a rating of basic on
Educational Progress so there's a really
serious educational gap and use of
dialect in the schools seems to be in
part responsible for that gap as
demonstrated by performance on the Gort
I don't have the faintest idea what the
stands for but something with reading
and testing and good goober I don't know
what you've got what is it
thank you as I was saying it correlates
with success on the gray oral reading
test the third version of the grey oral
reading test and if you hold
socioeconomic status constant that's SES
it's not up there but I may use it later
children who speak aa've African
American vernacular English do worse on
that test okay so I went to look at what
had been done in modeling cultural
diversity and dialect diversity and
these days there's a fair amount of work
on this in the intelligent tutoring
systems community in a field that's been
called pedagogical agents so these are
virtual humans who are supposed to be
like the kids that they are tutoring and
you can see some of them from one of the
most interesting studies that I looked
at it's interesting because what
cultural diversity seems to indicate to
this group of people is
The Voice is identical the content is
identical what changes is whether you're
wearing I don't know a more polite term
a wife-beater shirt and gold chains and
the sideways baseball cap
or a power suit if you look like a ditzy
blonde or if you look like you're on
your way to the office now there's a
large body of research in this same
style of changing the looks of tutors to
be the same as same as between quotes
the children who are using these tutors
and interestingly this research seems to
show virtually no effect on learning
although children may prefer to work
with an agent that is the same gender
and putative ly the same ethnicity in
one study for example only the children
who worked with the white male agent
learned the math interesting yeah I gave
a talk about this a couple of years ago
and - at a university and a student came
up to me afterwards and said I was
fascinated by your finding that people
only learn from white men and I was
wondering if this might also work in the
domain I'm working in do I therefore
design a white man to make my system
most effective so I added a slide when I
talked about this there is a problem
with this research in case that wasn't
clear it demonstrates a number of flaws
what are those flaws you can point out
some of them what's the problem with
tutors that look like this I know you
didn't expect to have to talk
they look like cartoons that's one
problem let me ask you whether they look
like cartoon representations of
mathematicians no not all of them
because these four depictions confound
images of race and gender with images of
math tutors and it's perhaps therefore
not surprising that people learn less
well from a ditzy blonde or a homeboy
than they do from somebody who looks
like a math tutor so how do we make this
better how do we make depictions of race
and gender that are not insulting and
that are in line with the kinds of
learning gains that we want children to
make but also in line with what we know
about ethnic diversity the importance of
diversity the importance of identity so
how can we draw on ethnic diversity to
make interfaces that do have a positive
effect on learning is that a question no
okay
I decided to start by looking at axes of
identity construction more generally so
we all indicate our identity in
different contexts in different ways we
use how we dress our jewelry our
hairstyle or language use our movement
it's not that sideways baseball caps are
bad it's that we may not wear sideways
baseball caps when we're tutoring math
it's not that any particular way of
dressing is bad it's that we use dress
and voice and movement and hair to index
our affiliation with particular groups
I'm trying hard to look like an academic
I'm succeeding greater to a greater or
lesser extent at other times in the day
I might want to look less like an
academic and those looks might derive
from idiosyncrasies of Who I am but also
from my beliefs about
how to demonstrate my affiliation with
one group and my difference from another
group so if we look at the population of
children who speak African American
English in that light first of all if
you've read about a v' you know that
it's a real dialect and by real dialect
I mean it's something that has a
phonology morphology a syntax that are
as distinct from mainstream English as
mainstream English is distinct from
Italian and Bloomfield famously said in
the 1920s that the difference between a
dialect and a language was an army and a
navy if you don't have an army and a
navy of your own you speak a dialect so
a v' is a real language it's a real
dialect it is not bad English any more
than Italian is bad English it's true
that not all african-americans in the
United States speak
heyyyyyy which is another way of saying
if not all african-americans use a van
dahl context and African Americans are
not the only ones to use AIF in fact
increasingly and interestingly we find
that Hispanic teenagers are using a v'
to signal particular aspects of
alignment with hip-hop culture for
example but the majority of African
Americans use some a v' to signal
identity in some contexts including
those who claim that it's evil Oprah
Oprah Winfrey for example who has
publicly said that a v' is evil speaks
it herself and there's a lovely new
paper demonstrating that she code
switches she switches in and out of a v'
at different points in her show so the
questions that arise then are when and
how and why do some children switch from
a v' to mainstream English is it just
language that's correlated with
particular aspects of African American
identity or are there also patterns of
movement of body movement that go along
with it if dialect use is about identity
how do we teach use of the mainstream
code without destroying features
of identity that are important for our
images of ourselves and how do we use
all of these answers to build
educational technology well because I
believe that we should study human
behavior early and often my students and
I set out to watch children interact
with one another when those children
were speakers of aive speakers of ma e
mainstream American English or children
who switched between one and the other
so let me show you these two use a
weight to test whether they have done
their job successfully okay and you get
a sense of what their language is like
this is classic West Side of Chicago hey
ve
so Ava's different in different parts of
the country but there are some
commonalities and this has some of the
key features of African American English
in of African American English okay so
after they built this bridge we went in
and we said you guys did great such a
good job in fact that maybe you'd like
to bring your bridge in and show it to
the teacher and they thought that was
great they were being rewarded with
bringing it to sharing time and we said
do you want to practice talking about
the bridge and the decisions you made
before you bring it into the teacher
they all thought that was a good I
dear we said okay how about you take
turns being the teacher and the student
and then you can bring it in and as with
all of our research with kids we then
left the room because kids behave very
differently when there are adults in the
room and here's what happened
now finish I do know how to jump high
you get the idea
do you see any differences different
language use not just different language
used but different ways of carrying the
body first of all about the language in
this second little video it's really
uncommon for third graders ever to say
say for instance but that boy said
say for instance and earlier you heard a
very different enunciation Brandon so
and we saw a lot of that they pulled
their body up there was no dancing the
key leaned their arms on the table if
you're a teacher this is horrifying by
the way but it's also extremely
interesting because both of these boys
as well as all of the children we tested
go to a school that 98 percent African
American and these particular children
were described to us as kids who were
incapable of speaking mainstream
American English the teacher said they
will never speak it in the classroom no
matter what the teacher does so there's
a puzzle here if they're so incapable of
speaking mainstream American English how
come they can switch into it at a
moment's notice and how come they switch
into it when they're pretending to be
students but not when they're real
students kind of odd we look to
sociologists for an explanation and John
Agnew who is a sociologist at Berkeley
describes something called the
oppositional divide where inadvertently
teachers set up a conflict culture in
the classroom an oppositional divide
between home culture and school culture
and children feel they have to switch
they have to choose one or the other
they can't have both so these children
may not want to switch to mainstream
American English because they may feel
that they're giving up their home
culture as opposed to being allowed to
have both how did we get around that
well first of all we looked at what the
children did we discovered that some
children did not change their language
at all but the majority did 14 kids
reduced by two-thirds their use of
African American English when they were
being either the teacher or the student
and DDM stands for a dialect density
measure Washington and Craig who are -
speech pathologists came up with this
measure as a way of looking at how much
dialect a given child speaks so most of
the children reduced by two-thirds their
use of a when they went from being peers
to being teacher and student we use
those results to do something fairly
straightforward
we built a virtual child that's because
it's hard to get the institutional
review board or IRB to allow you to sink
electrodes into real children's heads to
make them do what you want them to do so
we built virtual children who are
capable of code switching and we had
them do exactly the same task and by the
way we used Markov modeled on the child
child corpus in order to make the
virtual child say in a given context
what a real child had said to another
real child so all of the virtual child's
behavior is based on the corpus we
collected of child child performance and
here's the virtual child
okay so you get the idea
first of all kids are engaged with
virtual children remarkably engaged
really tightly engaged second of all
when the virtual child speaks
african-american English
so does the real child so the children
are speaking the same dialect with this
virtual peer that they spoke with their
real peers well you know the next step
the experimenter came in and said you
guys did a great job at building a
bridge would you like to bring it into
the classroom ignoring the fact that the
virtual peer has no legs and therefore
can't walk into the classroom children
thought that was a great idea maybe
you'd like to take turns switching back
and forth being teacher and student and
here's what happened
what did you do math so you can see that
the virtual child of his Mouse
okay so you get the idea and what did we
find
well we found that the sophistication of
the children's speech measured by
something called the ml U or the mean
length of utterance increased
significantly between the bridge tasks
the teacher tasks and the student tasks
we also had something called picture
description where the expend
experimenter asks the children to
describe pictures and I won't talk about
that here if we took all of the children
together as one group the dialect
density measured did not change between
one task in the other but we had a hunch
about that and so we divided the dialect
features into phonology that is accent
and morphology that is the endings of
words and tenses and we found that the
phonology doesn't change when they're
speaking to the virtual child but the
morphology is much reduced and that's
extremely interesting so the virtual
child is able to evoke that same
code-switching what we're doing now is
looking at places where the children who
didn't switch might be helped to switch
our emphasis is on the fact that
children seem to be willing to do things
with peers that they're not willing to
do for teachers and the implication of
this is that interface design that
sensitive to issues of identity and
culture can allow us to learn about
language use and identity in ways that
are useful to social scientists and
teachers who for example had no idea
that these children were able to use
this dialect but sent you
so that's the next step the next step of
the study is actually to have three
versions of the virtual pier one that
speaks mainstream American English one
that speaks only African American
English and one that code switches and
those are instantiations of three
theories about the best way to get
children to use mainstream American
English teachers would tell us that if
you use mainstream American English the
kids will realize that that's the right
dialect to use in the classroom
many Afrocentric classrooms in America
it's believed that if you use African
American English the children will feel
at home and will therefore be able to
use skills that they've learned in the
outside world such as code switching and
the code switching agent is an
instantiation of the theory that you
need to model the social context of
language use and we're just about to
start that and that's actually going to
be a longitudinal study with a transfer
task at the end to see whether use of
the virtual peer results in different
language in the classroom so the second
point here the second implication is
that the sensitive study of language use
and identity allows us to build
interfaces that support rather than
dissing culture and identity now I said
that we were going to look at tasks and
populations somehow two tasks fell to
the bottom and computers the HCI AI has
many many studies of interfaces
including as many of you may have seen
Chris Harrison's work on the skin foot
that's one of our graduate students
where the palm can be used as an input
device for phones and computers some of
my colleagues have worked on smart
school bags animatronic stuffed animals
construction toys here I'm just going to
very rapidly give an example of all the
places where computers are found today
in children's worlds every single one of
the objects on this slide has more
computing power than the first Apollo
launch kind of amazing but the second
fact about all of these toys on the
screen is that they talk at children
they have a model
of the child I sometimes like to say as
a little bucket with a funnel in it and
you pour the computer knowledge into
that funnel and it ends up in the child
and it doesn't really necessarily work
that way and even if it does it's not
necessarily a nice way to think of a
child and so some of my students and I a
couple of years ago looked at how we
could build a construction kit with a
very simple computing device in it as a
way of allowing children to hypothesis
test about the use of language the
application that we became interested in
was something that's quite hard for
children when they go from first grade
to second grade which is to understand
that when you tell a story you really
have to use conjunctions other than and
then anyone who's ever heard first
graders tell a story know that they say
and then he went to school and then he
went home and then he took his boots off
and then he went upstairs and then he
did his homework it's it's a good story
it's not all that creative but it's a
good story
but what's funny about it is that the
end ends are really not about time
because sometimes they'll say and then
he took his socks off and then he took
his shoes off and then he took his
Footwear off wait so they kind of have
and then as a stand in conjunction what
we did was we built two versions of this
object called the tell-tale that I call
the story worm and the tell-tale has one
version that's just one ball that you
see on the far right and one version
that's five yeah six little balls each
of which has a recording device that
records when you press its tail I think
and that plays back when you press its
nose and you can hook them together and
press the nose at the front and you hear
the whole story told back everything
that's in every little device it's very
simple what kids love about it is that
then you can switch the little pieces
and it's kind of like Mad Libs and you
get a totally different story because
the pieces are put together differently
all we did was ask children to tell a
story with a single recording device
versus the articulated recording device
and what we found was that even after
just a
of uses of this toy children were
starting to use different conjunctions
and then later but therefore and
nevertheless maybe not that one but
other conjunctions that link events in a
story we found that the body pieces
scaffolded the use of those linking or
segmenting linguistic devices and that
the body pieces led them to plan better
for storytelling really simple
experiment but it kind of puts the kid
in the driver's seat and the implication
is that if you know about the kinds of
challenges that preliterate children
face because you've listened to
five-year-olds tell stories you can
design simple but novel interfaces to a
task that children both enjoy and need
to practice before they go to school
with the storytelling and that novel
interfaces to storytelling also allow us
to conduct novel studies of children's
behavior pre-literacy which are
otherwise quite hard to study okay I'm
going to talk briefly here about a topic
that I've been thinking about a lot
which is psychology led people in
human-computer interaction to study
people that's good right because I told
you that we should study people but the
unit of analysis has been the person
increasingly however when we build
technologies we don't build them for
individual people we build them for
communities and we might not just need
to know how individual people react but
how the hive mind reacts how do
communities work this is work by Maura
Burke who's just finishing her PhD at
the HCI eye and she asked when we look
at people in online communities how does
early experience in the community affect
integration into that community and
alignment with the goals of that
community it's something that many of us
are interested in when we build
community software so she looked at
people on Facebook and she analyzed a
random cohort random in the sense that
it was all of the people who registered
for Facebook on a randomly chosen day so
that's a hundred and forty thousand two
hundred and ninety two people who signed
up for Facebook on that day and she
counted everything they did in their
first two weeks and then she predicted
whether they were going to get into
photo uploading as a part of their
Facebook experience so how do we predict
who's gonna upload photos and who's not
gonna get it who's not going to be part
of a photo community in order to
understand better what they were doing
she also did think aloud protocols where
she asked them to talk about their
experience in that photo community the
question she asked was is it a question
of social learning do newcomers who see
their friends sharing share more photos
is it a question of being singled out do
newcomers whose friends tagged them in
photos share more photos is it a
question of feedback to newcomers who
get good feedback on the photos they
upload share more photos and do
newcomers whose content is shared with a
larger audience share more content in
the long term it's a simple question but
it's a really important question for
those of us who design photo sharing
communities what did she find first of
all she found that she could divide the
community into people who uploaded
immediately who uploaded more than one
photo their first two weeks and then
people who were far less engaged in
photo uploading who didn't upload more
than one photo in their first two weeks
so she looked at those two communities
separately and the results that she
found demonstrated that with every Photo
Story newcomers saw they shared more
photos themselves so if their friends
uploaded photos they uploaded photos not
too surprising perhaps
more surprising is getting tagged even
once was really associated with an
increase in long-term photo sharing in
fact that's the most strong of the
results that she found for the less
engaged newcomers she also found that
getting even one photo comment was
associated with an increase in long-term
photo sharing and every doubling of
one's own photo stories being shared
with a wider audience was associated
with an increase in long-term photo
sharing so the largest effects were due
to feedback and tagging and I'm going to
show you something from the think-aloud
protocols in part because it relates to
this but in part because you know anyone
ever get told the user is not like me
the user is not like me the user is not
like me the user is not like me
why do you tag well I'm just assuming
that like a game of tag I'm it and now
I've tagged someone else and now I'm
done and that means my friends it and
I'm no longer it right
that's what tagging is or someone else
he said oh generally we don't tag in
family photos I mean why would you we
all know who they are
yeah okay or I love this one tag to me
connotates graffiti and that's a
negative kind of a violation of privacy
kind of stalking oops
bad word choice in tagging so what are
the implications this is a fairly
straightforward study except for the
fact that hundreds of thousands of
people were involved and the hypotheses
derive from a deep understanding of what
people need in communities what they
desire in communities and how they
operate in communities and that
understanding of why people join and
remain in communities allows us to build
communities that people want to enjoy
and remain in and those online community
design decisions play a role
in both community building and in
allowing us to understand community
building one more aspect of that old HCI
that I'm going to take down and that is
the notion of human abilities I said it
wasn't just math well it can be learning
and giving directions but it can be
something that seems as natural to us as
building relationships with other people
but that's not as natural for everybody
and I included this study because I knew
that I was going to be talking to some
of the Google folks in Boulder who are
working on the spectrum project for
children young people with autism this
is a project on looking at interface
design as hypothesis testing for
children with autism
so autism is characterized by a triad of
impairments in reciprocal social
interaction interacting in the same way
as the person were interacting with in
communication using language or even if
one's able to use language in using
language to communicate with others and
in imagination and these deficits in
social interaction in particular are
thought to derive from an inability to
understand that other Minds have
different perspectives on the world than
we do so since we had done some work
with virtual children whom I showed you
in one of the earlier studies we
wondered whether virtual children were
easy ways for children with autism or at
least easier ways for children with
autism to imagine the other and we
looked at that in a number of ways first
we compared children speaking with real
peers to children speaking with virtual
peers we did this for neurotypical
individuals people who are non ASD non
not on the autism spectrum disorder and
we looked at it for children with ASD so
in this video that I'm about to show you
on the left the little girl with the
stripes has been diagnosed with
autism spectrum disorder and she's
playing with somebody from her class
who's diagnosed was not diagnosed who is
thought to be typical and if you watch
the girl with the stripes you're gonna
see a striking lack of social
interaction with her peer
and the little girl in pink is trying
really hard to engage her so she says
she went into that house and the other
little girl doesn't pick up the cue that
she's supposed to take over the story
so she keeps giving pews yes stop she
keeps giving cues the typical girl keeps
giving cues to the other little girl
with autism that it's time for her to
pick up the story it's time for her to
carry on what's going on she does that
through I gaze she does it through
language through prosody through the
sound of her voice
once upon a time there was uh and the
other little girl doesn't pick up in any
case and at the very end there it's kind
of hard to hear and we might want the
sound a little bit louder for this but
at the very end you can hear that the
little girl who's on the spectrum
volunteers something that has absolutely
nothing to do with the story that was
going on before now let's watch that
same child with ASD interacting with a
virtual peer watch her eye gaze which is
directly oriented towards the virtual
child
she's continuing exactly the story that
the virtual child began so she's doing
the kinds of contingent and reciprocal
behaviors that she didn't do with a real
child and in fact the data bears that
out for the children that we looked at
that when we looked at the number of
contingent utterances that they produced
the children with ASD produced far fewer
than the typical children when we looked
at their interaction with their peers
the children with ASD were far less
likely to be contingent to say something
relevant and to continue the social
interaction when they were talking with
a real child when they were talking with
a virtual child they were far less
likely to add narrative content as well
now it's interesting but we don't want
children with autism to spend the rest
of their lives
talking with virtual children how do we
use this as a way of bootstrapping their
interaction to interaction with other
children the insight that we had was
that when you interact with a virtual
child you're rehearsing behaviors but
when you control a virtual child you
might be able to observe the effects of
those behaviors and get feedback and if
you can build a virtual child you might
be able to actually construct social
competence so we yes
um I do but then I don't have evidence
that bears them out yet so there are a
number of things that we know about
children with autism that makes it seem
like virtual peers might be easier for
them to interact with children with
autism 10 and adults with autism tend to
really feel uncomfortable around
unpredictable stimuli and virtual
children are predictable they tend to be
uncomfortable around real faces and for
reasons we don't understand somehow the
virtual faces seem to be less aversive
and they seem to be particularly
comfortable around computational objects
although it's recently been suggested
that all children are comfortable these
days around computational objects and so
they may not be more comfortable around
them those are some of the reasons what
we're actually doing right now is we're
looking at neuroscientific data to see
if we can understand through fMRI
through brain scans what might be going
on in the brains of children with autism
and in the brains of neurotypical
children we've already found that for
typical adults interacting with a
virtual peer is possible but more
cognitively stressful than interacting
with the real peer our hypothesis is
that the opposite will be true for
individuals with autism that it will be
easier cognitively to interact with the
virtual peer but stay tuned for that the
next step though to test some of those
hypotheses was to do this to build a
programming language to control a
virtual peer so what we did was and this
is the dissertation work of Andrea
Tartar Oh was to build a way for
children to author behaviors for a
virtual peer and to construct a Wizard
of Oz panel and in fact this came from
the fact that we were running an
experiment with virtual peers I think I
was in the closet with The Wizard of Oz
panel looking out through a people and
when I came out I decided to give that
panel to the child and say would you
like to control the virtual peer
yourself this is a child with autism she
thought that was a great idea and she
was amazingly able to choose behaviors
that she herself couldn't use and we
wanted to look at that more in detail so
here are some examples of actually I'll
just show you this one here's an example
of a child authoring behaviors for the
virtual peer and then controlling the
virtual hmm peer with the control panel
that he put together here we're making
groups of what Sam can say this is an
early prototype by the way so far
energies I can make up this weekend yeah
and okay I'm going to start okay what
else goes in that group okay right there
okay click it now click group together
group to you thank you
this child has that makes a group very
total of children with autism a very
flat prosit hey I'm going to start when
you warner make up a story together Wow
hey you wanna make another group yeah
what should Sam say so he's put the okay
I gather and now he's gonna control it I
am and that someone is interacting with
the virtual peer that he's control okay
what what does Sam say next
well I'm down one down makes up story
together
okay what do you make up in three
together yeah that sounds really fun and
wow wow now what's striking here is that
this kid is choosing behaviors that he
himself does not use when interacting
with other children and so Andrea took
this into the kind of the state of the
art intervention for children with
autism which is called the social skills
group it's a way of teaching children
social skills behavior it's extremely
kind of deterministic children are shown
scenarios and told what to do when a
child asks you a question ask two
questions back it's that kind of
instruction Andrea built the virtual
peer into that intervention and then
divided it such that different children
use the virtual peer for different of
the social behaviors that they were
taught which allowed her to evaluate
whether the virtual peer was effective
more than the social skills group by
itself and in fact strikingly first of
all she found that the very use of the
panel was diagnostic of the kinds of
behaviors that that child had trouble
with and I love this example this is a
kid with autism whose story started want
to hear a scary story well if you said
yes that's good if you said no then too
bad because I'm about to tell one not
exactly reciprocal not exactly sharing
and getting along but very typical of
someone who doesn't understand that I
talk and then you talk but for children
who talked like that the use of the
panel allowed them to think about what
they were doing and revise it so one kid
said I should have used more question
buttons
can I try it again so this is a kid who
seems to have realized that the other
child the real child in the next room
wasn't being given the opportunity to
speak enough which is a remarkable
realization and in fact it turned out
that children who use the panel for
particular skills were more likely to
use those skills when interacting with
real children later so there was a
transfer effect which is quite striking
for studies with autism okay so what are
the implications
well first we spent a long time watching
children with autism and it's
understanding the inner internal
workings of real children that allow us
to build virtual children and turning
that control panel for building real
children over to a child seems to allow
them to hypothesis test to construct
knowledge about interaction so here
we're using virtual humans as a kind of
an internalized
of all theory of mind and both stages of
this allow us both to build a technology
and to understand better the deficits
that children with thumb may suffer from
so let me finish up here what I've shown
you is a different way of conceiving of
HCI we can start at any point in this
process and go around iteratively or as
I once said in a grant proposal and
forgot to take out before I sent it off
to the NSF we go around the circle and
then we rinse and repeat I got the grant
so I guess things and he thought it was
funny as well we could come in at any
point in the circle but we always go all
the way around the circle we always look
at humans design systems implement
systems and evaluate their systems and
what I'm arguing here is that the
evaluation of those systems with a new
conception of the tasks populations
computers units of analysis and human
abilities that they afford us insight
into can both allow us to better
understand people and to build better
technical systems so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
