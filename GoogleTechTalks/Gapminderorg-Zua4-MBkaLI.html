monet and had the pleasure to introduce
a group of people from sweden from the
gapminder.org site and so we have who I
was gonna give a talk Johan and Anna
here and at a pressure of seeing another
person hands rustling from Gapminder but
a couple of weeks ago at this TED
conference were all sort of fancy people
such as you know there is your gamer ISA
a few other people from Google go and
this presentation was just a blast I
mean to give you an idea I'll go on
spoke as well and there were people who
in their slides after that had gone
rustling in 2008 so what I was going to
try to give at least as good a
presentation and we'll let him go okay
thank you for letting me speak here I
will kick start this Gapminder is a
non-profit Swedish foundation with the
ultimate goal to increase use and
understanding of international
statistics or actually development but
that would be in the understood by
statistics I'm gonna kick start and
write show a lot of stuff because the
method we have is not talk talk talk but
to visualize data okay I'm gonna like
jump between a lot of softwares so can
we turn the light down is there to get
more Kushi no okay anyway this is the
world as we recognize it you know the
environmental movement use it a lot to
show that we have one little planet we
have to be very careful with it you know
take it easy a which into this shouldn't
do that okay so they show this image I
mean it's a representation of the world
isn't it and all of us it's invoke
feelings and we get these emotions you
know that yeah maybe I shouldn't drive
the car as much as okay here is another
way of showing information
to audiences is a very common way that
we see at least that universities trying
to like play the the smart guy saying it
went from five point five to two point
nine that's a lot we have to be careful
people don't understand anything okay
but we pretend we say yeah feel a lot or
yeah that's interesting so what
alternatives would there be
yeah then we have these stuff on TV a
lot of it you know
this bald University hi
who are these guys anyway then this is
the professor you know sitting in front
of his books he read a lot of books so
we better trust the guy and he's smiling
so it's probably a nice guy he will tell
the government what to do and now is in
TV and then we have this alternative
vision of Sammy I mean I'm talking about
international development this is a very
common image showing a child now in
school happy and so on so this is
probably a good project they are talking
about this is National Geographic you
know interesting exotic people look at
the hole in her air there and they're
almost naked living close to nature I
mean she painted her breasts
what is that how fascinating people are
in other countries on play you know here
in our rich countries we are so boring
and fed up with capitalism but they they
are more real I mean we are unreal okay
this is another one you know with this
cool white male fighting dangerous
animals or people very simple setup and
we are there any white males here today
there's plenty of them did you see this
did you identify with this being Tarzan
okay these are common images from abroad
or from poor countries who call it
whatever I mean the giraffe Elizabeth
isn't she cute she's so cute but in the
background in the forest you can see
those very dangerous hunters killing the
giraffe Elizabeth
those guys they don't have any names
they are just evil you know but the this
European woman academi she goes there
and she saves the animals so she's the
good one you know my kid is now one year
old in five years from now he had will
been feeded with a lot of these images
and it will definitely form the way he
looks upon the world that there are poor
animals out there that needs to be
rescued otherwise they will be killed by
evil Africans or something like that
okay this is an alternative Robert
Redford falls in love the Sun sets and
it's just beautiful
this is the crisis we see a lot of this
all these images I'm showing are
exceptions I mean this is a
extraordinary event it happens but as
soon as there is something negative to
report we will see it this is a positive
thing but as exceptional I mean the
paradise those countries have nice palm
trees and we can go there surfing I mean
these are the images we see from poor
countries are they representative or are
they all just very biased extremely
events that actually form how we see the
rest of the world where we didn't travel
and so on I think so they need to be an
alternative image and it needs to be
fact-based and it should in some sense
represent the common life and the calm
everyday life not those extraordinary
strange fantasies of ours so we tried to
do this kind of stuff I will show you
some demos let's start with this one
which is called dollar Street so I have
to get rid of this stuff okay imagine
everybody in the world living on a 1 and
long street okay the poorest to the left
and the richest to the right so this
would be the poorest family in a refugee
camp somewhere and this would be well
who is the richest one right now
living up there and all of us the rest
of us will live in between the people in
this room probably up here in this
corner
I mean Sweden would be here okay
can we can we understand the world in
one dime
what would it look like we made this as
a game for children where you like
browse the dollar suite because if we
say this is for growing up they don't
want to look because they say well I
read books about income inequality I
don't have to look at photos but when we
say it's for children they spend two
hours looking at it and they learn a lot
so let's pick some houses let's pick
this rich South African family with a
swimming pool okay we go down the street
we pick another family let's take for
example this one a bigamist Muslim
family in Uganda look here these guys
have hundred dollars per day these have
two to five dollars per day or ten it's
very tricky to measure income but more
or less we just approximately measured
it this would be a third family with
somewhere around $1 a day so there is a
clay walls
those are brick walls and this is a
swimming pool okay so there are levels
what is poverty who is poor I mean
anybody you ask here will say I'm poor I
could need a bigger swimming pool you
see the world is unequal I mean some
people live with enormous read with
enormous resources like us but still
there are people that are even richer
that's unequal okay so how can we get an
overview that really represents how the
world is ok let's start by looking at
household we go even further down this
would be a widow in Uganda this woman
has one nice dress she put it on for
this photo we can enter her this is the
environment she lived where the water
comes up and it's really not a healthy
place to live with two of her children
sleeping in this well there is no lives
it was very difficult to take these
photos on eyes the photographer this
would be her bed where she sleep with
two kids and there they have some
plastic equipment which is very good for
health because you can clean them easily
this is her living room
okay oh please observe there are no
emotions in my voice technical
description of living condition to
understand because we all of us we grew
up I think correct me if I'm wrong at
the top of Dollar Street okay and at the
very extreme top and then we go out in
the world to save the world but we don't
know nothing about the world you know we
haven't been that we haven't experienced
the kind of decisions that 80% of the
world population are up to every day to
get food so we are not the experts okay
so we have to learn a lot let's check
how the doors look at different places
let's check how the kitchen looks like
okay so this would be a kitchen in the
middle of the large street you see there
it's under the roofs you don't get a lot
of rain and there is a brick wall quite
a good kitchen alright these are just
images as well so where is the data and
where are the facts let me try to go
over to the facts now and how could we
combine photos with with numbers this is
a thing we did for the Human Development
Report that UNDP publish every year
about the general development on earth
let me just take away those high text
boxes and please if you have any
questions don't interrupt because this
is gonna go fast Dollar Street this is
the same dollar Street you have dollars
per day one ten hundred this guy has ten
dollars per day there are six billion
people on earth let's drop them down on
dollar Street and see where they live we
hear a lot about the gap between rich
and poor increasing whoa would that be
me
so here are the six billion people I
just spread them out they have a nice
ceiling with good light windows and they
seem to be happy they are laughing and
this guy is the richest guy on earth
okay so great so we see the rich people
and the poor people the gap between
those two is increasing the problem is I
can't see any gap there is no gap there
is like a continuous mounting stuff
there is not two groups but we simplify
in our mind and think about poor and
rich because it's easier to think in
those terms but it's a continuous scale
people live in all income levels and
everybody would say they are poorest you
host them most people would so how are
we going to understand this better let's
see how this thing changes no let's
start with this the total income in the
world how is it distributed in terms of
the 20% riches this would be the rich
people they have seventy four or I
should actually say we we have
seventy-four percent of the world total
income the poorest 20% they share 2% of
the total income okay this this is what
we deal with when we have a common
environment on earth this is where we
say these people should think about the
environment but they think about getting
food and that's very it's a very simple
setup so let's see poverty line UN have
this official poverty line one dollar
per day let's go back in time to 1970
and see actually 38 percent of the world
population were below one dollar a day
these are adjusted for changes in prices
and so on to make sense let's see how it
changed year by year we move forward in
the 80s let's move forward we can see
how this mountain is growing because
more people on earth in 1990 26% had
less than one dollar per day then we
move forward even further and we see how
the world gets richer do you see a gap
between rich and poor increasing I don't
but I see general tendency people
getting richer all over the
now I want to move forward to see how
this is distributed in different regions
this would be sub-sahara this would be
Africa where actually 66% of the world
population is below the poverty line in
year 2000 the rich countries oacd the
the club of the rich I mean nobody is
actually a know whole percent is below
the poverty line Latin America is very
wide it reaches from the poorest to the
richest there are people on all income
levels the same goes for Eastern Europe
then we have the shinies region with its
neighboring countries East Asia and the
Indian group with 23% below the poverty
line let's move forward and zoom in on
the poor so this is in 1970 the poor
people were mostly in Asia because it's
so big population groups 11% of all poor
lived in Africa 56 6% in the pot where
China is East Asia and 30 in the Indian
group then an enormous economic growth
have brought a lot of people out of
poverty let me just stop to say if this
data is relevant because of course there
is an uncertainty in this data and
that's where we really want to go in in
terms of academic research in the end to
say what are the uncertainties and so on
but we try to start first by using the
data and get it understood then the
criticism will increase and then we will
get better data in the future that was
just of small lapses okay now in year
2000 it's almost one third in each of
these group if the projections for the
future are right actually in 2015 68
percent of the world's poor will be
Africans so it's a totally different
distribution of poverty on earth now I
would just like to jump over to show
different thing sort of
yeah let me just show you where you were
shine eyes in 1970 if we did this not
for regions but for for a country China
would be here and let's add USA there is
us much smaller this is in 1970 u.s. is
richer than China China is perfectly
equal everybody is poor okay so what
happened they got richer we know that
China got richer let's move forward year
by year and see how it changes we can
see how people get richer and richer and
this red ghost will soon cover us let me
do it again yeah this is what happens
scary isn't it okay so there is your
market in the future obviously okay
let's skip that part I will try to like
focus on us as much as I can okay
breathe for one second and check where I
am okay so let's go back to this image
showing the regions dollars per day what
is that how can you measure it it's
tricky but it's actually more or less
the same thing as GDP per capita more or
less I mean you can compare them so what
we did here is that now we go over to
regional averages of GDP per capita and
you learn by looking at this image how
different the distribution is compared
to just looking at the average number
because those balls will end up on their
regional averages and you don't see the
distribution within the regions we have
sub-saharan Africa now also so here it
appears to be a gap a very clear gap
between oacd countries and the rest but
when we saw the distributions we can see
that in terms of personal income it
doesn't make sense this is too
simplistic I mean you are too smart to
look at one dimension
well the world is multi-dimensional how
can we add dimensions well this was now
money let's add health in terms of child
survival how many children how the
percentage of children surviving to age
five among all born in the rich oacd
we can see oh yeah this is that health
is bad and good it's the simple way to
put it okay
and north and south on this map would
mean healthy and unhealthy
let me see right now east and west would
be rich and poor okay that's a
simplistic that you can explain to
anybody sub-saharan Africa eighty two
percent of the children survived to age
five in the rich countries ninety nine
point four it says okay let's see how
these changed actually in 1975 the two
Asian groups were poorer than Africa
both of them then this economic growth
we can now see how they leave this where
they were in 1970 Africa doesn't really
move sub-saharan Africa while the two
Asian regions move quite a lot and the
world is changing well let's try to go
beyond these regional averages Africa is
not a homogenous place as we might think
we split the African subcontinent
sub-saharan Africa into countries and it
reaches from zero Leone where 70% of the
children survive to age five up -
mauricio is almost on 98% it's a huge
difference and we can see African
countries on all different levels let's
continue splitting the rest this is the
Indian group that's why India is very
close to the big average but it reaches
from Afghanistan to Sri Lanka Arab
states is not at all the homogeneous
group it's very very very different I
mean to reach that kind of child
survival you need Social Security
systems very advanced societies East
Asia and the Pacific also a wide
distribution actually in all these
groups we will see a big distribution
Central and Eastern Europe they cover
the whole world it just doesn't make
sense to look by yo graphic region
because the countries are so different I
will later split countries as well to
show you that even the distribution
within countries are so wide so this
collection of national averages that is
being done by UN really doesn't show the
right picture but let's continue here we
have Sheila to Haiti an enormous
different between those two Latin
American countries high-income OECD well
it's by definition rich in healthy sorem
but us we come from Sweden
okay if you want to have some help we
can tell you how to do this both the
visual stuff and the child survival how
do you make children survive we know
okay we are the world champions that's
why we do this shorts yeah let's let's
just dig through this to see what we are
seeing we don't only have poor and rich
the country's all over the place okay
let's see there is also strong
correlation I see here that 30% to 0.3%
difference in child survival and 500 to
50,000 difference in GDP per capita we
have like two zeros on each of these
axis so the differences are huge in the
world these are of course logarithmic
scales let's look at some countries
Niger ends up there but on the same
economic level as Niger Eritrea's why
are they performing much better in
health well I don't have the answer
that's where you can find answers in in
the literature this is giving you the
framework to spot where our countries in
the general overview India have the same
income as Vietnam but Vietnam is much
more healthier it's also smaller South
Africa is much richer than Vietnam why
do they perform so much worse in health
health I say all the time child survival
is here considered a general health
measurement by UNICEF they say that is
the way to measure health in the society
because she wouldn't die of so many
different reasons the size of the
bubbles is of course due to population I
forgot to tell okay so we have
Malaysia United States with a different
of $9,000 in Malaysian GDP per capita
40,000 in u.s. but you perform equal in
child survival so this is kind of a
world map to to see where countries are
Singapore and Sweden are performing
better okay so we have a strong
correlation between money and health but
at the same time we can spot the out
layers
so it's like like a map let's move
forward and look at differences within
countries
let's take Bangladesh as an example it
would make a lot of sense to have
disaggregated data for example for
income groups the poorest 20% are quite
far from the Bangladesh average now we
extract the 20 richest percent and we
can have all those we can see reaching
from Eritrea to Egypt let's look at all
the five quintiles I mean 20 percent in
each of them and that is where
Bangladesh would be India also we can
see that the difference between
Bangladesh and India is smaller than the
difference within these countries let's
look at some other examples for example
Peru there the income difference is
enormous
from the poorest living close to the
Eritrean average and the richest where
hunger is of course there's a lot of
tension in these societies let's compare
it to Guatemala quite similar but the
rich people there don't get as healthy
South Africa is a special place of
course the rich people they should be up
at least in the u.s. level shouldn't
they with this money of some reason I
mean diseases car accidents etc they get
affected by these poor people living in
the same cities those are my evaluations
those are not in the data of course
Vietnam has the same health as the
richest South African all the five
income groups of Vietnam are healthier
than the South African averages even if
they are poorer so yeah there is a
connection between health and income
body etc okay we could go on for one
hour let's try to jump over to something
completely the same but a bit different
okay
this we did with Human Development
Report earlier here are the big country
the the English French Swedish Norwegian
and this you can select common languages
there
and I wouldn't do it in Swedish because
you would lose it this is a different
approach to show the same thing more or
less but in it's a difference I have
life expectancy now on this axis not
child survival the average of the world
would be there in 1975 since 1975 this
is just a very clear thing I want to say
the world has become richer and
healthier on average but we don't hear
much about that because you can't make
news out of it so now we are both
healthier and richer now I would do the
same thing a little bit faster yes to
show you that we have the same kind of
distributions in life expectancy
just to reach this image okay so here we
have how long is your life and how rich
are you you see there is no gap between
the richest and the poorest in this kind
of images I wanted to use this to tell a
story about one country in particular I
pick Botswana it's a Norwegian you say
sorry it was all the time it's a bit of
a problem now this would be English
wounded Botswana and Costa Rica ok so
let's see two case studies Botswana and
Costa Rica both are so-called success
stories in development UN and World Bank
say to the African countries already in
the seventies look at butts fauna that's
how you should do it that's how to do
how are they doing well let's copy the
thing I mean because they get richer and
healthier by every year and within 20
stops now in 1990 we didn't say 20 years
they will be in the OECD's if they just
continue like that this is what happened
so in 10 years due to hiv/aids
they lost life expectancy more than him
have gained in the earlier 30 years and
the obvious question is where will it
end where will it go
will it go back there will it go up
there
well let's take it again the economists
in the Swedish newspaper said well no
big deal you know they are still having
economic growth they are still moving to
the right so if you only look at economy
you wouldn't see this if you wouldn't
see the problem I mean okay let's move
to an example of a sub-national data set
China you have heard about China yeah
it's a very big country and mouse' tomb
was the boss for some time he said we
don't need money okay my interpretations
okay no official statement but that's
sort of what he said we only need health
and welfare so he said let aim for that
corner he goes up there and then he dies
and thinks your pain takes over and
turns to the right that's what happened
now China is an ordinary place on earth
I mean in the middle okay people from
China here you recognize this yeah okay
so what what about the differences
within China here we collected Chinese
data now we split China into regions and
those are bigger than Sweden all of them
but we don't know the names of them
unfortunately so this should of course
be in the UN data set or the Google data
set or whatever I mean it makes a lot of
sense to compare the richest region in
China with the poorest see that if we
can trust this data it actually shows up
on more or less the same health compared
to the rest of the world there is no
Chinese region down here they are all on
a very high health level so now I want
to show you as much as possible you know
this is a difference of where we made
some years earlier demo I should say
let's pick the winner here okay Sweden
are almost winner in this one it depends
on the data ok so there is where we have
Sweden now I'm actually back on child
survival on this axis and this time it's
expressed in thousands but anyway is the
same thing rich poor healthy unhealthy
let's move back in time some hundred
years oh this is where Sweden was when I
was not around so let's let's have a
look at it what does it mean actually we
are comparing GDP per capita from in the
background we have all the countries of
today but Sweden is hundred years back
so we can compare the historic data of
Sweden with the world of today and then
the the neighboring country of Sweden
hundred years ago today would be Angola
so Angola today and Sweden hundred years
ago end up on the same GDP per capita
and child survival than all other
aspects like literacy rate rule is very
different between the two so these are
only two dimensions let's see the way
which way did Sweden go to end up in
that corner we have leftish countries on
the left and writers on the right it's
quite easy so is swedish leftist or
rightish actually we have this Swedish
model of combining the two five years at
the time before the First World War
there is the First World War we wasn't
we were not in it between the two wars
we have the record years no actually the
happy 20s it's called then it stopped
the economic growth stopped and we had
the Swedish mouths a tongue called per
Albin Hansson increasing health without
more money okay he didn't die but there
was a change in government and after the
war we had a record years and we
improved money and health with unseen
pays ending up in this corner of the
world this is when we started to write
books about society planning and stuff
we got so proud you know if I should
tell you the truth we negotiated with
Hitler that is why we stayed outside the
war and after the war we were like the
only functioning country in Europe
it wasn't the question it was a
statement
I wouldn't let's continue okay so this
is the Swedish model then let's compare
it to Japan and we have this race now
between the red Toyota and the blue
Volvo okay so in 1920 which car would
you choose
okay of course there was no cars but but
anyway the Volvo is super you see it's
it's richer and healthier and then
during the World War I mean Japan lose a
lot of money surprisingly not health but
what happens off to the war it's really
scary because this Toyota guys they
invent some kind of engine they run the
double speed as the Volvo and they catch
up with us you see we turn left to get
better health and they catch up in
health and then in the eighties 90s they
catch up in economy now they are both
richer and healthier than us
and we don't know how they did it we
have this perfect Volvo running and now
we buy to your task the worst thing is
that they are running in this Swedish
model combining economic growth and
social welfare that should be Swedish
model not a Japanese model okay let's
take a look at some other things here
it's important to see we don't have any
countries down there no so rich country
is this unhealthy actually there is no
country up there cube I should be there
but World Bank didn't put it into the
dataset this year they don't want to
deal with their income but it should be
up there but if not we have this strong
correlation so please remember after
seeing it that there are countries on
all levels of income and health there is
a big mess of it and if you want to
learn it you will have to learn each
case and each story I mean there is a
tendency richer countries are healthier
barrels or a difference so now what
should I go for you actually I could I
would like to change now a little bit to
what was in the presentation to show
Iran nenene oh yeah you're right I want
to show you some features
so let's move to the map this would be
the map you recognize with east west
north or south
does it make sense to look at data on
this map can you see a lot of stuff
actually if I should just visualizing
data analysis here
you lose x and y in geographical
coordinates those two x and y are the
two most efficient visual properties to
communicate data that's why maps are
only good for some purposes especially
if you're looking at your graphic
distribution of problems then Maps makes
a lot of sense but when we look over
time I mean South Africa will always be
exactly there and we won't see any
change so we can only use color or size
it's actually why we don't use as much
maps to show these stories okay that was
a technical thing and let's pick two
countries you have heard of USA and
Mexico yeah this is how they show up on
the world map very close to each other
let's go back to this other
socio-economic map this kind of a big
jump if you go from Mexico to United
States it's quite big I could pick
another example also for example we have
this I is proud of this feature that's
what I'm showing it oh not that proud
because I can't pick Dominican Republic
yeah there it is Hyatt in Dominican
Republic there's very big difference if
you just get over the border you will
end up in a much richer and much
healthier countries so we should kind of
morph between all different graph types
that exist that is sort of a future
thing to do let's now jump over to
something different this tool is I don't
know what you see is what you get but
you you click on stuff and compared to
other short things tool when you say I
want to make a nice little diagram okay
what type by shot new screen and what
should be the labels new screen and you
sort of get bored in screen number three
so there are no screens here you
actually play around with it I click on
the axis I get a pop-up and I change so
let's move over to on the y-axis we have
total fertility rate what does it mean
it's the number of children per woman
okay so we have one child per woman and
for example Italy almost one and then in
some countries eight children per woman
we have a different map now let's go
back in time and look at this map in
1960 there were two type of countries
industrialized and developing countries
it makes sense to group the world in two
groups that was in 1960 s this is where
the grouping doesn't make sense sense
anymore
because family planning may these
countries rain down all over the place
the number of children is decreasing can
you see in the 80's 90's an enormous use
of contraceptives on earth to stop the
population explosion let me play it
again we go back to 1950 the division
between rich and poor or whatever you
call them disappears as it gets filled
by countries dropping down from below
and now a lot of countries have already
reduced number of children from say
seven down to four if this continues for
another thirty years there will be no
population explosion yeah yeah okay so
let's put life expectancy there would
that make sense because that's the other
thing I want to show I will do that
after showing Iran that's exactly the
kind of tool I click on the x-axis I
combined it with something else the
expert statisticians sort of yeah they
like this tool but they get afraid of it
because what are they supposed to do if
people can just browse the data okay so
they say it's dangerous because it's too
simplistic but because actually people
get ideas probably you have some idea of
what you want to compare so you eyeball
the data you have your sort of ideas and
you can test them immediately people
will come up with the long of a lot of
stupid ideas yeah let me show you
Iran which in 1960 Oh way beyond before
I was born you know
back in the Middle Ages almost it was up
there on a level of seven children per
woman 3,000 in GDP per capita let's turn
on this trails function so this is not a
PowerPoint I'm playing with the tool
right now okay here is the revolution
you know the mullahs took over and they
said well family planning no we actually
don't talk about sex Wow yeah that's
that's my words they went backwards they
lost money and the increased number of
children then something extraordinary
happened the mullahs one night they
changed their mind they said well family
planning is quite good for economic
growth let's invest in the biggest
condom factory on earth and let's have
these courses I mean in 15 years they
drop from 7 to less than 3 they are now
down there yeah you heard about this in
the news didn't you you didn't you
didn't it doesn't fit the journalists
agenda you know to tell this story they
have a very simplistic image of Iran
confusing it with Iraq those are very
very very different countries sensitive
issue but it makes sense to look at the
drop that Iran performed with a very
carefully planned a systematic family
planning you are not allowed to marry in
Iran without the boy and the girl taking
the course on how to use condoms by law
ok that's how they did it and of course
you reduce it because a lot of people
don't want to have that much children
and yes you have to talk about sex to be
able to drop like that so obviously they
talk a lot about sex so obviously we
don't understand them I don't know who
are we who are them anyway let's move on
you wanted to change the axis on the
other thing on the x-axis I click the
x-axis I choose I actually want to show
this with life expectancy instead so now
we are let me tie it shouldn't be unlock
a rhythmic so I changed a linear and it
morphs over it should blink should morph
remember that should really smooth stuff
that
where people say well okay okay we go
back so what are we looking at now we
don't have money this is only social
indicators long life short life lot of
children few children 1960 also these
two groups long life small families
short life big families then what
happened yeah we can see a similar
change remember that things were moving
a lot when I showed data from the 1960 s
remember they don't have to remember the
exact movement the world has changed it
is changing today and in 20 years you
have to update I don't know we need some
kind of tool to search this data to
constantly update our knowledge because
it doesn't make sense to go to
university in the 60s and then think you
know everything you need to constantly
update it some kind of feed maybe I
don't know okay so here we have the
world today let's pick two countries
let's go back in 1970 what would this
country be well I'm looking for a
particular one here sorry this is the
one it's sort of embarrassing to see me
where I'm looking right now but I'm sort
of tired I have to pick it from here
instead this would be there are two ways
of picking countries either you look at
this and ask yourself what is this then
you must point at it that's one way I
mean what is this where is my country
then you wouldn't go for like pointing
and all the 200 so then you need some
kind of search okay so let's pick
Vietnam and now we have in 1960 s USA
and Vietnam two very very different
countries in terms of long life and size
of the family you can see the fertility
drop in u.s. Vietnam life getting longer
and longer now we are in 1975 this is
what happened to Vietnam since 1975 a
big
change they are down here now where you
were in the 70s where you as was in
terms of the size of the family and how
long you can expect to live it's a
completely new society children born in
Vietnam today have the same expectations
as us in the seventies ok so where
should I go from here yep yeah you could
Iraq lacks a lot of income data and
stuff and and the UN has this you know
filtering of data quality so I don't
have it in this we could look at it
other words it makes sense this is the
kind of things we should be doing and
looking at let me now jump over to a
sort of overview the flower power point
it's called ok so what is Gapminder
doing and what do we think is needed
there is like one terabyte of public
data more or less in UN system National
Statistics NGOs like Amnesty and others
they collect a lot of data it's
extremely expensive this data this is
the scenario that interpreters
journalists activists and so on should
try to reach an audience through some
kind of media internet CDs and it widens
and it gets a big publicity the thing is
that this doesn't happen it just doesn't
happen people don't see these things
what I showed you were official UN data
on their website you didn't go there
look for it so how can we change this
because we need data instead of these
myths I was showing in the beginning
people think this is too boring looking
at data and this media I mean
journalists putting it up on a web it's
too difficult and expensive actually you
have to buy this data let me tell you
that one of these data boxes is the the
commodity trade in the world like 6000
como
something like that 200 countries
import/export price quantities since
1960 the database exists it already
exists it's already collected it's being
used and the World Bank and the UN and
the OECD are selling this database to
companies but it was produced by tax
money and now they are selling it it's a
very very very few companies that's one
year ago it was 12 companies it's so sad
because we need these data to see the
pineapple trade in the world where does
it go it said a lot of people should use
this information it's the basic of
capitalism free access to prices and
they have the data they just don't have
the tool or the way to disseminate it ok
let's move on so the data is hidden
underground here's the public watching
the Internet each ray should hit their
own website with their interests
customized for them so these agencies
put up small little websites like that
connected to their databases a lot of
cumbersome work then they want to get
paid so they put a little price tag and
the password and user name and if you
pay and remember your password this is
what you get and then you do something
else I mean who would continue from
there it's really boring so how can we
change it the data databases exist in
multiple formats etc a lot of formats
there is a lot of creativity in this
business so design tools it also exists
even more creativity I would say but in
a better sense PowerPoint freehand you
have all of them flash illustrator and
there are skilled people knowing how to
deal with these tools it's expected it's
yes that those guys don't and girls they
didn't go to the statistic course so
they don't know about data so they don't
manage to get a data into their design
tools that's sort of how are we gonna
deal with that for them to customize the
graphic output so we need to link the
data to existing design tools that's
that's kind of the thing the tool we are
missing is the one linking those worlds
together
then Gapminder is now developing this is
a standalone thing that could be
downloaded and ran in Africa where there
is no internet this would be a open
source stuff connected to one database
and then we link a lot of databases
together in a search thing those are I
can show you some claims in some
examples of it then in the future we
hope to inspire others or something I
don't think we really wants to scale
this up but we could get a competition
going so that the the general behavior
with statistics is changed sort of so
this happen the weather forecast
every day every evening in the news I
mean it's all the time nice graphics
they have data humidity wind they don't
show these numbers they wouldn't have to
do that they get a lot of publicity with
their weather forecast yes by drawing
nice sans beautiful colors so these are
the guys to copy in social science sort
of and then this needs to be free number
one these guys should say I didn't know
that about Iran let's write an article
about it so these guys say wow that's
what we need so this is what we are
doing now to enable the journalists or
the interpreters to access the data
there are like multi levels of users so
to say we need tools on all levels you
search and you find life expectancy for
Botswana I would like to immediately see
this is the first draft it took me like
one hour to draw this image it's just an
image we don't have this system running
it right now but thumbnails already
there it should be thumbnails of the
shorts and we should pick the good shots
to represent this data I mean there is a
Botswana map it really fits the Botswana
data and if you click on one of them you
would get this population pyramid and
let me jump over to what you want did
last week this is sort of the end of my
presentation I have two more things to
show then I will be quiet for some
minutes shorts it should be here
somewhere isn't it
ya think it's this one
this isn't isn't optimized it took one
week for them to put together so it's
this is the kind of thing we need and
and this would be the Swedish population
of one particular city it should be two
clicks from the search click the pyramid
and I see the population of my city okay
so we move over time and we see how
people get older here we have a lot of
emigration in this age you can look at
those I go back in time 1990 I can go
back and forth like this and see the
overview it's not interesting yes to
find one data point saying male 33 years
old how many are they it doesn't make
sense
I don't want to find one data point I
want to find it in its context that's
when it makes sense and being able to
browse back and forth like that so what
about short formats actually there needs
to be something so the end graphic
designers once again this is like
Internet users world map 2015 you see
your markets there and let me go for
what this could be also linked I mean
over time we need to have this kind of
stuff this is online gaming this is
world of warcraft to success in the end
you see in it these things are difficult
for designers to make look nice because
it's so much data you've seen this one
this is another one this would be
another one
this is the population pyramid this is
interesting this is nice you filter
indicators here and they immediately
disappear on the map it could be more
advanced but that I think is up to end
users that say I want to add my GUI to
your your front-end so to say now I'm
really suggesting something ok this is a
another thing that I found this is nice
I think it should move it static that's
so boring ok this is the population
income distribution this is bad I think
in some way sometimes it's good but
actually look at Canada I mean how big
is Canada
it's just big on the map all those
Islands so you put you consume pixels
I mean nap animal can you see Panama no
you can't it's impossible
so maps yeah I like them for traveling
and so on but not for data visualization
of course it makes sense sometimes not
always this is cool this is cool people
will come up with crazy ideas I am NOT
the Tufte kind of guy I think if someone
think this makes sense okay
democracy that's up to them I shouldn't
limit them so to say but they will not
be successful because it's very tricky
to see if this is what's the name of the
guy okay this is a poverty map the size
of the country is the number of poor
people so this is India China you can't
see Europe you can't see US and Canada
this is actually let a Central American
Caribbean this is Howie T so Central
America is as big as Latin America in
terms of number of poor this also
shrinks strange some people say these
maps are bad a lot of people say it
looks fun so they will remember it sort
of and get interested let's enable any
graphic front-end that makes sense for
that particular data trade data movement
transport you need to have some kind of
connections I don't know how to put it
let's find new ways this is something
else this is small multiples I mean a
lot of different indicators combined
this is probably too difficult for a lot
of audience these are the candy you can
see us up there it's really strange
thing I didn't do these things I just
pick it pick them and I think it's like
nice to see how many different
alternatives people come up with this is
the number of AIDS death to there and
then you have the number of infected in
HIV and AIDS and this is the second
world war the number of deaths so we're
already above the second world war and
then you have the other Wars there this
would be Wikipedia editing visualized I
think yeah
yeah this is the safe where we should go
that's more or less what you want me to
say okay Anna and me we are married
yes to to clarify I want to say
something
no actually not unfortunately yeah
Dollar Street doesn't work on a map and
we went to try to find funding for that
dollar Street and and save the children
gave us like two months of work and we
managed to make it work on on Windows
and it was made in director micro media
director and it was not the same on
Macintosh flash would have worked
yeah the plug-in is destroyed in some
way I don't know that was like four
years ago we are gonna renew it if if we
sort of have the money okay
more questions between the I don't know
but as any yeah is there an increasing
income gap in us do I believe so I
wouldn't answer the question but in any
country if we look at data there are the
poorest 20% the richest 20% year may be
the difference between those groups are
increasing but the the word gap make you
think there are like two bumps that's
not that's the thing I mean I mean the
distance between poorest and richest may
increase still it may and on a world
level it does let me show you yeah if we
take this one and we look at the world
this would the the grey one would be the
world and we can see look at these
people the poorest they are next to this
day okay the richest one have somewhere
around hundred dollars in 1970 if we
move forward yes the poor guys remain
poor and the rich guys get richer so yes
the gap is increasing between the
richest and the poor but the poor don't
get poorer because that is dying you
don't get poorer you can't hear on a
global level in the US you can get
poorer without dying so if if the gap is
increasing on a world level it would be
the rich getting richer and that's
happened that's happening
it does and this is another logarithmic
scale so people will claim we are
fooling them by saying so but this is
the kind of discussions that high school
children should go into with their
teachers and starting to combine
mathematics and social science to deal
with this stuff that's why I
intentionally try to be provocative in
some sense for you to start think
because I only talked about the general
stuff wouldn't be interesting okay
let's look at Brazil if we see a double
yeah we see a double bomb let's look at
Brazil oh there is a gap but this data
is modelled severe Salah Martino
professor in economics at Columbia
University has say we can't deal with
country averages it doesn't make sense
we have to have distributions so I
better throw together some distributions
for countries based on income surveys
and people will criticize me for
modeling the data like this but I do it
anyway because then they will realize
they need to collect this kind of data
so this is like the first attempt and I
rather I like this approach doing it
with low quality has to show that we
need it I mean the first world map was
completely wrong but it showed the need
of a world map and then we just made it
more and more perfect over time but we
need to start with bad stuff so - so
those bumps you see those are model data
there is a tendency of of this kind of
gaps in Brazil it's even more increased
here but of course these are multiple
normal distributions combined so to say
with Mao Zedong where China God bitter
healthcare but less or not as rich and
then it took a hook to the right is that
typical - people tend to move up and
hook to the right or do that are there
any instances of people hooking to the
left like getting richer with with poor
health and then suddenly become
healthier in other words does the wealth
follow the the better health care or
does the health care follow the well
China is that an exception first getting
healthy then getting rich well I showed
you another examples we don't well this
is sorry yes this is the same short on
linear scales this is a big problem we
have we actually need logarithmic scales
a lot of audiences don't understand
logarithmic scales it's it's really
problem well Sweden moved in the center
you saw let's look at us where did us go
actually I hope I can show it to you now
actually I have it yeah
I prepared it one second it's nice for
you to wait for something for two
seconds us ah this one this is not nice
it was actually designed for paper
printout so but you you can you can get
the idea this is where I plotted us it's
empower point this is the road of us
from 1900
didn't I say Riteish countries on the
right is the right that the conservative
politics all over the world say we
should first get rich then we can invest
the left tissue or whatever you call
them they say let's invest all we have
in social welfare if like Cuba this is
the track of Cuba so politics make sense
politics can really change where
countries are going and the speed of
change and so unlike Iran the whole drop
you saw is based on political decisions
so political it Xperia Lee make a lot of
sense that it sort of answers your
question
there is not one path that countries
follow really fast development seemed to
happen this is my interpretation not
numeric yes visually South Korea moves
from here in the 60s to there in the
middle of the cloud yeah no I didn't
show you sorry I didn't show you this
thing let's go back to to 1870 this is
our the country with data as we move
forward here we will see more and more
countries 1900 the First World War the
Second World War this is the overall
movement on earth in income and health I
take it once again a little bit slower
so those like France and Germany and so
on moves up there very low down remember
they were here in the 1800 now 8 1918
1990 there is white this is white now
there are no countries with this income
in the world with this low shall
survival why because it's much cheaper
to produce good health today we have
much more knowledge and much more
technology and we know about the vaccine
and so on so this is this other kind of
things even the long patterns wouldn't
go the same the same path yeah let's go
back to 1970 where everybody in Sweden
were communists more or less okay so
they look at the data if they did I
don't know if they did they would say
the richest country on earth are United
Arab Emirates created as soon as they
found all this and we need to be a
country you know
so they made a country nada that was I
don't know much about you know but
that's actually it if coincident in time
so they are richest in the world but
they didn't have time to build up any
social security system he has found
money so they end up very very rich with
no society so to say China is the
opposite they didn't find oil but they
had build up this society over time so
they were as healthy but we don't know
exactly we can't know for the poor
countries here we don't know exactly
where they are but we need to use that
data in u.s. and Sweden every person is
counted every birth is counted and with
whether you die it's counted and it's so
the data is like more or less 100% sure
in this part of the world it's based on
some few surveys that are extrapolated
for the rest of the population it's like
it the coverage is somewhere around 1%
in some countries I mean we don't know
for sure so that's a much bigger problem
than political manipulation because that
will come back to the politicians those
things are quite quite famous I mean
North Korea doesn't show up there
because there there is no transparency
in looking at their data on either the
population nothing so sort of answers
your question help
we're dimensions
like Human Development Index yeah the
question is is there a combination of
indicators that sort of can-can rank or
something I added some words to your
question sorry but that is what it's
used for to to provoke countries like
Sweden is number one in Human
Development Index if if we show up on
number two this is how the UN system
works every year there is a AIDS Day or
poverty day or something that is just to
get attention in the media that's the
way they do it and that day they should
present the ranking of all countries in
their indicators they often combine sort
of the the index the Human Development
Report have the Human Development Index
where you combine GDP per capita life
expectancy literacy rate and school
enrolment into one Index expressed as
percentage so what is hundred percent
GDP per capita
well it's Luxembourg the richest country
and the poorest would be zero present
and then in life expectancy hundred
percent is the Japanese life expectancy
of women because it's very these the
highest so they sort of equalize those
indicators and come up with an index yes
they do that I would say is not needed
anymore that that kind of approach is
very effective if you only have one
minute with Tony Blair for example you
can say you're number two or you're
number seven okay it's very fast way of
communicating data but it it removes all
the complexity in the data so you don't
see the distribution we could sort of
combine let me for the Human Development
Index if we take the life expectancy
here on a linear scale imagine making an
index saying that that one is the best
performer rich and healthy this one is
worse this would be the lowest ranking
the highest ranking and then the other
ones would be something like this you
mean this one and that one would
actually have the same ranking because
it's mixed so you don't see the
difference between Botswana and some
Slovakia or something it wouldn't be
still a Kia sorry
Armenia these two would sort of have the
same because this one is rich and
unhealthy that one is healthy and
enriched okay actually you have
so putting up
and SRC
story yeah we added yeah the question is
did we add any qualitative data together
with numeric data yes that is when it
starts to make sense that's let's call
it statistics storytelling or something
that is the qualitative part is to tell
what happened here what kind of politics
do we have that's exactly the kind of
words I've been adding all the time
without these words it wouldn't make
sense it would just be like what is this
so that is a tricky thing if you want to
automate this process to sort of
generate meaningful charts it is very
useful to have the comments and mix it
with other historic events like world
history calm you have timelines of what
happened in countries at every point but
yeah
Jeff
several subway and you looked at
the objective
tell sensitive
objective yeah there is a world of data
out there people some people collect
indicators there is a world value survey
that actually ask people are you happy
and they cover some I don't know eighty
countries it makes a lot of sense to ask
these questions and it's very
interesting to look at their results I
could show you things from there but if
they can sort of convert those
qualitative aspects into numbers it's
easier to compare it with GDP per capita
so yeah there that's they are doing a
great job and their data is free a lot
of these university projects those are
free and UNICEF have a project and some
are DHS and mix there are two survey
projects asking a lot of poor countries
how they are this data is free so there
is free data it's often survey data it's
like the academic community yes they
give away their raw numbers the really
survey answers so you can model them
yourself that's kind of things exist yep
I think a lot of people have other
meanings to attend so it's just switch
to a different mode where if you want to
stay and talk to to this group that's
great
