with us whom I met not too long ago at
something called a smart life forum in
Palo Alto where many of the health
professionals from this area meet every
month and keep up that with the current
research and he was the one person that
seemed the smartest there so I invited
him to come here and talk to us and
share some of his knowledge with us so
please help me in welcoming Steve here
and and see how what he has to say it's
a it's a pleasure to be here I'm about
one week post flu so my voice may get a
little bit weak so please bear with me
I'm going to the the the plan is I'm
going to spend about 40 minutes going
through the presentation and then I
hopefully have 15 or so minutes left for
your questions
people like to raise questions and
dialogue okay good
okay.i I did this first slide with the
idea of opening up the dialogue at the
point of talking about cognitive
performance mental performance what does
that mean
I mean everybody talks about
intelligence and everybody knows about
problem-solving and reaction time and
and memory and things like that but in
my opinion mental performance about any
aspect of mental performance that
relates to your health and the number
one aspect that we take for granted is
sleep and I will spend quite a bit of
time I think two slides talking about
sleep and more in more depth and but I
wanted to raise this question now just
because I want people to think about the
the context of your questions regarding
smart drugs or smart nutrients food
starting with the boring stuff working
forward B complex vitamins I'll just let
it ring B complex vitamins never really
get any respect haven't for forty years
because you're talking about one penny a
day of your investment in your nutrition
program I mean that's just it's too old
and too plain but it's really critical
detoxification we're starting to get
into some more risky stuff in terms of
stress to your body nutrients can get
pretty exotic and spend a huge amount of
money on nutrients and amino acids get
even more high-tech I'll get into that
in terms of brain neurotransmitter
levels later and then we get into the
overtly medical hormone replacement and
pharmaceuticals and I would also put
herbs somewhere in this category in
terms of a lot of complexity and a lot
of potential for toxicity as well even
though they're natural okay so I'm
picking from the questions on the
announcement starting off with which
nutrients promote optimal brain function
and the answer is all of them if they're
deficient they're affecting your
some of these are also effective way
beyond physiological levels so in a
sense we cannot use mother nature as a
guide for optimal brain function because
mother nature always gives us brain
function per unit investment in
nutrition in the wild the cost of a gram
of vitamin C is actually quite profound
you might fall out of the tree break
your arm and die from trying to get one
gram of vitamin C but if you're going to
buy it in your health food store you're
going to pay between two and 20 cents
for it I mean why worry about it next
question I'd like to ask is are they
sustainable because a lot of these
dietary supplement formulas out there
that are designed to give you a smart
pill are not really sustainable the
first day you take it it lights you up
like a Christmas tree but after a week
after a month you're back to baseline
again but you don't necessarily know
that if you're judging the value of the
supplement based on its short-term
benefit to you at the point what that
you started to take it so the human mind
is very able to make a cause-and-effect
connection between something that you do
and in effect that happens a minute or
an hour later but if the effect is a
week or a month later good luck it's not
also about the parts it's about how well
they work together so metabolism is a
key aspect of how your brain works 3% of
your body uses 20% of your energy if you
have a slight downturn but let's say 30%
in your heart function you won't see it
if you're not exercising at peak
performance but if 30% of your brain
energy goes away you are unconscious so
also get around to talking about some of
these other kinds of things so this is
really goes to the question of you know
what is your orientation towards a smart
drug program and being the best that you
can be that a lot of this is not exotic
it's basic food breathing
ition exercise things that you've heard
a thousand times before so I'm not going
to give you a real quick fix for how to
bypass all of that I'm going to
intersperse a couple of slides this is a
really fascinating site to me because it
goes down to a really fundamental aspect
of nature in life that turns out to be
critical to the area of having a brain
at all and that is that anaerobic
organisms the energy levels are so
inadequate the anaerobic systems that
you only get to ATP out of a glucose
that's burned which is enough to give
you life but it's not enough to give you
robust life it's not enough to give you
multicellular life and it's not enough
to give you a consciousness and a brain
working brain for that you need aerobic
metabolism and you get 38 ATP versus two
this gives you room to play with and
this is why the brain uses massive
amounts of energy so if you focus on the
issue of energy you'll do a good job
turns out this is critical for
Alzheimer's disease this is the slide
from the Alzheimer's presentation I'm
getting it out of the way so before
anybody passes out take a deep breath
okay good energy production systems flow
into enzyme activity protein synthesis
healing abilities the iron pumping in
your in your nervous system membranes
manufacture of neurotransmitters all of
these functions that are critical to the
brain turn out to be dependent upon
energy cellular energy production so the
ATP is is like the wire that keeps your
brain functioning keeps you sharp keeps
you from having Alzheimer's disease if
you want to look up this this entire
presentation is if you go to youtube and
type in reversing Alzheimer's disease or
type in my name you'll go to a nine part
series on Alzheimer's disease now to
reverse it and this critical step right
here that relates to the glutathione the
mercury glutathione ratio when that
fails all of this downstream
stuff happens for Alzheimer's disease so
if you can reverse this the Alzheimer's
disease reverses
so anybody want to vote okay
thirty percent of teenagers using eating
a standard American diet in public
schools have IQ deficits that are
correctable by supplementing to correct
the deficiencies thirty percent and the
IQ difference is ten points for those
kids thirty percent of the kids
you're given the supplements their IQ
goes up by ten points this has been
replicated in California and Great
Britain two studies were done in
parallel with exactly the same results
and it's been replicated in juvenile
correctional facilities where they've
shown that when you correct these
nutritional deficiencies you see broad
changes in EEG and behavior here's an
example of a study that was done that
showed that RDA supplements of B
vitamins three B vitamins at levels of
30 to 60 times the RDA resulted in
cumulative improvement in marksmanship
so as a blinded study and so the what
was fascinating to me is that the B
complex vitamins have a half-life about
four to five hours and yet the
sustainability of these results and
Agnetha was observed over ten weeks
here's a couple of other examples zinc
and teenage boys the joys of
masturbation lead to zinc deficiencies
and that causes the brain to stop
functioning
masturbation leads to insanity
your grandmother was right vitamin D and
magnesium are two very widespread
deficiencies anybody who lives at sea
level and who lives in an urban
environment is very unlikely to ever
meet their adequate level of vitamin D
from sunlight even if you like
sunbathing without clothes typically in
the winter if you live in San Francisco
nude sunbathing will actually get you
some vitamin D but if you do that in
Oakland you will not get any vitamin D
at all even at noon b12 and pregnenolone
and melatonin in the elderly examples of
deficiencies that can be addressed that
are specific to certain populations so
let me give you some examples of how
this works in terms of this is another
illustration from the from the video
where it talks about the neuro
protective steroids at the base of the
tree but pregnenolone and progesterone
which then go up the tree DHEA
testosterone the estrogens well it turns
out that the estrogens here have an anti
metabolic effect they impair your
synthesis of energy and this is why
women have more stamina than men but
it's also why when men get inflammation
they make more estrogen and they start
gaining weight and they start having all
kinds of health problems as well the
downside of estrogen of having too much
estrogen is quite profound to the brain
and so if you have inflammation this
pathway gets activated that pathway gets
activated and this pathway gets
activated so it turns these protective
beneficial energetic steroids into anti
metabolic steroids so if you don't watch
and you have an infection you can have
cognitive consequences from it
here's an example of a broad selection
of observed effects that are highlights
from stuff that I've observed over the
last 30 years
violence tendencies memory problems
Alzheimer's disease panic attacks this
also includes hiccups IQ problems
senility syndromes from blood
coagulation this is also a side effect
of infection ph imbalances in the blood
that impair oxygen and binding and
release and co2 binding and release
brain fog how many people have
experienced brain fog how many people
are getting a little bit sleepy right
now from just having eaten well let's go
on I got two minutes per slide so okay
how can you get a better night's sleep
first of all pay attention don't take it
for granted
second one is pay attention to sound
your brain never stops listening when
you go to sleep your brain is still
listening to what's going on around you
the paralysis that happens at the
brainstem that shuts off your motor
control function for your entire body
does not affect your hearing does not
affect your sight it's not affect your
taste buds so make sure that you have
sound that is comforting and predictable
and anticipated so if you live in an
area where you have lots of horns
honking and car alarms going off and
this kind of thing put some sound in
your background that you can listen to
day after day after day night after
night so that part of your brain that's
listening doesn't get alerted sleep with
regularity don't stay up to 5:00 in the
morning and then do an all-nighter sleep
regularly sleep in the dark gray light
suppresses melatonin you need to be in
the dark and the dose and the timing is
very critical for melatonin and when you
wake up in the morning wake up with red
light that's the dawn and dusk effect
when the Sun goes up what color is it
red okay look when it sets what color is
it red and so dark adaptation that
happens at night is mitigated by red
light so if you want to set up a light
in them in your bedroom or in your
bathroom I have to flood lamps in my
bathroom so what I'm sitting on the John
I just turned them on and I get bathed
in red light incandescent light very
helpful for keeping your circadian
rhythm going if you need tryptophan for
serotonin you can use that occasionally
however I suggest that you keep your
dose down there are some potential
adverse health effects from using
melatonin indiscriminate or excuse me
tryptophan it indiscriminately or
5-hydroxytryptophan and so if you mix
your tryptophan with predigested
collagen protein you can use doses that
are one-tenth as large and get a better
hypnotic effect this is the tough part
anybody with chronic inflammation is
going to have consequences health
consequences degenerative health
consequences but identifying
inflammation it's a tough one you go to
a doctor and ask them to help you with
it good luck you have unlimited amounts
of money you can throw PCR tests at
things and stuff but it's it's a really
tough problem so if you can focus on the
issue of possible infections if you have
chronic issues with for example the
herpes flare-ups if you can imbalance
yourself with vitamin D and vitamin A
and reduce that in that inflammatory
effect your health will benefit greatly
as well as your sleep will benefit
greatly food allergies delayed
hypersensitivities to things like wheat
or corn or yeast or milk to pick four of
the top five food allergies if you can
clean those out of your life you'll be
better off for it or adding digestive
enzymes to help you digest your foods
and the gut that integrity of the gut
things like zinc for example low-dose
zinc with each meal can help tighten up
your gut and prevent food undigested
food particles from passing in and
producing inflammation
and if you need a sleep drug don't use
ambien use eye Ram Sai Ram is a nutrient
it was declared to be the date-rape drug
by the FDA and then they made it a
prescription orphan drug it's now
available and zai rem is a great way to
get very very good sleep and it's one of
the few drugs that enhances the stage 3
and stage 4 architecture of phases of
sleep normally when you go to sleep you
go stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 stage 4 and
then up into rapid eye movement and that
takes about 90 minutes and as we age the
stage 3 and stage 4 phases get
compromised and by the time people reach
middle age oftentimes they will not have
any stage 4 sleep at all and by the time
people hit 70 to 90 they usually don't
have any stage 3 sleep as well what this
means is is that you're not really
asleep at night and you're not really
awake during the day you need to be
deeply asleep to be deeply awake and
Zhai REM does that it specifically
enhances stage 3 and stage 4 sleep by
the way this is a hundred times more
expensive than it was as a nutrient
before the FDA took it off the
marketplace
here's a challenge for the geeks in the
audience the Nerds you know a perfect
audience to consider this high tech
solution do-it-yourself sleep studies so
what you can do is you can set up a
camcorder and videotape and audiotape
your sleep at night play it back at ten
times speed the next day and see what's
going on with your sleep are you waking
up are you vocalizing are you moving is
your breathing changing do you have
apnea all of that stuff can be verified
at home at some point in the next ten
years this will probably be
over-the-counter right now there's a
vacuum
is there an alternative to s RI drugs
lots let's start with the least respect
b-vitamins the Raji they brought any
Dangerfield of nutrients yes
serotonin reuptake inhibitors they're
also called SSRIs although the first s
is really more promotion than fact so I
just delete the first s zoloft paxil
mineral deficiencies correcting mineral
deficiencies and discovering undisclosed
unrecognized toxicities I have a 94 year
old client who had Alzheimer's disease
who had an undiagnosed lead toxicity so
these things can go on for 20 40 60
years and you don't know about it yes
what is it efficiency its deficiency oh
well there's that's a good question the
question is what is a deficiency and are
there numbers attached to it and the
answers are yes however there isn't a
consensus on it so if you go to vitamin
Diagnostics in New Jersey and ask them
they'll define it in terms of normative
numbers how many standard deviations in
a general population are you in you know
above below so they define it based on
statistics and most medical tests are
done that way you get a cholesterol
level it's based on statistics you get a
thyroid t4 TSH level it's based on
statistics but there are other kinds of
companies like spectra sell in in Texas
who do a functional assay so they're
looking at the ability of white blood
cells to proliferate in the presence of
a nutritional challenge and so if you
take away b12 and your stels your cells
immediately stop proliferating then they
presume this means you have very very
low b12 reserves and so they're defining
deficiency in that in that context as
the performance of those cells under a
stress but in terms of you know minerals
for example I would define it in terms
of enzyme activity in other words
superoxide dismutase uses copper and so
is the activity of superoxide dismutase
increased if you supplement copper if
the answer is yes then you were
deficient if the answer is if there's a
slight increase than you were slightly
deficient if there's a massive increase
you were seriously deficient so there's
a lot of that kind of question going on
all I can say is that you cannot assume
that kind of question in a
straightforward manner and be able to
even interpret your own medical results
I've had hundreds and hundreds of
clients over 30 years who come to me
with thyroid workups that were one was
done right hundreds of people one was
done right and I've had somebody come to
me with the range from let's say ten to
a hundred and they got eleven
and the doctor says Oh your thyroid is
normal you don't have hypothyroidism
okay and yet when we give that person
thyroid hormone boom their energy goes
up their depression goes away they start
sleeping soundly they lose 20 pounds of
weight and you know on every measure of
functionality they're better off but
according to the numbers statistically
they were fine before neurotransmitter
precursors a huge aspect of depression
and you can load them up
tryptophan 5-hydroxytryptophan is a
precursor for serotonin so if you take
it and your depression goes away
guess what so you can take paxil to
raise your serotonin zoloft or you can
take five HTTP or tryptophan to do it
and see does it work you go to a
standard doctor they're not going to
even mention this option to you DL
phenylalanine or L phenylalanine or
tyrosine will raise your catecholamines
it's another potential cause of
depression hypothyroidism I just
mentioned get a proper workup you have
to know the right questions to ask and
you want to have check the results
yourself anytime a doctor does a thyroid
test and just tells you you're fine ask
for the copy of the results I suggest
you do that anyway
keep a copy of your own medical record
in total estrogen dominance iodine
therapy is one way to shift estrogen
dominance estriol is a estrogen hormone
that gets very little respect and iodine
helps push estrogens into the estriol
form estriol is protective against
autoimmune diseases in both men and
women and women has been proven and in
men it's just inferred but I'm convinced
that it's actually true
estrogen dominance and men don't take
your doctor's word for it when they say
estrogen is a is the female hormone it's
not true
estrogen is the off hormone in both men
and women and if your estrogen is high
you
need to know about this if you are going
to take SSRI drugs you can take them
with tryptophan or 5-hydroxytryptophan
so that when this serotonin reuptake
inhibitor interferes with the recycling
of serotonin which is what it's doing
and causes a corresponding depletion of
your serotonin storage form the 5-ht
will correct that and so your doctor may
tell you that oh yes you can have
serotonin syndrome and die from taking
these two together but actually you have
to be quite careless to actually make
that happen and if you do it with care
and deliberation it is entirely safe oh
this is a fun one I really like talking
about nutrition myths and that whole
thing about masturbation leading to
insanity was part of an earlier talk
about myths in nutrition where I threw
that one in the middle just to wake
everybody up but there's a lot of
nutrition myths out there in the world
today and some of them are being
promoted by industries that have a
vested interest in having you use their
products others are based on just plain
ignorance people not knowing what the
true information about things are these
are old myths how many have heard this
hydrogenated fats are perfectly safe
that means you're pretty old right I
mean that's what I grew up with corn oil
my father was a cardiologist and I grew
up on corn oil and that was part of that
that kind of a myth at the time
vegetable oils and margarine czar safer
than butter that was the myth it's all
crap bovine soil enhancement eating low
fat can make you thin we're now in a
more modern myth complex carbs are best
for insulin resistance this is the
advice given to people with insulin
resistance and type 2 diabetes by the
American diabetic Association it's not
true
eating fat causes heart disease and
obesity
tropical oils I mean we remember that
campaign in about popcorn in the movie
theaters was at about 15-20 years ago
and coconut oil used to be used
regularly in in movie theaters and all
of a sudden it became some huge crime
and it turns out it was the the US oil
industry that paid for that abetted by
the US government and it wasn't true at
all tropical oils are not dangerous at
all milk and bread are good healthy
foods of course it's the milk purveyors
and the bread salesmen who are telling
us that yeah how many people here have
heard that milk has one very fast way to
develop osteoporosis ten or twelve
people it's pretty good you're ahead of
the curve but it's true the correlation
with osteoporosis is not that milk is
protective it's actually a risk factor
yes
I mean what's bad about milk and bread
yes the
they can read the scoop then the faint
should be lived in by these fans that's
right it is and for the average person
and the reason is because of
inflammation that for most people when
you consume milk products you have an
inflammatory response and it's probably
true of you know somewhere between 60
and 80 percent of people depending upon
what your ethnic background your race is
if you're black you're probably 95
percent likely to have inflammation from
drinking milk if you're white and maybe
it's fifty percent in terms of bread
bread is a source of wheat and wheat
contains a protein called gluten which
is extremely difficult to digest and
undigested a gluten protein is an
inflammatory effect that causes all
kinds of degenerative problems and
stress to your gut and inflammatory
effects producing heart disease and
probably cancer as well and so my
suggestion is don't drink milk and don't
eat bread very very very straightforward
just eliminate those from your system
and if you're going to eat them eat them
rarely so that you know the reason that
you're eating the bread is because
you've gone to Aunt Mildred house for
for Christmas and you're trapped and so
we'd say it's okay it's once a year
twice a year you know that kind of thing
and if you can take digestive enzymes
with you to help offload the burden it's
not just wheat that is difficult to
digest corn is difficult to digest red
meat is difficult to digest yeast very
very difficult to digest the cell wall
of yeast is not something that humans
have good enzyme profile for digesting
it so you know try to keep those kinds
of things under control particularly if
you have signs of inflammation if your
estrogen to testosterone ratio is high
in estrogen then you want to look for
these kinds of triggers so yes
know it well it does on some level I
would put there's a couple of things one
is when you feed milk to microbes the
microbe takes the brunt of it okay so
you know yogurt there's still milk
content in because it's a fairly soft
kind of cheese of fresh kind of cheese
same thing with cottage cheese but when
you start to deal with you know cheddar
or aged cheddar 's the content of milk
is going down and down and down the
longer the milk has been fermenting and
and the bugs in it so I can't hear
there's a too much noise you can you
stand up to the microphone and what
about the difference between raw milk
and unprocessed milk yes there the raw
milk has good fat structure and that's
destroyed by the homogenous ation
homogenized milk causes enzyme
irritation of the vascular system
xanthine oxidase so it's true that raw
milk is way better but in terms of
allergy it may not be better at all so
it depends on your system and whether or
not you're handling it well or not there
is a test that you can do if you want to
find out is go off of milk for two weeks
all milk products all egg you know
butter anything with dairy go off of it
for two weeks at the end of two weeks
sit down at a table with a friend and
engage in conversation for about three
hours set up a tape recorder set up a
metronome adjust the metronome so that
it's not fast and not slow and it's just
synchronized with your with your body
and then put one drop of milk under your
tongue and watch what happens and ask
your friend to watch what happens if you
freak out if this metronome slows down
you're allergic to milk okay if your
pulse rate goes up dramatically you're
allergic to milk
vitamins only enrich the sewer we're
going back to the old days but there's
still people out there who have that
kind of attitude okay here's some myths
to live by I'm not going to say this is
all quite scientific because I think
that on some level it's based on
prejudice and philosophy and all kinds
of stuff but low carb vegetables as a
mains mainstay for the diet eat meat
either tiny amounts to moderate amounts
tiny amounts can just be simply the net
the bugs in your grain as it is in India
but we need small amounts of meat to get
our vitamin b12 cultivate fat-burning
mode this is a big one in my opinion the
graceful Agers in the world are all in
fat-burning mode this is not emphasized
in our modern society and doesn't happen
if we overeat carbohydrate which is a
cultural thing but get into ketosis
cultivate your fat-burning mode flip
back and forth into ketosis and out so
you exercise that part of your
metabolism and that to do that consume
tropical oils coconut oil is my favorite
eat less carbs and calories than your
peers under eat is a healthy lifestyle
and so
okay here's my words of wisdom if their
lips are moving
they're lying okay industry ads they
want to sell you milk they want to sell
you oils that are grown in the United
States coconut oil is grown in the
tropics so that's why the prejudice is
in those industry ads the food pyramid
is upside down okay again the government
agents that put that together are
working for the industry assume your
doctor your doctor is profoundly
ignorant and that doesn't mean that
they're not smart they're exceedingly
smart they know all kinds of stuff that
they really don't need to know but the
part is the question is what do they not
know and what risk does this put you in
what does their ignorant put you at in
doctors will rarely admit their
ignorance do you ask them a question
they don't know they'll make it up most
of them but if you know what your doctor
knows and you know what your doctor
doesn't know you're in a better position
to protect yourself against possible
adverse side effects I had one client
that was almost killed because the
doctor was using serum potassium to
judge his potassium requirement and he
was told by his by the by the patient
and by his wife that he's a potassium /
accumulator and therefore giving him
potassium was dangerous the doctor said
no no no no serÃ¡n potassium is an
accurate indicator of potassium status
and put it in his IV and drove him into
heart failure even had him on digoxin
before he it and he still didn't admit
that that was inappropriate action wife
had to check him out of the hospital to
save his life and I'm an expert that you
should also believe is biased
good you're not asleep don't work in a
sick building okay you've got good
people taking care of you here but if
you work in a building where you have
formaldehyde or acetaldehyde in the air
you get sick I had a friend who went to
the who is a teacher at the Oakland
Public School Oakland City High School
who they did incomplete earthquake
retrofit during the summer and had
double time and triple time crews in the
building putting in carpeting and
painting and new particle board
furniture and stuff and on the Monday
all the kids came in and the teachers
came in they had a 30% absentee rate for
the next three months from people
getting sick well when those people
started using vitamin C and cysteine
they became symptom free this goes back
to 1975 when a research group gave C and
cysteine to animals that were exposed to
an LD 90 dose of acetaldehyde and which
is enough to kill ninety percent of the
animals and make the other 10% violently
sick and when they were given the C and
cysteine they didn't get sick they
didn't die none of them got sick and
none of them died that's how powerful
this particular formula is you can go
out and drink yourself unconscious and
not have a hangover unless you have the
the genetic polymorphism in which case
you may have some residual hangover so
Asians Native Americans Irish other
other populations also contain that it's
called alcohol or aldehyde dehydrogenase
and there's a deficiency a genetic
mutation that a lot of people carry that
impairs their ability to smoothly
metabolize alcohol but this formula
helps take care of that you take one
capsule before the first round one
capsule between each round and one
capsule after the last round
drink a glass of water and go to sleep
pretty simple so here's the the basic
the active group is the sulfhydryl group
here from cysteine and cysteine is found
in glutathione it's a component of it
and cysteine is also found in n acetyl
cysteine which is a dietary supplement
form that seems to have some improved
transport abilities so for some people
it works better this is the metabolic
pathway I'm going to partially get into
all the negative stuff that happens from
alcohol from cross-linking effect which
is by far the most dangerous process
this is what gives you wrinkled skin car
Sidhu Nissa t happens as well but the
detoxification pathway here prevents all
of these other pathways competes against
them that's how it works benefits of
alcohol are pretty obvious lifestyle
biological effects and so cost of
alcohol cross-linking wrinkles organ
damage liver damage oxidative stress
hangovers Pro aging addiction through
glucose addiction serotonin addiction
and NADH addiction cancer and
degenerative diseases poisons methanol
which is protected by the sulfhydryl
compounds which is found in some
alcoholic drinks and fermentation
residues that are found in a lot of
distilled drinks the some of these are
protected against and some of them are
not by that alcohol formula you don't
need to know this okay here's contact
information I can flip back to this if
you'd like but what I'd like to do now
is open it up for questions and here's
some suggestions if you can't come up
with your own so step up and ask on the
microphone please about this milk bread
thing I mean I just had to laugh and I
see this like half the world are
probably more than half the world is
eating bread and milk like four more
than I don't know ten thousand years and
you're telling me no no don't do this
I mean I first
thing that's crazy but like what is what
else should I do
should I drink water or so instead of
eating milk and bread should I take like
a hundred different color pills I mean
it's that go I mean you can but I don't
think it's particularly wise okay not
only you're going to spend a fortune but
you're not going to get good very good
nutrition the issue is I mean certainly
children can tolerate milk but if you
look at infant studies and feeding when
for one reason or another children
cannot be best Fred best breastfed the
there's all kinds of consequences that
happen and and if you give prenatal
infants milk products there's a good
chance you're going to kill them so if
you if you read the literature on milk
it's pretty straightforward and the
reason that you may not know about it is
because very little of that gets
publicized I think any kind of fluid
would probably be better than milk and
overall but milk it has nutrition in it
there's there's calcium although you
know that's what it's promoted for that
milk has calcium but it turns out that
in terms of calcium it's not a very good
food you get better food better calcium
levels from grain for example but I'm
also telling you to avoid grain yeah I
mean so I'm not the question comes down
to what do you eat and I'd say the
answer is the Paleolithic diet is the
one that humans are probably best
adapted to and that is unlimited greens
particularly low carb vegetables the low
carb vegetables and fruit and nuts when
they're in season and meat when you can
kill it okay so one thing I've noticed
about milk is that in the US or maybe
North America is probably the only
continent where you can find in lots of
like low fat and half fat and whatnot
milk like in most other countries
doesn't exist in Japan for example
there's only milk that has like four
point five percent fat and you know
Japanese people people operate
on average well I mean it's not the fat
that it is my concern it's the casein
and whey in the milk that are in my
considered opinion the risk factors and
the the galactose
for example anybody any in the United
States any low-fat milk product is had
milk solids added to it to give it a
mouthfeel that produced cataracts I mean
that's a prescription for eye problems
and it doesn't matter whether you get
one percent nonfat 1% 2% 3% it's all
starts from nonfat milk in which they
take the the fat and add it back so they
still it still has the nonfat milk
solids in it so I'd say go back to raw
milk and drink it with all the fat if
you're going to do that and if you don't
want the milk and you react badly to it
find any other kind of food and you'll
do you'll do better with it I mean
people who don't drink milk as a whole
have a lower risk of osteoporosis so the
whole idea of calcium as being essential
for milk is fundamentally it's just a PR
campaign all right hi yes I was a little
confused as to what advice you had in
terms of insulin resistance
you mentioned complex carbohydrates and
you clearly I'm guessing what you mean
is something along the lines of oh well
even if it's complex carbs in your bread
it's not as go to say eating vegetables
or you know what are you suggesting for
insulin resistant individuals vegetables
and carbohydrate control is the number
one prescription for insulin resistance
you know keeping your carbohydrate down
to the point that your body is burning
fat as a as a for energy as a fuel
that's the fastest way to reverse
insulin resistance ketosis if you can
manage it if your actual diabetic you
need to manage that
medically to do it you know safely but
if you're just pre-diabetic you know it
you just have insulin resistance get
into ketosis ketosis is there's two
kinds of fat-burning mode in your body
and ketosis is where your liver is
burning the fat and exporting what are
called ketone fuels to the rest of your
body okay so the fat is basically taking
the the the liver is taking the fat
which is let's say anywhere from 12 to
20 carbons long usually 1618 and it
clips it in four carbon fragments and
those are exported to the body that's
called ketone fuels and the affinity of
your body's tissues for them is about
ten times what it is for glucose so if
you take a it's a rodent with induced
congestive heart failure and you inject
them with ketone fuels you'll see a 50
percent increase in heart ejection
fraction in 30 minutes that's how fast
it is and all of the tissues of the body
the the liver the kidney you know the
muscles they all absorb these ketone
fuels at a very very high rate very
efficiently and so when you're in
ketosis it's it's a very good way of
handling issues like end-stage organ
failure but it's not used by our current
medical system in terms of the the
alternative to ketosis is just called
beta oxidation this is what the what the
liver does to make ketones but all the
tissues of your body are also capable of
burning fat okay so they just take the
fat and instead of absorbing it from the
liver they're just taking the fat and
clipping it themselves and this gives
you a source of energy that's
independent of glucose so if your
insulin resistant your and your
depending upon glucose for energy your
energy is sabotage you're browned out
instead of having 110 volts your brains
living on 90 volts or 70 volts
it's going to affect how your brain
works but if you go into ketosis now
you've got sugar energy and you got
ketone fuels for energy your backup
generator is now on so you're now back
up to 110 volts even if you're still
insulin resistant because your backup
generator is able to give you that extra
voltage to make it work and what happens
is is that your insulin resistance
reverses as you have these ketone fuels
out there and so you become better and
better able to burn glucose by burning
fat does that make sense okay I could
ask you a lot of questions that I can't
play all sale until later yeah there's
people like my best a book if you
haven't seen it Geary tabs good calories
bad calories he's moving out to the Bay
Area and it's you know sometime soon so
we may have him here to talk okay great
April speaker at the smart life-form
alright so you mentioned glutathione
which I read you know lots of great
things about that but I've also read
that just taking it directly does not
give you much that it doesn't get
absorbed very much what can you say
about that it there's it's true there is
a problem absorbing it but the the
people who say that none of it is
absorbed they're lying
so there are people who are saying you
know you can't take glutathione because
it's digested well maybe half of it is
digested or maybe three-quarters of it
is digested or maybe one quarter so
there is some benefit that you get from
it but it is true it's very inefficient
but the real problem is it's not
sustainable there's all kinds of
research and people selling dietary
supplements with cysteine and
n-acetylcysteine and it's saying that
raises your glutathione well there's a
real problem with that because if you
look a day later and two days later you
see it does raise glutathione but if you
look a week in two weeks and two months
later you find out it doesn't keep it up
early all swathi the body's corrective
mechanism compensates for the
intervention I said yeah I've seen Anna
steal cysteine is also prescribed as a
decongestant so I don't know too if
taking that over time is good one other
questions I'll get it's also an
excitotoxin like aspartate and glutamate
and aspartame winter sweet it's an
irritant to the brain and can can
aggravate calcium toxicity in the brain
okay yeah um so I'm 51 and I have
cataracts and I have a friend who's 49
you have scatter acts or just like her
doctors said and I'm wondering if you
know and by the way I haven't to take I
haven't drunk milk for years I got off
that I do like hazelnut milk I think
it's wonderful but I was wondering if
you're aware of you know is there an
increase in cataracts in our society is
there something you're suspicious of
causing this or um or if you had I think
the connection to milk is is that is the
real obvious one but there's a lot of
falling apart going on around us
I mean it's autism is way uh brain
cancer is way up there's there's a lot
of different conditions that I think are
up trending obesity insulin resistance
anybody else want to pipe up from
something out there so this is not an
uncommon thing and you know when you
look at some of the old research there's
there's a few Millett of affect that's
observed with nutritional deficiencies
if you take animals and you run them
through several generations each
generation the nutritional deficiency is
persisted the effects become more and
more intractable and I think that that's
going on with us that we've been
degenerating our diet for long enough
that it wasn't just it's not just us
it's our parents and our grandparents
who were starting this earlier with
different kinds of things I was raised
on coconut oil that means my cancer
likelihood is probably triple what it
would have been if I hadn't been hmm
corn oil excuse me yeah thank you
coconut corn is just okay um so I
actually had three questions for you and
you took the first one on wages now
because your recommendations are all
pretty consistent with good calories bad
calories obviously you would agree with
that in the door sudden and and repeats
advice I think has been consistently
good for about thirty years he's one of
those pioneers this is stuff that I've
been talking about for a long long long
time I'm just glad to put up anybody
else as an authority beyond me for this
kind of thing because there is a problem
anytime you go out in public and
challenge the big lie so this leads me
to my second question which is I don't
know if I missed this from the bio and
the page or something but if we don't
trust anybody why should we trust you
what what is your background or what's
your qualifications for office you
shouldn't trust me you should always
have some doubt for everything that
you're told I'm an organic chemist so
that's my background biochemistry neuro
chemistry all of this but everything I'm
talking to you about
I learned outside of an educational
institution so I don't have a PhD to
hold up there and as a result I think
about the world in ways that are
different from people who have been
through the PhD mill who were
institutionalized who did were educated
in an institution and so there's a
certain level of enablement that happens
with that and there's a certain
blindness that happens with it too where
people become tracked I mean my day job
is nanotechnology development well it
turns out that my core invention for for
nano structural self-assembly system was
based on knowledge that I learned in
1972 in my sophomore organic chemistry
class that in that I brought drew upon
when I was hired as a consultant in 2002
I went back to 1972
thirty-year-old information and invented
a polymer because I would just looked at
it differently than everybody else
looked at it and it took me three days
to invent it it took me three weeks to
even admit that it was an invention
because it was so obvious so my third
question you didn't really talk about
this but it the buzzword showed up on
the slide and it's something that makes
me very nervous you talked about detox
vacation and there's a lot of quack
schemes out there claiming to be
detoxification schemes but it seems like
some people actually might know what
they're talking about also claim to have
something to say about detoxification
because so could you speak a little bit
about that I think it's true and I'm not
an expert enough to give you the the
pros and cons of all of it
I had the same reaction to herbalist
there are a lot of really amazing
herbalist out there but there are also a
lot of you know people who dabble and
herbs are potentially dangerous 5% of
the weight of the average plant is
devoted to chemicals that are designed
to kill you I mean that's how the plant
survives I mean it can't run away it
uses chemical warfare so wheat has
estrogens that make male animals
infertile you know male green you know
for the Buffalo and and you know mustard
has mutagens in it and alfalfa sprouts
have kanaev anine which is an arginine
mimic it produces autoimmune disease in
humans and in chimpanzees so you know
plants are not put there to be our foods
from their own perspective I mean they
don't want to get eaten any more than we
want to get eaten so that that kind of
issue of what the what role toxicity
plays is in my opinion not obvious for
example how many people have heard
anything that doesn't kill you makes you
stronger
well to some extent phyto toxins are
like that that when you expose yourself
you eat a very very plant rich diet you
get all of these chemicals coming in
your body your livers capacity for
detoxifying things gets higher and
higher and higher and higher and so you
may be much better off having that that
overall defense being higher than you
would be if you avoided all toxins which
we know when that's been done is
invariably very very bad for the animals
that are involved in other words if you
eat a refined diet not only you're going
to live half as long as you normally
would but your resistance to flu
oh and accidents and traumas is way way
way down so there is something about
stress and the adaptive capacity that's
induced by stress that is helpful and
this is exercise how many people have
heard it exercise is good yeah right
well exercise produces free radicals
stresses your antioxidant defense system
at the same time but I'm suggesting that
that's not bad that the adaptive
capacity is good so here we are living
it you know in in Googleplex and we have
radiation level that is half of what
people have who live in Denver and yet
do they have twice as much cancer in
Denver no do they have twice as much
radical damage in Denver no it's because
both of us live in a realm of radiation
that is within the human adaptive
capacity you can go up to ten thousand
feet of altitude and still be within
that window you put a human in a nuclear
reactor and they die but there's a bug a
microbe that can live inside the primary
loop of a nuclear reactor and that's
because they have this massive adaptive
capacity for oxidative stress and so
they're able to handle it you know ten
you know 20 times background radiation
so there's a lot of aspects of
detoxification a lot of aspects of
health that are fundamentally based on
stress and living in a polluted world
and and plant pollution or plant toxins
are not fundamentally different from
manmade chemicals if you look at them
from the perspective of what percentage
of them are carcinogens or what
percentage of them are mutagens the
percentages are identical but there may
be some argument to say that on some
level maybe were adapted well adapted to
eating phyto toxins
so my question is regarding allergy
testing and elimination and you
mentioned when testing for a milk
allergy to eliminate it for two weeks
and I've seen some sort of detox
programs that are basically around
eating well for three weeks and
eliminating things like bread and and
and milk and so on so my question is
where does the the two weeks or three
weeks or four weeks where does this
number come come from and how do you
know what's appropriate the the I pick
two weeks because the delayed
hypersensitivity delayed
hypersensitivity timeframe is seven to
ten days seven to nine days in other
words if you make AI GA IgG or IgM
antibodies to something it's going to
take six to nine days for those to fade
away and so if you try to do something
unless time than that you're not going
to you're not gonna have a good baseline
and so two weeks is enough time for
those that that response to attenuate
and so now you're in a sense restoring
at least a partially naive body but you
can certainly do it longer but when I
look at asking somebody to go for off of
milk for two weeks is like asking
somebody to change their religion I mean
this is a lifestyle adaptation which is
on the par with an alcoholic giving up
booze or something like this and so I
try to only ask people for some what I
would consider a kind of minimal level
of performance to make the challenge as
feasible as possible you know bottom
line is if you're not going to do it it
doesn't matter if I tell you that you
can do it and so to make it worse you
know you're just making it you know
tougher for people to comply but so two
weeks is in my opinion you know very
good choice it fits into people's
natural you know timeframes people tend
to organize their lives in terms of
weeks and so if you say one week that's
obvious line enough three weeks is a
week too long so two weeks is fine
you have one more questions coffee
coffee yes you want coffee
yes I want coffee is there a bad side to
coffee not what let's the real effect on
brain performance oh well caffeine is a
insecticide I mean if you take coffee
and you feed it insects they all die and
the you know coffee beans don't really
need to keep from being eaten by humans
because humans typically don't hang out
where coffee grows and so you know but
coffee beans do have you know to defend
themselves against other animals and and
insect predators and stuff like that so
I mean how many people have vegetable
gardens okay how many people use their
coffee grounds in their vegetable
gardens okay half boom yeah it's a very
good a sec insecticide you put coffee
into the growth media for fruit flies
and they'll never develop they'll all
die so but in humans humans caffeine is
not so poisonous in humans it's merely
an irritant irritant to our central
nervous system and so we get edgy from
it we get a lift and which we use
constructively but it lasts for about
two hours which corresponds to the
timing of coffee breaks in the
institutional workplace and the downside
is is that it's going to interfere with
your sleep it's going to interfere with
your DNA replication your DNA repair
mechanisms and so it's probably better
if humans don't get exposed to caffeine
but on the whole it's a relatively minor
you know irritant in the big picture and
it's
ah okay well step right up but the
question is what kinds of tests would I
recommend to find out whether people
have deficiencies and there's two ways
to go that I suggest one is the medical
route go to your doctor and ask for
certain tests those would include a red
blood cell trace mineral profile a
couple hundred bucks and they test maybe
3040 different nutrients you can also
get normative blood so the vitamin
levels you can have the spectra cell
functional medicine tests for nutrients
you can do urine chelation challenge to
find out field lead poisoning or mercury
or cadmium bismuth toxicity the other
way is to do it on what I call the
self-care option in other words you take
it and you notice does it work or not
measure your brain and then see before
and after does taking the nutrient help
and if it does does it continue to help
after 2 weeks or 2 months so do an AV AV
process on it after you've been on it
for two months and stop and see if you
noted decline in your scores of course
this requires you to be diligent about
measuring your brain function and
there's basically several ways to do it
one of which is just to pay attention
well the average person can't tell a
thirty percent drop in their mental
performance from none at all
in other words we're pretty insensitive
so that would suggest to me that you
need to cultivate computer games
something that's going to measure I hand
coordination dexterity simple
decision-making complex decision making
Tetris you know two-dimensional
three-dimensional rotations of blocks
and how fast you can do it a game where
you have a cascade failure design where
the game gets faster and faster and
faster and you know over time and when
you make a mistake it then jumps up
faster as well so so both the gaint the
timeframe and the the number of mistakes
both lead you towards a failure with
this kind of data you can make decisions
extremely rapidly
terms of b1 these 12 you can know in one
week whether or not that's a significant
on a scientific basis you know in one
day just experientially but if you want
to do an ABAP process it will take you a
week to do it and then you'll know for
sure and that's a lot cheaper
fundamentally if you're already a nerd
enough to do the study the measurements
of yourself and to build that
infrastructure so that you have a really
nice data stream and you can tell when
it trans up or when it trims down and
the nice thing about doing that which is
why I do it and why I suggest other
people do it is that when you go into a
hospital and you get elective surgery
and you find that the anesthesia hasn't
fully worn off you will see the
downtrend event from that anesthesia and
you'll know that there's something that
hasn't been resolved and you go back to
the doctor and say I need t3 mono
therapy for a week or something else to
restore your metabolism that the doctor
believes is there is no residual effect
from
oops I'm late overtime okay okay thank
you thank you that was it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
