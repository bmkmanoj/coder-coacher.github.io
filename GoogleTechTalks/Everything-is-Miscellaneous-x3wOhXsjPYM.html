for arranging this thanks for having me
in I have a book out
so I don't know what to say so I'm David
Weinberger I'm at the Harvard Berkman
Center I'm a writer this is a book that
came out on May 1st so that was like a
week ago this this is our actual
miscellaneous draw in our kitchen I know
it's fascinating you can tell a lot
about us from the that we occasionally
open cans and have difficulty opening
large jars the the book is called
everything is miscellaneous the power of
the new digital disorder subtitle and
the basic idea of it is so I'm going to
talk for too long first of all a be
there I will get to a point where you
you'll be sure that I'm done because it
sounds like I say and so it's a false
ending and I go on from there and I just
want to get you over your little
disappointment the the basic idea of the
book is that we're really good at
organizing stuff we've had I don't know
how to count but say 10,000 years
figuring out how to organize I'm going
to talk way too fast and if I'm going
too fast let me know I may speed up as I
see time dwindling we've gotten really
good at organizing physical objects just
fantastic at it and also then organizing
ideas and knowledge and the basic idea
has been that you make some type of
organization that could be as neat as
this one we do like these trees very
much and then there's always one section
of it that where the stuff that doesn't
fit you shovel everything into that and
if that section and this is true whether
it's a org chart or it's a although org
charts actually don't have miscellaneous
positions now they think of it maybe
they should but they do they're not
titled miscellaneous that's physically
it's it would be the drawer in the
kitchen the one that I just heard the
picture of where if if that becomes too
big then your organization scheme has
failed
traditionally alright then you've just
you've got to start over again what the
book is suggesting is that what's going
on online as a strategy and it's a good
is that the miscellaneous drawers taking
over the org chart and that's that's
actually incredibly healthy it's a huge
step forward for us in business and but
also in science and education and
politics
and the stuff that's touching knowledge
it's actually a really good thing
PowerPoint scales fonts horribly so
we're all used to playlists so I mean
they're very common they're really
really they're tiny things but they say
something very big about what we're
doing the fact that we're able to
fluidly divide up our stuff any way we
want is actually quite new especially if
you compare it to what we had to do in
what we have to do in physical world
which is we have to come up with a set
of categories one person gets to come up
with them for our committee but there's
only what in the physical world you only
get to order things one way and so what
the growth of the miscellaneous is
actually about and what and although the
book for marketing purposes doesn't say
this and correctly for marketing
purposes the book is actually an
argument against the idea and we put it
into Aristotle's mouth if you want if
you really want to drive down sales
we'll say it's an argument against
Aristotle that there's one right way of
ordering the world
well there's had to be we've had to come
up with singular ways of ordering the
world because we're ordering physical
things and physical things have to go in
one spot it's just the way it works
it's as if reality's secret plan is just
to keep things apart to make it as glad
how hard you try you cannot have two
things in the same in the same spot
so that's the first principle that has
guided our physical organization and the
second obviously closely related that is
that everything has to go somewhere so
in every domain we come up with ways of
dividing the stuff and it's different in
every domain and it's appropriate to
each domain but it's in every domain
everything has to go someplace and it
can only go one place and we're
amazingly good at doing this work after
thousands of years of doing it
nevertheless those are very severe
limitations they're not natural
limitations on thought they are on on
physical stuff but not on thought and
there's an immediate political
consequence to having to do this to
having that put things in one and only
one place which is somebody's got to
make that decision and that decision
gives that person power and authority
it's just the way it works so when
you're somebody decides what goes on the
front page of the newspaper and they
have to because you only have those two
square feet or so to give the most
important news of the day that's a big
deal so we have editors who are good at
doing that and generally they make
really good decisions generally but they
never can make a decision that's right
for everybody you just can't do it it's
not because they're not good at it it's
just that it can't be done it's same
thing with encyclopedias and books in
general somebody decides what gets
published and the 32 volumes of the of
the Encyclopedia Britannica are not
decided upon because that's how much
knowledge there is it's a thirty facts
when you can publish economically you
cannot have an infinite encyclopedia
until you move online and then you can
so 32 volumes 65,000 topics so you got
to pick the best ones you can and we
make reasonable decisions and we make
reasonable decisions about how to divide
up those topics how to organize the
information either in an encyclopedia or
a text book or in a newspaper or in a
store nevertheless it's a decision being
made for everyone and this pervades our
culture it has to because we live have
lived in a world of atoms where we have
to classify things in order to decide
which movies you get to see this was an
x-rated movie at the time which is now
laughable it involves things that aren't
so important like who gets to compete in
in tournaments in the Olympics and how
an online
kamar site is going to divide up its its
stuff so we can browse through it in
ways that they hope will find useful and
and appealing still you make that one to
say that determines the question of
categorization determines who gets to
participate in presidential debates for
example is an immediate effect on how
democracy works and then for much more
important things like apart height where
it was three thousand pages of race
rules of race laws it was if you were
not white you carried around in South
Africa a fifty page book about your race
this was insanity it was so finely
divided that they had to come up with a
category of honorary whites
this is because people weren't they knew
that some people were not supposed to be
oppressed but they couldn't figure out
how to get the laws to work that way so
they came up with a category there's a
famous case one guy in South Africa who
by the time he was fifteen had been
reclassified racially because the laws
changed and so now he was a different
race five times by the time he was fifty
in one occasion having to lead his wife
and family because his race changed as
he sat there his race changed likewise
this is a American Psychiatric
Association meeting in 1972 this guy
it's not a great picture but this guy
doesn't look like this this is a mask
this is john fryer in a mask in a wig in
two suits of clothing so his body would
be hidden and a voice disguiser so that
he could do this outrageous thing of be
on a panel and acknowledged that he was
gay because at that point homosexuality
was classified as as as a disease and
you could not have that disease and be a
psychiatrist you would be drummed out of
the api ata the next meeting a guy gave
a talk who also gay called stop it
you're making me sick and it was
literally that was literally the case
that the rules play we're classifying
him as diseased and the instant the
rules were changed he was healthy it was
just that easy so there are obviously
really serious consequences to how we
categorize and classify
Plato had really put this quite
beautifully when he said that in it
those who know how to talk and spend
head towards the truth the key principle
is to carve nature at its joints and he
had in mind literally butchering an
animal it's a wonderful metaphor I mean
you know that there are places where you
just have to hack in the bad sense yeah
just a hack at the bone that's not a
good butcher a good butcher knows where
the natural places to divide the world
up are and that's what we should be
doing so once again this is this is the
metaphor of the of the physical guiding
our idea about how ideas work so this is
what I just like this this traitor to
his species here but this is how the
world looked to Plato it's also how it
has looked to us even though we we're we
tend to say no no we're not that naive
but in some ways frankly we are this is
a very hard belief to give up so here is
the solar system except as of the summer
here is a solar system there goes Pluto
what happened was as you know the
International Astronomical Union had
committees that met for years and gotten
broiled in politics I mean I had to
reformulate the committees and when it
finally came to a vote the work of the
committee's was largely ignored they put
it to a majority vote what is a planet a
majority vote among scientists so they
came up with a definition and the
definition has basically two parts
definition of a planet which has never
had a definition before I mean these are
important objects of scientific study
they were undefined that we know from
the ancient Greek so plant the word
planet comes from wander it's the lights
and the heavens that don't follow the
circle circular motion but there once
we've discovered wines that were not
visible from with the naked eye we don't
have it there's no definition thousand
years so two part definition an object
that is large enough to round itself
here's the having that has enough mass
that will round itself the natural
action of gravity in the second is a
little cleared space well so why that
first definition because that you know
what it's because they wanted to say
that a planet is big but big is not
scientific
and one of the proposals was well we'll
say mercury or half the size of mercury
somewhat but that's not scientific
either so let's come up with scientific
and what scientific is oh well gravity
has this effect okay that's true that's
but why care about that why is that a
criterion who cares
likewise clear the clear at space the
only reason that's in there is to make
sure that we get well eight out of the
nine planets we want the aim of this was
to preserve the planets it's that simple
and we would come up with whatever
definition we had to in order to do that
so we ended up pointing at attributes
that are contribute that are as trivial
as Paris Hilton boots there's no
scientific interest in a lot of objects
that are large enough to around
themselves I'm sorry that came out
entirely wrong I I've talked about this
before I've never made the comparison
though and I didn't know it was going to
end up oh my god I have no idea where I
was Paris Hilton so there's no the
largest of the massive planets is
completely uninteresting what's
interesting about planets maybe or about
bodies circling the Sun is that some of
them have atmospheres that's pretty
interesting because other things follow
from it or they have water that's pretty
interesting is maybe there's life on
these planets but big and round who
cares it's only because we wanted to
keep those nine that so so there are
four objects apparently that have
atmospheres in the in the solar system
and I'll probably get this wrong but
you'll correct me therefore and one of
them is Titan is a moon that's an
interesting way of slicing things up
doing it this way is really really
scientifically uninteresting what's far
better would be to take a miscellaneous
view that is to say there's tons and
tons of attributes depending on what
we're interested in something we'll
slice and dice different ways if we're
interested in extraterrestrial life the
water is very interesting if we're
interested in mining then presence of
copper becomes interesting if we're
interested in things that may get us
thence other objects become interesting
rather than so the notion that there are
nine things we need to preserve right
back to Plato it's far better to to be
able to slice and dice along many many
different attributes in fact it may be
and I'll go so far as to say it is the
case that the universe to Plato look
like this but in fact is much more like
this where there are just so many
attributes of things and so thus so many
ways we can cluster and slice and dice
that to limit yourself to just some set
of them to say well there are natural
joints well every attribute is a joint
every attribute of every object is a way
that you might want to cluster and join
that's not to say every way of cutting
and dicing is right that the world is in
flux and anything you want goes that's
not the case as Umberto Eco the novelist
and academic philosopher by the way has
pointed out there are many cuts of
animal but there's none that connects
the the snout and the tail not
everything is possible but there are so
many there's an indefinite number of
ways we can slice and dice the universe
so we do so we make categories and by
making categories all that all that
we're doing is is saying the two things
are alike in some way but we get to
choose what the principle of likeness is
depending upon depending upon what our
interests are what we're trying to do
what our project is we can be wrong all
right I mean we can be wrong or we can
be right we can misclassify for sure
there are limits but it's also the case
that any two things we bring together we
probably can find a way in which they
can be brought together there's some
principle undergirding them if we want
them to be so we have enormous latitude
and how we do this but we don't do it
randomly we do it because we're trying
to do something that's the problem with
thinking there's only one order of the
universe the order of the universe it's
it's that one is not based upon our
projects it's and thus is the one order
that nobody cares about the rest of the
orders that we see the real ones are
always emerged because they're trying to
do something that matters to us
we're able to do this because not only
do things have attributes the attributes
tend to cluster so if you come across
something that looks like this smells
like this and feels like this very
likely it also tastes like it and
occasionally you're wrong and you end up
picking wax fruit out of your mouth but
generally you're not the world just
seems to be clustered that had these
clusters of attributes it seems to be a
condition for you know at the end of the
universe when everything's so modulized
that'll be different right now things
are clustered very nicely for us there's
a lot to explore and to know and we get
to do it the way that makes sense to us
so we we make these categories and we
make further categories and because
we're clever species we go up a level
and we start making more categories of
categories and categories of categories
until we get entire trees these are
incredibly useful objects is a really
useful way of understanding the universe
because they let us know these things
inherit from the top of it so if you
know that Apple is a fruit you also know
that it's a part of a plant that's part
of vegetative life and so forth but you
don't have to know that every time you
bite into an apple it's there for you to
know this is a very compact way of
representing the universe and very
powerful with Aristotle you get all of
the all everything put into these trees
animals it the best example maybe where
to be a bird means to be like these
other things but also to be a particular
bird which means you're not like other
members of the categories very
sophisticated sense of similarity and
difference that enables you to build a
structure that represents the entire
that captures the perfect order of the
entire world in which everything has a
single place and furthermore that place
is determined by a strict definition
that tells you what goes in this
category and what doesn't and to know
for Aristotle was to know what these
definitions are that without these
definitions there's no possibility of
knowledge this is what knowledge is
about so it depends upon having a view
that everything is perfectly ordered and
ordered by perfect definitions and
that's the view that we are rapidly
moving away from especially in the
digital world we love these trees these
trees are just so
awesome and so useful that we use them
all over the place but the I guess dirty
little secret about these trees is that
let's say you're putting away your
laundry ok this is the clean laundry so
what you do is first you divide it up
you lump and you split ok so you have a
big lump and you divide it you split it
up into smaller lumps by person
typically and then typically by body
part and so forth until you're ready to
put things away and one of the one of
the consequences of this of the process
is that if when you are filing you've
got the new pair of socks you have to
decide which of two piles it's going to
go into and you can use whatever system
you want you know divides forts socks
from dress socks or winter socks and
that doesn't matter you have to be
binary about it because that's how atoms
work have to go in one place so you make
your decision
so after you've finished this process if
you were to map the decisions you went
through you would have a tree you have
to you have to make these binary splits
first you divided by person and body
part and so forth these trees represent
the limitate the trees we've been using
for organizing our ideas are in fact
well what you get
following the limitations of organizing
real things everything has to go into
one or the other pile limiting thought
the organization of thought by the
limits of how you put away your laundry
is a terrible limitation that we've
suffered under because we've represented
knowledge ideas we've had to in physical
objects we've had up file the physical
stuff and so we we've absorbed into our
idea system the very limitation that's
on the physical there's a terrible
terrible limitation libraries god bless
him but these are just as reality is
designed to keep things apart libraries
are inevitably not designed to but have
to keep ideas apart so if you come
across any books have links in them with
footnotes come across the footnote here
if you're in a Harvard library which
this is not this is a much flatter
library than the Harvard library the
Widener the great Widener like
you come across a footnote you want to
trace it you know you're gonna be
traveling down a hall going up an
elevator across because there's a bridge
down the bridge through the tunnel
through the literal damn tunnel to get
to the next section of it where you'll
find the book except it won't be there
it's either out or it's in a different
library one of the ninety libraries it's
as if libraries were designed to keep
ideas apart whereas online you'd follow
it like that so we've managed to
internalize the representation of the
organization of ideas using the
limitations of the physical and with the
easiest guy to kick on this is Melville
Dewey is it's a switch I didn't even
want to but it's a I can't it's
irresistible
he's a Dewey Decimal System who 90% of
US public libraries and public school
libraries music 1876 he was a 20 year
old one 21 year old punk who's he's 21
years old he hadn't even totally
graduated from his Orthodox Christian
isolated college in the middle of
Massachusetts a tiny provincial college
I needed he decides he's gonna organize
all knowledge and so he did he was an
extreme rationalist he was a spelling
simplification esteem Ettrick person all
of which are this is do you think
rationalism is gonna solve all problems
that's what you do so he spelled his
name like this for a while then when he
became the light burst librarian at
Columbia change it back to Dewey he he
was slightly crazy so he liked decimals
he liked he just loved tens he he
acknowledged this he just loved tens he
loved ten so much and I'm not making
this up that he would try to arrange
travel so that he would arrive on a date
that ended with a zero just made him
feel better
he's crazy this is this is where
rationalism steps over into superstition
and craziness so he said 1010 is such a
good number let's divide everything up
into ten we'll have ten basic you know
root categories and each will have ten
subcategories and each of those will
have ten subcategories and so we have a
thousand integers to play with
well okay you know that's right and then
you get an indefinite number in the in
the fraction so we can accommodate
everything so it wasn't completely crazy
he's still allowed for that well okay so
let's say you're gonna build a new
kitchen you're gonna design it and you
you were doing you say you know what ten
I'm gonna have ten cabinets and each tab
cabinets gonna have ten shelves and each
shelf is gonna have ten slots oh that
will be beautiful so now let's put in my
spices I need to have 10 spices I only
have 8g I got the 8 the first day we're
really easy and even no there - what can
i what can I count as a spice Oh
chocolate sprinkles there spices well
popcorn salt that's a spice well ok
maybe it is maybe it isn't
chocolate sauce probably not but you
need to have 10 but that's exactly what
he did for knowledge and for books have
to have 10 of each the the requirement
that this is a reflection of personal is
apparent when you think about how your
children would organize if you told them
organize the kitchen it tends they would
have different set of basic categories
so you see that immediately in the Dewey
Decimal System so for for example in the
100's philosophy and psychology and the
100 by the way are the most important
because this is this is hierarchical
into in 3 dimensions or it's a very
hierarchical system so philosophy the
the queen of the sciences here the
hundreds here so the the integers oh my
god paranormal occult parapsychology
dreams and mysteries divinatory
graphology predicting the future by your
handwriting and phrenology predicting
character by the bumps on your head this
is still there these are the top level
categories yeah and just one other
example again because it's just too easy
is religion which is the second most
important it's the 200s where Jews we
get our own integer yes ok Islam nice
shares a little bit they updated this a
few years ago 297 is now Islam Bob ISM
and Baha'i which is fine except that
there are many Muslims who do not
consider those other two religions to be
as serious as Islam there's
nineteenth-century religions so they
don't quite have the pedigree but
nevertheless and then Zoroastrianism yes
its own integer and the Buddhists to the
right of the decimal point they didn't
make it it's just too bad you know they
should have tried harder gotten a better
PR agent or something because it's
frankly it's a little embarrassing to be
you know only part of a an integer so
why don't they fix it well they do
continually update it and polish it and
and get it better but it still remains
deeply broken deeply broken because
there's really not that much point in
trying to fix it so let's say they spend
I don't know how long did redo
everything and they start from the
beginning and they redo it and they
announce it and all the librarians go
out with razor blades and the scrape off
the white letters from the from the
spines of all the books and they put on
the new ones and within days less than
that the disputes will begin because the
Moslem oh my god the Shiites and the
Sunnis either are or are not at the same
level the Jews for Jesus category it's
under the Jews the Jews don't want that
it goes under the Christians the
Christians aren't crazy about that all
of the feminists and gender issues that
arise there is no possibility of
agreeing on this the librarians will be
holding they'll have to weld of the
razor blades under their fingernails
because they're never gonna be settled
and it's not because the people who own
the Dewey Decimal System aren't smart
and don't care about about issues of
equity and quite the contrary quite the
contrary
so there's we don't agree there's the
problem and we never will agree how we
organize the world is a deep issue and
we are just not going to agree on it
there is no single way of organizing the
world there wasn't for Plato that can't
be for Dewey when you're organizing
physical books you got to come up with
something and do the best job you can
but people are still gonna be pissed at
you all the time all the time can't help
it digitally it's different because
we're digitizing everything and that
changes the basic set of rules so I want
to quickly go through four principles
that change and then talk about some of
the I think sort of larger implications
of this beyond the Dewey Decimal System
so I think it's useful to think of
about there being three orders of order
in the first order who is the Batmen
archive largest most important
collection of historic photos in the
u.s. 11 million photos that were buried
is 220 feet below ground in middle of
Pennsylvania to keep it safe in the
first order you organize the things
themselves you put the pictures in the
in the filing cabinets or the put the
books on the shelves alright second
order so you do the best you can there
and you preserve the materials second
order you go through the airlock at the
Bettman I mean literally there's an
airlock because they're dropping the
temperature in the first order
collection mm-hmm and you have the
second order where you separate the
metadata about the objects and very
familiar way of doing it there lots of
ways but this is the most familiar where
you take this rich information so you're
in a library you got a whole book you
reduce it to a three by five card and
you make good decisions because we are
we've gotten very good at doing this
library science as you know is is pretty
advanced so you make good decisions
about what information is gonna fit on
that three by five card but nevertheless
you are excluding huge amounts of useful
information because you have to because
you don't want just for physical reasons
card catalogue can't get too big so and
you get maybe two or three sort orders
now instead of just the one author
subject title maybe four but not a lot
more than that because it gets unwieldy
because atoms just suck in the third
order everything is digital the contents
and the information about the data and
the med metadata are all digital and
that changes the basic principles four
basic principles of change the first is
that we are very used to the idea if you
can this is a physical store and you get
a new camera or you're gonna put it onto
some shelf probably on the camera shelf
maybe in the sporting goods shelf maybe
in the new arrival but you're gonna pick
one it's a digital store you can put
into every shelf you possibly can i mean
amazon is brilliant at this by the way
why because why not it's free more
people will find it they'll be happy
you'll be happy so now a leaf can go on
many branches but this totally would
shock Aristotle Aristotle would say
you've just betrayed the principle of
being the be a Robin is to be in this
one branch
being on multiple branches that is
that's chaos knowledge cannot exist in
such a system but nevertheless we want
to sell cameras so we'll put them into
many categories as we can a second is
that in the real world messiness is a
big problem because you can't find stuff
online messiness in a couple of senses
is really good and in one sense if you
if you post something and there's so
many links to it you can't even follow
them anymore your post was a huge
success that's fantastic
the the messiness of these relationships
accrete meaning that they are the
accretion of meaning and I'll come back
to that but that enriches in important
ways the knowledge and information and
ideas are putting up it's not so in the
third order messiness is okay because
you're not rearranging the actual stuff
when you're making a playlist you're not
actually moving items around you're
doing new metadata and so you can do as
much as you want you never have to
actually disturb the stuff we can do
layers and layers and layers on top of
it the third thing that changes is that
we used to be pretty sure there is a
difference between data and metadata and
now not so much so it used to be that
metadata might be if you're looking for
the you know the name of the author you
can't remember what the book was zero so
you type in Herman Melville and you
press the search button on some search
engine you know whichever one you prefer
and and you'll get back not just the
name of the book now because everything
is digital you will get back the actual
contents thank you for google print you
look back the actual contents okay so
now you have a different problem you
remember some content you say I know is
that book it has the phrase and maybe
the first line and call me Ishmael
wonder who wrote that and so now you
search on that and you get back the
author and what this means is there is
no longer any distinction between
metadata and data except so this this
functional one that metadata is what you
know and data is what you're looking for
and you use the metadata to pry up the
data everything is metadata in this
matters because we use metadata we
always have to locate the stuff we're
looking for
the fight to use what we know to find
what we don't know and if everything is
metadata now if everything is a lever we
just got way smaller than we were ten
years ago the ability to fight okay good
so I'm tempted to repeat it again
because I think to repeat it because I
think it's an important point but I
don't want to repeat it and so I would
be bad for all of us and the fourth
thing that changes is that we're very
used to the idea that well so we go into
a store clothing store and the rational
thing to do is to go through and to pull
off all the clothing within your size
because everything else is just noise so
you may go through with your shopping
cart and you start making this pile
you'll be thrown out in 90 seconds
just get out if you go online and they
do the equivalent of what happens to you
in a real world store where they make
you walk past aisles of stuff you don't
care about it's the wrong gender it's
the wrong size it's the wrong season you
do not look you would leave there in 30
seconds and so what's changed is it used
to be that the people who owned the
stuff also owned the organization of it
and now we do we own the organization of
it and so obviously one of the most
fertile fields around is developing the
tools by which we the users get to
organize other people's stuff one of
them is faceted classification these are
people familiar with that very briefly
then just because not everybody nodded
transitive classification this is your
North Carolina State University's
library allows you to as a user to
browse in a tree-like fashion because
that's a very convenient way of browsing
except you get to pick watch the route
and watch the next branch so if you want
to browse first by century and then buy
by the authors places a country of birth
and then by male or female and you can
and if your next instance in so you say
you know what matters to me I want to
separate I want to browse only male
authors you browse first by gender and
then you browse by year or by language
you get to construct the tree so it has
the virtue of trees without the inherent
limitation that of trees namely that you
have to browse the tree the way somebody
else thought you would want to so this
is being used all over this is a new egg
which has a very nice guy
navigation system as it's called it's a
faceted system IBM uses it to put
together teams of consultants very
quickly this is a good business example
because they they save millions of
dollars doing this instead of us using a
flat of using a database to do it and
there's a there's a company that makes
engineering parts physical engineering
parts have twenty five million parts and
they have a faceted system with
thousands of facets of faceted
classification yeah
so this stuff actually works and it's
showing up very rapidly it's showing up
in lots of places and it gives the
control back to the users perhaps you've
heard of this thing called tagging where
obviously you get the tag in this case
web pages but you know all sorts of
things are being tagged now with the
tabs that matter to you and obviously
the important part of it is not only
does it help you locate the stuff that
you've tagged which is a handy tool but
in so doing you're doing it publicly it
turns out and so everybody else can also
browse by the tag so in other words you
can have the rest of the world do
research for you you can see what
everybody else you're interested in
design or in robotics or whatever you
know obviously you can see what pages
they've turned up expert experts emerge
and because we're an insanely social
species we start noticing who's been
contributing tags and then we we talk
with them and we fall in love and we get
married we're just you know that's
pretty much what we do you can tell a
lot about a person by your by your tag
cloud tagging is I'm very enthusiam
portent they're big practical advantages
to it I'm skipping over all of that
because I assume that's all familiar to
you ok nevertheless there's also a side
of it that I think should be admitted to
in public which is one of the reasons I
think that folksonomies and tagging is
has caught on with such fervor among
many of us is that it is a little bit
the way I'm sticking it to the man we
got to create our own categories at long
last we don't have to it you know the
post modernists have been reviled and
for saying things like authors are not
the best judges of the contents of their
work though the author's intention
doesn't count for that much well you
know what they're right and and tagging
shows that it's the readers decision
about what the book is about but real
really counts and the author gets to
contribute one tag but the rest of us
get to contribute our own tags and there
is something satisfying about that so it
seems to me not at the end soon though
soon it seems to me that we're going
from thinking that the universe is
organized in one way and preferably into
this beautiful tree of perfect
categories the pulling down all the
leaves making this huge pile of
miscellaneous stuff enriching it with
metadata as much as we possibly can some
generated by the owners most of it
generated by the users and and changing
the the basic idea which used to be you
want to exclude all of the crap because
who has time so we have experts who
filter and show us what we need to see
and they organize it into categories for
us which is takes experts knew that's
how we used to do things now I think the
idea is the best strategy in most
instances include everything it costs
more to delete stuff than it does to
save it which you know from looking in
your in your digital camera folders
we're you know we endlessly DSC zero
zero ones 175 that JPEG you don't even
know what's in there in order to go
through and delete that you got to look
at the pictures and make decisions it's
just easier to preserve than to delete
so capture everything capture that I
can't believe I'm making another
reference to Paris Hilton's boob job but
capture that too because even though it
is by any measure trivial you're certain
we can be certain that within five years
50 years it going to be a graduate
student doing a dissertation on the
media's treatment of Paris Hilton of
trivia and if that stuff is not included
we've lost it so included why not so
include everything and postpone the
moment when we taxon amaizing we
organize it until the user does it
herself because the user has some
particular interest which you simply
nobody can anticipate so we are rapidly
heading towards mashups right I mean
maybe you've heard of them where we do
things that a real estate site like
capture everything including of course
what's available the school systems the
crime reports the the Republican versus
democratic areas in Massachusetts
where the Starbucks are that because
that may matter to somebody or where
Starbuck free zones are so even yet that
you know go for miles left somebody's
gonna want to know where are the
graveyards because they're you know they
got some weird fetish thing going on or
because they do the the the etchings
what you call in the rubbings which also
sounds fetishistic when you think about
it but that's their hobby and somebody
else is gonna want to know where the
good dog parks are and where dog owners
are and somebody's gonna want to know
the intersection for god knows what
reason that somebody's gonna want to
know that flight paths are obvious but
most people going to not want to live
under him my old thesis adviser Thomas
Lang in the late Thomas Langan he like
to sit out in his backyard in Toronto
he's actually pretty obnoxious to tell
you the truth then you sit there with
his binoculars and you're trying to talk
about your dissertation and he would
every time a plane went over he wouldn't
even use the binoculars he would say oh
that's the let's play one one two seven
it's on its way to Paris it's a little
late and it's a seven twenty seven they
must have swapped it out for the by
engine so he wanted to live under the
flight paths that's my point I'm sorry
I'm getting lost you can't know what
people are going what their interests
are and so have so include everything
and let us sort it the way we want to
so three areas I think this matters I am
gonna cool like the wind
first this simplicity we've been living
in an age for a number of reasons
including broadcast that has intensified
the the emphasis on keeping things
simple so the president makes a speech
and you know that every presidential
speechwriter says the same thing keep it
simple a year ago President Bush gave a
speech on immigration terribly complex
problem keep it simple keep it simple
that's what the speech writers did
twenty four hundred words later he was
done you're not a bad speech you know
I'm for well not a bad speech typical
speech don't go there don't go there so
within an hour a couple hours afterwards
I checked it at Technorati and there
were twenty oh sorry
faux pas okay I check at Technorati and
there are over 2,400 blog posts about
this speech so it's like there were one
per word and without looking at all them
you know what pretty much with each one
did which is you know they look at the
speech and they say oh interesting did
you notice that he changed his position
from when he was governor oh I didn't
know that you noticed that this
contradicts what he said this Arnold
Schwarzenegger is saying something
different is interesting bloggers do
this thing where they take a simple
object and they find what's complex
about it that and that's not so unusual
because that's exactly what we do in
conversation in every conversation
that's what we do we we we don't just
sit there and say yes I agree well now I
want to agree further with you that's
interesting let's agree we find what's
different and interesting we make things
complex and now we can do this on an
order of magnitude we've never been able
to do before and we're thrilled that's
one of the reasons why people I believe
are so so thrilled about blogging after
being treated like freaking morons by
the media for a hundred years in order
to get the economics of reaching the
maximum number of people the mass
audience at long last we get this moment
of revenge where we get the to be
interesting and complex again so I
wanted to come back briefly to Aristotle
Aristotle who was an enormous Li complex
thinker by the way I wouldn't want to
slight him for a second an incredible
genius just amazing to know is to know
what the simple definitions method
definitions that cut as cleanly as a
knife well Eleanor Rosch who is a
cognitive psychology at UC Berkeley had
a very it has a very different idea
which is prototype theory I'm so really
so this is gonna be fast very really
quickly the idea is what does it mean to
be a Robin well it doesn't mean to be
perfectly defined what a Robin is in
fact if I act you can all recognize
Robins but I've asked you to define them
you probably couldn't give me a great
definition nothing person you probably
can't and I couldn't you know what
skipping is I've never even heard
anybody give a good definition of
skipping just save that for the Q&amp;amp;A so
what happened she says well you know you
know Robin is a bird because your
parents when you were young pointed that
and said Oh birdie and that became your
prototype and it appointed a sparrow is
a birdie and you said birdie and that
those became your prototype birds
without a definition and so as over the
course of your life you're surprised as
a child to find out eventually the
penguin is a bird but you accept that
it's not a very good example of a bird
somebody wanted to know what a bird is
they genuinely don't you wouldn't point
out a penguin you'd point to a Robin and
so she says this is how we learn and
this is how we organize our world
through prototypes and some are good
examples some are bad examples are blah
is this a blog I'm reading this thing
I'm not sure it's a blog what is the
definition of a blog don't know but I
know who some really exemplar are
bloggers and what a blog is look at this
one look at that one this one doesn't
have comments so maybe it's not a
perfect example of a blog but it's still
a blog it's just not a great example of
one
this by the way echo stuff that Dickens
mine did just tip of the hat so the
reason this is interesting within the
digital world I believe within tagging
is that Joshua Schachter of delicious
says you can something can be 73% of a
category not for Aristotle you can't be
but you can if you tag stuff that's what
folksonomies do they're not simply
replacements of taxonomy z' they're
their representation of a wavefront in
which things can be 73% of the category
that is a that's important that's not
how we thought our world was defined
okay second point out of three
homestretch here if you go to Wikipedia
and look at tomato there's a section of
the tomato article on tomato vs. tomahto
because you know it's something we're
interested in so I want to imagine for
and of course this is a discussion page
about the tomato versus tomorrow so I
want to imagine the three people
contributed to this and I'm making up
the example so you have to go along with
me and the first person by the way
that's Aristotle it's the world's
greatest expert on tomato versus tomato
and he writes up the piece he put some
time into it gets it right second person
comes along changes it first person says
greatest expert I'm reverting it back to
where I was I mean I know what I'm
talking about I don't even know who this
person is third person changes it again
first person says I'm not playing this
game you keep changing it world's
greatest expert genuinely is my example
so I'm leaving which is absolutely his
or her right of course nevertheless that
means this person has now become
functionally irrelevant world's greatest
expert irrelevant
meanwhile I it seems to me this person's
ideas would be improved by entering into
conversation even if he has to correct
some some moron and very likely these
people aren't entire morons ideas get
bugs they get driven out of out of ideas
through discussion through the public
negotiation of conversation if that
that's where knowledge is so a really
clear example of this is you're on
mailing lists I've been on some mailing
lists for 15 years maybe more
so we're moderately specialized things I
care about and on those lists I find out
what the what the news is in the area
and I see people who know way more than
I do talking about this new stuff
arguing amongst themselves these are
experts in conversation it's very clear
that the mailing list itself knows more
than any of the experts on it do and
this is a really really good thing this
public negotiation of knowledge through
conversation one of the consequences of
this is that we end up having to lead
infallibility into our notion of
knowledge which has been driven out
until now well pretty much so Wikipedia
is very happy to have these notices
stuck in fav over a hundred of them you
can make up your own if you don't like
them these are all the ways encyclopedia
articles can go wrong it's not neutral
contradicts an article contradicts
itself isn't worthy of an encyclopedia
doesn't cite sources reads like an
advertisement reads like a sermon
contains weasel words they're very happy
that I put these they encourage you to
put up these notices saying this article
isn't good enough don't fully believe
this article and because of that we know
that Wikipedia is on our side it's very
clear that this becomes more credible
because they're willing to admit their
lack of credibility their lack of
authority it's on it's not trying to
convince us that it's the world's
greatest authority it's trying to help
us know and the metadata here the fal
ability metadata is crucial to that the
question is why you will never see this
here
and it's because these sources have a
vested interest in appearing
authoritative third and final this is
the philosopher Martin Heidegger
nineteen twenty twenty nineteen twenty
seven in the early Nazi years we can
talk about that later if you want if
it's not clear I'm a Jew I'm not crazy
about Heidegger I'd as a Nazi I did my
dissertation on him because I especially
because I think especially in what I'm
about to talk about I think he's right
and it's fairly simple idea
he asked what does it mean to be a
hammer to be a thing take a hammer as an
example and he doesn't mean if you were
March it means on this planet what does
it mean you says well to know what a
hammer is as a hammer you got to know
about nails I just be weird that you'd
say it's for hammering nail so but to
know what nails are you really have to
understand wood and how would accept
nails and know about wood means you have
to know about lumber lumber your trees
trees forests you need an economic
system you understand for connecting
these things is that how its works you
don't really understand farce unless you
understand they grow on an earth and
they do so in a sky with a Sun and all
of that is what it means to be a hammer
a hammer is its place in this
referential context of significance of
meaning a semantic web a real semantic
web the one that we live in that's
called the world that's what it means to
be a hammer so for the moment pretend
that's true I actually think it is true
many have pointed out that we as a
species externalize functions of
consciousness this is how we advance so
we externalized writing a memory in
writing and knowledge and books and
arithmetic in calculators and that's a
really good thing so what I want to
speculatively advance is the idea that
works now externalizing meaning this
connection this rich implicit
connections of significance of semantics
and we're doing this every way that we
can we do it every time we tad publicly
we're adding to this new infrastructure
of meaning that we've never had before
because these tags connect things and
are publicly available taxonomy is we
still need experts we still need
taxonomy ZAR incredibly valuable every
time you do one you are adding to this
this miscellaneous pile of stopped
through the semantic web writ small writ
large it's pointing out building up
these connections
through blogging and everything that we
post we're making connections between
the pieces and we're contextualizing
them every playlist whether it's for
music or at Harvard there's a playlist
for four four syllabi playlists are also
powerful ways of making connections and
drawing the pieces together through
sites like Digg and reddit which are
doing it for news for every
fundamentally every hyperlink makes a
connection of meaning between pieces and
it's it's cumulative we're doing this
we'll be doing this for generations
building this rich layer of meaning that
we can then draw upon and the most
important thing about this is that this
is not being done for us it's not being
done by experts it's not well vetted
it's it's good information it's bad
information but it's ours it's what
we're doing for ourselves if you wanted
to know what we're interested in you
shouldn't look at the Britannica should
look at Wikipedia all 1.7 million
articles in English and serve the
deep-fried Mars bars article in the
history of umlauts and heavy metal bands
for all that stuff it's a better
reflection of what we're interested in
than the New York Times then the
Britannica that any controlled source
can be this is the natural reflection
and it's ours we are building it for
ourselves it's up to us to decide what
to do with it but the fact that we were
building this infrastructure of meaning
seems to me to be a generational task
and of tremendous importance Thanks
I hate myself yes there's one too many
probably which reminds of spending all
this time teaching let us say sociology
101 yes there it's tough to be an expert
approaching Wikipedia because as you say
you may be tutoring constantly and then
permanently guarding checking back to
see we're all getting notifications of
when edits are being made so you may not
that may not be your role as an expert
that may take another expert or somebody
who cares deeply about it to patrol it
and to to keep it at the level at which
you've left it so far it seems to be
working pretty well at Wikipedia
Wikipedia seems to be a pretty good
resource it may who knows what will
happen over time and it may be there
will be a type of expert decay as
experts lose interest in that there's
also been talk about I saw I'm still
waiting for somebody to do another layer
on top of Wikipedia not on the site but
that's for example the Lord's Wikipedia
that's just metadata that points to the
Articles that it finds acceptable or the
American Psychiatric Association
Wikipedia that points at the articles at
at the state the particular version of
an article that they think is OK and
pull all that together so maybe that's
what will happen also we'll get frozen
pages frozen by metadata and
authenticated by people who we trust
don't know but maybe oh ok
that's the test hey one of our products
sighs the Google toolbar and we have
constant debates about what order to put
the buttons and how to group them you
can group them by what they do or how
often they're clicked on or what the
user wants them to do or whatnot and
this comes up and we always end up
making the generalization that users
don't spend the time to categorize
things they're better off having them
pre categorize because we can measure
how small of a percentage of people
actually bother to make categorizations
even though we're kind of nerds and we
like to tweak things so we all think
that everybody's gonna want to rearrange
the buttons and what if our toolbars has
that capability but it was just
interesting listening to you talk about
about what the things should be
categorized based on function or how
often they're used who or what uh what
do you think is there what answer in
terms of like making people categorize
things or having them pre categorize by
an authority and to make things simple I
guess there's a intensely practical
question which should be addressed to
somebody who's intensely practical it
does seem to me that there's a sort of
1% rule at work in a lot of
categorization including perhaps tagging
although there was a Pew study that gave
incredibly high figures from percentage
of people who are tagging it seems quite
plausible to me that 1% of a population
that does the tagging and categorizing
is sufficient to add enough metadata
that everybody benefits wildly from it
so it may be that 1% or fewer actually
bothered to rearrange the buttons on the
toolbar but if those button if those the
toolbars they created were publicly
available as a second you have to do
something for a default of course but it
is a second possibility a third
possibility but some people might a
small percentage people might find that
really useful a larger percentage of the
number who actually does redesign the
the toolbar thank you for coming here I
noticed in the book you mentioned two
writers one bore Hayes who I also I love
you can't
you can't you can't write a book about
taxonomy although we all say it's about
taxonomy but you can't write a book
about taxonomy without using the Bortas
looks like flies from a distance which
is a line that just floors me every time
I reason and you know any mention is I
think is it Michael Gorman Jesus yeah so
for the president of the American
Library Association for a brief time oh
yeah okay good so anyways I mean
basically sort of my question there is
Bohr Hayes wrote about all these issues
over half century ago and yet we're
still having these Wars how what sort of
reconciliation or where do things go
where the people who like little buckets
can get along with the people who don't
well so when Boris was writing it was
science fiction imagine if you will an
infinite library imagine if you will
that you now we have very intensely
practical reasons why we want to be able
to get the information that we want we
have social reason and this is the
imponderable I think this is not simply
a task for librarians who want to divide
up knowledge because the infant Internet
is not even primarily from my point of
view about information is about social
connection and so we have people who for
deeply social reasons want to want to
divide up the world in a way that makes
sense to them and connect with people
who do the same so the percentage of
people who are actually going to think
about buckets and how how can I label my
buckets and how can i arrange is very
very small the percentage of people who
want to be able to find all the email at
a Gmail that talks about that's very
large that's all of us the percentage of
people who want to be able to find the
photo of aunt Aunt Sarah when she was on
the beach and they can't because they
have 10,000 photos on a desktop that
will be all of us within just a couple
of years they're not thinking about this
as taxonomy well why should they they're
thinking about how they're how things
cluster in a meaningful way in their
lives and the the tools that we give
them that enable them to find the
meaningful clusters are the two
that have and will succeed the ones that
let them do the task of metadata oh my
god no we have lots of history that says
that lets us know that people do not
like dealing with it with explicit
metadata we need no further evidence of
that but I'll give you some mic
Microsoft Word at least ten years ago
when I checked the they have a metadata
sheet write them you can for every
document you can fill in the form and
it's very very useful for finding the
documents again it's a low single-digit
percentage of people who do that it just
feels like red tape lots more people are
willing to tag stuff so presenting to
people working on buckets tiny
percentage of people who want to
organize into clusters all of us I think
okay I'm not sure you're satisfied but I
think that wraps it up very much for
coming
