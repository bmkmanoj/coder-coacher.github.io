tech talk about source map org since
this is an environmental talk you're all
better people for being here my name is
Ben lindell and I'm an engineer in ads I
invited source have to give this talk
because I thought that their values
align well with Google's their
environmental open source crowd sourced
and they believe that information should
be free the presenter is Connie Kwan the
lead for short Maps marketing team we
also have hopefully via Skype the tech
lead and one of the founders of source
map Matt Hockenberry I wanted to warn
you that this talk will be posted to
YouTube so please keep your comments and
questions safe for the Internet ladies
and gentlemen please welcome Connie Kwan
hi i'm here to talk to you about an open
source project that i've been
collaborating on and that hopefully you
find interesting then want to
collaborate on as well for some context
i'd like to tell you why this project
fascinates me I'm Canadian I came from
Canada where there's lots of trees and I
love trees people think I'm a tree
hugger sometimes and even though I
studied Computer Engineering I always
thought that I'd do something in the
green arena and what green really meant
to me was abstract until I started
studying my MBA in sustainable
management I learned that green isn't
really the right word to describe it
sustainability is and that sustainable
living defines our ability to thrive on
earth generation after generation
indefinitely and I also learned that
sustainability isn't just about the
environment is also about social and
cultural sustainability and transparency
it's the center of it all because we
cannot improve what we don't know and we
cannot improve what we don't have
accountability for and transparency
provides both the knowing and the
accountability so I was searching for a
project that allowed me to apply these
sustainability knowledge that i have and
i came across source map dork three
months ago it was funded by an MIT Media
Lab and based in Boston
and I was very impressed with the
mission of the project which is to
provide transparency to the story behind
where how products are made and also I
was impressed with the visualization and
how source map is making the story of
products very compelling and I thought
here's a tool that really starts the
conversation about where things come
from and a project that can really
liberate information about supply chains
and if anyone believes in liberating
information it's google so I'm here to
talk to you because I feel that we have
a lot in common supply chains we live in
a world of linear supply chains where
things are harvested out of the ground
they're made into products we use the
products and then we throw it out and a
lot of information about how products
are made are lost because the only
information that we get as consumers is
the price tag of products and price tag
doesn't nearly tell you enough about the
conditions under which the products are
made the environmental devastation that
can occur when you mind the products etc
so we need to have a better system for
presenting that in the ideal world the
price tag would represent everything
going into the product but that is not
the case today and we thought that a lot
of this information about products exist
in the minds of many and if only we
could harvest this collective knowledge
we would know a lot more about the
stories of products so we decided to
build a platform for crowdsourcing this
information and having this information
that available publicly would be a good
start so source map org was born and
here you see a visualization of a laptop
computer and where all the parts that
contribute to a laptop comes from
including lines to where they are
manufactured this map is generated using
google geolocation technology
rendered using tiling and we have a
carbon calculator on the right here
which adds up for every product that is
in the laptop the embodied carbon as
well as the distance travel and the
carbon that is associated with that
distance what's amazing about this map
is the message and the impact that it
has when someone finally visualizes and
sees how a laptop is created anyone can
create a map like this by logging in to
source map and creating profile and they
can start sharing stories about the
products that they make or encounter on
the top right you can see three
additional features that allow people
the social network using this tool you
can click on delivered to find out the
last leg say for mountain view if I want
this laptop delivered here it would add
that last leg of carbon on to the
calculator you can favorite the map and
share with your friends and you can also
share through QR codes etc now talk more
about that later another thing that's
amazing about this map is there are 49
basic materials in a laptop and it turns
out 34 countries are involved in
creation of this laptop and if you think
about that that's 34 different cultures
about 20 different languages hundreds of
communities thousands of people and
species that live in the areas where the
materials are harvested and that starts
putting in the context the impact of
purchasing and using a laptop amongst
other things that you could also map on
source map so you can share the story
using a map you can also share the story
using rich media for every product or
material that you add to the map what
you can do is add a picture or a video
here is a video of 10 and it and the
mining process of 10 and Indonesia so
you can do that and share the story in a
more intimate way I'd like to talk about
how to build a map we have these
catalogs within source map where the
data is
harvested from publicly available
databases and that the carbon
information of each of these materials
are imported into the source map
database and you can see here the view
of the carbon the carbon catalog for
parts we also have a car catalog for
transportation so by using these items
as building blocks you can generate a
map very easily if you have a custom
material that you would like to add to
the catalog you can also do that and
make your own building block now I'd
like to share with you some examples of
how users are using source map in their
everyday lives here is an example of a
butcher in the UK who has mapped his
products his meat actually and on the
left is his particular supply chain on
the right is one of his customers using
the butcher's map to map the last leg of
the journey of that meat getting to him
so by having a map available the butcher
starts having a dialogue with his
customers about their particular impact
when they buy the meat you can also
interact with customers in the store we
use the Google charts app to create the
QR codes so that for each of these maps
so that you can put that sticker on your
products and interact with the customers
at the store directly here's an example
of a hotel that is using source map to
take action they have mapped where all
their guests are coming from around the
world created a source map and shared
the story and then they bought carbon
credits for all of their guests
businesses are also finding source map
quite useful they are using it to
visualize and improve their supply chain
efficiency in this example a brewery in
the UK has been using a bottling plant
which is located near the center of UK
there and shipping all the materials
there to be bottled when they mapped out
supply chain to decided hey why don't we
move and why don't we actually open up
our own bawling plant closer to home and
that would actually save us a lot of
money as well as carbon footprint and
impact so they have made a plan now to
start start a boeing plant further north
in the UK and they saw as a business
opportunity to expand their business so
not only are individuals finding this
tool informative businesses are also
jumping in to use it as a way of
starting the dialogue so what does the
future bring well we'd like to do a lot
more than just measuring carbon we
believe carbon is a good start because
it's a very popular metric for impact
but there's also other impacts like
water forest social but social impacts
and health impacts of communities and
you know everything under the sky so
we'd like to start measuring some of
those things and understand what metrics
could be used to measure those things
we'd like to develop more apps so that
it's more accessible in the supermarket
to everyday people and we'd also like to
start working on validating the
crowd-sourced data obviously we're
getting a lot of people participating
and we need to make sure that the data
is robust so we are working on research
on how can we make crowd-sourced data
reliable and I'd like to introduce Matt
hockenberry who hopefully is still on
line with us here Matt are you still
with us yes I'm here Oh excellent
alright so Matt is joining us from
Boston he is one of the founders of
source map org along with Leo banana and
he is a mastermind behind development of
much of this tool so he would like to
make an introduction about the
architecture of source map and then
start a discussion with you about any
recommendations that you might have for
us Matt take it away thanks Connie
so yeah I just want to give you a little
bit of a background on some of the
technical development of source map and
sort of what we've been up to so this
started and continues to be an academic
research project and that influences a
lot of decisions we've made so far
development but we're also strongly
motivated in making this you know a
successful open source project and
trying to build from the foundation that
we've created to sort of get buy-in from
people who are interested in supply
chains and this kind of problem so the
basic technical story is that this is
started as a PHP 5 app it's derived from
quoting nighter but we use more we're
more heavily geared now towards more
modern HP features so no longer page
before compatible or anything like that
but the basic idea is to create sort of
a modular structure for sharing supply
chain information source map objects
what we think of as source maps and what
Connie shows you a source maps are sort
of the basic building block of the
system these are supply chains but they
can be nested to create sort of more
complex supply chains we have carbon
catalogs that have very basic
information that we can't peer into that
deeply but our primary goal is to sort
of construct everything as a sort of
annotated referenced source map object
this approach that we've been trying to
go with has been targeted mostly towards
students because we're an academic
research project and we've been trying
to sort of increase our sophistication a
little bit to get some buy-in from
outside developers and most of this is
written in a fairly modular way a lot of
the heavy heavy lifting is done locally
with JavaScript classes we use jQuery
but not too much else we have a few
different areas that we've sort of gone
to some pains to make a little more
expandable into the future so right now
you interact with source map with an
editor we think it's a pretty good
editor for creating supply chains or
describing supply chains
more correctly in the system but you
know we're open to the possibility that
there are other editors tailored for
more specific kinds of products or kinds
of purposes so we tried to create a
modular structure so that different
editors could be built to interact with
the system in a fairly generic way the
same is true of visualizations the map
has been really special for us because
you know you think about supply chains
and it seems really intuitive to me that
maps are involved but that's really not
the way you know a lot of people in
supply chain dialogues communicate their
supply chains so the supply chain
visualizes a map has been hugely
transformative for these people to see
at the same time there are other useful
visualizations we try to create a
modular structure so we can add things
like charting get a little bit more
heavily involved in sort of diagnostic
analysis of particular supply chain to
see what the weak links might be with
regard to certain kinds of
sustainability the same is true for the
calculators that we have right now we're
pretty geared towards carbon because we
think it's important but it's certainly
reasonable to imagine there are lots of
different kinds of calculations things
like costs or customs or even sort of
social measures of how different
countries might interact with the supply
chain you can evaluate those in some
sort of quantitative way but on the back
end we basically just want to get all of
this data and make it as open as
possible so right now we're trying to
keep track of a lot of data get a lot of
data about supply chains and where
things come from when I had rich
descriptions all the values from
calculations that people produce through
the website or enter in when they're
creating supply chains we also are very
interested in keeping references about
the data because a lot of particularly
with carbon the data sort of a black box
and you don't have a lot of insight into
why a particular value is particular
value so an important part of our data
management is trying to keep track of
how a particular carbon value sort of
gets stated as the carbon value
there's a lot of geo work that we're
doing or no trying to do with regards to
source map we use postgres on our back
end so we can use post GIS to do some
cool routing things things like you know
sort of automatically routing from point
to point what a trip looks like four
things and of course that usually
involves unless you're getting you know
next day delivery some sort of
international shipping over you know a
boat transport to warehouse to a truck
and once we get all of this data our
goal is to give it away as quickly as
possible so that everyone can know this
information we right now have a lot of
sort of data export options we do have
an API and you know sort of favor Jason
all of our data is passed back through
the app as Jason and we also have KML
exports and Adam fees but I mean we do
have raw data export and if you just
want to take the data or get you know
open G is access to the data and use it
to say something meaningful about this
information that's part of our mission
and that's exactly what we want people
to do so I think Kony has a link if
you're particularly interested in what
we're up to what we have planned you can
check out our active development but
mostly what we want to do is just engage
in a dialogue about what we could do
together or work that you guys have that
relates or what you think we should do
because one of our mottos is that we're
totally open for any kind of advice and
we would love to take it thanks
I don't have a lot of feedback on what's
going on you the crowd is raging they
are jumping on their seats for you man
through that's true so we'd like to take
any questions and make it a two-way
conversation if you have any
recommendations for us or projects you
think would be interesting please let us
know first question evan parker here I
work on google maps I saw a picture of
an Android device you have QR codes i'm
sure you guys thinking about like an
android app i'm curious if you've
developed one yet or a few have plans to
develop one to like you know read the QR
code and show you a map or maybe it's
just a link so it links back to a
website the question was whether a
android app has been created for source
map yeah so the answer is sort of you
know we did write an android app over
the summer to sort of pilot out the idea
of interacting sort of constructing
source maps as you go shopping or
getting information on products you know
at point of sale i mean we haven't gone
too much farther with that just because
you know in-house our development is not
so geared towards mobile devices but we
think that's the important part of the
picture one suggestion there is to focus
on mobile web app that can be accessible
you know from iphone or android or
blackberry and if you don't need to have
a lot of rich graphics I think that
would work pretty well and then the QR
code it could just be a link to your
site to them and you know you detect the
mobile web browser can he hear me what
I'm talking or no no Matt can you hear
him no not really okay so I have to
repeat the question which I do for the
recording anyway so that's fine okay
yeah so mobile website might be a better
Avenue and development instead of a
specific
droid app Evans recommending that a
mobile web app is more versatile than
creating a specific app for the android
ya know I mean I absolutely agree and
you know at one point we had a phonegap
you know version of the site running I
mean the only nice thing is if we had
access to some you know sort of rich
features that you know some of the web
frameworks they target cross-platform
devices are a little shaky on you know
across cross-platform devices things
like taking pictures of the products as
you get them you know so we can again
verify and annotate that information
about say the source or the bottling
plant for bottles water etc etc I mean
is sort of really nice feature you know
something that actually adds to source
map by using the mobile device but just
for access to the data I think that's
completely right and hopefully you know
the sort of web app intermediary clients
have gone better I haven't looked since
the summer but I mean that's my
preferred approach since i'm going to
web developer and not a not a mobile
developer who's developing for the web
of sorry the mobile side right now matt
and are we looking for help with that we
are absolutely looking for help with
that Connie I mean you know we are at
the mercy of MIT students here so they
could begin and you know they get
excited and they develop an application
and then sometimes they leave and that
was the case with the the actual android
client that was written specifically for
Angela I mean we still have it we're
still interested in you know seeing if
people are interested in developing just
that client I do think the web
development angle is something that we
can do sort of ourselves without
lying on you know students or outside
developers well the beauty is about open
source is that if you don't like it you
can come and fix it so we do welcome
people to come help fix things for us
and there are lots of you know great
applications that already exist things
like shopsavvy that we could imagine you
know hopefully picking our data or you
know similar kinds of data toss to share
that information at point of sale when
consumers are looking around at the
products hi Connie um I have a question
about resourcing consumption so
different sorts of transport consumed
cost different mounts of money and
consumed different amounts of resources
so typically bulk sea transport is
relatively cheap um you know kilogram
per mile for example kilogram per
formateur do you have access to that
sort of data and are you possibly going
to expose it so I can figure out what
the the transportation resource
consumption is in my particular item
yeah we actually have two different
catalogs that the building block I
notice you came and after i mentioned
that part so let me repeat that part how
the maps are built is based on
catalogues of parts as well as transport
so we have a catalog full of values that
we've important from public databases on
the carbon footprint of each products
the embodied carbon as well as each
transport so you can ship via a
freighter and that would be lower per
unit or per weight if you ship via an
airplane obviously a lot worse so you
use those building blocks to make your
map yeah and if I can just add Connie I
mean some of this you know like Connie
said some of this information is
publicly available but there's a lot of
secret information here or proprietary
data that you know essentially our
competitors like to keep this data sort
of in-house and not make their numbers
very transparent or publicly accessible
which makes sense
no in a company maybe but we sort of
begged borrowed and stolen to get you
know a lot of the data that we have and
we're really committed to you know
trying to get as much data as possible
that people will send us we've had
people literally email us for you know
professors or academics carbon values
and the referencing information for how
they have arrived at the carbon value so
that we could share it hi I'm
fascinating project but I couldn't help
noticing in your initial example that
you are showing us a a typical laptop
computer now if I'm you know really
interested in let us say minimizing well
the footprint of my purchases what I
really want to know is what's the
footprint of this particular laptop
computer because it very much depends on
how do things designed and built where
it gets its materials from and so forth
so first of all I'm concerned that it's
going to give me sort of other generic
answers are not going to want to my
specific question and if you do get to
the point where you may be able to
answer specific questions you're then
getting into all kinds of areas about
you know frankly information as Matt was
saying spamming and that kind of thing
you know if something I just took off
and people started using it to make
purchasing decisions how are you going
to protect the purity of your data
mm-hmm excellent question so the
question was the laptop example that we
showed is of a typical laptop so how do
we get more detailed data about specific
laptops which is more interesting and
also how do we maintain the integrity of
the data that is a million-dollar
question we are trying to figure that
out as we go as well we are publishing
typical laptop values because we don't
have it's fair it's probabilistically
impossible to find every single item and
where they all come from a professor at
Waterloo I was talking to he's an LCA
expert a life cycle analysis expert and
he wrote a paper about finding where one
element
laptop comes from and he could not nail
it down he was working with a grad
student for half a year and he could not
nail it down so we know that it's
virtually impossible to do but the first
step we would like to take is start
sharing this information than trying to
get more and dig deeper and obviously
he's two people trying to solve the
problem we're proposing platform where
more than two you know 10 20 people can
start collaborating on one map and try
and make it better so we don't propose
to say that even for the typical a plot
example that I'm giving is accurate but
we're getting close to the reality and
then ideally we would like to move to an
apple laptop computer what does that
look like a dell laptop computer what
does that look like and then start
comparing you know who's doing better
who can learn from each who can learn
from the other and try and improve where
they mine or copper where they get their
tin it provides a place to have a
conversation about it so you're right we
don't know yet what a typical I thought
would look like this is what we think it
might look like and we would like
definitely like to get to more rigor in
the data and more we're looking for
people to help us validate LCA expert
LCA professors to help us do some of
that auditing of the data as we get it
so that we can have more robust data and
then on the website there's a lot of
sites now that are trying to crowd
source information like Yelp for example
they're trying to make it crowdsource
and also validated data so we're looking
at solutions there too and you know
maybe you guys come across something
like that and have ideas about how to
implement some kind of crowd sourcing
and Trust building app or interaction
tool and we'd like we love to hear about
those suggestions as well another
question unrelated but have you
considered the time dimension as well as
location something I was thinking about
one of the things that often gets
transported long distances as foodstuffs
and you know the carbon footprint of a
kilo of fresh beans very much depends on
whether they were you know harvested
next door or flown in from the other
side of the world which meant on the
season so I don't know if there's any
point in having a you know a time-based
view of this if you're looking for beans
in January than they're probably going
to high carbon footprint because they
couldn't be local technical where you
are right the question was whether we
consider the time based view because
especially for fresh foods I'm having it
transported in from farther away may
sometimes be less footprint than a local
food source so I'd like to answer it
there I think there are two questions
there one is the time aspect one is
foods and you know distance and carbon
and how that all equate souza so let me
answer the carbon question yes it is
definitely true that a lot of times
things transport it from farther away
actually has less impact then things are
grown right in your neighbourhood and
for those measurements I think the tool
as it is has a good approximation of the
information that we need to make that
decision because it does calculate the
journey as well as the embodied carbon
so the energy in growing that food which
is the water necessary and the transport
that water fertilizers everything that
you need to grow the bean and then
shipping that being on a freighter or an
airplane so that is all calculated and
your option two is to buy it in your
farmers market which you can also map
that piece and say I grow the beam in
California so it's actually you know
more or less carbon and then the last
journey is actually really short so it
does take into account that side but it
is interesting to ask about time because
we have had conversations about well the
tin is mined from this place today but
to be honest next year we don't know
where it's coming from we could come
from a totally different place so the
maps and when they're created start
mattering and that is something we would
need to start working into the
technology
make that mappable yeah just to just to
add that yeah time has been something
we've that Connie said talked about an
awful lot you know where we're
developing now sort of better mechanisms
for integrating this as a visualization
tool for real business supply chains you
know still mostly targeted small
business so that as a small business
develops and continues its supply chain
they can feed that data sort of more
directly into source map as they go and
so the time issue particularly when we
have sort of real supply chain
development being shown on the site
becomes much more important so you just
answered at least one of the questions
that I had I was going to ask about
comparing comparing foodstuffs going
into supermarket and saying well i can
buy this apple from washington state or
i can buy this apple from chile what
kind of penalty do i pay for the one
that comes from chile so that kind of
feature because i can imagine that for a
laptop it's very difficult to get that
data but for a foodstuff it's actually
pretty straightforward to get it would
be easy to make a comparison and very
useful for consumer to have that
comparison especially on a mobile device
they can quickly make a decision but
you've kind of answered that issue so I
get asked another question or make
another suggestion which is that you're
looking at where things come from and
that's kind of the name of your project
but I'm in making the decisions for
buying some of these things part of the
decision at least is is where it goes to
once you've bought it and and the
footprint of the objects in particular
something like a laptop and and how it's
destroyed and where it goes and that's
also something which would be kind of
interesting as a reverse of what you're
doing to say well how how much carbon is
going to go in in disposing of this
thing that I'm buying where is that
going to and that would be kind of
interesting data as a reverse of what
you're doing thank you those are the
comment and a question the comment was
it be useful to have the comparison when
you're at a supermarket for apples say
and
per the origin the one who had pulled to
the next and see whether what might
impact is for buying one Apple versus
the other the question was about the end
of life of a product we're mapping where
it comes from to a consumption point but
then beyond consumption pointers the
trashing of the product where does that
go Matt would you like to comment on
whether any maps have been created on
the end of life side of products yeah no
I mean that so yes absolutely on you no
comparison and yes absolutely on end of
life so you know we do have end-of-life
information you know what you can do
with certain things in terms of what
people call recycling you know has
different carbon attached to the process
and you know sort of different things
attached to each individual process
depending on the kind of material it is
and we do have data on that what we have
lost it at some point early early in
development like a year and a half ago
we had end of life on site and it is
something that has not made it back on
the site you know in one retooling
situation and there are a couple sort of
technical reasons for that and also some
data reasons for that but end of life is
important we have information about it
and we're committed to it the the only
reason why it hasn't been as pressing is
that there's a lot more information
about end of life and maybe not in the
nicest possible way but there's a lot
less you know opaqueness about what you
can do it with materials and what that
really involves yeah I'd be curious to
explore further on how we can visualize
that obviously people care a lot more
about things getting to them at this
point in time but it is very important
to me as well the whole cycle of
products because the supplied
shouldn't really be linear should be
circular things go in a circle and you
know if if this is a start this is
starting point for having that dialogue
but I think we can extend this tool to
to build on the circular aspect of
products and of life so you know I'd
love to have that conversation with you
if you have any ideas that's my contact
info right up there so feel free to send
me an email or come talk to me and we
can start that dialogue and figure out
how we can do that mapping so I want to
take a little step back from talking
about cost and carbon footprint and
stuff like that a lot of times when I'm
buying a product I I don't even know
like what what is in the product and I
could see that like wits with
uncertainty sometimes you can hear about
stories of my talks may be toxic things
coming out of China it's like the atom
that of a business could have an
incentive maybe two to actually say what
exactly is in their product and whether
specific supply chain is if it can prove
you know that the product is good that
the product is you know not toxic or
things like that if it's some kind of
product where there might be you know
uncertainty about about what's actually
in it right to distinguish your product
from say another product that that might
be cheaper and kind of marketed based on
you know on not actually making known
what's in the product so do you think
there could be some sort of opportunity
of like you know some some financial
opportunity some of some business
incentives around you know exposing
what's in the product to demonstrate the
quality of a product the question was
well there's a preamble about it first
beyond carbon there's also the toxicity
you know people talk about toys in China
and other issues about products so the
question was whether we've thought about
linking quality of products to this
whole idea of mapping supply chains to
demonstrate higher quality products
compared to inferior products and
whether that is
financial incentive for companies to
participate that is an excellent idea
and thank you for bringing that up one
of my personal goals on joining the
project is I find this idea really
amazing the idea of starting a
conversation I think there is definite
interest in the business world an
opportunity for making a profit with
this tool and with this idea obviously
we believe the idea should be free or
the information should be free so we'd
like to maintain an open source aspect
on source map but I think you're right
the quality of products is always a
question on consumers mind and then as
well as the eco friendliness now so
there is definitely opportunity there to
to create value for for-profit
businesses as well and for example the
lower levels of a supply chain they
might not normally get too much
publicity they might not be exposed
directly to the consumer but through
your something like this a lower level
um business you know can can get
publicity for for like say proving you
know like you can show show videos of
how it's made and you know prove that
quality product yeah yeah that's
definitely true one of the challenges
I've experienced in talking to business
about this is they are still reluctant
to make the information free they feel
like a lot of the supply chain
information is proprietary it's part of
their secret sauce and so having it
online is scary for them and sharing it
scary for them and for supply chain
which is typically the operation side of
the business is is far apart from the
marketing side of the business I mean
between operations they're still
development and then they talk to
marketing so marketing people might be
more interested in publishing the story
but operations people definitely see it
more as a threat so I think getting
through that cultural mindset and if
that's not true i mean that's a
generalization that's not true of every
person in operations I've certainly talk
to people who are more progressive about
sharing their story but it is a cultural
mindset that
we continue to bump up against that we
need to start moving towards coney if i
can just say about things like toxicity
or sort of other you know environmental
things things like you know damage to
animals or plants or sort of social
costs we have some information about
things like this the biggest obstacle
for us is sort of finding a way to make
this kind of information in some cases
quantifiable and in some cases a little
bit more transparent there are lots of
measures out there other than you know
co2 equivalency that sort of measure
impact or something like that where it
does take these factors into account
that it takes them into account in a way
that you don't really know you know how
much of a contributor the social cost
was or how much the contributor risks
about you know toxicity or hazardous
chemicals being involved in
manufacturing process art so our biggest
goal in moving ahead with you know sort
of measures like that is finding a way
to make it sort of transparent you know
verifiable and quantifiable
where they track they basically done the
life cycles
process for several of their products so
it might be interesting for you guys to
contact them
and whether it's you know they've been
selling more products because we can
know that
that was a comment that Patagonia has a
car footprint chronicles where they
publish the footprint of their products
so that might be a good source for
information to collaborate on and put up
on source map Thank You Evan here again
a couple things that came to mind one is
i'm sure you guys well you I wonder if
you are aware of any efforts to get
government involved in enforcing in say
providing standards and requiring the
companies put this information on their
products using some sort of standards of
the development of the standard and
whether government's might someday be
able to enforce that products use these
standards I think that'd be really cool
mm-hmm hard that would be really cool
we're looking for people to help us talk
to more people about source map we are
working I'm working on this project on
the marketing side we have Matt and Leo
obviously in Boston and then we have MIT
students at our disposal at times but we
are trying to get more people involved
and obviously more ideas more heads on
the problem it's a lot better so yes we
would like to talk to governments and
start a standard there are a lot of
standardization bodies out there fair
trade organic you know I can fill a page
full of logos with with all the
different logos you can put on things
these days and we're starting to talk to
some of these organizations be cord for
example is kind of like s core but they
look at eco-consciousness a little bit
more so they have a way of auditing
companies that become be corpse so I'm
talking to them about how they can use
our tool to do the auditing or two to
improve the transparency but yeah
there's there's a lot of organizations
out there kind of looking at the problem
in different light so we'd like to
collaborate with them certainly and to
expand on that further
I could imagine you could define a
standard in like XML for representing
this data and then companies could put
it on their website and it could be
crawled and access in a generic way kind
of like you know web search like we
Google does with web search but sort of
specific to this you know source map
data yeah I'm sorry I lost kiss what's
the question well it's just just a
suggestion um basically if you if you
create a standard way of representing
this data using say XML uh-huh then
companies could put up the data for
their products like you could imagine
Apple could have a page you know see
where you know get the data for this
product and it's an XML file and then if
there's a standard than that encourages
people to use that standard to represent
the information kind of like we use KML
to represent geo-information that was a
standard that was developed by the
keyhole company that google acquired
that became Google Earth now it's
actually it's a accepted standard in a
common way of representing Geographic
data so i can imagine you guys
developing a standard for representing
the data on where things come from and
getting momentum behind that that's
really cool um so the comment matt is
that we could create a standard much
like XML where we standardize the way
you represent the story behind products
and then we can publish that standard so
that companies can participate on their
own time and create Maps or stories
using the standard yeah absolutely that
sounds like a very awesome goal it would
be great to be you know contribute in
some way to a process like that where we
do get a standard for exposing you know
the the real story behind you know all
the products and foods and you know
things we have no if no one else has
other questions I'm just going to keep
coming every guy I it occurs to me that
it would be great to have some pilot
companies that represent their
information or work with you guys you
might already have companies that you're
working with to try to
is there information like Patagonia was
mentioned as it as a really
forward-looking company that is already
actively doing things like this and
we're Googlers we don't sell many
products but we just started selling one
the nexus one and I think it'd be really
cool if we like you know on the nexus
one website you can find out all the
source map information for where the
parts of the phone come from would you
like to get me in touch with a person
who would like to draw the nexus one map
I'll see if I can do that that sounds
great the suggestion was to work with a
pilot company like maybe Patagonia to
map all their products online and yes I
am actively searching for that right now
as we speak I was curious like you have
the example up here of tin from it
indonesia if you were to also look
across all the places you could get tin
from you know if you look at all the
places you could get a raw ingredient
from which ones actually are the better
places to get it from where the worst
places and how what percentage of that
material is coming from different sites
so that might also kind of once you have
more data in your database might be
something that can be cross-referenced
that way to get a better idea of which
areas are better to get that resource
from environmentally yeah the comment
was once we get more data and where 10
is coming from in all the various places
maybe only five or six but we don't know
then it would be interesting to know
which of those six or seven which of
those are better places of sources from
yeah as you know when you get a lot of
information there's a lot of cool stuff
you can do with it so we are trying to
get more information yes for each of
these materials there are usually only
five or six mines in the world that will
do it and if for every material there
are six mines there's seven sources you
can get it you can also get it from
recycling and then there's probably
another one where you don't know about
so probabilistically you can figure out
the volume of those minds and
so and so calculate probabilistically
for each laptop you know how much of
that material is coming from that mine
so yeah there is a mathematical way
actually to approach the data and
harvest the data and create maps
completely mathematically and say Oprah
probabilistically the Apple iPhone or
the you know the next is one is created
from these minds yeah I mean that's
really good point Connie I mean if if
you have a laptop it has ten in it you
know probabilistically the chances that
that tin is from Indonesia is you know
ninety-five percent I mean it's ten in
particular we like to talk about because
we happen to know a lot about ten and
exactly where it comes from exactly the
islands where tina's mind we're still
sort of in and we have a lot of data now
but the process for acquiring new data
is still very hard so for example
finding things like tin mines sometimes
literally we're sitting there with
Google Earth you know zoomed in and
scrolling around places where we think
Tim might be mind looking for what looks
like a mine because you know it's really
hard to get that information any other
way yeah sometimes we are coming across
conflict materials where there's mafia
involved and how to source that material
in which case the Mafia isn't so
interested in sharing their story so
there's definite you know difficulties
we're coming up against but by letting
people share their story we we start
getting more and more information
well it looks like the questions are all
done here so I like to wrap up this talk
by saying thank you for coming and we
hope that you will join us in our quest
to liberate information about supply
chains our contact information is up
there as well as our development code
access URL so please feel free to check
it out email us give us ideas if you're
interested in collaborating if you know
anyone else who is please get in touch
with us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
