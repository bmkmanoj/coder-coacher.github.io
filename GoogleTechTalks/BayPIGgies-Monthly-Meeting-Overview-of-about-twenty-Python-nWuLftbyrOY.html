for inviting me to talk and also
especially thank us for giving up his
original concurrency talk that I didn't
know was scheduled but he said oh he
should go talk on this so today we're
going to talk about buzz words and
Python and buzz word compliance in
Python because there's so many buzzards
you have to know and I'm only going to
talk about some of them and what I'm
hoping to do is to go through and i'm
going to give you about three slides per
buzzword this is going to be enough that
you're going to understand what this
little topic is about and it's going to
give you a little bit of breath through
all of python but it's not going to go
through far enough to answer all your
questions it's really about trying to
show you an exploration of what's in the
whole Python world here this means that
I've asked that you hold your questions
because otherwise we certainly will go
down an infinite number of questions and
I'd like to to give the talk and then
answer all of your questions and I'll
make myself available for as long as
necessary so that i can say i don't know
as many times as it takes so let's talk
about exploring python because it's fun
and it's large and there's really three
aspects we're going to be looking at
here one is the Python language itself
you know after you get past print hello
world there are a lot of features in
Python that it takes time to learn and
get used to and then there's also a
whole bunch of libraries that are kind
of like solid building blocks you know
you can pick them up you import them you
use them they mix and match together and
remember python is always about trying
to make you more productive as a
programmer so that when you've got
something unique that you want to do you
can put it up and just go and finally
there's these big honking spiky
frameworks these are also part of the
python universe and they're large i'm
going to pick on for the frameworks i'm
going to pick on web application
frameworks for the libraries and
building blocks i'm going to pick on
games and graphics i could have picked
any other group but this is to try to
give you a feeling
for how these are available and how they
all fit together so first let's talk
about learning python how to get that
snake in your head if you haven't
started learning python you should and
the very first thing you should get is
you should go out and get our grew its
little faq on it and this is going to be
a five or six page document that is the
summary of what all of the syntax is
what all of the major modules are and
it's a little it's kind of dense to sit
down and read but you'll find that you
keep it next to you while you're going
through and said okay I've just gone
through the python tutorial and I forgot
how do I declare a class oh you just do
it this way so you get that you'll at
the end of the talk will give you the
web address where tomorrow all of the
links will be up and available so that
you can get all of your notes and things
and i'll post it to the bay piggies
mailing list you should also go through
the python tutorial which is a good way
of reading and typing code and kind of
getting a feel for how it all works and
then you should move on to actually
trying a few things on your own I'm
recommending one piece here called the
Python challenge which is a website that
has little puzzles in Python and you can
write in one to ten lines of code that
if you just do the right thing you can
figure out the secret netiquette message
in the web page and get to the next
level and for the first dozen levels of
so it's pretty good but you really the
thing I want you to get them this is
that there's a cycle of learning in
Python but you're going to keep going
around in this weird circle you're going
to do a bunch of general reading or
watching a couple of videos I heartily
recommend the advanced Python
understanding Python video or code like
a Python nista there's a lot of good
things to just go and read make sure you
go do some code you'd be surprised how
many people get into this new language
and they just sit and they rely Brer
ease all day and they forget to actually
write something because that's where you
submit the knowledge you can explore all
these beautiful colored libraries
especially the standard libraries that
come with python python has this
batteries included idea
of most of the libraries that you're
going to need come with it and it makes
a huge document to sort of look through
but the more that you pick up the more
different types of problems you can just
solve so in a lot of ways python is
often about you have some concept of
something that you want to do and you
want to get there with as little effort
as possible leveraging the libraries and
tools of other people and you have to
start exploring the tools as well this
thing's like pie checker which is a
little lint problem a lint like program
that will save you some time there's
unit test frameworks built in there's
this quite a lot of tools that are
useful lots of editors and ide etc but
when we go into that I'm going to jump
into from sort of the easiest to the
hardest parts of Python one piece here
is list context how many people are
really configuring and happy with list
context this is sort of at the beginning
level here what you're sorry I keep
calling them list context read/write
list comprehensions these are just nice
ways it's just a really slick little
idiom this is the type of stuff that
makes Python so fun this stuff that you
used to have to code that was long it's
concise it's just a cool way of doing it
after a while you think every language
should have this after another six weeks
in a point release every language does
have this and you start saying this is
what you use it gets rid of things like
map filter and reduce so you just don't
have to use them much and yes obviate
means make obsolete so it it enables you
to make things that are short and
readable so that your eyes will stay on
the screen and can cover can you keep
more of the code in your head and here's
something that's true almost all the way
through Python you see a fancy language
feature and all its really doing is
unrolling your syntax into something
that's a bit longer but still very
simple in this case and I hope everybody
can see the code we've got one line up
here let me say some all of the elements
of this
where the elements are build- paid for
the various customers that match this
function call it on a regular editor
screen this will fit happily within a 72
character line if you had to code it
without list comprehensions you're
probably looking at five or six lines of
code then you probably want to put a
blank line before and after it to show
that you're doing something in one spot
and pretty soon you've got one of these
routines that sort of scrolls through 15
screen full of code to do something
fairly simple and at that point you
might as well go back in program in Java
let's now is that Java software we
designed it to be really really simple
for people who didn't know how to
program so this is one of those things
it's simple it looks Python can look
complicated at first because you see
this top line and you're not quite clear
how it unrolls out into something
simpler one of the other places that
often looks complicated in Python and
we're going to jump ahead to something a
little more complicated is when you
execute modules you hit that import
statement and very similarly you hit
that class statement and and your
namespace changes and and you it can be
kind of confusing especially at at first
but it's actually one of those spots
that once you get it it makes Python
simpler and simpler as you go imports
run code once you hit a class definition
it runs that code once the deaf the
keyword that makes a new function is
just another statement and what it does
is it compiles up some code and it
attaches that name and that code and
sticks it in your local namespace which
is just a dictionary that your namespace
may change inside a class it has its own
namespace inside a module that has its
own namespace inside a method it has its
own namespace
and almost all of these tricks in Python
come down to just going through and
manipulating those namespaces and
running those scripts from top to bottom
in this case I'm going to show you a
quick trick that people use for if
you've got to do a bunch of fancy setup
on a module that you that it becomes
useful to just make a helper function to
do it so here I've got a class C just
like a module it changes its name space
after it's all done and we're going to
come back to meta classes in a moment
first line there print hello from see
it's just going to execute this code
from top to bottom so on the console
it'll print out hello from see when it
sees this code it's just running it this
is actually really useful for trying to
figure out what's going on is to just
put a few print statements in your
modules in the midst of things and see
Quinn things run it's not inside a d e f
it's not being compiled it'll just be
executed so first it executes hello from
C then it sees a def make this function
it compiles that function up that takes
the name help make table throws it in
your local namespace and you've got a
function with that local namespace
notice that even though i'm in a class
it's not taking a class argument I now
call I said it's at a variable equal to
something using that well it's in my
name space I can call it see table
becomes in the class name space it's a
class attribute at this point and then I
just delete that table out and it's gone
forever I'm just playing with that
namespace all I'm doing is running from
the top to the bottom and playing to the
namespaces this will be a little hard in
Python because so many of the buzzwords
and things that you do in Python are
just playing with this particular fact
it's a very simple language under the
hood now we're going to jump ahead you
know normally people would sit down and
then cover this in great depth and then
they'd cover a little piece more in a
little piece of more we're sort of
jumping around a little bit these are
the decorators they came out in
in Python 24 25 and they're cute they're
nice syntax they use the @ sign they
wrap methods with a new functionality so
the place that you use these is for
logging security debugging places where
you want to have all of that original
functionality and then you want to do
something that's kind of really
different to it like for example you
might wrap a routine and say I want you
to trace every time that you come
through this and print a message on the
screen so I can track what's going on in
my program you might wrap it and say
look this is a an edit page routine and
it's all about how do i edit this page
and right up at the front I want to
decorate it and say I really want you to
check the security level and make sure
that the person has the right
permissions before I let them edit this
page and so what it's doing is it's the
decorator itself is another routine
that's going to be called that routine
will probably call the decorated routine
the easiest way to see this is is in the
actual usage that's got a very clean
syntax for use and it unrolls like
everything to simple code what actually
happens here is that when you decorate
something you know first i'm going to
show you this and then i'm going to tell
you what that bottom line does so first
we could talk about you know decorators
actually return functions that are
functions that take arguments that call
other functions ignore these syntax that
comes out of the box you go out and you
get the one from IBM the decorator class
and you import it and then you have
something that turns any function into a
decorator so this top function here does
a trace takes a function it takes a
bunch of arguments it takes some keyword
arguments which you want to print out a
little bit differently and it prints out
that it got called and then it will
actually call that function one of the
you'll notice here is that in Python
just like in the previous example the
name of that function is just another
name so I can pass it f as a function
named as a function and that's sort of
the attached to wear that function code
actually is and then I can call it later
so all I'm going to do is I'm going to
print something out and then I'm going
to call that function and since I'm
about to return anyway I just returned
that return value of whatever came out
of it so I can wrap any piece of code in
this and it'll call it the decorator in
there does a little bit of magic to make
sure that the function names don't get
messed up and things like that and then
down here is how i use it i put that at
sign trace and then i go off and i
define my buggy function someplace to go
do all of its normal stuff what's
happening behind the scenes is it's
unrolling this code this ad sign trace
buggy function after it if you finish
the Deaf you've compiled up that code
and assigned it to this name buggy
function what it says is well what I
really want you to do is say trace
parentheses buggy function with all of
its arguments and assign that to the
name buggy function and call that
instead every time so it says buggy
function equals trace of buggy function
the decorator class the decorator
decorator at the top wraps it all up for
you nicely you'll use this in places
where what you don't want to do is have
your mouth where you don't want your
module having to do two separate things
that don't make sense together editing
pages and checking security levels you
don't want it to have to go out and and
crowd things up with timing routines
when you just want to say that you know
I've got a little function that counts
up how much time I spend in this routine
and it's a poor man's profiler and so I
just say time it and I run it a few
times then I take it back out this is a
very clean syntax and it's one of the
cool things in Python that a lot of
people
learn about so these have been very cool
things in Python I'm really excited
about them and they're very slick and it
gets easier as time goes by this
decorator this @ sign decorator class
didn't exist yet it's not in the
standard library yet you just download
it and import it like everything else
and there's some dark sides to Java that
aren't so clean the first one is meta
classes you'll see these occasionally
this is kind of towards the end of where
people are skipping some sort of
skipping towards one end of what's going
on in Python and this will be a great
interview questions people will always
love to ask you about meta classes and
then they won't use them what they do is
they put a false front in front of your
classes when you declare a class you
might want to go in and play with those
class definition that the names of those
functions or who the parent classes
before anybody uses them places you
might want to do this include if you're
writing some program that's going to be
doing some mapping out to IDL or out to
an object relational database mapper or
something like that so this is a
buzzword this is kind of most people
won't use metal classes right now you're
probably expecting me to say oh yeah now
it's two at signs just before your class
definition because that would make so
much sense and just say to add signs
call this function huh this is the bad
side a Python they haven't figured that
out yet what they have instead is it's
implemented that classes themselves have
a type super class and you can have all
sorts of fun arguing about what your
terms mean and drawing funny graphs or
trying to decide what happens to things
that have multiple inheritance from two
different meta classes from two classes
that each have different metal glasses
and what happens there and the short
answer of it is because the syntax is so
horrid
and because what you're doing is
changing the functionality of Python
you're getting in the middle so that
when you say class something it's not
doing quite what you expect it's
actually calling something else what
happens is it adds complexity to the
entire project this is not an individual
program or decision to start using a
metaclass there should be a project or
even company level decision as to
whether you really need to do it so if
you're making something like you're
making plone and it's going to have this
thing or Django and it's going to want
to go through and map all of the
attributes into some database you may
have to do something like this but you
should approach it carefully and one of
the sort of takeaways is that there are
a bunch of shiny little hooks that
people sort of talk about they like to
talk about it and they never really find
good uses for it and they're shiny and
you think oh you know I'm a great
program I should go start playing with
these and they can be traps they can
morph the language outside of what
you're expecting all of a sudden if you
you're using meta classes especially if
you end up using more than one metal
glass in your application your debugger
might get confused your testing tools
might get confused things won't happen
quite the way you want but you know you
might need to look back at this some
time and decide that this is what you
want to do and there's some straight
there's some code for it and the way you
can tell that you're in a bad area of
Python is this is boilerplate code
almost anywhere you start seeing
boilerplate code you know that there be
dragons here because otherwise it would
be clean and you wouldn't have to so
this is a you declare some class that
inherits from the special class type and
it overrides one of its new functions so
that it can get ahold of of just before
the class is created it runs this class
that it runs the keyword class and runs
all the scripts inside of it and bundles
everything up that it got in there and
instead of just making a class object it
calls this routine
which then may go through the list of
attributes which are also the function
names and start doing something with
them they may need to wrap everyone in a
decorator it may need to you can do some
things like you can write an
aspect-oriented programming system in
this but you're changing the
functionality of Python and if you do
this it you really want to make sure you
need to or that you're just getting
something cool out of it and then some
other class down here well specify that
metal class is going to be used does
anybody recognize what the that the name
of the function means they're going to
change the syntax again for Python 3000
okay so another dark so now you know
look we just talked about some really
cool aspects list context it will make
your life faster and simpler from the
first day you start using them
decorators you'll find that there are
places that you use them and they keep
your coat a lot simpler to understand
because you say this edit it's a page
you don't have to say it checks security
levels and it at its a page it just
makes everything nice and simple this
stuff will probably make it more
complicated this is going to make it way
more complicated this is unicode this is
one of those things that is coming it
lets you draw a little airplane symbols
in the middle of somebody's name by
accident here's what we get unicode
represents every human language it
represents all of all of the french
characters with little accents and dots
it represents all of the asian languages
that may go up and down instead of left
to right or hebrew that goes right to
left with a completely different set it
represents oh what was the universal
Esperanto it represents things that are
used more than Esperanto like Klingon
and elvish two different types of elvish
you can write anything
it breaks every single rule about our
ski they're working on the Babylonian
cuneiform they haven't come out yet but
really it's getting pretty close you can
bug me after class i'm curious which
one's not in there so it breaks every
asking rule you'd think of you don't
know how many bites your characters are
when you read bites from a file the
bites don't tell you what characters
there are you just have to have adopted
some convention to move from bites two
characters you don't know how wide
things are going to be so you don't know
if your labels are going to write over
something else and if something's on the
screen you don't know if those
characters are the ones you think about
or something in some other dictionary
that are different and so you know one
and I'll get confused while everything
gets confused in this it's designed by a
committee an old-fashioned style
committee a please pay as $50,000 to
join and we're going to move what gets
done wind by how much your company paid
and your current tactical goals it's not
an open-source thing this tells you
Python has to deal with some of these
real-world constraints so when we take a
moment and cover some of the basic
vocabulary that comes with Unicode and
dealing with all the languages in the
world and all the typefaces in the world
and all the ways we write and we're not
going to do that it's a whole area you
can specialize in Unicode for a long
time and then decide something in
Unicode to specialize it most developers
just have to make some sort of armed
truce with Unicode you're going to find
that because you have to use Unicode
your programs will be buggier they will
not work as often it will be harder to
write an application that is clean and
slick and that's just one of the things
we have to deal with now and you just
have to make it your best piece and
learn and say you
TF 8 encoding and try to remember that
when you do a string in code it'll throw
you a unicode decode error and when you
do a string decode they'll throw you an
encode error and you'll just have to
deal with the fact that as you try to
use unicode it's not going to make your
internationalization particularly easier
to do but it's going to cause you more
bugs and it becomes the standard string
type coming soon to Python 3000 near you
Python 3000 is another one of those
buzzwords people have been throwing
around for quite some time it means the
next version of Python Python 30 you
know it's got the beautiful picture here
of the 3000 golden Buddha's and people
are going to contemplate this for a long
time and come out with something
radically different it was okay to break
all the code in the world and
fortunately that hasn't happened
everybody you know language about this
size everybody starts trumping out all
of the things that broke in the last
seven languages that they wish were in
there and people start making all these
proposals and fortunately most of them
are ignored so it's an incremental not a
revolutionary change to the language
we're going to be a few little syntax
changes you're going to have to learn to
type print with parentheses around it
because it's more consistent you're
going to have to need to read through
all of the old code of that thousand
line Python crafty program you have go
through it line by line to look for
things that the little pi 2 to 3
conversion tool is not going to catch
for you like for example chopping off
the last character of longs and things
like that it's already available Tuesday
there is another alpha release little
pieces are being implemented you do find
that Greedo exercises a large amount of
restraint and what's happening to python
here that said i'm going to show you one
of the features and i'm working off of
the pepper not off of tuesday's release
here the
the proposal as to what's changing so
one of the proposals was function
annotations that was going to let you go
through and and add little comments into
your your functionality so that you can
describe what every parameter does this
sounds like a nice idea so you can go
through and you can say map X and you
can put little the comments in here in
blue or the little string comments that
tell you what these each frame other
means and what the return type means
that's great like every new feature
that's coming in there's going to be
sort of a hard period because it turns
out you can also put in any other random
expression and some tools are going to
want to use this for type checking some
tools are going to want it to use it for
documentation some tools they don't know
what they want to do but they've always
wanted this in the language so when you
start using somebodys library you kind
of have to figure out what they did and
takes all the fun out of program to play
with this stuff but it's coming and
it'll work its way out in the version to
do that's the end of the sort of the
dark side so you have some really cool
things and they have some things that
are a little hairy Python 3000 Unicode
and meta classes are all a little hairy
even though they should be cleaner in
time right now they aren't but you go to
the libraries and you find there are so
many people working in Python that there
are libraries for every standard
endeavor that you want to play with so
that if you're a startup and you're
saying I want to go off and do this
thing except for that very special
aspect that you're bringing there's a
library that you can contribute to or
just use that will get you most of the
way there so you can spend all of your
time on that special thing that you're
doing now I'm not going to cover the
ones in the standard library I'm going
to cover things like the the pill the
Python imaging library
python imaging library reads and writes
image formats lots of them 250 of them
it seamlessly deals with JPEGs and P&amp;amp;G s
and windows bitmaps and all of these
different types of formats it it's clean
and it's slick in it lets you just sit
there on the command line and and play
with it until you figure out what it is
you want it to do with that image and
then sort of cut and paste it into your
program to use it for later now one of
the things is this is a very standard
thing that a lot of people need to use
it's a very solid library gets updated
once a year whether it needs it or not I
got on the anniversary they just sort of
say 1 dot 181 that one I did they tell
you long in advance tendo bug fixes in
it they just want to make sure you know
that it's still alive not Python has
this battery included model but not all
the batteries are included there are
things like pill which is a very rock
solid piece that you'll find that
everybody eventually learns about so
let's take another look at a rock solid
library oh sorry here's how you use the
pill I'll let let you just read the code
it lets you loads uploading images
resize them write them out as different
types of images in different formats
play with the RGB values the
transparency value is if the format
handles it all sorts of just about
everything you want put together gif
animations things like that and it just
works it works well enough that you're
usually not bothering to look in the
manual you know it's got a manual it's
got a one-page this is how you use the
library tutorial and you really look at
the manual so here's another rock solid
library anybody guess what it does it's
friendly it bites you this is PI game
it's really popular for a lot of people
if you're learning python and you wanted
to start by making games a fair lot a
fair number of people learn a new
programming language by coding up their
favorite games in it you probably start
with PI game it's an easy to d
game engine people teach you to teach
with it sometimes in high schools it
there's a lot of it's an aggressively
cross platform because the first thing
people do when they get linux running on
some system like I have a little gp2x
battery controlled gaming system that
runs linux they get Python on it then
they get PI game on it and then they
start you know playing around with games
on it so it's easy to use aggressively
cross-platform they do things like
contests where people show up and they
can say okay within a week in 48 hours
let's all build games and see who gets
the best game in 48 hours and when you
arrive will tell you the magic three
secret key words you're you have to have
hopping bunnies with flamethrowers you
know don't make me a game about hopping
bunnies with mine Thoris and people will
and thousands and thousands of people
work with this thing and it's done they
haven't released a new version of this
software in years as an old programmer
this is strange to me this is done it's
finished they they argue at once in a
while but maybe they should add
something and then they end up saying no
you know we'd rather not this is a nice
static library but it's not really
static because there's so many people
using a new ideas floating around and
ways to interface it and it comes up
with all sorts of games like these you
know you can make pretty games out of
them you can make all your splash
screens and you're you're moving things
in your game logic and and different
people in putting on different consoles
moving different types of sprites around
if you pick your graphics right it can
look kind of 3d it's not really but it
can look kind of like a 3d game and it's
it's it's a great way for people to play
with Python
pi game itself aggressively is not 3d
but there are ways to to poke with it
and federal document it saying you
really want it to be 3d we can do that
but if anything pygame actually tries to
keep you from doing it it's a good point
you can do it and a lot of people
actually poke do that with with ogre
back and forth although I'm not sure so
this is a this is a solid library now
let's look at one that's not solid if I
go in and say oh this is a great 2d game
engine Python 3d game engine hit Google
I'll get Soria Soria claims to be a nice
3d game engine almost and sad two maybe
three games written in it development
was slow so slow they forked it off to
another open source project called pi
soy and just for the extra buzz word it
uses pyrex all throughout in order to
try to speed things up and linked to
other libraries there's about four or
five ways of linking to C++ code pyrex
is one of them tends to take a little
bit more programming to keep up with
everybody else's releases and and you
know we could have a whole section on
how do you link to C++ code pyrex versus
pi plus plus vs. ctypes versus all the
other choices but it's slow it's the
development was slow the execution was
low if you just have this Python centric
virus by a saint everything's got to be
written mostly in Python it's not going
to work quite nearly as well as
something like over ochre is a large C++
engine it does senior enduring it does
it very well when you want to put
together something where you've got like
a skeleton moving across a plane and
their shadows and there's fog and
there's some lighting effects and and
there's 52 objects put together you go
off and you use / commercial programs
have been written an ogre
and chipton done reasonably well and
also a lot of people use ogre where
they're still deciding with it again you
funding for their 3d gaming system so
somebody made Python ogre first it was
just a set of bindings to ogre then they
started using pi plus plus which is
another way to convert to with C++
except that it's really fast in terms of
your programmer time so it gives you an
interface that you don't tweet much and
and that means when somebody revs some
other library it just works and it goes
off of ogre is really popular on the c
plus plus side there thousands and
thousands of users of ogre but in order
to make it work with Python they just
wrap it in python bindings and say now
you've got a nice language to write your
AAA code in and you've got a nice
language to do your game logic in and
you have all this beautiful scene
rendering and then they start doing a
mash up a whole bunch of other library
so this is what's in Python ogre it's
got rendering including some tree stuff
and it's about iOS and gooeys and sound
and often this one or two different
choices because in games people say oh
we need this little one for this tweak
or whatever and it's got physics and
networking and the important thing is
all of these things that are written in
blue are actually spin-offs where
they're wrapping things from the C++
world so even though python is not
nearly as large as the c++ world
especially in game development they can
surf off of all of the thought that
these people have done to making nice
interfaces making these pieces play
together at least in the c++ world so
that when you call them in Python and
they have to call each other they do the
right thing seamlessly so sometimes you
can make a really good set of mashups
and you can run across them as you're
looking for libraries that there's a
very popular library and another
language though and see if there's some
Python wrappings that do that do it
justice
those are libraries yes mm-hmm spun off
there's a bunch of choices and as the
slides slides and notes are going to go
up to tomorrow morning and that actually
has a link to some of these long
comprehensive list of what's available
in Python graphics and which ones go
with what I'm just trying to sort of
show look here's ocher it's pretty good
your Soria it's not so good here's some
solid things you will use the Python
imaging library if you need to do
anything with images there's just no
reason not to and you will use pygame if
you just want you to play around it and
to get things going now I could have
picked on all sorts of different sets of
libraries here I picked games because
for a lot of people who are learning
python and getting into Python that's a
good place to start but there's usually
a sort of a set of two or three good
libraries in any area and you go when
you find them now there's some tools
that will help you find them and i'll
park at the end about how to pick among
them eventually these libraries kind of
grow like here with Python ogre used to
just wrap over 3d now it's wrapping ogre
3d and mostly things that have tend to
split off and are parts of this over
development system but eventually you
make these frameworks and today I'm
going to pick on web application servers
as a set of frameworks I'm going to be
view four or five web application
servers the most popular ones and kind
of tell you what to look for when you're
picking the thing anybody recognize to
cover anybody recognize this picture
anybody who's cover from phila and
alex's guide to web publishing many
years ago they made web application
servers before people called them that
and gave you a coffee table book to show
you how to do it with lots of cute
photographs of him and his dog
it's to deploy web applications which
means it runs on a server and your
browser it's a huge pile of parts and
mostly it's a pile of parts that have
put together with some amount of careful
twiki and some choices that have been
made along the way and there are dozens
of choices which means that if you sit
down with your development team and say
which one should we use pretty soon
you're going to be having fairly vicious
religious arguments about the pluses and
minuses of each one and of course the
correct answer is did you happen to hire
two people who have both worked in the
same one before yeah use that one if
you're starting from scratch these are
all the pieces almost every web
application server out there is all of
these pieces or it tries to be or it
tells you to go off and write them
yourself it's a messy slide that you've
got some user identity and some Ajax
bling on the front and you've got a web
server that rewrites the URL so they
look cute and they they do this and they
eventually call some people piece of
Python code which may or may not be
embedded in some page and it renders a
page out to you and an off it goes and
it has to work between Python which is
an object-oriented language and really
efficient databases which generally
aren't object-oriented and then you can
keep adding a little there's an admin
interfaces and stuff so when you look at
something like soap here's zope it's an
application server it's been scalable
since the dawn of internet time it's got
a full web based at admin interface so
that people sort of like can click in
over the web and administer the web's
applications as they go and turn things
on and off and it is really scalable it
runs a reasonably sized website you
couldn't run amazon off of it easily but
if you wanted to assert a run macys.com
that shouldn't be a problem you want to
run macys.com off
one maybe two machines it's a big
framework you could do that even even
doing spiky holiday traffic it's pretty
efficient it's got if we go back to the
pictures here you've got a lot of things
about how caching works and it's gotten
sort of a cadre of people you know of
the people who are working for hardcore
websites are just making it work and
they don't really want to try to make it
more user-friendly it's kind of hard to
pick up you you hire people have worked
in soap for years and its successful for
what it aimed at which is medium to
large websites being very efficient it's
not going to easily move to something
that's just really beautiful 44 randon
users to pick up and there's some other
options for that and when you look at so
what is soap do you go back to this
picture and say okay well what part is
the soap do really and you start saying
oh well it's got its own them Tory web
server but it actually will use apache
for when you want to deploy but but you
can remember this little web server and
it's got its own URL rewriting system
and for the most part because it was so
early all of these things it writes
itself their rights its own security
managers it actually has its own zouk
database but it also talks to regular
databases so it has an object database
built-in it's got a lot of stuff if you
go to the something else that's really
popular you get something like Django
I'm pizzas oak a lot easier for people
to pick up and start running it's it's
very slick it has a an attitude that
fits with Python in terms of being
something that's concise doesn't like
boilerplate code likes to go through and
say you can just sit there in an
interactive console one and type in code
and things happen that said the biggest
problem it has its unfortunate naming
choices first of all it's Django not
dead Django you have to explain to
everybody there's a silent d and if you
go into google and you type de django it
will come back with a very famous
musician and a very famous musical style
and possibly music
schools and eventually it'll mention oh
yeah there's a popular web framework but
you know popular show us is in thousands
and thousands of users not in millions
of people who listen to Jengo music also
they main things in ways that make it
hard to describe to people instead of
model view controllers they call it
model controller template or something
like that they make up their own terms
one takeaway from this if you want to
make a popular system at some point
confusion comes from bad names you pick
bad names people are going to be
confused that said if you go back to
your little list of this is everything
Jenga writes most of of its pieces
itself kind of like soap does it is
written more recently it's written much
more user-friendly it takes advantage of
things later in the language that that
weren't really available hans oprah's
written and it faces competition from
people who don't mess up the names like
turbo gears which is it's more symbol
from parts it's more friendly it's got a
lot more screencasts that go out and
sort of like okay this is exactly what
you do and this is how you set up your
basic website you can buy out books you
you can come to our seminars and we'll
teach you all about it for a nominal few
thousand dollars a day and the outreach
sort of makes people happy and now it's
considered a little bit of a toss-up I'd
still go with Django but some people
will go with turbo gears and again if
you happen to get to people who started
with one that's fine most popular little
book out there for Python application
services carefully switches back and
forth between them so so they can sell
to two crowds what they do is they they
patch things together they take the same
thing and they say well we need a little
toy a web server but somebody out there
wrote cherry pie because there's all
these people writing stuff so there's a
little cherry pie web server out there
for the Ajax well there's no cricket
somebody wrote a whole bunch of little
Ajax routines that do all the flashy
blingy things on your
your your site so that you can scroll up
things and the way gmail sort of updates
everything that's nice for the object
relational mapping well this SQL object
will just go do that template engine
somebody made one of those they write
very little of their own code so they
can come out and you know work on really
promoting it and trying to get people to
think about the same way and try to hit
that magic level of user use and because
wow you know there isn't really a leader
in this this means you get all sorts of
people these people are coming out and
saying that they're the greatest thing
they've been around for a while making
one or two websites this isn't even
their logo I have yet to decide what
logo it is but it's sort of if I were
going to say you know who are the top
three or four people being used this
would be number four it likes to
reimplement a lot of ruby on rails rails
is the package in ruby that does the
same type of thing and has all those
same components so it does lots of
cogeneration just like Ruby does it's
great you can come down you can say okay
you know we sat down this afternoon we
started working on the project we've got
four makes of code going we all deserve
raises we're doing great here you know
this app by by evening we're going to
have 12 megs of code written it is
flexibly assembled with a tool called
Python paste which is specially made for
creating yet more web application
servers it's so flexible I can't tell
you what's in it you know it's kind of
like if you had a conversation with it'd
be sort of like well you know we use SQL
alchemy for object relational mapping
and say oh I I kind of like the other no
we use that to no problem yeah what do
you say Jack I don't know what do you
got beauclerk it is fully integrated
into it oh so is that other one you
liked and yeah we use one of 15
different web servers just pick one and
this means that every installation will
be different but again you know you can
cover the boss and use all of his
favorite ones
flexibility has its limits after a while
there more of these than you want to
look at I want to go with one of the
three standards so go with Django
October gears or if it's a big things oh
okay yeah yeah the things eat their
young um and it'll be written on top of
pylons probably sort imeem the thing
that I think will happen is you'll find
that that there's certainly aspects in
any of these where some of the code is
just really well done and especially if
you go back and you look at turbo gears
now they're already assembling from all
sorts of different pieces so working
with the framework that's really just
about assembling makes a lot of sense
one thing that's not really quite the
same our content management systems they
often get really confused they're
slightly different do you think about it
the web application servers are about
how do I write something that's got all
these funky applications on it and serve
them it serves gmail content management
servers are about the fact that you get
these creative people and they come in
and yes there's a place for everything
and they're in a hurry and it never goes
in the right place and you know I don't
know if any of you have kids this
happens all the time so oh yeah we threw
in some graphics files and we've got to
make it all work and and really it was
supposed to go through a spell checker
before it went live to a million people
and all of that so these are built on
top of web application servers they're
about website publishing their about
people whose job it is to make that
website fresh every day and put up new
content and you have a lot of things
about flow of control who has to edit
what's my workflow like and you have
things about what's my versioning
I can how do I roll back and forth
between different versions or show
different versions to different
audiences and test things now they're
built on top of web application servers
and so it gets a little confusing
because people will go through and
they'll write a little content
management piece on top of it and say oh
yeah now we're not just a web
application server but if you import
this other stuff we could actually be a
content management server too
fortunately unlike the web application
frameworks were you going off and you're
picking between Django and turbo gears
and soap and pylons and all of these
other things you really only choose one
and it's great when open some open
source project gets there early and does
the right thing so you use plone now you
just don't if you're going to have
something where a lot of people are
going to be editing the same stuff and
there might be a few people zip it but
but we have one of the up and coming
clone is written on top of soap it's got
a strong support base there are
thousands of sites you know if you go to
the CIA homepage it spawn if you go to a
random University it's probably plone
its biggest technical innovation was
that it made a very strong support for
new and different types of content
coming out so if suddenly you're serving
a particular type of media it can do
that if you're serving flash games it
can do that right it's not kind of
something where you can hook it on it
you just make it a first-class content
type and this means that you again these
are all big areas where people can
specialize in and once you have the
right design you're going to end up with
somebody running away with most of the
market share even though it's free most
of the market share most of the
mindshare and most of the new ideas
flowing back in until it's far enough
ahead that everybody is you know having
to give their websites as well I did
something interesting I could send it in
and get it changed in that way I won't
have to maintain it every time there's a
new release of something else so this is
just a
them shot from one of the recent plone
conferences and there are a lot of them
of their a lot of people who use plum so
when you when you're looking for
somebody to build something content
management you just say oh I need a
phone consultant there are a lot of them
and a lot of these libraries grow into
this set so the frameworks people have
to specialize in using the libraries are
blocks that you can pick up and start
playing with and the frameworks are big
problems that a lot of people have so
you build this big framework around it
before you even get to the libraries you
back to all of the different spots in
the Python language getting used to how
to use its classes and getting used to
use decorators this context iterators
generators you know I think I'm kind of
hitting that spot where I'm finished you
know here's this big quilt of Python and
we've covered a few different spots here
and there let me say look there's little
pieces of it here and there that that
we've talked about but really you just
have to remember this is all about
exploring as you go through this going
to be more and you keep exploring Python
you just just have to play with it when
you're looking for modules there is the
cheese shop which lists everything
there's cheese Raider which tries to
rate them and doesn't do that well a job
there's a couple of automated raiding
tools that sort of chug through but you
know pygame hasn't been updated in a
year or two and and every automated tool
would say it's hopeless nobody uses it
anymore it's too popular and the place
to look is Wikipedia Wikipedia will give
you a good fast rundown on almost every
major python module and if it doesn't
have a decent entry it probably doesn't
have enough users to make a decent entry
and you can add one yourself if you'd
like to ignore the version numbers
ignore the data was last updated those
aren't really going to help you as much
as you think it would be and you're just
going to have to keep learning python
because after you get past sort of it
the basic you know here's this language
and it's cool
it's fun to program and what you
actually learning is all of the things
everybody in the world is doing in
programming that start showing up on
your open source docket that you know
some of them are under GPL licenses
which can affect what you can do with a
new company a lot of them are under BSD
licenses that are just take them in and
use them and you don't even have to tell
anyone but you'll find that more and
more a lot of the problems we're
actually getting solved we're getting
big bulletproof libraries or frameworks
that just do it what used to be you know
we talked about these web application
frameworks and they all look sort of
messy but they solve problems that used
to take a development team months to do
and now it's well it's messy and it
might take you a couple of days to get
it to get something running and you know
somebody who really knows this tool
might quote you two weeks to get your
website up and running three weeks if
you want it to scale to 20 million users
that's it you know then you start saying
well I've got this long list of features
because everybody else has the basic
stuff and then you're back to using on
programmers again so that's what i was
talking about it's some buzz words it's
not all of them it's trying to be a high
signal-to-noise I've I hope you know you
some of you will probably glaze over at
some of this but hopefully everybody got
something out of it my contact
information the slides and notes will be
up tomorrow at Charles Miriam com / talk
and and the notes will include links to
everything that you should be reading
and playing with and and hopefully what
will become a reference in themselves
thank you very much
any questions not that there's a
religious argument coming
no but okay I'm it is very very flexible
but let's certainly will I'll go with
that
the basics
and it would be excellent if you know
both sets of developers ended up sort of
adopting the same code that they're
working on because of inches right and
you can see this that what happened with
blown in part because it started so
early and it started on top of the soap
is that as things consolidated well now
it's this idea flow that really makes
things mature quickly to the point that
sometimes have finished okay same person
this the ecosystem you'll see and I
think there's going to be a does this
fish get bigger big enough issue because
you know we have two engineers who are
going to have seven opinions that that
that's the way of it no I agree i'm not
i am not trying to sit down and advocate
oh these are the strong opinions about
it i'd be truly surprised if people
jumped up and said oh there's another
one that for web application framework
dwarfs these others if you started
anywhere with any one of these you would
probably find that you could go back and
and and start doing something else well
one of the oddest things that you'll
also find that is if you're an engineer
you may well want to carefully look at
it and decide that you're going to spend
your entire career worrying about a
better template engine worrying about a
better Ajax library and there's some
good talks on how to do good JavaScript
libraries and it's not always obvious or
you can spend all of your time writing
that Python code which is a good thing
to do database specialists have always
been around this is we're solving very
large problems each piece that you put
together is often very tricky okay
I had a web application I had done any
good apps I was familiar with most of
these great works familiar that that
I've heard of them and I started trying
to use poem because I thought that would
be it had a lot of the components that I
wanted to all the administrative control
but I wanted to actually talk whenever I
wanted to write I want to provide my
code and I found it very difficult to
get down to the application and I've
tried to use ArchiCAD yourself to do
that I had to have this uml generator
tool I gave up I couldn't get them so I
took a look at turbo gears and I walk a
book I started trying to build this same
application using turbo garrison and I
was struggling with that struggling we
found that difficult
took you down this path simply yeah and
I found pythons and I found it easy it
was a simple app simple to build I
didn't you know you've had your choices
of things i like to sequel alchemy I
could use the database that I wanted not
sequel object mmm blah blah button I
found it easier to use and I like the
you had choices of pepper it was there
is very quite done that they've changed
okay so that was my experience and so
you'll find more people saying pylons
it's very very flexible you can throw
together all the pieces you want and
they like it that way and its really
kind of hard because if you go down
using the wrong tools for a while the
the tools all come with their sets of
expectations for example if you're using
ply which is a lexical analyzer for
making your own grammars it expects that
you can just pass everything in memory
and it doesn't work if you can't do it
that way if you're using pi + + to
interface to C++ code it has certain
expectations and you may want to be
doing something different so there's
always going to be a spot where you were
just because your head down in a project
doesn't mean that you should stop
exploring what other alternative
libraries there are because you may find
one that sort of comes up with the right
set of assumptions for the problem that
you're doing and these assumptions are
very hard to tease out and people don't
write chapter one this program assumes
that you will use what we tell you to do
because you just want your job done or
in plone we assume you're putting up a
public website probably like most other
public websites with maybe one or two
different things and that it's primarily
about managing content which is where
you're using us and not about writing an
application people don't write these
things down well you know if you're
writing the if you're using the pill the
Python imaging library you know it
assumes that you're going to be using
one of the format's that it supports if
you're picking something like I know it
doesn't support the adobe photoshop
format at all and it will have an
appendix that kinda says you could write
your own support but you really can't
now you just say if you're going to have
to parse up those files go write your
own program it's not going to work so
I'm not going to pick I'm not trying to
pick hard hard on pylons I know bits
gaining in popularity it is it is a
little bit of an assemble at yourself
kit and sometimes that's what you want
you might look at Pyrex embedded as one
of the things that I always found about
phones is that you have a lot more deep
constraints than you would expect your
memory is often very constrained and
that they're constantly worried that you
will do something that will eliminate
its ability to make and receive phone
calls so you'll end up doing a lot more
linking to C++ libraries to get things
done and I haven't seen outside of you
know that the phone API world just
changed radically google introduced
there's which called Android or and or
something like that yeah well notice
that there is a big change and this is
going a little bit off topic for the
pure python player there is a very large
change just in the last two months
google announced its system where
they're making a bet that people are
going to want to basically brand their
phones off of the services that the
phone provides meaning Google Apple
opened up their API and they're making a
bet that you're going to okay they meant
to open it up it didn't work but they're
there they're basically made
announcements where they're saying okay
you're going to be going with the phone
manufacturer and that's how you're going
to think of which phone you have son has
come back and came out with their set
that says you can make it proprietary to
your phone hardware go ahead just
license it from us and so they just
opened up something you're going to see
a lot of chaos in the phone applications
world mostly it's all about whether i
can write a little piece of application
that can cleanly load and unload itself
and share its resources in a friendly
manner with the other applications
running
that's all I can tell you right now look
at pyrex embedded as a new piece there
was a guy you have it running on your
your iPhone and then like like although
like if nothing else works it always
what a giant under your Java to get it
running on Android it's nothing else
that stuff
I
when I was at Sun working with j2me we
went through a lot of iterations and we
used to call it j2 embedded and things
like that and we were selling people
slides for a lot of money and eventually
people came to a conclusion on it that
it takes a while for these things too
it's a trickier problem than it first
appears because when you're actually
ready in an application it just works
so there's efficient economy is there
important items exhibit a decision I
haven't seen these to use it you see
what was highly see the deluxe version
why should I use
it's not practical we followed by the
response will be developing applications
well so what is the final question here
no okay ya know it sounds like what
you're saying is it'd be nice to have a
chat group or a meeting on programming
for mobile phones and my guess is that
if you did it right now you'd probably
get a lot of hints but nobody has
answers yet yes no thatthat's let's
switch it likewise there were three
points if one is my continent there's
gonna be a new version of Python act a
little trap you lie to my photo taker
that's what the second thing is going
from not from procedural programming for
transit going
from what I'm hearing peers okay yeah no
no this is the that's what you're
hearing go on what but you haven't given
me anything else to be bigger than the
other the third thing is that that yes
like we gonna post a messy thing but
it's cannot wait you say here's a
sequence of bytes that change applying
this cur cur there was a be happy it
should do now if I'm assuming from what
you're saying what is that playback
isn't giving you a clean way to do it so
your results are messy what I'm saying
that's okay those are valid and I look
at each of those and first you know I
appreciate people who get up and say
this didn't sound good what we've got
here is yeah this is not the rock python
is great speech there's a it there's
enough as you go through just the
regular python tutorial you'll see how
much stuff and you know look I was at
Java soft we made a language that is so
hard typed well it turns out people
don't make typing errors any more
dynamic languages really are really nice
and if you look at some of the languages
pythons and interesting trade-off Ruby
gets all the Lisp programmers Ruby and
Lisp go well together and javascript is
great as long as you're ready just for
what javascript is good at and that
that's okay whenever you even in Java if
you open up a file you have to tell it
which encoding you use it usually you're
going to be using utf-8 which is great
for American languages because your
standard ASCII will come out in one bite
and not so good for some foreign
languages because your standard
random Kenji character is going to come
out in eight bytes but the stream itself
doesn't tell you which encoding it is in
and some people will use you GF 16 or 32
some people will use some of the other
encoding zout there some people will use
different choices as to which code pages
to map the same characters on this is
not a Python specific problem this is a
Unicode problem and the case that you're
going to get is that all of the stuff
that you can control is going to work
fine the things that are going to hurt
our that you're going to have to write
some new test cases to say when I asked
the person yes or no and they start
putting in one of the two different ways
of putting Korean characters in and some
of the pieces don't break nicely in the
way that you'd like and you know on
these weekly conference calls they argue
about this is this going to break my
code where is this going to put my kanji
characters right over the critical piece
of data so that the person whenever he
tries to click OK is actually selecting
their gangi characters this is going to
be true in any language and it's almost
unfortunate that there's not a big
Welling and say no will make an open
source alternative to the Unicode
problem but it's not likely to happen
the layout for some of these things are
dependent on the rendering and useful
laid out it's me that's two different
ages but you're just yes secondaries you
I don't really care about I know it's
about the Python will provide you is ok
but the first issue of what's in the
stream oh if I open up the far end with
rhapsodic versus asked I don't know well
open up a file that's little Indian
versus beginning it's just a definition
that's all it is as a definition I think
you know focus on shirts babies floated
over done awesome but it's fine it's
just if there's not a good library or
interface to access and iniquity that's
what ball stuff but I think your slide
do a disservice to unicode where it's
really how you interact I think we'll
probably just have to agree to disagree
on this matter of how clean unicode is
yes beautiful car internationalization
is hard death death constant as far as
Python specifically python has built-in
you know prototype Ruby doesn't PHP
doesn't Java does like if you know how
to do internationalisation type on this
awesome you don't know how to do which
nationalization I thought about rescue
that's all
yeah and I think one of the things that
is coming to people is that as Python
goes to the next version unicode becomes
the default string tight everywhere when
you say quote hello it encodes that into
unicode according to some rules usually
it's utf-8 unless you've said something
else right metal classes as I said they
tend to be the interface the you don't
go there meta classes are for when
you're changing the behavior and doing
things that that you really just can't
do in Java and you can play with it even
more in Ruby but it becomes very opaque
and what it does is it's allowing you to
change certain behaviors the classic
examples for this or when you're going
through and you saying when anybody
defines a class in this area then I want
to go through and play with all of the
instance variables for those classes so
that I can create an IDL mapping or so
that I can create an ideal mapping and
talk to some cold Cobra server over the
Corvus over over there and I or I want
to put it into this mapping where I can
then go out and I can talk to some
object relational map and never have the
person ever have to specify anything and
I've looked through a lot of Java code
where half of the code is written about
Swizzle enid into some particular XML
format and back out and you shouldn't
have to do that meta classes are not
something but no no and the way that
Python actually handles that dynamic is
everything is running that script and
looking at a dictionary and when you
come down and you look at the dictionary
you say ok I want you to go off and draw
yourself on the screen draw it's not
actually like in C++ where it's got a V
table or even in Java it has
out the equivalent of the table that
that's compiled in what it does is it
looks at that dictionary and says for
this type in front of me right now does
it actually have the ability does it
have a routine to go off and draw itself
in itself or one of its superclasses if
it does then i can just process that and
i don't have to worry too much about the
type because it turns out that
developers after they haven't learned at
least one statically typed language some
point in their career usually in the
first computer science class stop making
type errors also Java has sorry Python
has a lot of unit testing built-in
people actually do write their unit
tests to try to cover this stuff we find
that this is not a problem people don't
make that air that the type error that
everybody's worried about when they
start talking about dynamic languages
the Python its inherent in the way that
Python does a message dispatch
you'd subclass it you probably just
subclass it sure is you can't monkey
pageanty possibly it's possible to do
that no place it really easy to affect
everything as my phone is it is a list
or dictionary so if you want to change
your parent class itself you have
listened parent classes you could swap
in a new parent plus you want to add a
method on the fly the closets dictionary
have new methods so it's really I mean
it's an employee of the runtime engine
basically medical medical classes is a
fairly esoteric feature that's recently
been language that blog people myself
have never touched and probably never
room so if I think it'll just brought
out that it's something there is very
powerful but it's much but I got it to
West and it has come out beginners from
your point of view what you want I
thought yes I tremendous amount of
things
name in fashion
now you want my Python language
comparison talk which is a different
talk so okay and feel free to bug me
after afterwards and I'll answer any
other questions there are few other
talks it has with the basics yeah
there's a quilt these are like three or
four random spots around it yes yeah no
I think Ruby on Rails for those that
don't know about it one of Ruby on Rails
was great because they came out with
like two or three ideas that people
hadn't really been using enough of one
of which is they said your fret web
framework application should manage your
database schema and you'd all of your
database pieces and have a fast way of
just saying make me a new database
that's up to date and migrate back and
forth between versions of my database
now granted it has some problems because
it's very hard to test whether you're
down migrations actually do what you
thought it would but you'd be surprised
how many people got burned that one day
the database died and nobody knew that
at one point somebody went into a MySQL
Council console and manually created
some index and it just worked faster
from ever onward and it was never
entered into anything that was
repeatable the other thing that rails
did very well was that they took an
approach where they said that you should
not have to configure things you should
work on a convention more than you
should work on a configuration it can
actually hurt you a lot in rails if you
try to break the conventions because
other people other parts of the program
that you didn't expect will will want
that convention to be true if you have a
database named people there should be an
object named person you should not name
that object anything
else or things will start being hard to
deal with but also you never have to
explain that there's this person and
this people and if I do a person dot
find by last name that that probably
means that there's a field and they're
called last name it it will just follow
the convention to find it and that's
something that really came out of rails
as well so you'll find that those things
migrate around one of the nice things is
that in the dynamic languages that are
fundamentally all open source languages
right now they latch on to really good
ideas that other developers had and
packs them in fairly quickly and it can
be you know once somebody has has shown
you that this can work and has decided
that this is a really good idea it's
actually not that much effort to
implement any other questions great
