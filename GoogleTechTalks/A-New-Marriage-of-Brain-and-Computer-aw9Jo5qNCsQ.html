Hameroff professor of anesthesiology and
director of consciousness studies at the
University of Arizona Arizona at Tucson
he has collaborated with roger penrose
on the or cho our objective orchestrated
objective reduction theory of
consciousness he has appeared in the
film what the bleep and he's currently
working on a feature animation called
mine ville so let's welcome Stuart
Hameroff thank you thank you very much
Isaac for inviting me and thank y'all
for coming and I'm gonna start off
talking about consciousness and we know
that when we open our eyes the world
appears before us and we know that light
enters the eyes goes to the back of the
thalamus in the back of the brain and
then being the world appears before us
now the word being has kind of come into
use in the consciousness studies area to
denote phenomenal subjective experience
otherwise known as the hard problem what
it is like to be something so if you see
being that means conscious phenomenal
experience and that's what we're trying
to understand but we know that the world
is actually the representation of the
world is in our head or the world we we
experience is a representation in our
head this is what modern science has
told us not everybody agrees with us but
most people would going back to the
ancient Greeks
so the Bing is actually the
representation of the world is in our
head and that that is conscious
experience but if that's so then we
don't really know what's out there for
sure and Descartes confronted this
problem and is and he talked about the
we could be a brain-in-a-vat fed
information by an evil genius in recent
times this is the theme of the movie The
Matrix oh okay the The Matrix where
actually the the outside world is an
illusion but because of this the card
said I think therefore I am the only
thing he could be sure of is that he was
conscious the card gave several other
important contributions including his
idea that the contents of consciousness
like the the players and props on a
stage and this denna called this later
the Cartesian theater so we have various
things script and irony and things going
on to the content of the stage that is
presented to the audience but who is the
audience who is perceiving the
consciousness and this is of course goes
back to the big problem of the
phenomenal experience and if there's a
film or being shown who's looking at it
if there's an observer then that
individual esta doesn't have an observer
and and so forth and this gets into
what's called the infinite regress
problem of observers all the way down
decart believed that the the audience
was an immaterial soul hovering above
his body he was a religious man and that
it was the the soul that had the big
experience and that the soul of viewed
viewed the contents through the pineal
gland which is the only midline
structure that he knew about so this led
to Cartesian dualism of what's called in
modern times cognitive closure or
mysterion ism which basically says that
we will never be able to understand
conscious experience Steven Pinker for
example is a cognitive closure
aficionado although he doesn't even
pretend to understand the quantum
argument but that's another matter but
anyway this separates mind didn't matter
that's dualism Cartesian dualism what we
do know is that for vision light enters
the eye signals go from the optic nerve
to the thalamus and they're broadcast to
the back of the brain and then
sequentially moving forward from the
back of the brain forward forward
picking up the v4 and then frontal
cortex and it seems that for full
attention mediated consciousness that
you need the back of the brain and the
front of the brain this is called
bottom-up or top-down if if there's a
process going from the BET from the
front of ran back down and this for full
attention mediated consciousness is how
conscious experience occurs or at least
is associated with this type of activity
in the front and the back of the brain
and there's kind of a snowball effect
where in the back of the brain you you
detect shape and then shape and color
shape color in motion and then after
several hundred milliseconds the Bing
experience of an integrated visual
Gestalt
so the cartoon form would be there's
activity in the back and v4 and also the
front and this gives rise to the Bing
experience consciousness phenomenal
experience front and back however other
situations of localized activity also
give rise to consciousness so you don't
necessarily need the front and the back
for for example pure color Zeki did
experiments stimulating the for area and
the subjects had experience of pure
color or without any context so the
question is what type of activity
mediates this another type of more
localized conscious experience comes
from our lower centers more primitive
centers the emotional core intense
romantic shall we say feelings from the
brainstem meaty by dopamine and other
hormones and other neurotransmitters so
some process activity is specific for
consciousness you know it's not an
architecture that you need the front and
the back in the front it's some activity
that can occur locally globally
originally we just don't know what that
activity is there are also
representations of the body the motor
homunculus for example and the sensory
homunculus are this is motor over here
and there proportional to the
sensitivity in the case of sensory or
the need for fine control in the case of
motor so this is how our bodies are
represented in our cortex so here's a
little cartoon of what a homunculus
might look like if he or she were
talking to you and the the brains will
be performing at our next consciousness
conference we also know that memory and
conscious content are distributed
throughout the cortex in this sort of a
holographic fashion and Carl pre-bump
talks about this and this goes back to
Lashley we know that memory is not
stored in any one place and probably
conscious content is not represented any
one place but it's stored kind of all
over the place in many situations in a
distributed hologram like way ok so how
do we put this all together early AI
guys Simon and Newell and others have
the idea of a blackboard which became
the global workspace where you put down
the content of the moment what's going
on so you have inputs you have top down
effects logic various things go into the
global workspace which produces
out out put in a computer architecture
this is very much like the Cartesian
theater in fact this was basically
adapted from the Cartesian theater idea
by Bernie bars as far as putting it on
on structures in the brain bars and
Dehaene and others came up with the idea
that the thalamus projection to the
cortex and then back to thalamus gave
rise to these top bottom-up and top-down
feedback and feed-forward loops that
give rise that the constitute the global
workspace so kind of the the party line
in modern neuroscience and cognitive
science is that you have a global
workspace that maybe the thalamus to
talking to the cortex to the front of
the cortex talk in the back of the
cortex with emotions memory putting it
going in that somehow gives rise to
consciousness as an emergent output of
this computation so in this more
simplistic form of the bottom-up and
top-down and consciousness kind of
emerges in some way in between ray
jackendoff a philosopher several decades
ago and also jeffrey gray and some other
people recently have noted that
consciousness is probably not at the
bottom not at the top but in the middle
in an intermediate setting which which
kind of has a handshake with both
bottom-up and top-down and the
consciousness is in an intermediate
situation between inputs and between the
bottom and the top but it could also be
argued that the say this happens many
places in this cognitive hierarchy in
the cortex are between thalamus and
cortex now what about the brain how do
we put this into into biological brains
well Ramona kahala famous Spanish
neuroanatomist the turn of the century
lasted last turn of the century a
hundred years ago showed that the brain
is composed of individual cells called
neurons now prior to this time Golgi the
predominant Italian nuran animus was
saying that the brain was a syncytium
was kind of a tangled threaded reticulum
of fibers that weren't weren't separated
weren't distinct but kaha demonstrated
synapses between neurons showing that
neurons were discrete entities although
with very complex and beautiful forms
now with gap junctions
as I'll get to in a minute it looks like
they're actually our syncytium also
mediated by gap junctions but kaha
showed that the brain was composed of
individual cells called neurons
connected by synapses mediated by
chemical neurotransmitters that
transmitted information so with this
type of neuron this is this is what you
get these are toy neurons we say three
dendrites that receive the input one
axon that spikes and if you put a bunch
of them together in a network or loop
you get information a signal that
travels around the loop now notice these
signals are not coherent wherever you
happen to measure it when they when the
spike passes by you will see a potential
so computer people then came back and
and made a model neuron McCulloch and
Pitt's in 1943 made the first artificial
neuron or model neuron in a paper called
a logical calculus of ideas imminent in
nervous activity and basically they had
inputs a nirodh which plays the role of
biological neurons in an output so these
became dendrites and this became the
axon with spikes outgoing spikes or
firings now if you add connection
strengths so which can be which can be
altered synaptic plasticity due to heavy
and learning Donal hebbs contribution in
the late 1940s of adjustable connection
strengths this led to the perceptron
which was the first which was put forth
by Rosenblatt in 1962 which eventually
led to neural networks some twenty years
later
Marvin Minsky wrote a very critical
paper and this this idea disappeared for
about twenty years but then came back
and led to artificial neural networks so
this is basically the the McCulloch
pitts neuron with with the variable
connection strengths and if you make a
network of these and in artificial
neurons that it will self learn and and
and learn to recognize patterns so
artificial neural networks came back in
the 1980s or so based on variable
connect connection strengths inputs and
outputs and this look this was basically
based on neural networks to how people
understood neural networks and also
helped under help explain how neural
networks might work
now the biology of this is based on
here's a neuron with many dendrites in
the cell body and one axon which then
branches and goes to other in this case
one but actually many other different
nerve cells and the message transfer the
information transfer is due to a
propagating spike a depolarization
mediated by ions traveling across the
membrane perpendicular to the flow of
the spike propagating as a firing axon
firing or spike along the long axon now
the science for this was based on the
hodgkin-huxley neuron the hodgkin-huxley
equations in 1952 related the membrane
potential to ionic currents moving
through these ion channels here and
accounts for non-linear triggering of
the action potentials or spikes and it
allowed people to model the neuron as a
series of capacitors and with
resistances and so forth which led to
various types of models of dendrites as
cable theory and so forth and this is
much better than just simply some aiding
inputs but still doesn't do justice to
the complexity of dendritic processing
so in a very rough sense neural networks
can be thought of as something like this
this type of feed-forward biological
neuronal networks with the exception
that these spikes would only wouldn't
only go to one neuron that they would go
to they might branch and go to other
neurons as well but basically the
artificial neural network fits with the
idea of a feed-forward biological
neuronal Network as shown with these toy
neurons so stepping back for a second
this the idea that consciousness emerges
from this type of computation is
basically materialism representational
ISM computationalism AI in brain equals
mind equals computer emergence theory
and the singularity materialism the idea
that matter gives rise to mind so the
singularity specifically is as I guess a
group of notions which says that
computers will reach or surpass human
brain computational capacity based on
extrapolation of Moore's law and I'm
sure you all know what Moore's law is so
that human brain functions including
consciousness will and will occur in
computers this is the core idea of the
singularity now ignoring consciousness
for a moment let's just look at the
human
brain computational capacity because I
will argue that computation does not
necessarily lead to to consciousness but
just look at the computational capacity
AI assumptions based on neuronal firings
and synaptic transmissions that is neuro
computation based on moravica and
reycarts while and others roughly you
have 10 to the 11th neurons per brain
roughly a thousand synapses per neuron
firing maybe a hundred times per second
gives you very roughly 10 to the 16th
operations per second so they plot out
when Moore's law reaches 10 to the 16th
operations per second it's another 10 or
however many years and then
consciousness will happen that's the
prediction the assumption of the
singularity so let's what are the
problems with this well one is that it
assumes consciousness is an output of
neuronal computation in these
feed-forward and feedback networks and
this requires consciousness to be epi
phenomenal and ilusory I'm not going to
go into this I take the time to go into
this but if you measure the evoked
potentials that fit this model the
activity correlating with conscious
consciousness in in any type of paradigm
occurs several hundred milliseconds
after the stimulus and we've already
responded even in rapid conversation and
ping-pong and baseball we've already
responded and we think we're acting
consciously but the science says no
you're at we're acting unconsciously and
falsely believe we're acting consciously
therefore consciousness is an
epiphenomenon and an illusion and I'll
come back to this later but it seems
neuronal firings or synaptic
transmissions are the fundamental
information states are bits if we go
down a level into the cytoskeleton and
the microtubules will see that we gain
roughly 12 orders of magnitude greater
than the singularity assumption that
which may or may not be a problem now to
show why it's wrong to consider neuronal
firings and synapses as the fundamental
units of information consider a
single-cell organism like a Paramecium
this is one cell it has no synapses no
no spikes it swims around it finds food
it finds mates it avoids obstacles it
learns if you suck it into a capillary
tube it gets out fast and faster each
time it has sex there's a paired a pair
of Paramecium conjugating and it does so
without any synapse as it uses its
microtubules which including the
microtubules in this
sylia on its outside which are both
sensorimotor and the microtubules inside
the cell and these same microtubules are
found in neurons if we look through one
of those cilia that are both sensory
organs and also motor organs in a
Paramecium and look inside we see that
it's it's made up of these doublets of
structures called microtubules which by
these other contractile proteins Bend
and can send signals back into the cell
itself and these same microtubules are
found in other structures widely through
our biology for example in our in our
eyes the sensory cilia in the retina
light passes through these to get to the
rhodopsin in the in the back of the rods
and cones and these things are very well
structured to be optical detectors and
in photoreceptors and have been shown to
be photoreceptors and organisms like
Euglena and other cells by Gunther
Albrecht Bueller and a pair of these
structures make up centrioles which have
a very important role in cell division
when the chromosomes - bye it's the
centrioles shown here in the yellow
connected to microtubules here the pull
the chromosomes apart this is the
activity that first got me obsessed
interested in obsessed with microtubules
some 35 years ago and it's still a
mystery how this beautiful orchestrated
mitosis occurs in neurons if you look
inside neurons you see microtubules also
shown here you can the the tops have
been ripped off in the preparation to
show that they're hollow and they're
connected by other proteins to form a
network which I will argue is a
computational network occurring inside
each and every neuron in the brain I got
interested in this in the 70s and 80s
and and work with a physicist at Los
Alamos neens
Steen Rasmussen and we model
microtubules of cellular automata in
which the state of each individual
subunit so here's a microtubule it's
made up of these peanut shaped proteins
called tubulin which can change shapes
governed by quantum forces inside inside
their interiors and we we model them as
a computational lattice and calculated
their forces their their interaction
forces so that much like a cellular
automata we see patterns and gliders and
computation occurring in microtubules
based
the individual the state of each
individual subunit being the fundamental
bit or unit of information in biology so
you if you take a piece of a microtubule
and the white in the blue being
different patterns and this is just
based on dipole dipole coupling forces
among the six surrounding neighbors and
because of the hexagonal skewed lattice
you get some interesting behaviors and
propagation of patterns and information
and if you couple a couple of these
together you can show learning and we
did that in some simulation studies so
the inside of a neuron would actually
look something like this where here the
receptors on the dendritic spines
there's actin filaments connecting to
the microtubules which are linked to
other microtubules so you have a
computational lattice inside the
dendrites of each neuron in the brain
affect all of our cells but dendrites
have particularly elaborate and and
well-organized microtubule networks and
our micro tube is important in our brain
yes if they get messed up we get what's
called neurofibrillary tangles which is
one of the hallmark features of
Alzheimer's disease everybody talks
about the amyloid plaques on the outside
but the other essential lesion to get
Alzheimer's disease is that the
microtubules inside the neurons get all
tangled due to a defect in the tau
protein which which keeps them from
falling apart and so your microtubules
disintegrate if you have Alzheimer's
disease so let's say this is correct
that there's there's computation going
on at the level of microtubules inside
the neurons what does that make the
computational capacity of the human
brain well each neuron has about ten to
the eighth microtubule subunits which
switch states in the nanosecond so that
gives you about 10 to the 17th
operations per second per neuron which
is more than the singularity is
projecting to the entire brain so that's
a problem so if you count each neuron
that gives you about 10 to the 28th
operations per second so the goal post
for the singularity should be pushed
back another 12 orders of magnitude
which would definitely get you into the
quantum regime but whether that's a
problem or not we don't know yet so
another problem with the neuro
computational singularity concept is
that the neuronal behavior
it's from hodgkin-huxley remember
hodgkin-huxley is is what makes neurons
act like model neurons and we now know
that ion channels appear require
non-local cooperative interactions for
spiking for spike firing and there's an
X factor affecting spike threshold a
paper in two thousand and actually two
thousand six in nature by non door fat
all these are these are spikes the Reds
are the spikes this is the activity in
the dendrites of the cell body and this
is the emergence of spikes which is this
is what hodgkin-huxley predicts here
there's a gradual increase in the in the
voltage and it reaches a threshold and
then there's kind of a sloping uptake
and spiking occurs with a very narrow
threshold but what cortical neurons do
is this and this doesn't hold true for
it holds true less for neurons in slice
and not at all for model neurons is that
number one there's a very wide threshold
there's a great variability in what's
going to trigger a spike in every neuron
from from spike - spike and some people
say it's noise but it's it's probably
something going on buried in this great
electron activity cloud which correlates
among neurons even across the brain and
also the the up the uptake the slope is
almost vertical basically vertical which
means that if you look at if you think
about it but what Hodgkin constantly
says was that a wave of depolarization
is going to move and as it hits this
this channel in this channel the channel
is open sequentially as the wave moves
along but that's not what happens what
happens is that the channel is open in a
given region triggering the spike open
simultaneously they all open at the same
time and this stuff burn Reuter and
others have suggested that there's
quantum coherence occurring among these
among the channels to give rise to this
spike so neurons in the brain do not
behave the way model neurons do they
have this this x factor and also they
seem to require quantum cooperativity to
give the robustness of the spike another
problem with with the neural computation
gambeson
neuro complications singularity idea is
gamma synchrony EEG the best measurable
correlative
this used to be known as coherent 40
Hertz it was discovered in 1980s that
higher-order cognition and consciousness
has a high-frequency EEG component and
30 to 90 Hertz above what's what's
usually measured and this goes away with
anesthesia and comes back when the
patient wakes up and it's not related to
axonal firings or spikes it's mediated
through gap Junction connected dendrites
and structures that we're calling hyper
neurons or dendritic webs so here's our
here's a brain and somebody being with
their EEG being recorded and the normal
EEG frequencies that we usually think
about alpha beta and so forth go to 30
and then above 30 is gamma and filters
tend to cut this off because it gets
into muscle artifact and power
electrical power and so forth but
controlling for that people many people
have found that the best correlative
consciousness is correlations between
like front and back right to left
gamma synchrony being precisely
synchronized for example Lutsen all did
a study on Buddhist meditating monks
who've been meditating for decades and
decades and their controls were college
kids that were just taught to meditate
for a couple days and they measured
their gamma synchrony and the monks had
incredibly robust highly coherent gamma
synchrony very high frequency to out to
about 80 or 90 whereas the college kids
had some gamma synchrony but it wasn't
nearly as robustly coherent or as
synchronous and the monks had a much
better much higher highly more highly
coherent gamma synchrony even without
meditating showing that years of
meditation changes the brain another
study on this was done by Frank eken
Hoffer in the Amazon where he went down
and studied subjects taking ayahuasca
and measured their EEG and he he avoided
the he just looked at the top of the
brain to avoid muscle artifact and he
found tremendous correlations from side
to side front to back in the gamma
synchrony in subject compared to
controls and subjects taking ayahuasca
the hallucinogenic brew used by shamans
in the Amazon and this is what
apparently they see under ayahuasca
this is paintings done
the shaman Pablo Alma Ringo the visions
that are seen with ayahuasca so when
they're seeing this their their brains
are highly coherent at in the gamma
synchrony range but gamma synchrony
cannot be easily explained by this
axonal dendritic neural computational
paradigm it requires a different type of
connection from chemical synapses so
here's a normal chemical chemical
synapse or transmitter synapse incoming
axon a space the synapse a spine and
then the postsynaptic dendrites but
there's another type of connection
called a gap Junction for example
between dendrites so here's a dendrite
of one cell a dendrite of another cell
and there's this gap junction which is
like a window between the cells
now this couples these two membranes
coherently so they they depolarize
synchronously but it also makes the
interior of one cell the equivalent to
the interior of the other cell basically
makes it like a syncytium as gold.you
suggested before alcohol it is this type
of connection the gap Junction
connection shown here and these are much
bigger than ion channels plus they
connect to pores on the other side so if
you were swimming around in this cell
you could swim through this gap Junction
into another cell so this is what
mediates gamma synchrony from the inside
of a cell say from the inside of one
dendrite look it might look like this
here the microtubules there's the gap
chunk to the other cell and then here's
a an axon and a synapse here so this is
where I think consciousness is happening
this is worth this is what is being
active this is where this mediating
gamma synchrony now this this type of
network would look completely different
than the net network we saw before but
is actually embedded in the other type
of network so here's a bunch of tiny
neurons and glia because glia also you
have gap junctions connected by these
dendritic dendritic gap junctions and
they are depolarizing coherently so it's
kind of like the chorus line where the
dancers are holding hands and acting
coherently and because if you measure
anywhere in this in this area you're
going to get this the synchronous
activity they synchronize from here to
here here to here and this is the type
of dendritic
postsynaptic potentials which were
synchronized spikes are not synchronized
when when gamma synchrony came along
people who people assume spikes were
coherent that jumped on the bandwagon
proclaimed it as the
neural correlate of consciousness but
that when it came out later that spikes
are not coherent many people were forced
to choose between spikes and gamma
synchrony and they chose spikes
incorrectly I would say so this is where
I think Bing is happening in the gamma
synchronous this doesn't tell you why
Bing is happening so and these are
embedded in the other type of
feed-forward and feedback in your own
neural networks so there's no new
Anatomy here it's just the same old
Anatomy just taking into account these
types of connections and in fact this
does occur in the brain here's a
pyramidal cell neuron these are all
dendrites here's the one axon coming
down here and it has these lateral
connections with other dendrites and
this is shown beautifully here in the
slide from qahal of the lateral Baelor
dendrites of pyramidal cells interacting
so this type of layer may be where where
consciousness is occurring and these
have been called dendritic webs or hyper
neurons so I have a simulation here
let's see if this is gonna work just
takes a second this was done by a guy
named Rob stuff oh beam of the other
mine project and it's showing a couple
thing never don't worry about the sound
it's showing this type of connection
which is the chemical synapse and then
here's the here's the dendritic
dendritic gap Junction it takes a few
minutes so so the point is that that
these two dendrites these two cells
mediated by gap junctions depolarize
synchronously it's not a domino effect
like with excellent spikes neurons
connected by these guys depolarize
synchronously together so in the context
of this this sounds a little bit
annoying but you see the axonal spikes
that look like these travelling signals
going on but in the background you get
this green flashing that would be
something like the dendritic gamma
synchrony so what's going on underneath
or behind or supporting the axonal
spikes that everybody normally pays
attention to
so just to recapitulate this is the type
of circuit that I think is mediating
consciousness dendritic dendritic gap
Junction networks with with processing
and microtubules going out with that
happens to be quantum computations going
on inside that mediate consciousness so
the last problem I have with neuro
competition is singularity is that
psychoactive drugs including anesthesia
which blocks consciousness selectively
and psychoactive drugs which which
enhance consciousness if you will act by
a quantum interactions in dendritic
proteins membrane proteins and
microtubules anesthesia doesn't do
anything to spikes it just affects
dendrites for example and all these
psychoactive drugs act on act on
dendritic proteins they're mediated by
quantum interactions called van der
Waals forces shown here between two
neutral neon atoms where the electrons
of the one atom repel the electrons and
the other forming temporary dipoles the
temporary dipoles then interact these
are not chemical bonds these are
physical quantum interactions and are
what mediate effects of psychoactive
drugs anesthetics and protein
conformational states of some proteins
so proteins are chains of amino acids
and they fold when these nonpolar groups
including those with aromatic rings get
together in the interior form what are
called hydrophobic pockets or quantum
pockets which can mediate the
conformational state of the protein so
here's the protein with two different
conformations and certain proteins well
I'm calling them Schrodinger's proteins
like for the the quantum guy because
they're like Schrodinger's Kathak and
the electrons the quantum interactions
control the state of the protein and
anesthetic gases get into these pockets
and just acting purely by quantum
interactions well any chemical forces
block consciousness selectively the rest
of the brain is quite active there's EEG
continues except for gamma there's
evoked potentials the only thing that's
missing is gamma synchrony and
consciousness and acting strictly by
quantum interactions and I have a paper
about this in anesthesiology that's on
my website so tubulin the microtubule
subunit is such a protein and has a
large
a nonpolar hydrophobic pocket made of
these aromatic rings so we've model it
as a as a switch so if the electrons are
in this direction it's in this state if
they're in this direction it's in this
state and they go back and forth between
the two states something like that okay
so where's the Bing so let's say I'm
right that that competition goes down
the level of tubulin subunits inside
neurons you have 10 to the 28th
operations per second how does that
explain consciousness good question
I'll come back to that in a second but
just to be complete here we've talked
about dualism we've talked about
materialism
another possibility is idealism that
mind generates matter Bishop Berkeley
actually Aristotle had something about
this that we project mental qualities
onto the world and of course Indian
mystics idealistic would say that
mentation creates the world around them
so idealism is another possibility but
let's say we don't like that we don't
like materialism we don't like dualism
there's another possibility called
neutral monism that was put forth by
Spinoza than William James Bertrand
Russell that there's some underlying
something that that gives rise in one
situation to matter in one situation to
mind and I like this one and we'll come
back to that in a second so here's an
anesthetic sensitive Schrodinger's
protein but because these are quantum
interactions mediating its
conformational state that means it
should also be in quantum superposition
of both states at the same time and and
therefore these proteins can act like a
quantum bit or qubit in a quantum
computer and the same the same type of
electron resonance activity and these
aromatic rings they're called for
example tryptophan and phenylalanine and
so forth
also govern the activity of psychoactive
drugs and I'll come back to that in a
second but the model that Penrose and I
developed basically takes a microtubule
and says each of these subunits is a
qubit and the microtubules are quantum
computers and this type of quantum in
Turin may be required for brain wide
gamma synchrony according to Freeman and
Vitiello who show that there's really no
other explanation for front-to-back
left-to-right Gamma synchrony that's in
some kind of quantum
long range dipole correlations mediated
my quantum interactions between the
proteins so the psychoactive drugs all
have all have aromatic rings much like
the the hydrophobic pockets and they're
they're complex highly aromatic
nonlocalized rings so again back to this
I'm saying it's quantum Internet and the
quantum interactions say in this neuron
can spread by tunneling to the next
neuron the next neuron next neuron and
perhaps through the whole brain by these
gap Junction mediated hyper neurons okay
well where's the Bing Roger Penrose came
up with the idea the consciousness is
linked to quantum gravity that is
fundamental space-time geometry and when
he first came up with this in 1989
people he was like he was from another
universe or something what the hell was
he talking about and I at this point I
had been working on microtubule
information processing for 20 years and
people kept saying essentially well
where's the Bing how does that explain
consciousness so I read his book and I
thought he had some some very
interesting ideas he basically said that
quantum superpositions which avoid
decoherence grow to me threshold given
by the indeterminacy principle undergo
spontaneous self collapse objective
reduction a fundamental moment of
consciousness and the consciousness is a
sequence of these types of quantum state
reductions this is very much like Alfred
North Whitehead occasions of experience
and Henry Stapp has a somewhat
comparable idea so basically we go back
to the idea that a tubulin is a qubit
and flips between two states it can be
in a superposition of both and interact
with others and the gray turbulence here
are those in quantum superposition they
grow and evolve and eventually reach
threshold between step six and seven and
this has a subjective reduction and by
penrose definition this is a moment of
consciousness here now applying this to
the brain at large for gamma synchrony
since we're using equals H over T if we
set T equal to 25 milliseconds for 40
Hertz gamma synchrony this requires
quantum superposition of turbulence in
roughly a hundred thousand neurons
so this did Riddick Webb would change
topology because gap junctions can open
close and change with every conscious
moment so the basic idea is that we have
over 25 milliseconds of buildup of a pre
conscious quantum superposition reaches
threshold for now a conscious moment and
that's a moment of consciousness and a
sequence of these would look like this
quantum information can go backward in
time to avoid the epi phenomenal problem
and consciousness is a sequence of these
individual moments which are actually
rooted in quantum mechanics so what does
it mean if something could be in two
states at the same time in addition to
to dealing with the problem of
superposition Roger addressed what it
means for something to be in two states
at once and you know the multiple worlds
hypothesis that says that every time
there's a superposition space-time
separates and forms to another universe
a separate universe
well Penrose starts off by saying the
same thing if we have a cartoon here of
space condensed on one dimension and
time so an object a state in one state
would be say into the screen and in
another state another position out from
the screen and a superposition is a
separation or a bubble or a ripple if
you will in fundamental space-time
geometry but unlike multiple worlds
which would branch off and form a new
universe the separations are unstable
and after time T given by this equation
will self collapse to one or the other
in a fundamental unit of conscious
experience occurrs that was the Penrose
basically the Penrose idea with how
consciousness actually happens so the I
if you put in the context of of neutral
monism and replace underlying something
and Spinoza thought that's underlying
something was god but if you say it's
quantum space-time if a measurement of
decoherence occurs you have matter if
objective reduction occurs you have
matter actually matter and mind both
over here so this gives an ant ontology
that can explain the hard problem
subjective phenomenal experience so
basically if she's looking at the rose
and yes there's a pattern of activity in
the brain but the
reason she has the qualia the experience
of redness is that the particular
space-time geometry that correlates with
redness is being reproduced in her brain
this is a pan experientialism or pan
proto psychism applied to two modern
physics now what did what does
space-time actually look like it it's
obviously we don't know for sure it's at
the Planck scale its approachable
through string theory quantum gravity
twister theory we don't really know but
it looks something like this and string
theory and loop quantum gravity gives
sort of similar ideas and Penrose and a
number of people Freeman Dyson that
should be David Bohm have said that
precursors of consciousness may be
irreducibly embedded at this level and
as well as platonic values may be
irreducibly embedded at this level like
mass spin or charge and this is
consistent with this various spiritual
beliefs that there's some underlying
giant lookup table in the universe if
you will that can access that we can
access okay so you might say well that
sounds interesting and but but the brain
is too warm everybody knows the brain is
too warm for quantum computation to make
the quantum computer in the brant in the
lad you got to go to absolute zero and
no vibrations and blah blah blah well I
don't think that's true but let's deal
with some of the arguments max tegmark
published the paper criticizing our
theory based on this equation where he
calculated ad coherence time of solitons
on microtubules 10 to the minus 13
seconds way too fast to be of any use
but he omitted all of these caveats and
stipulations we had put in for our model
and we we recalculated Hagen and and
Kaczynski myself in the same journal he
published and got down to 100
milliseconds or longer for based on
theory and the characteristics of
microtubules have that can protect it
are they have these charged tails that
stick out in every tubulin forming a a
plasma the bilayer plasma a shilling or
cloaking microtubules and also the
quantum london forces are inside the
tubulin protected from the environment
and the microtubules can be embedded by
acting gel which also isolates it
isolates from the environment so
microtubules seemed
have had these possible mechanisms as
well as that the fibrin the Fibonacci
pattern of the lattice of the winding
patterns may be ideally designed for
topological quantum Eric error
correction which could extend the
quantum lifetimes indefinitely
now here's various patterns you use the
AHA Rona Bohm effect to follow different
patterns and you get a very very robust
qubit so the idea is that these patterns
would be the qubits rather than each
individual tubulin so if one tubulin
gets knocked out of deep knocked out of
coherence gets pulled back in by by the
others theory is nice but what about
evidence well in a beautiful paper last
spring in nature angle at all found
evidence for weight this is the title of
their paper evidence for wave-like
energy transfers and quantum coherence
and photosynthesis and here's a photo
synthesis apparatus inside the gray as
the chlorophyll and the yellow is a
protein scaffolding holding the
chlorophyll and they found clear
evidence for quantum coherence in this
protein scaffolding surrounding the
chlorophyll in photosynthesis at
significant warm temperatures so
photosynthesis is using quantum
coherence to make the food we eat so it
seems logical that the brain might do
something similar to for information
processing and also a yang an out salome
in 2003 study an interesting system of
quantum dots and the green and the red
connected by these same aromatic rings
that we found find inside proteins and
make up psychedelic drugs and so forth
they found quantum superposition of
quantum spin transfer between these the
dots connected by these benzene rings
and as far as temperature they found
that as they increase the temperature
from 0 degrees and about 80 degrees
Kelvin they got to this jump in spin
transfer efficiency that persisted out
to brain temperature so it's not true
that that that heat is necessarily the
the enemy of quantum coherence and
biological system the biology may be
using the energy to pump coherence like
a laser a laser is a is a warm quantum
device also so conclusions brain
processes underlying consciousness
extend downward to computation in
microtubules within neuronal dendrites I
think it's very nice
to think that a spike is the fundamental
unit of information if you think that's
a case and please explain how Paramecium
can learn find food find mates have a
sex life without any synapses gamma EEG
synchronized dendritic input integration
layers what we're calling hyper neurons
or dendritic webs are the functional
neuronal network architecture for
consciousness these are part and parcel
of the feed-forward feedback on neuronal
networks that we're all accustomed to
looking at they're just you just connect
the input layers basically you make the
input layers laterally connected and
that's a whole new area for computation
which gives rise to consciousness the
result of those computations can trigger
spikes and and have responses quantum
computations in these dendritic web
microtubules are coupled to gamma
synchrony EEG by Penrose objective
reduction so you have the self collapse
after 25 milliseconds and that's what
causes the the terminates the the
computation and condition initiates
spikes and finally consciousness is it
to solve the hard problem to solve the
problem phenomenal experience I think
you have to say that consciousness is a
process in fundamental space-time
geometry coupled to brain function and I
have explanations for all this on my
website so just to conclude let me just
say that that Penrose suggested that
photonic information embedded in the
Planck scale geometry buffet pervades
the universe this is platonic
information in terms of mathematical
truth and other information and it's
accessible to our conscious processes
and the only thing comparable to that I
could think of was Google
so I'll close and with a plug for the
the conference we have every two years
and Tucson coming up this coming April
this one should be a particularly good
one and I hope you all come thanks a lot
for your attention
I don't know whether all animals would
be conscious but you can ask the same
question well the the skin the skin
cells on my butt have microtubules why
isn't my butt conscious I've had the
same question posed to me and and the
answer is that that you need that that
anything will have a conscious moment if
it avoids decoherence and / and by e
equals H over T a single electron in
superposition isolated from decoherence
would have a conscious moment but only
after 10 million years so the
microtubules in your skin cell or some
other tissue number one would have to
have the the apparatus to avoid
decoherence the actin gel and all the
other things which it may not have but
even if it did it would it would have to
take a long long time it probably
something would happen in between so
only in the brain do you have say a
hundred thousand nor the microtubules in
a hundred thousand neurons in
superposition so that the self collapse
can occur in 25 milliseconds
thirteen confirmation
well I think I think memory launcher
memory is stored in the cytoskeleton in
the microtubules in the neural filaments
which are very very stable there they're
embedded it in amongst the microtubules
and other structures there's no good
explanation I mean if you say memory is
is is recorded in the plasticity of a
given synapse the synaptic receptors
turnover from hours to days and that's
all regulated by the microtubules so I
think memory has to be and it's been
shown that in learning paradigms the
dendritic architecture mediated by the
microtubules inside the dendrites
changes so memory would I would say is
me is is stored in the cytoskeleton
microtubules and neuro filaments
both both I would say if you don't have
the self collapse there's no
consciousness so a computer can have a
gazillion switches and bits if it
doesn't have this collapses and it'll
never ever be conscious an electron
could have a conscious moment after 10
million years but the equals is also
equal to the intensity so the intensity
to be extremely low so as he becomes
greater say in our human brains we've
evolved you know to have a hundred
thousand tibula tubulins and a hundred
thousand neurons in superposition to
reach threshold fast enough to have 40
or 80 and if your meditator or whatever
per second so not only having more
conscious moments per second the
intensity is greater so more intense and
more frequent and more frequent relates
to you know if you're if you're in a car
accident the car is spinning everything
slows down well maybe you're having more
conscious moments per time plus a higher
slope some more intense somebody asked
Michael Jordan how he could be so good
in basketball he said well the other
teams in slow motion when I'm playing
well maybe he's having more conscious
moments per time than the defense so
it's it is discrete it's you have to
have equals H over T if you don't have
that then you're not conscious but it's
like a photon you can have a low energy
photon or a high energy photon so a high
energy conscious moment would be high T
sorry high e brief T and a low intensity
to be the opposite
every team well they would have to get
super position isolated from the
environment so it's unclear that if
you're asked I don't think I mean Henry
step says the universe is is is his
wavefunction but I don't think that
works you have to you have to ISIL have
isolated super position maybe I'm not
understanding your question I think well
if you go another 12 orders of magnitude
you're definitely going to get down into
the into the quantum regime but I don't
think that would do it I think if you
need this objective reduction then you
need to have super position mass and if
you do it with no luck with a silicon
computer where the let's say the the
states are electrons electron the mass
is so low that it would take nearly
forever to reach threshold you just have
a lot of electrons I think the only way
to have a conscious computer
technologically would be something like
fullerene technology because fullerene
if you could somehow make nanotubes into
computers in superposition you have
significant mass there it's still a lot
less than proteins but you can make up
for that in other ways so I think if
this idea is right the only possible
quantum computer that would become
conscious I mean even a regular quantum
computer wouldn't come conscious I think
you would need something where there's
significant mass in superposition
possibly using fullerene technology
necessary cycles complexity because I
mean it to think it's not complex it's
intense but I I don't think it's just
complexity because there are a lot of
complex things that aren't necessarily
what gives you consciousness is this
self collapse according the Penrose
model I think that's you know I'm I'm
biting the ontological bullet because if
you say that if you have critical level
complexity is conscious well some people
say well there's here's a system that
has equal complexity how come that is
unconscious or are you saying it's
conscious I'm saying if you have this
type of collapse it's going to be
conscious I have to bite the analogical
bullet and say well if an electron is in
superposition it'll have a conscious
moment but only after ten million years
the brain is is is evolved so that we
can have a large system in superposition
isolated from the environment that
mediates information that's connected to
inputs and outputs it's it's really
amazing that for me in some recent work
with a rodent model of Alzheimer's
disease they developed an antibody which
cleared the brains of the amyloid plaque
presumably it did not affect the tubulin
inside their neurons their function was
largely restored
I'm skeptical about that because you
know every couple years they have a new
a new drug for Alzheimer's
for example cholinergic agonist because
most of the neurons involved are
cholinergic could give something that
makes asset ill : last longer they get
better marginally so I have to see the
studies but beware of claims that that
help to treat Alzheimer's because
there's a lot of money involved I would
I don't I have to see that I have to see
the studies but I would say just getting
rid of the amyloid plaques would not
would not solve it
so this used to suggest the tantalizing
possibility that we might one day give
some kind of artificial system that
would plug into the brain superposition
and maybe make it so that your
consciousness could migrate outwards and
then be taken away well maybe but you
know interfacing you know it's a quantum
system you can't interface whether you
interface whether you destroy it so well
we do that all the time I mean I mean
the other way to ask that question is is
well how do you interact with a client
how does the quantum system which has to
be isolated have inputs and outputs so
if you go back to that that slide I
showed of the of the waves like that
at the bottom of the wave if you're in a
classical phase
so you're alternating between classical
quantum classical quantum classical
quantum classical quantum forty times a
second
during the classical phase you have
inputs and outputs but in that
integration phase it's strictly quantum
so the interactions are punctuated every
25 milliseconds what do you think of the
possibility is it inherently impossible
or if you know other words if you
connected to an external system during
the classical phase and then the whole
thing ran into superposition together
and in a superposition collapse your
quantum your your mind basically would
migrate no there's some probability into
the external place well I I think that
there can be quantum entanglement
between people I think that you know I'm
not an advocate of parapsychology or
near-death experiences or things like
that but if if they occur and I think
there's some very interesting suggesting
that they do occur the only possible
explanation is some kind of quantum
effects some kind of type of quantum
entanglement between people over time
space that sort of thing assumption that
consciousness
privileged state how would you go about
demonstrating than such a label state as
consciousness it exists so your question
where the consciousness exists yes I
know that's hard to argue I would read
David I would recommend you read david
chalmers book the puzzle of conscious
experience because it's better or John
Searles Chinese room argument or any any
full any number of philosophical
arguments based entirely on someone
blustering and say well of course that's
not consciousness and I don't think
thing in the argument well I mean I may
never convince you I would suggest you
read David Chalmers book on the hard
problem the puzzle of consciousness our
model has many falsifying testable
predictions and falsifiable hypotheses
unlike AI which has yet to produce a
single testable prediction pardon me I'm
not what do you mean by discretes you
mean something unique yes yeah I don't
know that's a good part because but that
that's that I think any Theory is gonna
face is gonna face that but and you can
you know you can you can take the
Penrose girdle argument you can take any
number of arguments against what you're
saying and in the end it's it's arguable
as I said in the first problem with the
singularity so it may be it may not be
possible to prove the existence of
consciousness or exactly how much energy
is in consciousness we have we have to I
published 10 20 testable predictions of
our model okay I have yet to hear a
single testable prediction or false
viable statement about AI producing
consciousness now if you say
consciousness doesn't exist then then
there's nothing to prove anyway and so I
really don't know how to respond
with your hypothesis fit in with deep
ratings observations that the buddies
find previous in time to a phenomena
happening on the computer quantum
mechanics is non-local the wheeler
delayed choice experiment that was
proposed by wheeler years ago was proven
the last couple years and asked Allen
aspect gave to talk about this in
Arizona and I said well does that prove
that that quantum information can go
backward in time and he said yes
unfortunately it does it does prove that
so and that that solves a problem of
deliberate experiments because of a
backward time referral and can also
rescue us from being at be phenomenal
because we have conscious decisions in
real time so well there's one more over
there shoe quit we got a quick Oh was it
one over there
studies done with humans who can after
the after being in a certain state tell
you what if they were conscious or not
but doesn't that immortality and you you
were talking about earlier paramecium's
not having gas alright I don't think any
game of synchrony for consciousness as I
said an electron can be conscious but
the T would be ten million years gamma
synchrony just just has happens to be
where our brains work optimally you can
have you could have conscious moments
and alpha at ten per second but there
would be much less intense so there's
nothing magical about the gamma
synchrony but it's a way of of
coordinating all the quantum quantum
activities and the tubulins throughout
the brain into one superposition state I
was I was just using them as a as an
example of an intelligent behavior
adaptive behavior that doesn't have any
synapses so if you want to build a robot
you know build one without me without
any connections actually a Paramecium by
equals H over T there would have to be
in superposition and isolated from the
environment for a couple minutes and the
only time like that the Paramecium are
absolutely still and not moving is when
they're having sex so maybe two per
museum fuse together are having a
conscious moment at the end of which it
twice as much mass exactly and when you
think about a conscious experience would
be pretty good incentive for evolution
and procreation
so maybe Paramecium might be kind I
don't know that the conscious not but if
they are them during sex is probably the
best bet for when they are conscious
yeah
