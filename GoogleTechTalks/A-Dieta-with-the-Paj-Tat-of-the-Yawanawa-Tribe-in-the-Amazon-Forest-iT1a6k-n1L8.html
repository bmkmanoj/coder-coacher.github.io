welcome and thank you for joining us and
I wanted to take a few minutes to
introduce bow and this father Paolo and
tell you a little bit why I'm very
excited about this topic now if you are
scientists that you work in areas like
your biology official intelligence
quantum computing and sooner or later
probably like any human or any scientist
you get intrigued with a phenomenon of
consciousness and the new makes a Cigale
realization that the methods of
experimental science are not all that
well suited to study the phenomenon of
consciousness so let me explain this a
little bit so as scientists or when x is
at its best then what you do is you
don't take some old book and you believe
everything that's written in there you
invited to use your own brain to form
your own ideas of course you're most
welcome to adopt some of the notions at
some of the grandmasters that came
before you have developed but ultimately
it's incumbent on you to take your ideas
and then very carefully take a look at
nature and say you stare at the night
sky you see an Apple falling down from
the tree or you look how a plant or a
baby grows and then you see whether your
ideas how using the word is taking
really apply so what this program has
yielded enormous technological successes
but of course if you're really honest
then we realized that our ideas how the
world is really working a fairly feeble
and in particular what scaling is sort
of that this primordial experience your
conscious experience and as Descartes
taught us that's really the only thing
we can be certain of
as an experience everything else could
be some form of illusion that this
primary experience is so fully
accessible by the message about this
program of experimental science for
example if you ask sort of what I think
is a very reasonable question is
consciousness only existing in the
brains of high amendments or is it also
outside of it for example what about a
modern flight control system as it
steers the airplane is it aware of the
sades the airplane is it ask a question
or a tree is a tree is that some faculty
was in a tree that's kind of aware of
its as a moisture content in the ground
or whether it's being attacked by
beetles or not so I think it will not do
you much good then if you were to
calculate something what's example
caused it to known if I measure it was
pretty popular measure a few years ago
to assess or describes the amount of
consciousness in a system but others may
agree but I feel this is somewhat futile
exercise because if you compute the
turn-on if I measure for the flight
controller I cannot see often or imagine
an independent experiment where you
could assess the content and intensity
of the conscious first-person
perspectives as flight controller has
and that's very different to external
observables like speed now there make a
prediction the speed of an airplane I
have a well-defined measurement
prescription to see what the speed is
but intensity content of consciousness
it's not accessible in that way and
that's where saying shamanism and the
yawanawa
come in and they are wisdom that I would
sort of consider a word cultural
heritage
because something you can do is you can
take your own apparatus a pareo see
Portuguese in Portuguese you would call
it you know your own apparatus houses
direct conscious experience you're aware
of and
what you could do is you could change
the configuration of your a pareo and
bring it into an altered state SRC
conscious experience may be very
different and the our Nava have
developed and other tribes in the region
have developed Fuji a lot of techniques
how to achieve this well how you can go
from your default consciousness to an
altered state and get back in a
reasonably safe passage and live to tell
the tale even though I should maybe and
TV shows they always have the sticker
don't try this at home alone so I think
some of the things you are going to see
today as a similar caveat applies but
last comment edit if you go through
these experiences they don't only afford
you with sort of a richer portfolio of
what conscious states of conscious
experience could be like most people
also makes a striking experience that
once I got back say also in a
physiological way feel much better and
healthier than before for weeks to come
and I'm pretty certain that sort of FDA
type studies will confirm but right now
I think it's just a safe hunch to have
and here I went to long enough to know
that once spoke with Undersecretary of
biodiversity it's actually a student of
Richard Evans shoulders sort of the
sidonians is the great American Aetna
botanist from the he was a director of
the Harvard Botanica Institute and this
his student told me that the region we
are talking about is the Gregorio River
in a state of aqua was never never
separate that probably 95 percent of the
plants and plant medicines here whenever
using and not described anywhere and no
books and not characterized so it's it's
really rare and fragile knowledge and I
think it's a very implication that sort
of that these many of these substances
carries the term medicine and and
first-hand experience tells you why is
this
fear in our culture we still have to
come to grips with the implications of
the fact that these medicines they don't
only work on a physiological level but
it goes hand-in-hand and maybe the only
work because there's also a katatak
mental psychological element to the use
of the functioning of these substances
so with this I want to hand it to shut
down Melo a salsa is the full name and
young man growing up in in Rio de
Janeiro and he is like many of us here
is studying engineering and he is
particularly interested in in forest
management and sustainability in civil
engineering and construction and also
Social Inclusion aspects this is a board
member of NGO called indigenous
celebration that sets up projects to
help protect the of Inaba culture and
the rainforests it depends on and Rodin
had sort of an interesting upbringing in
the sense that he is the grandson of a
revered religious leader in Brazil
Padrino or Sebastian Mota email oh he is
a leader in the center diamond tradition
and also his father he continued this
lineage here too among many things to
his credit one important achievement was
that he organized and let the scientific
Commission that convinced the Brazilian
government to legalize ayahuasca for
religious and ceremonial purposes in
Brazil a little bit similar like the
Native American church in South America
and the US I should say is permitted to
use Peorians their ceremonies so was
this I'm very curious to hear from the
two of you about the experiences during
the diet ax and so now it gives a tarp
but Paulo often referred to as he
ambassador to the Amazonian people
because I feel many of these contacts we
Bo Paulo and the thing only because of
sort of this family heritage
Jordao was admitted
and was led into some of their most
intimate knowledge so yeah you will be
the v-j as in controlling the
presentations and shut down with is a DJ
controlling the sound okay so thank you
hard mood for your kind presentation
what your kind introduction and I would
like to say that I'm really happy to be
here and to speak at Google for me this
looks like a temple of an advanced
knowledge of high tech and innovation so
if you're really honored to be speaking
here about the mysteries of the Amazon
so my first contact there with the
Amazon Indians whereby the yawanawa
people it was when Phi J yahwah yeah for
sure
for people that doesn't know his family
translation for shaman
so Paje yawa visit our community in rio
de janeiro with his group and bajalia wa
is one of the various people never had
the chance to meet at the time I was 15
years old and Paje yawa was 97 years old
and I when I start talking to him I will
start noticing the amount of energy the
amount of joy and the amount of
knowledge that he has an is capable of
transmitting these in such a natural way
so we invited a human there his group to
present their traditions for us so we
did a ceremony where we will take you
need also know as ayahuasca and I doing
this ceremony with intake of this
medicine you enter in a state of
visionary experience and in his visions
he saw
in the mountain in front of our house an
ancestor spirit of old engine and
connected with the spirit and called the
spirit to do a special healing work for
my father that at the time was suffering
some serious back problems so we did is
another ceremony a mark closed with just
my family and their groups and after the
this work he did and my father all his
back problems were gone and this got me
really impressed and I have started
having more interest about bajalia WA
about their culture about their people
in the same ceremony an alliance was
formed between our spiritual community
and their people in this so they invite
us to meet their place to meet their
forest their people and it was when a a
few months after once I travel together
with my father to experience their
festival is a festival that is done once
a year to celebrate the old all
traditions and ancestors this festival
during the days so before explain a
little bit where it is destroyed is
located in ugly the Brazilian state
inside the Amazon forest it took us
three days from near de Janeiro to the
village including two flights a truck
drive and a boat trip seven seven hours
of a boat trip upriver getting deeper
and deeper into the Amazon forest once
we arrived there for the festival doing
the base the first ball has a lot of
games and their traditional games and
dancing and chanting so we was for me
experience to get to know the young
generation how they how they interact
the most of them completely speak
Portuguese so I was able to fully
connect and interact with them
and at the night the nights are reserved
for their ceremonies their spiritual
ceremonies
whereas doesn't take off only into that
moment from from I have already heard a
lot about visionary experience I have
read something but I could never really
trust or believe those experience just
by hearing something is similar what
Hartmut was telling ya when it comes to
something like this you need to
experience by herself so we was then in
2009 when I was 15 years old that I had
my first visionary experience with the
Madsen's the way the ceremony works they
have a big circle where they dance
there is a big fire and a spot for them
to to be seated now I took the the only
and start dancing with them I was with a
straw skirt all painted and with a
Markov feather dress yeah so at the time
that I was dancing I will start feeling
kind of dizzy and and getting caught by
the farce of the medicine so I decided
to go take a seat as I was going to take
a seat my feather dress were a bit loose
so we fell in front of me as if there I
closed my eyes once I closed my eyes the
feather dress in the visionary straight
state transformed into a mock off the
spirit of a macaw and this spirit I
started flying hovering around me nap in
circles and in those circles women start
establishing a connection where I was in
her and she was in me and once this
connection will stab
I could see through its eyes and
suddenly the macaw got its claw and
ripped the air so we whip the air in
open up a tunnel of light of energy of
colors and we entered together on that
and together in this trip the the spirit
of the animal will start sharing many
things with me out of that I was I had
an aerial view of the village something
that I have never seen on pictures or
movies before so we will start getting
closer and closer to a guy that was
facing the other way and at the moment I
realized that God was me I woke up from
that experience completely impression
and not knowing well what I was going
now so during this festival this week I
could really interact with the people
there with nature and with cosmos so
once I got back to to the city and I
started seeing the the difference that
the seven days have done for me then in
those seven days I experienced a new way
of existence now a new way of
interaction with amongst my even the
relationship with myself with the others
yeah with nature and with the Creator so
once once I will start processing that I
realize how that tribe how that place is
a source there of experience and
knowledge that that can take you to some
new some new idea comprehension about
yourself about the your environment
about the word how how how it functions
I will start sharing this with some
friends from Brazil Canada us and I
started noticing the same thirst this
you see the excitement about when I was
sherry day they look really they needed
that too so and of course I needed that
again so but I I got my second trip I
decided to do something different that
the first woe is when they all get
reunited and they they present now where
is their their tradition games and all
this but I was more interested how they
live what's their day by day they are
their daily life and it was then when I
found a group with 12 young people and
we went again to the Amazon forest
during that time we were able to without
Wi-Fi apps internet all this we were
able to fully detached from civilization
so in this open up created a whole new
space for situations in interactions
with the people there with nature and
their spirituality and so they will take
us to do some some daily life activity
such as go for to get some food or or
how tresor or take a walk and in those
experiences such as a go fishing for
example and tawa who my Indian friend he
invited me to go fishing with him so I
will away the whole day and he was okay
that night he came and saying what about
the fishing like I was waiting for you
you you think I'm ever so I know we're
going out and he handed me a machete and
a flashlight this was already 9 p.m. so
I was like are we going to cut our feet
no we're going to to fish with that so
we went in the night to the the river
there in that season the river stays
really low up to our cow
yeah and we were growing up River
walking with the flashlight and said
with the machete oh just give a little
knot in inhibiter fish hat and throw him
at the bucket I'm not sure it was my
shaky legs or my really heavy steps but
I were able to find no fish and at the
moment I found my first fish I got so
excited that I stroked him so hard he
was splitting in two
I went for the head and the whole body
went away so this this little this
experience that for them are completely
a normal and regular foreigners is
something that is is completely
extraordinary you know for you to to go
there and have this experience and so
this close interaction with nature and
the development of those new skills
grant me the how why we call spiritual
awakening yeah a whole part of myself
that I doing my sea during my whole life
in the city was asleep and in this part
of myself woke up in the mirror of the
forest for my friends each one each each
and single one of them those experience
ignited a whole process of self
transformation and healing and for me as
I was already more used to it but I
United Mia alcoa initiation into my
spirit or development into the medicines
and into their Giada's their diet so it
was then that I in this second trip I
will start paying more attention to the
elders the elders there they have a much
deeper connection with nature and its
vast quantity of night scenes they can
be divided in two basic group
the pushes the shamans that he threw
their spirituality and their mental
medicines and the employee who now it's
why they call the medicine man's that
they heal with the plants and and the
animals and what is in their surrounding
though I had a chest walk with some of
those guys and the impression that I got
is that they see the forest as as a huge
drugstore we were walking for ten
minutes and he'll pick up a leaf and say
this is for something you pick up a root
and say you mix that with this and bits
for that and so in as I was speaking we
were able to experience that our group
that was not used at all to Amazon where
they were in crime we we arrived there
with diarrhea with fever with headache
and as soon as we shared that with them
they they start walking in different
directions and brought something for us
to leave for us to rub and smell and
that really strong smell will go into
our minds and the habit will be born
instantly they brought some roots that
will chew on it and swallow the Jewish
that will help with diarrhea so long
story short in the next day everybody
was a hundred percent that all did the
little diseases that happen through the
process were gone so this is something
that really gives credit to what those
people are saying because they could get
a I ordinarily fanned said this is for
that this is for that and we will never
know yeah so through our experience we
will see how I value it is how much
worth it has this nice culture and so
for for and at the end of the of the
trip they have together with the Indians
because this forest was extremely
you and something we have we didn't
thought about it you what it was for
them the with the contact with white
people it created a big gap between the
generations of the elder and the young
people the young people they speak
mostly Portuguese the the they were more
interested in in in other I'll say other
type of music then they their assessed
or music so so when they saw our group
coming with many skills and we will
start playing music together to teaching
them how to play guitar and audience and
when they saw all those guys we had a
snowboarder that showed a little bit
about how it is to to go into the slopes
and the snow so they start seeing well
those guys come from different part of
the world and they come here to
appreciate what we have so what we have
has value so what we have has as has a
potential and so together with this with
ours knowing we start strengthening the
young generation to keep preserving
their culture to keep living as the
elders to wanna so in these ceremonies
and together with the relationship of
the elders we're able to fully discover
that the extensive amount of masses that
they have the most extensive group are
the plants Madison yeah so they have
plans for every almost every single
situation you may have it you may happen
to you so different allergies nausea the
older they have something they have a
data which they are really proud of that
in in their their people they have never
her about somebody that died from a
snakebite and this is because they have
plans for each type of species now each
type of or of snakes has its own plants
together with this their medicines are
not used only to to treat but also to
facilitate to help their way there they
they have a full section of medicines
for womens they are pregnant so so when
when the time is coming they take some
leaves to help the dilatational process
they have leaves for to go fast and once
the baby's born his first stage with the
Manson's is when he starts crying at
night and all this so they give a
special bath on the children with some
special leaves that guess the baby
really relaxed and uh we had the
pleasure to meet a young boy yeah he's
probably four I will say and he was
uptown and got bit by a really poisonous
snake his mother his mother took him to
to the hospital and they say the only
way out of this would be to cut his leg
of course was devasted with that so she
called any boy who the Matteson manse
and delivered the children to him and so
they did the treatment yeah everything
worked out and a couple months ago I
just played soccer with him so he is a
really really healthy and and and doing
great besides the besides the the plants
medicines they're also the animal
medicines and probably one of the most
important of those medicines is they
come with the Congo is this frog this
the way the manson works you get the
resin of the
frog and you burn little dots with a
steep just to take the superficial layer
of your skin and after you put the resin
on you
this little drink that is on the on
screen is a mainly of juice something
that you drink a lot so when when combo
starts to have its effect now that is
you starts a few your your throat
getting dry it starts to feel your body
temperature ranging it starts to get
kind of dizzy and that's when the
clintons happens now when they start
purging and there's already many studies
about this combo there is some Italian
and Japanese companies trying to do some
some Western drugs to to regulate the
pressure the heart pressure but this
medicine is not just a physical
experience the the the engines that take
the most type of combo the most points
of combo are the hunters the hunters
they have something they call Panama
Panama is when they go hunt the start
racking the deal the whole day and when
they get in really near
accidentally they step on a stick and
this catch the animal to run away they
go and shoot but misses they so when
they are not able to bring food home
they know they have the Panama there is
kind of a bad luck so during this they
set up their intentions to do in the
process of the cleansing they say that
this can be staying you so once you
emerge that you're opening your race and
then this is something they always do
first thing after the konbu there
without looking at nobody without saying
nothing to nobody they go to hunt
most of the time with some big deer song
another imagine is called son hunger
Sunanda is a general term for eyedrops
there is seven type of scenarios and
with different uses most of them are
based on vision accuracy for hunting
they are also used in ceremonies to open
vision and are also used to treat bad
headaches and convulsions there in the
tribe
so there's there is in this great
extensive quantity of nasan's there is
more group that they call the Sacramento
medicines is the man since the you they
are used by the Pasha's those medicines
they believe they were the first one to
be discovered so talking about first
they will meet also that I mentioned
before so noise ayahuasca they only for
them is their main medicine that and is
made by is a tea made by a vine which
they call only and that needs to be
smashed in a leaf they call Kawada
together with this they mix that put
water and this tea is made yeah
so this tea and its effect water expands
your consciousness yeah and it gives you
extra sensory or perception is their
main connection with the spirit or realm
is their main connection with the
spirits of the forest and it's important
to most most studies that were done
about this medicine would classify as a
loose inorganic so after and this is
important for us to what is something
that it doesn't generate any kind of
audio visual hallucinations that it puts
you into a visionary state what they
call in theoretical or you have
experience with the sacred so as
sherry you close your eyes and you start
having this huge experience but as soon
as you decided to open your eyes yeah
these all these visions they stopped yes
for the whole period of the ceremony you
know who you are
you know where you are you know what
time you are so there's there's this
distinguish between Alison o Janek and
nto janicoo together with only there's
the happy is a snuff made with tobacco
in a bark of a tree called soon OOP
didn't snuff doesn't get you any visions
but it puts you into a higher state of
connection of concentration of mental
accuracy that and is used mostly in
their spiritual works and their healing
spirit of works and also for cleanses as
well well the snuff is blown by this
this tubes called TP or there's the
individual also called creepy now and
it's man chest with the bones of their
sacred animals last but not least is the
spot supplies imagine that is a resin of
a of a tree this resin you take and you
put it into the coast and it generates a
white smoke was the first Walker ever
knew that doesn't hurt your eyes or
lungs and in these moves they do a
special prayer on it to read their
ceremonies so in those ceremonies I will
start paying more attention and I
noticed that what the young people sing
is completely different of what they had
seen the pudgy also seems what they're
seeing but the length the the melody
many aspects you see there's something
different on it I got really impressed
knowing the process that Tata and yahwah
they are the two only one left in the
whole tribe
titania wah I
are also the two oldest people in their
tribe Tata has is coming almost 100
years old and yeah why is this past that
so I will start paying attention how how
engines that can be so rude that are now
is already blind from the two eyes those
people there so how can they have so
much energy we look to you look to them
and you see them kind of sadder you know
that their physical aspect but once you
go talk to them you see there's a boy
inside that body you once you go to do
ceremonies with them they spend the
whole night singing where there is young
people where their side is sleeping and
snoring yeah so this God will really how
they are able to do this how they are
able to preserve their culture reflected
on their songs and their prayers on
their legends and stories yeah and it
was then that I first better have my
first contact with the indigenous
concept of diet the G Attis so the diet
the G artists they can be divided now so
the jet is there they are used to reach
a state of spiritual learning and
personal power development this diet you
need to renounce certain things that you
renounce sweet so of course sugar net
but for them
sweet is fruits any kind of sweet you
renounce meat will nows water and sex to
those deities they can be suffering two
main groups
now there's the renew and say yeah this
first group is when the purge a priest
to you and how he prays to you he gets a
little pot filled up with this many
artists and start singing in a special
way in a different language but a more
deep
into their inter their language and
seeing the whole night sing the whole
night in this pot after that if they end
in this first group to this type of
healing they can they have two two main
goals to cure to heal somebody delhi zoo
now or to transfer some spiritual
knowledge so in this first group the
chatters they are more there their
length is between one to three months
and the second group of jihadis is one
you stop being the patient right because
when you're the patient this one to
three month diet is for you to preserve
and exactly what he put inside you and
the second group is more about being the
doctor now it's more about knowing how
to do that knowing how to enter in
connection with the spirits of the
forest and and in the case of healing
with the spirit of the sickness and how
to work with that now they believe that
every single sickness is related to a
spirit so in that way they diagnose your
your your your sickness by your dream
yeah that's the main diagnose for them
yeah Tata share with me they say you
guys do a blood test and all this for us
is all about their dreams yeah so so and
those those this second group of jihadis
that they are done by the pass the
elders the tau and yahwah would say that
to me with when they are very really
really old yeah why did his Giotto with
65 years old table with 50 years old so
once I started getting to know them of
course I had a lot of interested and I
was planning on something
a Jetta like this but uh at the moment I
was 18 years old
and I was already studying engineer so
my first plan was to graduate and then
enter to I study like that but
concerning to their health and their age
I started seeing how risky it would be
for me to to stick with my university
now that he has been going from 15 years
and I am pretty sure in one form or 50
there then and with losing this precious
opportunity with the the trips that I
have been doing for that I've started
getting to have a feeling of family with
them so they were opening up a whole
opportunity that was unique for me and
so I decided to polish my University and
everything I was doing on my work to
enter in a in a study like this so I
will start preparing we start doing kind
of a strategy so I talk with the people
of the University which was pretty easy
compared to the task of convincing my
father and my mother to allow me spend
four months by myself in those
conditions at the forest but once I did
that once we we talked that I came to
our home we had ceremonies we had an
agreement was formed where Tata assured
me that he would take care of me and so
demo car the diet that I I want to do is
the Mucca diet there belongs to the
second group is a four year now and it
takes a retreat from four months to
reduce retreat you have no contact with
many people with children with noises
without that and Democrat route
something like a potato but really
there is also in the second group know
what the renewal Sheena there is for is
used for experimental knowledge so once
I decided to do that and everything was
cleared I came I went to muten village
which is Tata well Tata leaves once I
arrived there this village a works like
this it has the main village where
everybody leaves and deeper into the
forest it has what they call their
spirit of center is where their
medicines are made where the ceremony's
happens and all this and this is divided
in three different areas the beginner
area there is for people that wants to
have the initial experience that has no
experience at all with the medicines and
once you get to know there's also the
intermediate there is for people they
will do those small diets
then there's the double black diamond
area that is reserved for this type of
of retreat the second group of charities
once I got there now we went to to build
where I will be to build my hood they
believe that for every single one that
will do this type of Chi at a new place
needs to be opened up so we and these
three areas the beginner intermediate
their measure about how deep they are in
the forest so after walking a little bit
we were able to find a good space with a
good stream and it was my my heart was
built so in a gross eighteens I began my
mocha diet and the way the way happens
is you go to that plant the mocha and
you were already selected and when the
Sun is about to set yeah
you go and talk to it as was a spirit in
front of you so you present you
introduce yourself you presents her
intention and you make a special wish
after this you go to her Hut and it was
then that I spend my first night all by
myself in the jungle honestly I had no
clue what to do I eat it was real but I
didn't felt any effect so I decided to
stay in my hammock and once I was half
sleep half awake yeah I could feel my my
ear is kind of decompressing I could
feel my mind get into a different
mindset
I could few many aspects of myself
transforming into that night so I
eventually fall asleep in the next day I
had my first visit and my first meal
so during this diet this yet you cannot
drink pure water so for the formulas
over there I were drinking some some
some a drink me from out of corn and
without any sweet so my first meal it
was this green banana cake now then you
can eat one each day he the absolute has
no taste at all so her cheese pudding
inside your stomach during the first
three days I I didn't had any visit from
Tata and with this special type of food
diet that I was eating my body start
feeling really weak really weak I would
sit up and let me stand up fast
I would start to get dizzy and I came to
a point that I almost couldn't move and
at that point I had no family around
I had no technology around I had nobody
to count with man and this put I started
putting me into a introspection process
where I had to face myself and only
myself doing this three days
after the third date attacking to visit
me he prayed for me but it wasn't a
manioc juice it was a special ink and
when he was spray on and that ink I
drank a little bit and put everything on
me and this he was pretty to open up my
spirit of path he was transferred
transferring around some of the
knowledge he had to me and once he did
that my energy crease and increase and
increase in to a point and to a point
that I could do my ascetic practice so
this is ascetic practice he concerned
about food diet the studies meditation
physical exercises rituals and
ceremonies sessions with the top players
and dreams the food diet how it works is
it starts really restrict at the first
day you can only drink two fingers of
that weed and you can only eat this
banana cake green banana cake and with
time after the first after the first
month you can start to eat fish it was a
tiny little fish there was 90% bones but
for me look like a huge sandwich just by
myself and with and then with the -
going by he started getting less
restrict and to a point that the four
years completed and you can get back to
meet sweet sex and water so in the
studies man he worked like that I had my
place there what I couldn't go out I
could even had a I had in the energy to
do trade I was at the first month so I
needed to be really standing my ground
right there and that I would visit me
Tata would visit me and we went in
ceremonies where in those ceremonies he
will start
explaining to me deeper into their
stories deeper into their players into
their chants and their practice so after
this I would go to my office there was a
clear that I opened up in the forest so
I could extort that now and he can
communicate in Portuguese but for him to
explain such a thing as a healing and
there is so complex is even hard to
speak in their native language it was
too hard for him so I had also the
company of martini martini is his
official apprentice he's obi-wan Kenobi
he he has he speaks fluent the
Portuguese so he was able to make it
pretty pretty simple and for me to
understand and use it so during those
sessions that I introduced me to a new
kind of pre player they don't pray
asking they pre thinking now for
instance if somebody is you they don't
pray asking for this person to get you
they think they think for the person
that is already healed so this is
affirmative prayer during this prayer is
when they use the spod the white smoke
now and they talk really firm but
everybody thinking and this got me
really interested on it now I did a
whole translation and and did that for a
while so the the last of the practice
and that for me was them
I think the most different now is the
dreams I have never had before the
Giotto any type of special dreams or
being lucid feeds and dreams all that
after the intake of the die of the Mucca
and the prayer he did to me it opened up
a whole new
for talking about dreams and for them
they have a special value the dream has
a special value to them their dream is
is a par with the entrance to the
spiritual realm where they can receive
revelations they can meet spirits and
even predict some diseases that could
come during the dreams is where Tata
would see to me to see how was my
performance at I buy it there are some
details that first doesn't have any
importance but for them is in the
details that everything it is so I will
share little bit about my by day why do
so the day began really different that
you used to begin in my my life my day
used to begin foreign minister for my
first university class and that I will
change eat something and go Ronnie and
be there the day there starts why still
dark
so we wake up around 4 a.m. now go next
to a fire that you're supposed to keep
this fire going for the whole process
you're there and there you take some
happier and you start remembering you
start bringing what you have dreamed to
this reality yeah I share that tags like
I had a dream of those people were
chanting something and like what they
are chanting who are those people how
how they are dressed so this this first
time of the day is for you to fully try
to remember it and and put the pieces
together of your dream after this when
the Sun starts rise is the hours of
powers sunset and sunrise and these
hours are reserved for the luau work in
the affirmative prayers now so in those
on those prayers you you burn the spot
and you speak in these affirmative tone
they're thanking for everything you
would wish thank you for the the
we should done once you start your diet
after this I will go to the stream have
a good bath and we go to my office study
unless data would visit me and will go
into the ceremonies for the rest of the
of the evening so I'm still on the
process of the I'm still the jet the
MOCA of course now with seven months now
from my diet and my food diet is being
realized restrict in a way that I can
travel work and I can actually interact
so I will start once I I will start
study what was the main result for me of
the this period never including the
forest so during this this time I could
really encounter with my Higher Self and
this higher since my Higher Self showed
me the accents of life through
renouncing some of those things even
body needs then I was able to comprehend
and understand how how many things are
possible
yeah I will I start to envision the
synchronicity now as I was praying and
asking for something a bird came here
and and then flew and and will stop
right looking at me or our star falling
star I would see so all these will start
making some some some sense to me
somehow and they won't make go well for
me was to see kind of the the the
extension and and how big it is the love
of God the love that we feel inside of
us I could see the love of God in in in
in Tata's wise word in the children in
the chanting of the bird in in
independence of the animals of the
snakes
and this started this this feeling of
love involved to a feeling of gratitude
yeah I really changed yeah with with
that now oh oh my my my identity I was
able to fully comprehend more and we'll
together with this trust on this on my
identity I can do this I can stay
pharmacy in alone in the jungle
I can stay one year holding this this
type of diet and so this started opening
up new horizons for me and this this
feeling of gratitude man was how can I
replace something like this now how I
felt like giving something back yeah oh
how can I help the maximum that I try
will never be even compared with the
whatever received yeah so but at the
same time I needed to do something yeah
I needed to help them in a way so as
hardly mentioned I'm a board member of
indigenous celebration and geo and we
create we develop projects to preserve
and sustain their their traditions the
knowledge and wisdom of the past and
also the protection and conservation of
the reserve that is around 600,000 acres
and so taking taking a look at Amazon
yeah I could I could really see this
forest now as a huge library yeah that
each single plant and animal has a story
to tell and a use for it
yeah but this this forest this library
was on fire yeah there was only four
people taking care of the of the library
and this starts to shook me now the
spirits that I have
would my son or with the generations
after me who's - same opportunity yeah
so for me the solution so once once I
started seeing this yeah and seeing how
big that the problem is in Amazonia how
is this problem that that is burning
such a library now
so the mayic illogical function of
Amazon is the biotic fund it takes from
the Atlantic Ocean for the 20 billions
of tonne of vapor of water transformed
this into a aerial flying rivers now the
travels thousand a thousand of miles
delivery rain and humidity do the 20% of
deforestation plus 20% of the greedy
areas this biotic pump is not working so
much that is by these five rivers I
started to shrink as we can see this
taking planetary consequences as we can
see here the droughts in California the
excessive rain in the Amazon and the the
lack of rain in cities that some Paulo
so for that now how how how is that our
way out and for me now I what I what I
conclude is supporting in fortify the
community of indigenous people they were
there for the last 10,000 years and in
they were who interact with it without
destroying in a total sustainable way
and so they're the great environmental
masters but unfortunately to the contact
with white people they were starting to
lose their identity and old habits so -
so we started with
together with indigenous celebration
developing there some projects that will
help preserve their culture first one
was the empowerment of the woman's
association yeah
we created a online store but people
from each part of the planet could buy
those products so bracelets art crafts
all this there was also where we're
working right now is the sustainable use
of forest with wood residues in order to
do rustic furniture so what is that the
the the trees of Amazon not the huge
trees the the root are not so so
vertical as the the nutrients are in the
ground their model is not lis so with
with a regular wheeled many of those
huge trees fall down naturally and it's
based on that that we would use these
resources that had completely no
interaction of man and used to something
else doing the furniture doing my
process there in the gieta
a traditional school was formed based on
this generation gap the leader the chief
of Mattoon that is the only woman chief
of the whole tribe she decided to create
this where the children they stay there
for a whole month and they are
completely prohibited to speak
Portuguese so they are in their language
they are started to have lessons and
classes about their traditions their
education and how to behave and it was
really nice to see that many of the
troublemakers the little kids they will
spend the day just doing bad stuff they
went into this traditional school they
were the most creative
an active students there so it's already
a great result that is coming the this
not helping just the kids now the elders
used to feel really isolated yeah
they had so much knowledge about
themselves about what it is to be a
yawanawa and they so completely no
interaction now with their kids or their
grandsons so this is a project that is
benefiting the whole tribe together with
this we have the video game and about
yawanawa culture in a VR experience a
virtual reality experience of
sightseeing of their daily life and at
that time I would like to invite our
indigenous celebration present to speak
a little bit about this project
thank you sir Adele so first I just like
to mention that our mission and
indigenous celebration is to facilitate
the transfer of wisdom between
indigenous peoples and the modern world
and we're doing this through a
celebration of culture with that
strategy were able to empower indigenous
peoples in two very important ways the
first is economic by having these
sustainable revenue streams were able to
economically empower the people which is
absolutely critical to a community's
ability to protect their lands from
deforestation threats the second way is
a cultural empowerment by creating these
revenue streams through a celebration of
culture were able to impart a sense of
the value of what it is that they truly
hold they're the value of their wisdom
their their knowledge and their culture
so we're very excited to explore the use
of different technologies to develop
these remote culturally immersive
experiences through virtual reality
augmented reality and gaming experiences
since this will exponentially increase
our ability to reach people far beyond
how many people we could physically
bring into
village so what we're currently working
on developing is a gaming experience
that tells the ancestral legends
traditionally passed down orally from
generation to generation
we're discovering that through gaming we
can effectively preserve the language
which is currently at threat of
disappearance due to this generational
gap that jordão has already mentioned
and we're able to transmit these
ancestral teachings that were always
only passed down orally so by gamifying
storytelling were able to create
interactive experiences that will engage
people cross-culturally will create
bridges and most importantly it will
create an awareness around what is at
stake here
what is that stake of being lost if we
don't consciously begin to fortify the
indigenous people's their culture their
wisdom and their specific knowledge and
in harmony with nature study after study
finds that the most effective and most
economic way of preserving the forest is
to simply empower the people that have
been living there for 10,000 years over
that period of time they've really
developed a specific knowledge about
their own home and it makes them far
more qualified than any other
environmental group that might be
stationed there to do that same
conservation work and finally I would
just like to mention that perhaps the
most underrated strategy to combat
climate change is to end deforestation
so protecting the remaining forests by
empowering the indigenous peoples will
save more carbon from our atmosphere
then all of our efforts to implement
green you know energy technology and cap
industrial emissions combined so with
that I'll turn it back over to jordão
thank you very much thank you very much
so I would like to end my talk with a
invitation you there watching me right
now now I invite you to close your
computer stand up and come to help us
home to experience come to two
visit our tribe coming to meet Tata to
experience the Manson word and see by
herself
why I'm talking yeah we need help to
take this project to develop those
projects so you have connections you
have yes so I feel that my job here nice
to do the bridge between those
indigenous people and the right people
so what we are doing together with
indigenous celebration and to create a
concert to share their sacred music and
this concert will happen here in u.s. in
Miami and possibly California and also
New York so this concert is made by the
the kids the young generation there I
studied there into the traditional
school so this for our main goal is not
only to share this experience but also
put them to to see from their own eyes
their how value is their culture
so I used to be a chemist and in
chemistry there's a field called natural
products chemistry which is basically
the science of looking at plants and
animals things like this and sort of
trying to you know extract compounds
from them that have medicinal purposes
and I know a lot of people do this but I
feel that a lot of their their
approaches is somewhat blind and that
they sort of you know just go and
collect plants from the forest without
any sort of particular direction and it
certainly sounds like from your talk
that there's a lot of wisdom in the
indigenous communities ma'am it's all
about specifically which plants can be
used for which purpose is so I'm
wondering if there are any efforts maybe
through the Brazilian government or any
nonprofits which you know try to
actually sort of characterize some of
these medicines scientifically sort of
you know connect natural products Tenace
among the government there's not much
there is being done yeah but there is
also some foundations there for instance
the the will become boy the frog that
they're doing a whole research on how to
use it and all this and the plants the
problem is that the people who has this
type of knowledge here they are not so
well connected to - to the indigenous
community right there so a few that is
they is the main block why this haven't
happened yet so what for sure is is is
something that we will be working on - -
I'll say categorize that somehow and
possibly expand something that we were a
little bit concerned is about the whole
thing of pattern and and and then so
first approach to that will be to do
this in their language
and what they decide to share with us
that English we need to respect because
most those dos nipper who this mess of
Manson's they if you appear there he
haven't never seen you in his life but
if you're sick he'll treat you and he
will take care of you but to teach you
is a whole different thing now there's a
abundant issue to be made in their
culture they just teach for relatives
for their son or their son-in-law so to
have this kind of but I'm sure that this
is this will advance blue Pope somehow
we we have a rally somebody that he is
stirring this here in Western University
and he is really interested in in doing
this experience right there so I believe
that for the next year then this will
starts to to get in in process I just
had a question about because the focus
of this of this NGO is says the yawanawa
and I'm just I was just wondering if
there's any plan to liaison or sort of
interact with other indigenous rights
organizations like around around the
Americas and around the world
yeah because I see our inju is a stew
baby
then it's it is born but is still a baby
so we're starting small we buy the
connection that I have with this tribe
we decided to to focus on this tribe but
of course as we get bigger and we start
growing now we will like to interchange
herb because is a indigenous celebration
so everything that is indigenous is our
field of work we have already had
contact with some persons of other
foundations that would like to you know
share experience and work together where
this is to also in in process it's been
widely known that big pharmaceutical
industries have been fattening or trying
to patent plants in the Amazonian
rainforest which shouldn't be countable
what is the position or what can be done
about the knowledge of the francais
yawanawa tribe and others that have this
old gnosis or knowledge about the
healing plant medicines and how that can
be protected because it seems like the
synthetic medicines of big pharma is
been mostly damaging the consciousness
of humanity and what would be a process
to stop that and to wake people up in
regard to having companies steal what is
not theirs
yeah so I see the worry I believe that
could be done is the connection now of
people being aware that this works as
well because living here they know that
the engine street will treat themselves
with the plants and audience pura is
really superficial yeah there is no much
deep intimate so why I believe is for us
to as was something similar that he was
pointing out for us to study now this
process of instead of us getting the the
physical aspect or the the chemical
compound or we could do a the what they
call Nepali now is the garden of
they have a place there the elders we
take we'll go travel and find these
mansions and bring and and and and it
starts to collect and categorize that
somehow so I don't have so much
knowledge about the pharmaceutical area
but I believe what can be done there to
to to heal that that situation is to let
people know that this alternative
medicines exist now is not something
there is there are on the legends
something there is choose today as your
don't said forest is burning thousands
of species we are facing a real mass
extinction nowadays not only in Amazonia
but all over the world that's what's
going on so so the most important now is
to preserve the knowledge that was
acquired during the last ten Millennials
in Amazonia and this knowledge is
disappearing because badges are very old
they died young people are not so
interested now as you're doing his group
when they're and motivated the new
people Jose to start to study hardwood
when they are to and started a house a
with the Google gifted program we could
support the formation of new seven
patches young people so most important
now Peter is to preserve the knowledge
assuring that will be transmitted to the
new generations through oral tradition
that's the key point
maybe last question
thank you shadow some doctors take
people to the Amazon to help them with
different conditions and also
specifically addictions and I wonder
what type of free treats are available
and it is also something that's inside
was a you know in our projects you know
promote yeah this is happening but you
know isn't in a small-scale because of
the I'll say not so many people has this
contact even though the engines have
this this power to to treat something
like that those those hard type of
addictions but there's already have been
many results about that together is we
were implementing the Masand into this
treatment now I knew I would say five or
to seven people that have quit smoking
with the hopper and it's something that
it was in kind of a swap of addictions
yeah he used the hopper that contains
the nicotine of the tobacco and then
gradually was reducing the use of hopper
into a moment that he stopped completely
so I believe that the message has a key
factor of that because mainly unique and
once you drink on me and and and you
start those visions they are not just
like movies or something there is really
entertainment sometimes they go deep
into yourself now they're still showing
things that you don't want to see yeah
so that's the different many people for
instance drink alcohol to forget many
things to burn many things but at the
point they start drinking unique all
this flourish all this comes up they're
wanting or not so is
is a is a different method yeah but for
what I have seen it's pretty effective
oh yes yes yeah let's do next July we
have a big trip to their festival and we
one project here that we didn't mention
that but is the at no tourism there we
want to - because the tribe is just
hoping for other people to come in there
fast
oh so while we're developing to the add
new tourism to open let's say five
people per month or even two just to
begin with something that feel really
comfortable now and E is there's this
part of it there's a there's the whole
hunting marketing of it you know you
cannot go there expecting that I say you
will be served there you're going to a
hotel or something like this is the is
the is the is the way of living in
community in the co-operative system so
our next trip will be in July but thank
you so much in eugenol for this very
fascinating talk and thank you Father
for bringing along supporting us and
thank you for being so attentive
listeners going away past the time
including I see all the guys on the
media conference in to stay be there so
apologies for being a bit over time but
I think it was well worth and thank you
one more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
