join Purdue in 2004 but has a very long
and very distinguished history she has
many different research areas she at
serious is is actually the research
director and she's strongly affiliated
with that group
she has interests in areas of access
control system secure publishing
technique secure broadcast she served on
many many editorial boards she served as
the editor for a scientific I Triple E
security of privacy our Tripoli
transactions on dependable and secure
computing and the list goes on and on
and on were very happy to have her here
today today she's gonna be talking about
digital identity management and
protection so I'll go ahead and hand it
off to her thank you Lisa nice
introduction
okay so I'm very pleased to be at resume
for the first time I am Google so I must
say I'm really kind of excited and
seeing this place so let's get started
with this talk of digital identity
management so and really what I'm going
to do I'm going to first of all kind of
give you my opinion on oh my idea what
is really digital identity management
because you you see this buzzword all
the times really you know I mean a lot
of different things and that's why I
find exciting that the soul area has a
lot of different aspects so you can
really can do a lot of different
research okay and then and after that I
will you know kind of describe with some
researcher we are doing okay and then
I'll outline some ongoing work future
work and so forth so first of all what
is digital identity okay let me say that
now first of all if you think of what is
the identity of a person that is real a
philosophical question to start so I
will not try to define it but in a lot
of people think did you know identity
management is simply single sign-on okay
that is not true
single sign-on is a component of any
solution for digital identity
now my real favorite definition is to
say that digital identity can be defined
as the digital representation of
information known about a specific
individual organization system machine
even devices okay so which means that
typically you can see this as a set of
properties which are digitally you know
kind of recorded concerning a given
individual this may of course include a
lot of different properties like name
address social security number your past
access history your browsing history now
this may characterize you as a as a
portion of your digital identity is
really everything which is known about
you in the digital world okay I like
this definition a lot because it's
really kind of connect this work cut to
my previous work on database management
systems at the end you know you have to
manage all this information of course
what is really important is that this
this information very often as you know
information which is sensitive is
privacy sensitive ok and you know and
you know kind of another as I an
authorized disclosure of this data may
arm individual in various ways so we
need to be very careful and use it and
in a very secure way so in general what
is also useful to introduce is to
distinguish again some you know
introduce different terms the first term
is what is called the name and it
typically gives an individual let's say
an identity under which the individual
can operate with other parties typical
example are login names
other examples are those you know pseudo
names that you want to use one you want
to interact without revealing your real
identities so in this sense we can say
that those names can be strong strongly
bound to an individual or weakly bound
so and if you're not is in a lot of
interaction we will you know emphasize
this again
in other cases really these names
not really have to be linked the to your
real identity because in an auto
transaction maybe the service provider
does not really need to know you who are
very tight so to have some strong
evidence of other properties that you
know you may verify the second important
notion which I will focus more in what
I'm going to say is that the notion of
partial identity so partial identity is
any subset of those properties
characterizing an individual and we
refer to those property as identity
attributes or identifiers and they again
can be classified as strong identifiers
or we identified in general strong
identifiers is a set of identity
attributes which uniquely identify an
individual within a specific set of
individual a weak identifiers is
something which does not uniquely
identify an individual example if you
set the age of a person really this does
not identify a specific individual
unless the set of people you are talking
about as only three people the case may
be very easy okay
however in many cases even a weak
identity may be sufficient you know if
you have to carry a transaction you have
to prove that you have a certain age you
know that may be enough okay so again
partial identities can be bound strongly
or weakly to a real individual so a
really important issue in identity
management is this problem of linkage
authorial in the middle that will have a
lot of inner issues by itself okay so
again here it's just a small example of
you know what we could say like strong
identify her things like social security
number weak identified can be difficult
you know as you probably know better
than me even if an individual only
reveals some weak identifiers
still this set of information may still
allow to link add information to a real
individual so we know all this possible
you know attacks which have led to
development of the anonymization
techniques they were really done because
even though strong identifiers were
removed from the set of release data by
combining this data with others it was
possible to really restrict
a set of possible individuals to which
the weak identifiers could be associated
with also in Sayuri die I'm sure this is
very well known to you identifiers can
be of different nature so we have a
biometrics so biometrics is a very
important you know let's say part of
your digital identity in the sense that
one knows your fingerprint your other
biometric start being recorded that
become part of your digital identity
they pose a lot of interesting issues
there are a lot of you know
misconceptions that people have about
biometric then of you have of course the
things like people ever like talk and
certificate and so far and finally
things that people may know those are
typically faster than a secret okay so I
want to again bring another definition
of digital identity which is a digital
identity is a set of claims in general
that is made by one digital subject
about itself or another digital sound
wise this definition is important
because as this word of claim so in
general what you want to do with this
digital identity attributes not only you
want to manage them to regard them you
know in some user profiles or other
storage for the users which can be
cellular phone or whatever portable
devices by you in many cases need to
verify the declared Stroh okay because
you know you know any individual can
claim you know to have a certain
identity attributes and other cases you
need to verify that so in general is
important to say that in a lot of
transactions you know we have a party
making an exception if we needed to
verify that's why we use also the word
claim of course how do you verify those
claims and there where you have a lot of
solutions and and ideas you know it's
where we do some work but also so this
is a Mausam our initial notions we
needed to introduce another idea here
which is somehow this idea it you you
will not find it
very frequently in papers or solutions
talking about digital identity this is
the problem of validity of quality of
this digital identity this is a kind of
notion which really comes from my data
base background you know in databases
for example you know there are strong
groups doing work on provenance of
information instead for the exotic there
is one such group basically you might
want to know where this information came
from how it has to be modified
manipulated by which application because
also in digital identity remember we are
talking about set of identity attributes
concerning individual you may have the
same problem naturally a lot of problems
come from the fact that those digital
identity information can be inconsistent
so basically we have introduced the two
notion when talking about digital
identity the first one is the notion of
ownership so the idea of ownership is
the following you have an individual
presenting a claim about a digital
identity attributes for example the
individual method this is the social I
am Alyssa Bertina and this is the social
security number or I am I am older than
25 I'm much older by the way but okay
let's okay and then you want to verify
that this individual we say as the
ownership of this identity attribute
which means the owner is an individual
to whom this identity attribute has been
assured by a trusted Authority physical
the social security number has been
issued to me but the social security
number office or an individual who has a
cemeteries action with respect to the
claiming of this attribute in other
cases you may delegate some of your
identity attributes to other individuals
so there must be some evidence of that
so we have this notion of ownership the
second notion is the notion of validity
so validity it goes back if you're
familiar with issues related to data
quality you probably understand the
right way what women it encompasses a
lot of different notion first of all
correctness because okay I may not
present a social security number
but maybe you know this may be wrong
actually so in a way you know so the
dent if I as it to be correct
possibly with respect to the real world
now this problem up is not really when
we directly control our identity
attribute but in general know we I hope
that we when we are asking our social
security number we can click on some you
know digital representation of SS card
for exam process and card and so we know
oh we know how to enter the right number
okay but one of these identifiers are
collected by other parties even though
they are encrypted or whatever you know
that could be mistakes which are
introduced and so there are a lot of
cases and they aware the many times that
the US government has a lot of problems
with inconsistencies in those digital
identity attributes properties of
individual this meant reduce a lot of
problems as you know innocent people in
Oran and ended up being suspected as
criminals in some cases they have maybe
you know the digital identity
information are not really very maybe
are just last name and first name so
maybe that can really share the same
name in other cases that could be errors
so there is a this problem of
correctness also there is the problem
that the information is it to be
up-to-date so a lot of digital identity
information once you have verified that
they are being checked that they are
true forever in a way like your birthday
typically doesn't change but other may
change over times so we are actually
looking at to make a taxonomy classify
this different digital identity
attributes because again you know in our
goal is to make sure that not only the
individual can claim and prove the
certain identity attributes belong to
the more 12 we want also to make sure at
least that the application may have some
idea how good those data are okay now
you may tell you must say you can see
probably from what I'm saying
that I said that the application have to
see how good those data are because
after having worked in security I
realize that as many people know there
is no 100% security at the end okay so
at the end you know
you can be very strong but depends on
what you are trying to do how much you
are going to protect what you have to
protect okay so for example for you know
if the assets are not important so
critical may be you may not bother so
much about the quality of certain
intensity okay so we are also this
notion of validity so basically now we
can come to the know put all these
things together and say what we mean by
digital identity verification so for us
deals basically verified that the
identity attributes claimed by an
individual are honored by that
individual and the second notion is that
we also want to verify that basically
the identity information I have a
certain as a certain level of assurance
okay so what do we like to do is to say
this identity attribute we can tell you
with an assurance for example a a being
the highest level that is really correct
is a good data or we can tell you that
we never verified the series so you can
use you cannot use then this left to the
application to the side okay so for us a
successful identity verification of an
identifier climate of an individual
means that the identifier is valid or at
least there are information about the
validity level of this identify and that
is also honored by that individual so
another important concept that you find
is the notion of link ability okay link
ability easy to do with the fact that
you know okay so we have a disadvantage
the attribute so we can prove that one
part is submitting this identity
attribute is really the owner of this
attribute we will see now how we do this
in our in our approach we can verify
that the identity attribute is correct
for example and those properties can
exist in the panel or on whether those
are identity attributes are really
connected to a real individual or not so
in some cases you may have to prove your
age and provide the strong proof but you
know you don't need to really say to
whom this is linked
okay so link ability is very important
because as you know there are a lot of
techniques in cryptography especially
the anonymous credential techniques
which exactly they try to provide those
credentials without really having a way
for the service provider to link them to
some real individual even within this
world of anonymous credentials there are
various approaches for example some
approaches you can present the same
credential to the same service provider
multiple times and those protocols make
sure that the service provider is not
able to know that those really are
issued by the same individual so you can
do multiple transactions using the same
credential and those who will be seen as
a thief as a transaction by different
individuals okay other credential
systems do not type of this property so
if your use of the same credential which
is anonymous still the service provider
may know oh those are two transactions
by the same individual okay so there are
all all these type of approaches so
again so and as I said before not only
globalink ability between digital
identity attributes with the real
individual we may also have or not a
link ability between different
attributes of the same individual or
even between different views of the same
credential when this is used so let let
me make a small example just to clarify
this notion so suppose we have an
individual was a real name is Bob Smith
that as a digital pseudonym called Omer
at 0 7 so the case 1 so we have done
this you know this kind of matrix that
we use so the first case is the case
when we want to have strongly community
strong identity attribute assurance so
this means that the case 1 arises when
Almer claims to have a certain social
security number in the very file that is
the service provider typically as a
strong assurance that the claim is
correct so this is a real social
security number issued by the US
government and it is really honored by
that individual so it really the one of
Bob's me and also the service
provider 10 is aware that this is linked
to Bob Smith so as a d-link ability the
kinda tool is a case where we have still
strong identity attribute insurance but
we don't have strong link ability with
the real individual this is because when
Armour claims to be a US citizen and the
verifier does not know who is the real
world oh is no individual who is showing
this identity attribute but still the
service provider is a strong assurance
that now that individual is real a US
citizen the other two cases are the
weakest cases in which really the that
can be bought in a week identity
attribute assurance and strong or weak
link ability so this is the case in
which instead there is an uncertainty
that those identity attributes are good
at good quality they really belong to
that individual so the difference
between 3 &amp;amp; 4 is when the verifier knows
with the real individual presenting the
claim however it cannot release this a
claim which I can really trust or not
has not been verified in the case of for
the the service provider the very file
does not even know with the individual
present in the claim of course we are
interested more in the case 1 &amp;amp; 2 okay
but in a way you can say that you know
you can do so much for verifying
identity attributes and those
verifications especially about the
quality D correctness the way they are
related to the application so you are
trying to address okay so of course
there are a lot of interest in this type
of issues a lot of problems for sure
companies have a lot of interest public
sector as a lot of interest because
again you know you start looking at a
huge set of different application for
example we are looking at application
for doing privacy preserving record
linkage by which you have a list of
suspects you know and maybe some
government agency to check whether they
have done
transactions in on around the know
several US banks you want to do those
matches without having to access the
data of the innocent citizen on the
other hand you don't want to know the
bank to know which are the people you
are looking for and this of course again
usually you typically take a digital
identity attribute you try to search for
them okay
the citizens of course are are very
concerned because of course you know and
people who heard about this problem of
identity theft everyone is scared it's
not clear whether there are big the
problem is some people sighs not so big
as it seems to be and even the question
of digital identity the problem of
protecting from identity theft is a huge
problem and as usual insecurity you
cannot just rely on a single technique
you have to use a lot of them okay so
here it's the typical did identity
lifecycle here I would skip there is not
much to say but as you can see we have
to create at the entity that's identity
provisioning we need to activate the
identity so make the certify this
identity can be used we needed to use
and finally women ever to revoke a to
suspend or distraught of course there
are interesting issue when you deal with
biometric data because as usually people
say oh this data I can they be revoked
and actually that's why a lot of people
including ourselves are try to develop
technique to generate by oh my let's say
crypto key or commitment at out of
biometric data so you don't need a
really to record the actual biometric
data just to even say okay so let me
skip this and let's go so okay so this
is an important problem as you know in
general more and more people get asked a
lot of identity attributes when doing
transaction on the web myself since I
started working on this sorry I get very
annoyed when I am asked the identity
attributes which I perceive have nothing
to do with the transaction I'm trying to
know usually that guys are array
fuels I stopped the transaction on there
maybe because in security you get used
to this minimal disclosure mean you have
to release as least as possible after a
while it gets a no somehow your way of
of acting but okay so however which is
the problem of course the people want
however to have a convenient a
transaction on the other hand okay so
sometimes in our security solutions they
have to also be very usable by users
must really support convenience by the
users otherwise you know this is going
to be a problem so let me say what we
are trying with our project and as you
will see we are not really pretending to
address a lot we just working on various
topics that we like because after all we
are in academia and we are trying to
provide you know our own idea what could
be a smaller solution of a part of this
bigger problem so basically we this is
this project called very high DX which
stands for somehow verifying identity so
we have done various kind of research on
this so we are looking at first of all
about the notion of verification of
identity attributes and they'll tell you
exactly what we mean by this because
that will be the Presto of the tork we
are looking into the use of biometric
identity attributes those really creates
a lot of problems also because as I said
people have a very strange perception on
bio memory but in Scenario which is
important because of all these
initiatives on the a passport and these
type of things let me say that typically
biometric solutions are very weak
because of what they do they do the
follow once you enter your fingerprint
and extract a template out of it of it
so typically for the finger could be
some specific minutiae point and they
store this template in some user
databases then mesto the template on a
smart card that you carry with you so
when it comes to the verification they
attack again your fingerprint and try to
match with this template okay so the
problem is if the database is act by
someone if your credit card is in your
card the Stamper at the way
then in our fingerprint and a biometric
doesn't provide any any protection at
all okay also they have other problems
they have a lot of problem of sensor
interoperability because it okay yeah
yeah
yeah yeah okay that's a very good point
you know people actually in crypto in
cryptography have been trying to exactly
work on this problem let me say they
worked on the problem of generating
encryption keys out of of biometric over
individual so the idea would be and I
haven't my fingerprint right that is a
key is generated that my phone is
encrypted then the template is remote
okay
next time I want to open the file I'll
do the same my fingerprint is read you
know and again what happened a problem
there is that typically they want to
assure I repeat ability because when you
try to have your finger up internet
again and you know somehow the key
doesn't come exactly the same you cannot
open the fat that's one problem with
biometric they really are when they do
the template matching you should have a
threshold if there is a match above 90%
or you know then it is recognized
however with the generating but
encryption key the problem you have is
that even if one input bit changed your
key is completely different okay so
people have tried to solve this problem
to assure a better ability to come up
with a lot of different techniques which
usually involve storing additional
information and this additional
information typically represent a
weakness point because everyone at the
end that manages to attacks and be able
to attack those schemes we are trying to
do something like this but we are not
trying to generate biometric colossi
crypto key we are trying to generate a
commitment which I'll sign a second what
they are okay so far we have a good
repeatability but the security of our
scheme we are still working on it it was
a typically for biometric they required
that the huge generator must have a
higher entropy so we have to prove that
to the entropy is a certain level so far
we have not at that level but our
approach is kind of complete took me a
day to put together a very smart a
security student and image processing
person a person a expert on
second or support vector machine to try
to address this problem okay but again
that's a very very good question okay
but the conventional approach about
biometric they usually store those
template that's the problem so we are
trying to do some work on that that's
why we're not talking to me
actually are also working on policy
languages to manage all those identity
attributes finally the last study which
I like a lot is the notion of identity
attribute quality provenance and
consistent that we are really borrowing
idea from the provenance you find and
database system so can we apply the same
so I know when I get a digital identity
attribute from where this came from no I
was of generated where it was stored by
whom opposed access said okay here the
interesting change with respect
conventional provenance is that in some
cases a party may tell you okay I can
tell you that this individual verifies
this condition against an identity
attribute but I cannot reveal you which
policies they use for my evaluation from
whom I got this information this is done
for confidentiality you know reasons so
this is what we are trying to do and as
you might expect this is only a small
part of this entire big problem of
digital identity manager and of course
we are really myself and let's say five
six students so there is so much oh we
can do okay so let me go and introduce
some terminology which is very well
known so typically when you talk about
those solutions you have a three typical
parties you have a identity providers
typically those are the parties which
make sure those identifiers we have a
relying parties which are really the
service providers those are the parties
which require the identity attributes
for doing they they say for providing a
service and then we have the subject
those are really the users trying to do
some solution of course in general you
may want to have availability usability
which is at least in our solution you
know this is a kind of an important
requirement we have a usability privacy
of course security as you know privacy
Google two different things so what what
we do and we are trying again to see if
whether this can improve the problem of
identity test but let me say that
identity theft is very huge there are a
lot of attacks so I will not comment on
them but there are a lot of attacks
there are mitigations for various
attacks so you know it's really a big
problem it can go from the attacks can
be physical based on social engineering
technical you know can be and you have
you know again a lot of possible
mitigation so what we are trying to do
we are trying really to use a
multi-factor authentication as so we are
really here you can see the long the
list of possible approaches then you
need to combine to attend strong
solutions okay we are really doing
multi-factor authentication so what do
we do is the following so our idea is to
try to mirror what happened in the real
life a certain point when somebody wants
to verify your identity will ask you
given me no other two identity documents
or some additional pros ok so we are
really trying to do the same with a
major difference that in real life you
have really to provide those documents
so when I got my driver's license in
Indiana they asked me ok we need your
passport plus another photo ID + this +
+ de sade I added to give all those
documents to them ok we want to do the
same but without revealing really those
documents to the service provider
because after all the service provider
that needs those identity attributes
really not for caring the service is
trying to provide you but only to verify
your identity so in theory does not need
to know their values ok and again in
security we try to reduce what we want
to disclose so for doing this we we use
basically some cryptographic techniques
which are that kind of off-the-shelf
techniques we need we added to extend
one in a way but we really use a
commitment techniques and there are
knowledge of proof protocol
okay so basically this is what we are
trying to do so so let's look at your
life so for example here there is a
party would say okay I want to buy
something here it's a my credit card for
pain and then the the shop you know the
service provider say okay please show me
some additional identity attributes
which are your license driver license
and an additional photo ID and as you
may say really you know those additional
information are not really required
because at the end the user only needed
the credit card okay so we are trying to
do the same so it's a very simple but
what we want to achieve we want to make
sure that each service provider can
specify whatever combination of identity
attributes that may require so we really
don't want all the predefined and sets
over the entity ID so if I go to another
shop this other shopper may say oh I
just need your driver license maybe I
want to see your app or do I did because
my bit support those shops okay and this
should be flexible and possible so we
use the notion of policies that the
service provider as this policies will
specify which identity attributes may
require to be to verify the identity so
we have basically so our approach works
in this way we have a logical entity
which we call the Registrar this
registrar is a very small code really
does very little and this what does will
establish a maintain some identity
commitment so those identity commit
metals and a second what they are are
then used by the user to establish the
approval knowledge of the strong
identification with be that I take my
social security number I generated this
commitment and then I buy see using this
commitment I can prove that I know my
social security number okay however
because of the user the Patterson
commitment and I lie about the
definition in a short time we also
needed to use a random
so those commitments are generated by
providing as input your identity after
the class the random number now this
random number created the usability
problem okay because my students then
implemented the notice this protocol and
they show me and this diamond which the
user was supposed to click on something
on the screen and this would open a
window say random number generator first
of all this shouldn't be shown to the
user however since we want to support
them up by the user as a matter of fact
we have an implementation on the Nokia
cellular phone O'Day's so how can the
user move those those random number so
that was a usability problem because now
I can expect the user to remember that
social card the social security number
may be for sure it cannot remember this
random along number so so that's why we
are right now we have this we found
typically for mobile user this cellular
phone you know that can be quite useful
because it's very very easy to load
those secret and store them okay but
basically the user what he was arrested
to do has a two basic error all does
identity attribute this register we said
that he committed a strong identifier
and then they can be used so before
revealing the actual value of so the
user now can go run a transaction the
service provider may ask you know
whatever identity attributes that the
may have policies let's say so the
identity the service provider may have a
policy say for example you can able to
prove me your identity by using this
identity attribute so the user can
choose even which one you wanted to use
the policies you know you can have
alternative groups over the entity
attributes a little bit like a card
space and does in a way you can know
click on what you want to use it and
then once you know which one you want to
prove then the system the client the
cellular phone we do the zero knowledge
proof product without really which means
the best you prove that you know those
identifiers without revealing their
values to the service providers what are
those
knowledge improve protocols they do and
of course those are really well-known
and you know there are a lot of them so
what do we do really
so our extension with respect to this
zero knowledge of proof protocol
basically such a protocol is an entire
we used an interactive protocol is to
prove that you possess a secret you know
secret without revealing the secret to
the to the verifier so you are the
approval you have to prove you can show
that you know without revealing the
value so our main difference is that we
actually with our scheme we can provide
with one round that we know the
knowledge or multiple secret
so typically so typical approaches what
they require if you have to prove three
different identity attributes we will
have to do one zero knowledge proof
protocol for each one of them we can
aggregate those proofs and basically do
just so around this very efficient I'll
show you the data even on the cellular
phone deployment ation scalable so they
are based on two well-known techniques
the first one is the Patterson
commitment which I'll show you what it
is the second one is a protocol that
dumb-bunny from Stanford developed which
is called aggregated the signatures this
protocol was used to prove at the you
know then when you have a message
standard by different individual how can
you really you prove that the signature
is correct of those multiple signatures
okay
yeah
and now but the question is the
following exactly that that's the
problem because you do not know in
advance how many combinations you will
be required so this means that either
when you commit you already know the
possible combinations okay
or otherwise you know you see which is
defined so because you may go that a
service provider may tell you I wanted
the identity attribute a and B okay so
this means that basically you when you
enroll them you will have to have
generated a commitment best containing
based on this combination okay in our
approach we don't want to do this so I
can enroll each identity attributes on
its own at different times and that can
still combine them in any unanticipated
way okay so it does so crypto this is
not something you know ground-shaking
I'm not in a crypto person at all it
uses this you know aggregated seniors or
technique basically but you see which is
depart because otherwise your approach
could be used but then you must know all
possible combinations in our demands so
basically the idea would be I go to a
service provider it will ask me to to
another one may ask me only one another
one may ask me for so of course one may
wonder in your life probably the number
of combination is more so maybe you can
pre-compute all of them but we want to
allow to revoke those a digital identity
attributes so you can remove them a
certain point you can add the some more
so that's more flexible at you and again
it's it's very efficient and the known
okay so that's what is a Patterson
commitment is maybe it's not so
important but so basically the idea
would be that this is what what you see
is a public commitment so when you want
to commit an identity attributes you
basically run this protocol with the
your registrar typically or with the
identity attribute issue where G and H
are public parameter as you
Espie then X is your secret and your
identity attribute and R is a random
randomly generated number okay so at the
end you give as input X R is generated
by our software and the system will
create this value C so this is what is
given to the Registrar so the register
which stores those commitment only gets
C does not get X or R okay now how do we
prove that basically we know how to open
this commitment so typically this
commitment as this protocol by which you
can you can prove that you know how to
open the commitment opening the
commitment means that you can prove that
to you to the approver to the verifier
that you know X and R but without
revealing X and R okay that is standard
the peddles Patterson commitment so
basically the protocol works in this way
so there is a deep Rivera typically is
at the user so the user will randomly
picks two numbers Y and s in a given
interval 1 to 2 and then I will send
actually Jay G and H are public
parameter okay so basically the prover
will send the deed to the verifier then
the verifier we randomly select a
challenge in the interval 1 &amp;amp; 2 and send
this random challenge to the to the to
the approver to the user at this point
step 2
P will compute umv okay and then we'll
send them to the verifier so the
verifier will accept the proof which
means we'll say oh the user knows how to
automate this commitment if we have at
the Equality there okay you can easily
prove it by replacing the values okay so
I'm not going to show you why if this
last equality step trialled this means
that the prover this is the user knows
out when they commit a basically this
means that the
service provider only as you see by
running this protocol evil ever the
certainty that you let's say the user
knows X and R but without the knowing X
and R okay now what do we want to do we
use at this product but we want to allow
to use a multiple X and we'll stick
around because we want to do this for a
number of different identity attributes
so let me so before we look at the how
we do that part let me show a very
simple example because we have
additional component in this ax so
basically for example let's look at this
guy's Alice has committed an identity
attributes a credit card number from the
credit card number issuer
so the issuer we release a certificate
signed by the shore with the commitment
so you will see that we have a D commit
which is really it would be a random
string however we have also what is
called C C n this is the tag because for
each commitment we need to know which
identity attribute that refers to
because a user may have a multiple of
them so Alice can go a register this
with the registrar okay at this point
the register asset to check for
duplicates we want to avoid that a
malicious user may have register 8 that
your identity attributes before you so
we needed to check somebody tried to
register the same and that's why we have
this kind of unique number associated
with this certificate so at this point
this is the key the Registrar will
generate that couple that you see on you
know on the on the on the PowerPoint
slide so we'll first of all issue you
know let's say temporary ID or a single
sign your login name this is really
aneema so can be whatever the user wants
to be and then he will create what we
call an identity topple this identity
table all really refers to an identity
attribute so we'll have the name of the
identity attribute this guy's credit
card number will have a DC at or because
the test it would be signed by the
register so that the user cannot tamper
with it evil ever the commitment and
then I will have an additional field
which is a weak identify er which we
used for linking together if needed the
several identity tuples of the same
individual the knowledge doesn't the
registration then they can she can run a
transaction so at this point is she
require a service now the service
provider will say oh I want to know your
credit card number I also want to have
approval of your identity with the
social security number so at this point
Alice needs to have another commitment
as it were all at this admission allow
tributo this shows that the user can
enroll them at any time base okay so at
this point Alice will do this role meant
we will create another identity table so
as you can see the Registrar will keep
will they created this new table for
Alice so it's a police but can be a role
that at anytime and then now Alice can
do the zero knowledge proof protocol to
know that she knows how to open the
commitment of those two digital identity
attribute okay so so you may wonder how
does the service provider because the
service provider to know whether Alice
is telling the truth needs to ever the
commitment okay so there are two
possible models that one can use here
the first one is that the service
provider may have to contact the
Registrar this is used in a lot of
solution we were looking in on some real
products and they always required that
no you have to go another possibility is
that this the register can issue Alice a
certificate like a token with this
commitment which is sanded of course by
the Registrar so this only requires that
the service provider should be able to
verify the public key of the registrar
because Alice cannot tamper with this
token because it will be Sonia
okay so I skip a little bit to this
because of you have at the example of
the attacks I want to let you know give
you more details about the identity
record what this is is so our identity
records which is again this set of
information that the Registrar stores
which however can be also given to the
user inside the token or certificates
consists of one or more identity tab so
an identity tab will is related to a
strong identify RAM and consists of a
number of elements
first of all attack forum which is a
symbolic name the noting the identifier
look here we are not dealing with you
know problems of terminology in those
identity attributes that could be
another problem then we have a
commitment for the digital identity
attributes which we denote as capital M
then we have two assurance fields the
first one is validity assurance this can
have four possible values a B F and you
a means this is a good piece of data so
which means the issuer or the register
is verified that this value very well
okay the means that the verification is
not so strong F means that the
verification is valid for some reason a
user tried to a role a decide entity
attribute for the payroll the credit
card number and we checked and this card
does not exist
okay but still we want to keep this
information the last case is U which
means unverified at all so the user may
also know this identity attribute
nobody's checked it but we want to keep
this because we feel at the end for the
application is important to know you
know how strong is this verification
then we have the ownership assurance we
this is really a critical problem that I
find in any solution I have a look that
when other solutions really they give
you all this crypto in our tokens and
things but they tell you we don't don't
know we know the problem of making sure
that the really
of this initial talk and is strong so we
really verified that this belongs 22 a
given individual they say is outside the
scope of our solution which you know
really means that the rest can be strong
but if initially what gets you know so
we want at least two other feel the way
by which the register can say here the
value is you which means we didn't check
anything so if the process is very
strong so the userís to go in person
provide several document maybe other
individuals who know him then we can say
this is really a it's really atop a
Liberty Alliance has actually introduced
the stand that the for assurance of
identity attributes exactly because this
is the real problem so we are trying to
introduce a component in a solution to
provide this notion of assurance and is
something which I like a lot ok so what
is our a policy in our in our approach
so a policy for the moment so this would
be a service provider policy something
very simple it consists of a set of tags
those tabs would be the name of the
identity attributes the user ID to prove
that T is or is able to open them so for
example could be for example credit card
number social security number then we
have another set of tag which are called
the D open those are the tags that the n
refers to identity attributes which have
to be really provided that to the
service provider so those are the ones
needed for the actual transaction the
the others may only be needed for
verifying identity so here it's our
actual protocol
so basically when the principal which is
at the user wants to provide that in
also multiple cigarette what he will do
he will base it will generate an
aggregated signature where basically
each by multiplying the signature of
each committed value okay and also
commuted the computer product M which
you see how it is
and then they carries on this data
knowledge of proof protocol to verify
that he knows how to open those
commitment then the last step that the
service provider easy to do is to verify
the aggregated CL this is where we use a
dumb bunny aggregated signature
technique so basically once the very far
side except the zero knowledge approval
the next step will be to verify that
actually M is equal to the products of
the commitment of the identity attribute
possibly needed to do that so we have
many other protocols in some cases you
may want to prove that you know how to
open a certain commitment without ever
revealing the tag because you may even
want to keep the Tagus again so this is
the architecture that we have
implemented and I want to show you the
data so basically we have deniable
almost done so basically this is some
data okay yeah okay yeah so we have the
data and so as you can see our technique
is very good because basically the time
to create the proof is constant despite
the number of identity attributes you
may want to prove with one round of
protocol so on the client is very good
it takes 0.02 seconds on the server it
takes a sub linear time because the
server is to do all this multiplication
that you saw we actually have an
implementation on this on Near Field
Communication cellular phones because we
want to allow the user to do this maybe
goes into a shop in person you can do
those proofs so we use at this near
field communication because you know
kind of more secure and base you can
have these bidirectional
protocols so we have also the
implementation as you can see in this
diagram you see the difference between
the time required on the mid-late on the
phone we use at the Nokia cellular phone
on the phone I text more than two
seconds which are not let's say refused
enormous
see Texas 0.02 but still within two
seconds very good so let me say just
some you know a lot of other related
research effort on which we are working
so so we are also doing it as I said
before this privacy-preserving data
matching for larger data sets we are we
want to apply this to digital identity
management we are also working a lot on
healthcare application and we are
developing a version of this very
addicts for healthcare record management
looking at federated environment so user
is no patient going to the doctor then
going to the lab which may be an another
organization or do we know then we are
looking at a management of personal
health care records so we are looking
into how can a user specify his or her
own access control policies okay but
this will be our user with not a
computer specialist we are also looking
at privacy aware back for multi domain
systems so with this I have Donna and so
if you have questions
yeah I know okay that's great okay
