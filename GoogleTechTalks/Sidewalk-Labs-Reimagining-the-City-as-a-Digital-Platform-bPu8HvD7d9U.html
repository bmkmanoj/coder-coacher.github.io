we're not confused this is the structure
of this way of sidewalk labs it's a it's
an alphabet company you're probably a
little bit familiar with the new
structure so kind of a sibling of Google
but we're particularly focused on making
cities better and we're going to talk a
lot about cities and urban technology
today since we started to talk about
cities I sort of wanted to get a sense
of the audience so how many of you live
in New York City oh wow
like almost 100% I can't even tell
whether no hands up and how many of you
were born outside in New York City
Wow that's actually a huge that's it who
was born in New York City oh wow
look at ya welcome welcome people from
New York City who was born outside the
US now that's that's actually probably a
slightly higher percentage than New York
as a whole I think New York is about 40%
foreign-born so actually I'm kind of
interested what obviously we all it
sounds like we all it looks like you're
almost all moved to New York some of you
just sort of stayed put but the vast
majority of us moved here voluntarily
what what drew you to New York would
larysa t's like what's your favorite
thing about a city any any the grid
people love the grid any other yeah
public transmit is awesome I agree I
work right there are jobs here that's a
good thing actually it's important yeah
the people are fantastic yes exactly I
agree yeah social yeah super social even
just walking down the street is social
restaurants hmm Kuchar culture yeah
exactly
okay fantastic yeah one last one hey
I've got I've got good and bad news for
you later on so you know my favorite
thing about New York City honestly is
just walking down the street you know
sort of pick some random destination or
as Knicks they've got a happy bones this
talk is not about plugging my cafe but
you know randomly you know head to a
random location and dollars to doughnuts
on the way you will discover something
you've never seen before somebody doing
something crazy some new little store or
you know park or whatever
you know I just love that kind of
novelties you know never far away in New
York City so um okay so so let's talk
about technology and New York so does
anybody know what this is very good
that's pretty fast
yeah transistor that's a transistor
that's kind of impressive
so who invented what organization event
of the transistor HEMT Bell Labs exactly
so so an interesting thing yeah these
days you kind of think about Bell Labs
is something you know in New Jersey but
originally Bell Labs was based right
here in New York City in fact like about
you know three or four hundred yards
that way Southwest from from the
building we're in at the moment so Bell
Labs was based in New York from the late
1890s to about 1966 in the 40s it
started moving out and over that time
Bell Labs invented things like it was a
largest Industrial Research Center in
the u.s. invented automatic telephone
panel switches it was kind of obvious
the first experiment were talking movies
black and white TV and color TV and in
fact they devout radar during the Second
World War they're called upon to help
with the war effort and most of the
radar development when a Crockett went
on and the Chelsea Market building
across the street which used to be a
Nabisco Factory Google is now partly in
that building vacuum tube commercial
broadcast and so on even part of the
Manhattan Project
so you'll notice there's a train running
through the building and so it's
interesting how that train line
basically over time you know fell into
disuse and has now been redeveloped as a
High Line so this kind of a line from
this amazingly technology that happened
right here in New York City and then
sort of fell into into a sort of a a
slow period for technology in New York
but now New York's redeveloping that
whole area but when I moved back to New
York I moved out to California to join
Google in 2000 my wife Kristin I moved
back in 2003 because we're desperate to
start living in New York again and the
New York Times published this piece and
one of the things they said was you sort
of have to read this in like an e or a
voice with the technology startup boom
over the term Silicon Alley is fading in
a history leaving behind a New York
Internet industry that offers little
excitement so that was kind of the check
scene in 2003 so things that come down a
long way since you know the 40's when
this was like the center of technology
IBM research and and Bell Labs and other
companies so fast-forward 30 that's by
the way obligatory photo of me and and
Craig Silverstein Craig was the first
employee at Google when we when we came
out we got our photo taken to sort of
commemorate the event sitting on
obviously like exercise balls in the
middle of Times Square 16 years later
this is a map of tech startups and and
tech events like this one right here in
New York City and you can see at the top
this is accounting I rearranged the UI a
little bit thousands and thousands of
thousands of companies in advance and
you all testament to that right tech in
New York City is kind of amazing now
there's a lot of incredible stuff going
on so in a way cities have done
incredible things for tech not only in
New York City but around the world
silicon roundabout in London there's not
a huge tech scene in Auckland but we're
building San Francisco as the city
itself Tokyo Sydney and so on so cities
have done a lot for tech in the last
decade or so the question now that we're
trying to address that Sidewalk is what
contact do for cities so let's rewind a
little bit maybe a couple hundred years
to the late 18th century
so 1700 s and let's look at some of the
impacts that technology has had on
cities already not computer technology
but in this example steam technology
which gave us essentially the Industrial
Revolution so suddenly people were able
to move around cities in between cities
much more easily no longer at the speed
of walking on the speed of a horse but
at the speed of a train driven like by a
steam engine probably even more
importantly it was now possible to be
incredibly productive in a small space
because of the leveraging power that all
that steam power gave us but of course
they were downside so incredible
pollution and the coal burning and
health impacts of people being crowded
so close together there was some pretty
negative aspects of the Industrial
Revolution so 100 years later actually
in New York with Edison now grid out
residue came to the world which enabled
for example elevators and
elevators enabled very tall buildings
and then all of a sudden in the late
19th century it was possible to build
these incredibly tall buildings and many
of them are in downtown Manhattan but
pretty quickly people realize that I
don't know if anybody knows the
equitable building down down downtown
essentially if you build a whole bunch
of these buildings that are fifty or a
hundred high even though you can maybe
you shouldn't because it blocks out all
the light and actually reduces quality
of life so the automobile another
amazing invention and through the
beginning of the 20th century but really
taking off in the post-war years the
automobile allowed people regular people
to get around with immense freedom so no
longer were they having to go wherever
the Train told them they could go they
could drive wherever they wanted and the
development of interstates and the
automobile meant that that Americans and
people around the world had access to
enormous freedoms the ability for
example to commute from their home to to
their office in in places like New York
so it seemed kind of wonderful what's so
wonderful in fact that it seemed like a
good idea to put a Robert Moses to put a
basically a highway through the center
of Manhattan's right through the middle
of Greenwich Village and fortunately
that didn't happen but what did happen
is lots and lots and lots of traffic and
lots and lots and lots of space devoted
to roads and to parking which will tell
more about so history shows that
technology can be an immense boon for
cities but there's also we have to be
pretty careful because there actually
some pretty negative consequences that
can come from from technology and Alan's
going to tell us a bit more about that
thanks Greg he'll be back yeah so I want
to talk about the fourth revolution that
we're we're seeing in cities and this
isn't really you just about sidewalk
labs I think I think when we we talk
about this you'll see examples that all
of us can relate to and we're calling
this sort of reimagining the city as a
digital platform you it's important to
start by saying that the cities
themselves have always been platforms
they're they're places where we pull
together we we've built roads
we we build sewers and we fund all that
through taxes and that enables all kinds
of users and businesses to come together
in the same way that we think about
other kinds of technology platforms but
until recently you know digital
technologies were sort of an
afterthought in city design and and what
what I want to talk about a little bit
is is when digital technologies become a
peer with concrete and with laws and
regulation and taxes what what happens
you know how does that change cities and
before doing that I think it's worth you
know talking about great platforms that
we all know and love in the digital
world and the potential that they've had
an actual change they've really really
sort of undertook and so I'm gonna talk
a few about a few of these first off on
the left here we've got your
virtualization server virtualization you
know led to dramatic efficiencies and
you know how we run application we have
you know the web and Google and search
engines which lets incredible at
adaptability for content creators and
the ability to discover knowledge from
around the world you have the app store
which is allowed an incredible community
of developers to reach users result all
around the world you know 100 million
apps in the App Store now and then
lastly you have the cloud sort of the
ability for your per minute billing and
you know per second billing now in some
cases with you places like Amazon and
Google allows any developer to go write
a server application for four pennies to
get started and and these digital
platforms have really had transformative
change both within the IT world but also
you know spanning into other sectors and
you know we we think we're at the very
early stages of digital technologies
being able to have similar amounts of
transformative change in cities and one
one way to kind of gauge this is is to
talk about sort of are the user
experience of the city and and how its
how its really changing so Kevin Lynch
was an MIT I think an urban planner from
MIT you wrote a
in 1960 called the image of the city and
it's a really interesting book is is
based on a survey I think I don't know
how many different people in three
cities and he basically just interviewed
them and asked them to kind of play back
what their mental perception of the city
was they lived in it just kind of
through spoken interviews and he kind of
paid attention and he observed for you
know what what indicators they used to
describe their life in the city and he
came up with these kinds of sort of five
you know types of physical identifiers
that people would reference the path
which is pretty straightforward walked
down walk down a path the edge which is
sort of a boundary between two different
areas in a city the node a crossing
point think about going through you know
a train station for example district
kind of like a neighborhood and landmark
large physical physical landmarks and
and these were you know by definition
physical physical objects by and large
and what what we're seeing now is that
you the the digital the the bits are
becoming every bit as critical to our
physical experiences the atoms so let's
start let's talk about paths so you
think about paths today you can think
about roads you can think about give bus
routes and the signs for them if you
think about the the the digital enhanced
version of a path here's it here's Ober
hop and this is an example of a dynamic
bus service that uber has been piloting
out in Seattle where you can see your
virtual bus by the color of the LED
light on the windshield and so it's no
longer you know waiting at a particular
bus stop yet there is still some notion
of a path it's just the digital version
of it now let's talk about an edge and
this is this is my favorite example we
think about an edge you know when you're
growing up you often hear people talk
about being on the other side of the
tracks and the railroad tracks were
often an edge now people are sort of
embracing this in the digital world and
this is what's called a digital exchange
zone
anyone know what this is so so there's
this is a place for Craigslist
transactions and so they've the city has
put cameras here and it's wired directly
into the police
police office and so in theory it's a
safe place to do transactions although I
wonder what happens on the edge you know
there's a lot of people with cash
walking around but it's interesting see
now you have a digitally created edge if
you will and then you know notes I
mentioned you know there's all kinds of
nodes in a city you think about you know
just a Union Station in DC this morning
you can think about sort of checking in
at the airport as a node where we're
kind of two worlds come together and now
with with you know wearables and you
know things like digital locks the the
the very definition of what is a node
changes you know you know when you check
in a hotel now in many cases you don't
have to go to the front desk you go
straight to the room or you think about
Airbnb you're not even in a hotel
anymore and so so that the notion of
kind of these these these nodes as
orienting kind of objects in a city
changes or has a capacity to change and
then the district you know we all we all
think about sort of neighbourhoods or
districts as having distinct physical
character when you enter them but now we
have your virtual districts right you
look at a list in Foursquare and you can
you can think about sort of carving up
Manhattan into thousands of districts
each with their own character and and
that providing a whole new dimension of
sort of experience and then lastly the
landmark I think this will be I think
this will you will what we think about
is landmarks will will persist for quite
some time but then again you look at you
look at the youth and you look at sort
of snapchat geofilters and and that's
every bit as much of a landmark for
people as as the Eiffel Tower and what
you see here is you have taking a
picture in a particular location to to
get a geo filter and you know being able
to use that as a reference point for
your friends you know wherever they are
and so you know these are these are very
early signs of change you know we start
to see you know like I said through the
bits influence the user experience every
bit as much as the atoms and what want
to do next is hand it over to Craig to
talk about what's next so one of the
things we've been thinking a lot about
it at sidewalk and and
we should say that's we're actually
pretty young that Sidewalk we're really
just beginning to think about these
issues Alan's been thinking about this a
lot longer than I have but we're we're
as a company we're only about six months
old so we're starting to think through
these issues but one of the things we
think is important is not just to think
about cities as they are now and some of
the changes we can make on the ground
but think into the future decades into
the future and and try and see where
cities are going and think about how
that influences what we do right now in
order to prepare for that and to start
to think about it so here's an example
so self-driving cars are getting better
and better and I think in the limit the
vast majority of cars will be
self-driving and it'll be rare for
individuals to be driving themselves but
there's still a bit of a crowdsourced a
sense of this so so who agrees with with
me that sort of in the long run
self-driving cars will will sort of
dominate and it will be a rarity to feel
like it's 2/3 maybe it's going up to 80%
actually this is almost everybody ok I
think maybe 80 85 percent of you you
agree with me so far so one question is
well we're going to figure out how long
this is gonna take so who thinks that'll
happen by 50 years in 50 years time
mostly it'll be right so keep your hands
up
so keep your hands up if you think it'll
happen in the next 30 years okay a few
hands down we're still over 50 percent
what about 20 years will this happen
within 20 years and I think we're right
at the 50 percent mark who thinks that
that that cellphone guys will be
pervasive in 10 years ok so somewhere
about sort of I would say based on this
crowd some time about 2015 years when
ours when it will happen we should sort
of write that down and check back and in
2031 so one of the implications there's
a whole bunch of implications a whole
bunch of which I don't think we really
understand yet but one that people have
talked about is the idea that that
parking itself will go away there's a
huge amount of space within cities to be
devoted to parking will sort of
disappear so the argument is this if you
have a lot of self driving cars let's
assume that that it's not the current
ownership model where everybody owns
their own car so now you know you go
from home to work and when you get to
work and you get out of the self-driving
car
I'm just gonna sit there and wait for
like ten hours for you to come back out
again I'm like a puppy it's it's gonna
probably go off and like pick somebody
else up who needs a ride and take them
around now eventually supply of the
demand will drop a little bit maybe in
the middle of the night and the cars
will go off somewhere but they don't
have to hang out like in front of your
house or in front of your work they can
go off somewhere so that unobtrusive
they need to recharge because they're
probably electric right so basically
you're not gonna have all the on street
parking and all the parking building
that exists in cities right now and it's
interesting over the last few months as
I've been sort of thinking about these
issues it's kind of shocking in
different cities how much space is
devoted to parking I mean Manhattan's
one thing but you know many other cities
to vote even more of their space to
parking so if that that use really goes
away what do we do with all that space
it's sort of an interesting positive
challenge to think about does that
become green space does that become
productive space that we can use for
other things do we have more bike lanes
and so on and so on those are really
good questions and even more interesting
question is when you think about the
growth of cities and there are lots of
estimates about the growth of cities
over the next few decades that
essentially say that it's conservatory
hundreds of millions if not billions of
people will move from rural environments
into cities over the next few decades
and so cities are gonna grow and as they
grow what do what do thought experiments
like this say about how you design those
cities you know maybe you shouldn't
design parking in as cities grow and as
you have new cities so outside what
we're really trying to think about what
the implications of things like
self-driving cars are on essentially the
built environment but also the digital
environment so Anna's going to talk
about a different a different aspect of
the built environment so so in this
connect so if you think about the if the
logical conclusion of self-driving cars
is to really make your transportation
almost entirely programmable you know
that's that's gonna change the built
environment too and you know when we
right now and we think about buildings
you look at a building like this you
know this is a massive building it's
been here for how long this building
been here 80 years right and
the permanence of the building and the
size of the density is often derived
from the transportation system we people
talk about transit transit oriented
development putting in a train line and
building around it if if now with you
know if these these cars that can be
pooled dynamically and you're
provisioned you know if that exists that
changes how we think about land use and
you know what what what size a building
is you know does it always stay that
size you know can it change and grow and
so u11 approach that that's been
proposed actually by Google on its
Mountain View campus is it's a radically
different you know play on buildings and
what you see here is in this case it's
it's glass could be a plastic canopy
very large-scale canopy where that
structure creates a waterproof windproof
region within which the structures can
be radically simple and at the limit can
actually be moved around by robots and
reconfigured and you've moved up and
down what you see on the left here is
what are called crane robots or Cray
BOTS and and you know this is this is
this is you know in part R&amp;amp;D but you
know there's aspects of this that are
going to become real very very soon and
you can see two things here one you know
the the the connection between creating
essentially a software programmable
transportation system which with
self-driving cars suggest and then and
then secondly you really you're freeing
the built environment from kind of the
shackles of innovation and really kind
of freeing your imagination to see
what's possible and so you know this is
this is one one possibility for you know
what a city in the future might look
like but I think it's important for us
to recognize that you know digital
platforms and the kinds of you built
environment that they enable there it's
not inevitably gonna be good for the
city you know just like Craig mentioned
earlier previous transitions they had
their downsides and you know just you
can look no further than then Hollywood
to see some examples
everyone everyone seen wall-e you know
this is this is maybe not the feature
that we that we hope for and you know
there's it's it's really interesting
actually to look at you know Hollywood's
critiques of cities of the future
another another one that's interesting
to look at is is Minority Report which
which had in some ways a more of a
positive view but you could see at the
at the edges some of the challenges and
issues that the society was grappling
with this idea of pre crimes and if we
have all this amazing data you know to
what what are the limits you know where
do we where do we want to draw the line
in terms of Public Safety and you know
civil liberties and so there's really
really hard questions for us to confront
and so you know our approach at sidewalk
as as as Craig mentioned is really to
immerse ourselves in in these cities of
the future in the in the different
possibilities but then to step back and
say look what kind of cities do we want
to create and you know our view is that
the cities of the future they have to
really be designed to be not only
efficient but also to be equitable and
human and and we need to be really
intentional about that so that we don't
you know repeat some of the same kind of
catastrophes that have occurred
throughout through the history of
technology in cities but it's it's it's
it's not enough to kind of be thinkers
and dreamers we also need to be living
in the present and so the other the
other half of our approach is about
solving the pressing urban problems that
exist today in ways that bridge these
cities of the future and and I want to
hand it over to to Craig to talk about
sort of how we have one foot in the
present one foot in the future
Thanks so we've started to think at a
very high level about what the sort of
the digital infrastructure of a city
could look like and I've made kind of a
an analogy a little bit of a stretched
analogy but with operating systems
computer operating systems and the kind
of thing that exists within the Google
infrastructure for example at the bottom
we've got the city is
selves and we've essentially input and
output that allows us to understand the
city through senses through people
moving around the city with their phones
through traffic air quality and so on so
input coming coming into our digital
platform and then output as well so this
is this allows the city the digital
platform to influence what happens in
the city so you can imagine traffic
lights are part of that story
intelligent door digitally controllable
door not door lock so you can for
example you have yourself Lydon or on
the weekend when friends are visiting
let them in and so on or apps apps that
people are using to navigate the city
for example are in a ways ways ways that
the digital infrastructure can influence
what happens in the city what direction
people drive and so on so above that I
sort of you know again using this
analogy of a of a software stack this is
the kernel so this is connectivity we
need connectivity throughout the city
we need permissions we need a layer that
makes sure that people have access to
only the things they should have access
to and and ground traffic control this
is essentially having the city
coordinate what happens in terms of the
roads in circulation on top of that
services things like the forty map where
we're saying knowing where vehicles and
other objects are in 3d space over time
and in real time analytics of simulation
to understand what's going on in the
city but then to understand a what might
happen next but also to simulate if we
change this so we if we added a road or
you know change the light timing you
know what would happen in the city and
demand management because cities have
scarce resources things like Road
segments and so on so making sure in
parking until we get to the to the end
state where maybe we don't have parking
but we need to allocate these resources
carefully and using demand management
and dynamic pricing to do that and then
on top of that essentially the user
facing application so transportation
apps to help people get around citizen
services which are maybe like a three
one one app on steroids and city
administration apps that allow the
leaders of the city to take action to
understand the city and then to take
action and to make good decisions about
planning so I just want to pick
a couple of these really quickly one is
connectivity and combined with that
citizen services and here's a shot and
statistic that 30% 36% of New York City
households who are below the poverty
line and the number of below the poverty
line is a shockingly high number in New
York City but 30 36 percent of those
those households don't have access to
Internet at home so think about that for
a second if you suddenly were cut off
from the internet access at home how
hard it would be for your kids to do
their homework for you to access city
services for you to access the world it
lies to get a job and so on so kind of a
shocking statistic and then when we look
at the current public infrastructure for
who said pay phones before for pay
phones for for communication this is
essentially the state of the art so
sidewalk one of the first things that
Sidewalk has done has made a major
investment in a company called
intersection which is replacing
payphones with the things you see on the
right these linked linked NYC devices so
these are every place there's a payphone
and there are about 8,000 of those
places throughout New York City there's
going to arise one of these they're
about nine feet tall and they have
screens on each side and at the top they
have a RF transparent area where we have
Wi-Fi each of these has a fiber
connection back to a central point and
they each provide Giga watt Wi-Fi and
you can see some of the reactions from
Gizmodo and a gadget and the bottom left
is a screenshot by Gizmodo showing
standing basically standing out in the
street I think probably with a laptop
like you know getting 436 megabits per
second download speed so these are kind
of amazing bits of technology paid for
by the advertising on the screens they
contribute money back to New York City
and we're going to be rolling those out
I think there's sort of 20 or 30 out
right now most of them are along 3rd
Avenue starting at 15th Street and sort
of marching up so if you want to check
one out head over head over there so
here are a number of of renderings of
these out in the wild they're going to
be throughout New York City so the Bronx
Staten Island Brooklyn Queens Manhattan
and they're gonna be super accessible
and people have started using these from
their from their apartments they're
actually you know
actually pretty accessible so this is an
exciting by the way I should point out
that in addition to providing Wi-Fi
access
there is a keypad that there's a there's
a tablet on there an Android tablet that
allows people to make free phone calls
so they're sort of backwards compatible
to your pay phone point the only the
only difference is there's no slot to
put 25 cents in because they're free and
there's even a place to charge your
phone so you can actually here's a
better put photo so you can use Google
Maps charge your phone make a 9-1-1 call
like a three one one call or use the
three one one app and so on so this is
this is new infrastructure that's
currently rolling out as part of
sidewalks mission that we're super super
excited about so to talk about another
example here's around oh sorry
and just one that's before III one of
the intersection people email me about
half an hour ago and said hey you
remember we're hiring too so
intersection is hiring if you want to be
involved in projects like this
intersection calm it's an idea for
Google slides dynamic ad insertion so so
you know Craig talked about one pressing
urban problem the digital divide and you
can see how we approach that with with a
commercially viable product I want to
talk about another really pressing urban
problem you know that's focused on
transportation and just to underscore
the point that Craig made earlier when
we look at problems we have sort of one
foot in the president and one foot in
the future and and in the case of
transportation we talked about these
great things called self-driving cars
that are gonna come but we're also we're
also anchored the reality that you know
most people don't have them today and
there's a long road to go and we're also
and so when we look at these problems
we're thinking about how do we do things
today that bridge to that future and
that's and you know you have this
platform diagram here for a reason which
is I think that by solving these
problems today we can create these
bridges to the future and start to build
build out a platform to pull that City
the future forward when we think about
transportation there's really
interesting and you know sort of sad
trend that's occurred in the last 10
years if you take the typical poor
resident in metropolitan area
the number of jobs that they can access
within a reasonable commute is actually
declined by almost 20% and this has
really understates the problem the other
80% in most cases it also had much
longer commutes and so you have a real
issue now where transportation is
causing both financial poverty and the
inability to get the jobs and time
poverty and and this and this is not an
accident you know this is really a
direct result of the way that we've
thought about you kind of transportation
in the US and much of the world if for
the last 50 years we've thought about
the outcomes that we want to shape
around transportation and said look the
answer to shaping those outcomes is to
pour concrete to build highways and that
was a very intentional plan and you're
part of part of that plan was also sorry
for the geeky chart was giving away lots
of free parking and this what this chart
shows is that as as you put more parking
spaces in a place along the x-axis turns
out that more people drive and and
that's not not a shock and the the
problem with this is it doesn't scale we
we have congestion issues and that's
driving the the problem that you saw in
the previous slide and you know the
wealthier among us can can sort by
income they can decide to go live closer
to jobs but the people that are less
wealthy or unable to do that and so they
they're suffering you we think there's a
new model we there's a new model for how
for how you can think about driving
transportation outcomes the starting
point is really first of all figuring
out what your problem is actually and
this is this is this is a huge gap in
the way that transportation planning
works and and we think there's an
amazing opportunity to solve this using
the smart phones that we all have today
if you go to most cities and you ask
them how many parking spots do you have
and how utilized are they most of the
time you're gonna have blank stares and
you know this the the the state of the
yard up until a few years ago was to
spend three hundred dollars to put a
sensor in each spot and and that's just
crazy the cities can't afford to do that
similarly if you if you ask most cities
you know who's using your streets where
are they trying to go what's driving
congestion
you'll get largely largely blank stares
or in the best case you out-of-date
surveys and and so in both cases we
think that using the data from
smartphones and other sources there's
there's an opportunity to really
revolutionize the the base understanding
of what's happening in a transportation
network now understanding is nice but
you know we really care about driving
driving action and changing behaviors
solving that the commute problem that we
talked about and it you know it's not
like the tools are sort of rocket
science you know
yes self-driving cars are gonna make
transit much much better but we have we
have transit today we have sharing
services today and so a big part of the
challenge is providing information and
draw in and the right incentives to
change people's behavior and you know
what one sort of example you know we've
we've referenced this a couple times but
this is this is one that we think is a
real opportunity is is really looking at
the driving experience and starting to
focus on on how we manage parking as a
place to start and the reason this is so
important is that the parking is a huge
factor in congestion and encouraging
road use and so one of the one of the
challenges today is that if there's just
simply isn't good information right when
you when you navigate to a destination
you typical typically in your navigation
app doesn't tell you that it's going to
take you another you know 25 minutes to
circle around and find a spot right and
so just by exposing that information to
people we can start to help them make
the right decisions and you know this
requires you know hard data science in
the backend it hard it requires really
sort of you know a novel thinking about
the user experience and this isn't a
confusing experience but if you do it
right we can start to expose this
information and then not only do we
expose information we can start to
expose alternative choices right so if
you if you know in advance that's going
to take you twenty five minutes to get a
spot well maybe you should purchase a
spot maybe you should or maybe you
shouldn't even drive at all maybe you
should take transit or Park &amp;amp; Ride and
and you can see how this this sort of
relatively simple example is is really
to create
a new form of infrastructure if you will
for transportation that's built around
information it's built around engaging
citizens and it does so in a way that
creates more capacity for everyone and
like I said earlier this is this is
about sort of more than just parking you
know if we can free this the shared
space that we have on the street so it's
not just for your car that's parked for
you know ten hours a day but it's for
bike share it's for dynamic transit then
we can we can we can enable more people
to get to where they need to go and then
you know if we fast forward to whatever
the year we picked twenty thirty one
twenty thirty one we can fill this in
you know we won't even need those
parking spots anymore
so just the last thing I want to I want
to reiterate so we had this this fancy
stack diagram and you know our approach
is to approach the is is to think about
this incrementally right you looked at
sort of what we're doing with link what
we're doing with with transportation and
parking but I think it's really
important for us to to also think about
the full stack to use kind of Silicon
Valley hero terminology what if you
could innovate across the entire stack
all at once what would happen what would
be different about a city you know I
think you we think of sidewalk that
possibility is not just an imaginary one
that is real possibility and you know
the reality is we're you know the world
is collectively building cities all the
time there are opportunities to
reimagine the full stack and and you
know what we'd love to you know hear
from you both after this presentation
but also an ongoing basis is what your
ideas are what are what are the ideas if
you have the opportunity to reimagine
the city from the ground up what's what
could be possible so with that I'd love
to love to kind of fight Craig up and
we'll be happy to take questions and
drive the point home we are to state the
obvious we are we are hiring engineers
and product managers and other roles so
so if you're in we're going to be a
pretty small team but it's a pretty
small and great team so if you're
interested in this kind of thing if this
is your passion and you're a great
software engineer a great product
manager go to our website
and apply actually let me mention one
other thing which is this this is this
is sort of one metaphor we used to talk
about some of the things we're doing but
stepping back you solving solving the
problems if we're to making cities
betters it's a vast problem space and
one thing I should mention in terms of
how we approached it I talked about sort
of going problem by problem Craig
mentioned having a small team our model
really is to is to pick off specific
problems try out solutions and then as
they become more promising then we go
deploy capital and resources against it
and so today we're about 15 will be
doubling that team but as we as we come
up with ideas will often decide to go
form companies around them and those
could be very large and so think about
it as a sort of a small high leverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
