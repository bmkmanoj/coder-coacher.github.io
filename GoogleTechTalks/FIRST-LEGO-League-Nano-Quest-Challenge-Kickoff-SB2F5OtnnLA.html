had no idea how many people would really
be interested so it's really quite
heartening to see you know pretty much
most of the seats filled I'm not going
to try to talk any more than I
absolutely have to you guys are here
really to find out the details of the
game ask questions and sort of begin the
process of having the team's work
through things so we're gonna try to go
quickly through any talking so that we
can get right to the heart of things so
basically what we're going to do is
we're gonna spend just a real quick time
doing some introductions we're going to
talk about the research project and then
I have a short video that was put
together by one of the partners in
Wisconsin in conjunction conjunction
with the University of Wisconsin so that
explains the operation of all of the
elements of the game will go back
through and talk a little bit more about
each of the elements give you guys a
chance to ask a few questions we'll talk
about the significant rule changes that
have happened this year there are some
particular rule at additions and
modifications with respect to teams
needing to be able to work with either
of the rcx or the NXT based systems and
then we'll go with sort of a general
question and answer as long as we can
suffer with the patience of our hosts so
before we get started the video will be
getting posted on google video so Glenn
and Albert have taken the time and
effort to get things put together so
that that can happen so if you want to
go back and look at things again it'll
all be there the presentation itself
will also end up getting posted under
the NCAA FLL website so NCAA FLL or two
thousand six kickoffs slides PDF it's
not there yet I couldn't finish them
until after they released the final
details and pictures today so I have had
a chance to actually post them yet but
they will be there in the next few days
so it introductions just clone a short
talk a little bit about playing at
learning some of you know who we are and
some of you don't know who we are and so
I want to give you guys a quick a little
bit
glenn introduced himself there are three
other Google employees that had a real
strong hand and having this happen on
make sure we identify them and thank
them we're going to have a t-shirt
design contest this year so we'll talk a
little bit about that and then we'll
talk about some of the things that are
going to happen with your words that
will be at the what they're not calling
the championship tournament playing it
learning so that's basically a small
nonprofit for all intents and purposes
right now it's my wife and I we got into
this side of things sort of in a
roundabout way we basically were your
partners for FIRST LEGO League junior
FIRST LEGO League and first of X
challenge so we're we are first
representatives for Northern California
for those three programs we are a a
501c3 nonprofit which means that all the
donations are tax-deductible him we are
all volunteer we have no salaried staff
we don't pay anybody anything we cover
our expenses all the tournaments or
Ana's breakevens so what monies we
collect what things were looking for all
geared towards covering the costs only
the other big thing we were trying to
really stress is this idea of community
based and so we see events like this is
the beginnings of a community first lego
league in northern california has been
sort of clusters of small communities
we'd like to see a lot more
opportunities for everybody to come
together so this is sort of a first real
effort at doing something like that
because up until now the only time
everybody's come all together has been
at the end of the season and it's only a
fraction of the teams it's not something
for everybody our Google hosts the four
of them Albert bodenheimer who was here
earlier I don't up he's here now
blend to wit and then Emily nishi she's
actually works as as part of their
diversity hiring and diversity and she's
been our sort of main sponsor and then
amber issah help take care of doing a
lot of the facilities setups for us it
is in Korea so she apparently is in
Korea at the moment so every year
there's been some sort of t-shirt as
part of the program we thought this
would be a great way of beginning a real
community effort so what we'd like to
propose is a t-shirt design contest
basic idea is is that each team can
submit one or more designs as candidates
for t-shirts for the first lego league
tetrick the official FIRST LEGO League
t-shirt for Northern California and the
idea is to post them on a website have
the community boat what they like the
team that submits the design gets the
most votes will get free shirts and then
we'll offer for sale shirts to the rest
of the community as a way of raising
funds to help pay for the the
tournaments and you notice it is plural
we'd like to see these kind of efforts
support not just the state tournament
but as much as possible all the
qualifiers we have this continuous
problem where we're all approaching the
same companies we're all approaching the
same donors so if we can find ways of
communicating and cooperating and
leveraging the larger effort we can get
more money out of fewer places basically
in terms of what we're looking at awards
wise at the official tournament it's
going to be very similar to last year so
if you're new to FIRST LEGO League and
you're not sure what the awards are the
coaches handbook is a great resource it
explains all their words some of them
will be awards that are going to be at
the tournament some of them are optional
words we give depending upon how things
look for a particular year we have three
awards that we've started giving that we
need nominations for and so throughout
the season if you see people that you
feel
are deserving of an outstanding coach or
mentor work or are really doing above
and beyond in terms of outreach for
FIRST LEGO League or are really going
above and beyond as an outstanding
volunteer those are awards that come
from the community they don't have to be
somebody that's at the Northern
California tournament we like to
recognize you know the what the
community sees and so we'd like to have
nominations from you give us a reason
why why does this person deserve this
award and so we'll set up an email
address where those nominations can be
mailed to so watch the NCAA FLL yahoo
group for announcements related to that
one thing we'd really like the stress is
this idea that the program is for
components it's not all about a robot
running around on a table so there's the
robot it's designed there's how it
performs there's the teamwork aspect and
then there's the research project and
we'd really like this is really probably
mostly to you coaches out there is to
emphasize to the kids that that is
really a four pillar program and you
really want to make sure that all parts
are being addressed it's kind of this
idea that the more the kids do with the
concepts that are behind the challenge
the more they're going to get from it
the deeper the the learning will be okay
so skipping real quick I told you I was
going to try to talk as fast as I can so
we can get to the real nitty gritty
every year the FIRST LEGO League project
is going to involve basically three
ideas so I'm sort of an exploration the
teams are going to do some sort of
design or solve and it's some sort of a
share so this year the idea is to go
learn about what's going on with
nanotechnology either related directly
to the challenge or from there are teams
own readings learn about what
difficulties of the T the current
researchers are facing what kind of
applications there are what kind of new
applications there could be and come up
with a solution either to an existing
problem or find a way of
scheming up some new application of
nanotechnology and then share basically
ideas is to spread the word get the kids
to get out there and play sort of
evangelists have them get excited about
telling other people about technology
there's a much richer description this
is sort of the the quick and dirty
version of the project description
there's a much richer one if you haven't
already gone to the first lego league
website they have now published the full
description of both the project and the
the game it did get rather swamped right
around noon today I can't imagine why
they are doing a few things this year to
try to improve the resources that you
guys as teams and coaches have to work
with so for everybody who's already
registered and received their equipment
you got a DVD that has a bunch of
examples of project presentations on the
now you can see what kind of things that
other teams have done there are several
videos that were also put together at
the same time as the videos i'm getting
ready to show you that we're put
together to talk more about some of the
aspects of nanotechnology so they're
great resources and first is already
populated a pretty rich set of resources
underneath the project area of the the
challenge website so if you go into the
first lego league site and go look at
the challenge 2006 you'll find in the
project section a whole long page
resources broken down into different
categories so if the kids are looking
for somewhere to start with ideas it's a
great place to be in okay so this is
this is what you are are here for right
this is the first big p so how many have
cheated and already gone and looked on
the website
be honest okay that's pretty good it's
good patience this video as well as all
of the challenge videos are all hosted
off of a website at Notre Dame so the
Notre Dame faculty participated in the
game design and got excited about the
idea of helping host the videos as part
of the kickoff so the link is here first
FLL de nded you it's also referenced
underneath the resources section of the
first lego league website with that I'm
going to switch over real quick and run
the first video this is about five and a
half minutes long it's basically an
element by element explanation of what's
going to happen in the game and
oh you know what I forgot I forgot it
has sound
and like all good technology things it
doesn't want to run we'll try this again
our experts going to bring over an audio
connection for us
and I headphone jacks are on this sizes
individual atom manipulation mission
move individual atoms accurately the
robot must remove at least one white
atom from the blue surface without
removing any red Adams counting atoms
left on the surface a count of eight red
Adams and seven or six white atoms is
worth 30 points a count of eight red
Adams and five or fewer white adams is
worth 40 points a count of fewer than
eight red Adams is worth no points the
smell mission transfer molecules from
the pizza toward the nose the robot must
get pizza molecules completely off the
paper plate for five points each and
transferred to the yellow or black areas
of the person's head or neck for an
additional 10 points each the maximum
value of this mission is 30 points
stain resistant fabric mission test some
stain resistant fabric the robot must
deliver the dirt trap to its location
mark the dirt trap at its mark is worth
15 points completely dump out the
testers dirt dumper the dirt dumper when
empty is worth 15 points the dirt pieces
are bonus objects worth five points each
in the dirt trap and three points each
everywhere else on the table when
removing dirt for a bonus loss the
referee takes stray pieces first then
pieces from the dumper and pieces from
the trap last
smart medicine mission target medicine
to reach only a specific problem spot
the robot must release the buckyball
containing medicine into the person's
arm the buckyball placed anywhere in the
person's arm bone is worth 50 points
even if it hasn't reached the problem
spot self-assembly mission start the
self alignment of atoms the robot must
cause the angle the blue nanotube
segments to align horizontally end to
end this alignment is worth 30 points
collector motor mission deliver and
adenosine triphosphate ATP molecule to
power a molecular motor causing it to
spin and release energy the robot must
deliver one of the two ATP molecules
through the molecular motors black frame
440 points even if nothing else happens
the second ATP molecule represents a
second chance to complete this mission
but points are only given for one
delivered molecule atomic force
microscopy mission free the probes nano
tip the robot must separate the Nano tip
from the material surface the Nano tip
separated from the surface is worth 40
points nanotube strength mission lift
the truck by a thin cable of carbon
nanotubes the robot must move the truck
onto the lift frame the truck completely
on the brain is worth 20 points activate
the lift the truck and frame supported
completely and only by the cable is
worth an additional 20 points the
maximum value of this mission is 40
points
space elevator mission operate the space
elevator at least one robot must cause
the car with the yellow car go to come
down if this mission is completed no
matter which robot or robots worked on
it both teams get 40 points
the the bonus section
I don't know if I can see
at 40 points
I don't I was going to try to replay the
last section this is a freeware little
viewer of the flash video format that
they've used for these videos it's maybe
not the best I didn't have a lot of time
to go looking so I'm going to I'm going
to get out of that will go back to the
slides and we can talk about it ok ok so
I'm going to skip forward and we'll talk
about that last issue the fairness bonus
so Scott Evans are our wonderful game
designer decided that maybe there was a
little difference between an RC X in an
NXT in an effort to try to level the
playing field he says maybe there's not
a lot of difference maybe there's just a
little and so the fairness bonus is is a
new element to the game this year with
an RC X to score the fairness bonus you
must score points in any three of the
missions with NXT you have to score
points in six of the missions now I see
a little bit of an issue we'll have to
see what the QA says related to the
bonus objects and how they count into
the tally of missions and you know how
that actually fits but so that's going
to be an interesting one to see how that
plays out I'm going to skip right ahead
to rule changes will come back to the
other slides in a few minutes as we
start getting into the question the
answers for the most part a lot of the
rules look very similar the changes
start to come into play when you start
looking at rotation sensors and total
number of sensors so because the NXT has
a rotation sensor in every motor the RCX
is allowed to use up to three rotation
sensors as well because you don't have
to use three NXT motors the NXT is
allowed to if it's not using its full
complement of motors is allowed to use
some of the old rotation sensors
if they wish and so it's kind of an odd
wording of the rule but so that
basically the the end impact is is that
neither robot can have more than three
rotation sensors on it and neither robot
can have more than three motors on it
now because the NXT can have more more
sensors plugged into it they've also
allowed an option of a third sensor so
it's a it's actually a third sensor
meaning if you add it up before you used
to be allowed to touch or too light now
you can have either a third light or a
third touch so if you wanted to figure
out how to try could try to take
advantage of those that option is there
for you and they have gone ahead and
allowed the ultrasonic sensor for the
NXT this year as well it is possible
these will change like all good rules
they get adjustable as the season goes
so like for all the game missions
relying on the QA is the right way to go
that's going to be the final test the
final check of everything that's
involved there are some other NXT
specific rules no bluetooth there's just
too many questions about what can or
can't be done with Bluetooth in a
tournament environment and so for the
sake of simplicity there just isn't any
it's not allowed not in the pits not in
the competition area so all connections
to the robots will be done either with
the infrared tower for the RCX robots or
with the USB cable for the NXT robots
and then there's that special rule about
the rotation sensors we're trying to
record all this and so I'm going to go
ahead and we'll move real quick into
questions and answers so that we can you
know not not try the patience of our
hosts any more than we have to I'm going
to when you ask a question I'm going to
repeat the question so that we can
capture it on the video what I like is
if you've got a question if you could
stand up and come to the of the three
sort of i always that'd be an easy way
for me to make sure that I get
everybody's questions answered we do
have a couple other folks here that are
familiar with
game so I'm a pointed a few people to
help answer questions as we go as well
yes yes sir the question is can your
robot beach and figure out the other
side on it does the sword will still
stand of it the way it's written it says
at least one robot so to me that implies
that one robot doing it is sufficient so
if we think back there was a similar
mission a couple years ago in mission
Mars that had two halves of a habitation
module that could be connected together
in that challenge it was allowed for the
robot to reach a cross in this case they
kind of turned a blind eye to that you
can't reach into the other table rule
because it was a beneficial interference
not negative interference so my
assumption would be that that's the way
that'll get addressed in the QA but the
QA will be the final say on it I'm sure
that question is going to come up very
quickly sir
so the question was is what if the
elevator doesn't go down when the
mechanisms get activated so there if you
haven't looked real close to said if
there's two little hooks one on each
side so it is possible the models not
going to work the referee is likely
going to make a decision based on
whether or not the two sides have been
pushed sufficiently if the model doesn't
work but the robots on two sides or one
side or whatever have activated the
mechanism he's likely to give you the
benefit of the doubt and award the
points way in the back there
it's not deducted you won't earn right
the question was is will any points get
deducted if the truck falls off and so
if you read the way the challenge is
written the truck must be on raised up
by the red platform and hung from the
cable in order to score the points so
it's not that they get deducted you
don't earn them the question is is for
the the fairness bonus is it that you
have to complete the mission in other
words so I have to score all the points
available for that mission and the
answer is no the way it's written my
interpretation of the answer is it again
be the QA will be the final definition
of all these its score points the way
it's actually written is must score
points in missions it doesn't actually
say must score all points in missions so
in the case of the pizza molecule
getting one pizza molecule off of the
plate is enough to score points in that
mission and that would be sufficient to
count that mission as part of the the
three missions for the RCX or the six
for the NXT sir the maximum question is
what's the maximum number of points I
believe it's 400 Scott Evans has tried
to set the game's up to be 400 every
year
this fabric if you get dumped but
there's a there's a piece of dirt left
hand and later on you touch the robot
robot and the referee comes to take that
out and that's the last one in there you
get 2 15 points
so the question the question is a
complicated long one it's worth spending
the time to make sure I describe it
right in the case of the stain resistant
fabric you've dumped so the robot has
caused the little dump to empty but it
didn't empty completely there's like one
piece left but sometime later the
referee assesses a touch penalty
touching the robot out of base penalty
and takes that piece away does the
dumper now count as being empty so
interestingly we the tournament partners
all think like you guys do and so that
was one of the first questions that the
tournament partners asked is gee that
seems like an easy way to score 15
points I believe that will get addressed
in the QA and it is a an issue of how it
gets empty so it must get emptied by
robot action not by human action and so
in this case because you touch the robot
the team member touched the robot and
scored a penalty that doesn't count as
the robot having emptied the dumper and
so my guess would be no it doesn't count
now is empty it's still full
bragging rights satisfaction of a job
well not the question is what do you get
if you win the tournament's bragging
rights the satisfaction of a job well
done trophies and plaques just depends
on what tournament you're going to
everybody's got slightly different at
the qualifying level the first level of
tournaments everybody has a slightly
different strategy for how they manage
words and they're not all the same at
the championship level we have these
really cool Lego trophies that let us
give out their very very neat looking
and know that you can't take them apart
they're glued together just saying yet
you had a follow-up question on the
dumper all this they say that it's the
state of the board at the end of the
terms of story it seems like there's all
kinds of ways things can get changed
during the process so the question is
basically the it's like more comment
than a question the comment is the way
the rules are written it's the scoring
is all based on the state at the end of
the game so it's it's when the two and a
half minutes have expired and the
referee looks at the table how does it
look Scott has been very good at writing
the rules and he has a few different
outs he's left for himself in the rules
and there are a few different places
where there's unless the mission rules
over right so there's a few places where
he leaves himself doors and I'm sure
he's going to take advantage of it
because it really is supposed to be
about what the robot does not about
loopholes so he usually tries to find
the loopholes early and close them and
he was actually a little surprised that
we found one that quick sure
the question was what happens if one of
the dirt pieces get stuck on the net
what would you guess so it count as
being out of the dumper so it's still a
three point object it's a bonus object
but it's not a five-point object because
it's not in the dirt trap
crack
Joran same group can actually interfere
with each other and whether or not
acceleration
Oh
so the question was is the NXT kits have
ultrasonic sensors and there's some
concern that two robots both equipped
with ultrasonic sensors might interfere
with each other and whether that there
needed to be something done to the robot
or to the environment that the robots in
to adapt to that it's a fear more than
anything nobody's actually seen it
happen to know that it does happen it's
going to be an interesting season way in
the back the question is is is the
allowed electrical equipment going to
change the progressive the comment I
made about the rules changing I don't
believe they're going to change the
equipment rules that there's nothing to
say that they might not I doubt if they
made any changes that they would make
them more restrictive if anything they
would probably make them less
restrictive but that'll be something
we'll see yes
and the question was how does the
buckyball molecule get on to the robot
in every season there's a few objects
that are deliverables that start in the
base the buckyball will be one of those
objects that starts in the base and as a
deliverable and base it can be handled
by the team so the team may place it
onto the robot into some sort of
mechanism on the robot lay it down in
front of the robot whatever they deem
necessary for their robot to accomplish
its task but they can't buy their action
put it in the bone the robot has to do
that so they can load it while it's in
base and then the robot does it its work
sir okay if you're not familiar with the
NXT it has places to connect three
motors and places to connect four
sensors because there are rotation
sensors embedded into the motors it
effectively has seven sensors that are
connectable the rcx when you look at it
at face value has places to connect
three motors and has places to connect
three sensors so how do you accommodate
the difference in the capabilities
between the two there's all kinds of
tricks that can be done the gang sensors
together if you go on google and search
and look for you know mindstorm sensor
tricks you'll find all kinds of ways of
being able to put more than the obvious
three onto the robot and so it's more of
an allowance for whatever creativity a
team can come up with then a
hard-and-fast this is how you do it
that exactly it is possible to have
different attachments the comment that
came from the back was is you can
reconfigure the robot dynamically during
the round so one attachment might have a
light sensor on it another test might
have a light sensor and and touch sensor
a third attachment might have so the
whole set of things you use during the
two and a half minutes maybe a lot more
than what you could have used for
example last year but it still would
maybe only be three at a time sir so
that the comment was is if we kept the
NXT ultrasonic sensor down at like edge
of the table level so that it's
effectively below the walls of the table
maybe it wouldn't interfere I don't know
whether or not that's true like I said
it's going to be a real interesting
season we're going to find out and
probably it's going to be one of you
folks out here that finds out before any
of us do right way in the back
so the question was is can you drive
around the stain resistant fabric and
dumped from the back the general thing i
always tell anybody will ask questions
about the game rules is if it doesn't
say you can't think that you can so if
there was nothing in the rules that
specifically prohibited you from doing
it why see I think that you can't so I
don't think there's anything in any of
the rules that says you have to approach
any of these models from any particular
side so whatever you can come up with
ought to be fun to work and some fun to
see right here yeah
the question was is is the dirt trap
that's part of the stain resistant
fabric is it part of the deliverables
that's correct it starts in the base as
something the robot must deliver so
you'll have to have your robot figure
out how to get the dirt trap over to the
stain resistant fabric
let's see the question is is does the
dirt in the dirt trap so before being
dumped count as points as part of the
fairness bonus and that's a question
we're going to have to see in the QA
it's maybe maybe you'll boil down to
this difference between the robot
scoring points and the team scoring
points and so you could think one way to
think about it might be that the dirt
and the trap scores points regardless of
what the robot does so if the fairness
bonus says the robot must score points
in three missions then if it's all in
the trap the robot hasn't scored points
so I don't know that's I'm sure is going
to come up in the QA and that'll be the
place to look for the definitive answer
to that yes
the question was is there a limit on the
number of gear boxes you can use on your
robot the only limits that have been
expressed or about the electrical pieces
so other than that if it's made by Lego
pretty much you can use it ma'am the big
question with just a few words what's
the difference between an RC X and an
NXT the there are many differences it is
a different electrical equipment
different hardware different motors
different sensors different main brain
brick different software environment to
use for programming in that said I've
aside from the sensors that are new to
the earth to the NXT I've not seen
anything that can't be accomplished with
either alright so that it's just a
different way of accomplishing the task
it's newer it's going to be very
interesting to see how the teams decide
which way to go it's a to go really into
detail would take a lot more time than
we've got tonight I'll go with Glenn I
would assume so the question was is for
the the dirt stain-resistant fabric
dumping the dumper scores points
potentially regardless of whether or not
the dirt trap is there and I think
that's that's probably true the dirt
trap just gives you the option of
effectively adding a little extra points
to the dirt not the dirt molecules or
whatever they're calling them sir
to the question I think I understand the
question is can you use a Lego remote
and then he paused while I'm testing it
out so if it stays at home and never
comes to any tournament yes at the
tournaments they'll ask you to walk out
with it the problem with the Lego
remotes is is they don't control just
your robot they control everybody's
robot so you press that a motor on
button and everybody a motor turns on so
they are you no no no don't you can do
what you want to at home but it doesn't
go to tournaments sir
for that's 19
it's a it's a long question there's the
question was is if a model one of the
elements on the field gets broken what
happens and it depends a lot on how and
when it gets broken and how it happens
the robot drives out crashes into
something and that something falls apart
depends on the model depends on the
conditions depends on the situation the
referee may reset it if the referee is
seen that you've crashed into three or
four things before that he may decide
that that's part of your strategy and
may just leave it as an example if you
have say we're looking at the test the
carbon fiber the nanotube fiber if
you've successfully gotten the truck up
and your robot drives into it crashes it
and knocks the truck off the road that's
referee is not going to come back out
and put the truck back on but now say in
in reaching out to retrieve your robot
when it was over near the truck you
dragging your robot knocked the truck
off the referee likely would put the
truck back so there's a lot of detail
behind how and why and what happened and
you know how long it's going to take to
fix things whether or not is going to
get in the way of your game it's not a
simple answer a lot of it depends on the
situation sir
the question is is when delivering the
dirt trap for the stain resistant fabric
does the dirt trap have to be fully on
the mark I would suggest reading the
rather detailed descriptions of in on at
there's a couple other words Scott Evans
has spent some time defining those words
he's very careful about defining them
and the rules for the missions are all
written around those definitions of
those words i believe the rule is in
this case the word he uses is act it
must be at its mark and I believe the
way that that ends up being interpreted
is the some part of the dirt trap must
cross into some part of the mark doesn't
have to be exact it doesn't have to be
you know lined up and closed it needs to
be covering part of the area inside what
kind of balls down to it yes sir
so the question was is is when when the
robot is unsticking the the nanoprobe
what happens if the whole model flips up
that's something you're going to have to
watch for that is a potential problem
the mats are flexible that's going to be
true for everybody everywhere and so
that's maybe a consideration you have to
take into account when you you and your
team get together and design your
solution to that it is part of the way
that that model is built and designed he
specifically talked about it when he was
explaining the challenge to all of us
and he said you guys might be tempted to
put some extra sticky tape under there
don't ok so we're not going to yes
starting
after that day
around
that
three
the question was about the robot
starting position and the method of
starting the robot and the recent spate
of changes in the rules related to that
Scott did a lot of work in last year's
rules in cleaning a lot of the language
up and cleaning the method up and I
don't believe there's any significant
changes in that section in coming into
this year it's basically the same rule
the the team must stop touching the
robot before it begins leaving base so
if the robot is in motion and the kids
are touching it that's that's an issue
do it basically it's a dumb it gets a
lot harder when you're actually in the
tournament's and it's a live active
situation referees in general or trained
to give you the benefit of the doubt so
close calls are going to go to the team
but if it's an obvious you know there r
EA mming the robot is its leave getting
ready to leave base referees going to
rightly ask them to stop and bring it
back and restart it again you leave a
piece of the duct work then you get a
bonus loss that it's the last piece out
you say no what
if you get the bonus loss first and then
you come and dump the rest of them okay
so the question is related to the bonus
loss and the empty dumper if the referee
takes a piece out of the dumper but
they're still dirt there and then later
the robot causes the dumper to empty
does it still count as an empty dumper
and again I think that's probably won't
be one that comes down to the QA I would
tend to believe that that's going to
count as empty dumper the robot caused
the dumper to be empty the assumption
would be that if that other piece of
dirt was still there it would have come
out it's kind of hard to know that's
definitely gonna be a good one for the
QA sir
once the robot so in general there's a
couple of rules that are really spend
some time reading them it helps a lot in
terms of how you and your team are going
to decide what your strategy is
specifically there's a rule that says
the robot cannot interact with the field
in any way until it has completely left
base and so anything that would be stuck
back still into base would mean it's not
completely out of base additionally
there's a rule that says anytime a human
touches the robot it has to be brought
back to base for a restart whether or
not there's a touching penalty happens
to fall down to where the robot actually
is is it partially in base or is it
completely out of base if it's
completely out of base and you touch it
you're going to get a robot retrieval
penalty and be asked to bring it back if
it's if it's partially in base
regardless of whether it's on its way
out we're on its way in you may touch it
but you have to bring it back in before
it can go out and do any other missions
so the question was if the robot empties
the dumper but some of the pieces fall
out onto the board and the robot later
goes and picks laspisa's up and puts
them in the dirt trap does that count I
would say why not and it should be a lot
of good cheering going on to right way
in the back so the question was is what
if the mission model breaks during the
mission we kind of touched on that a
little earlier it depends on how and why
so if it's obvious to the referee that
it wasn't the fault of the team he's
likely to try to repair it that said
there's some of these models that are
pretty complex if they break in complex
ways he may not be able to repair it and
that's something they'll have to be
addressed at the time by the people
involved each referee will make the call
based on what they see if the team
crashes into something and breaks it
it's going to depend on whether it
looked like an accident whether it
looked like it was strategy it's kind of
a greater good rule is to try to be
careful around the models
so the way the scoring so the question
was is for the molecular motor if the
robot causes the the mechanism to spin
but doesn't actually drop the molecule
to make it happen does it still count
and the thing to do is to actually read
carefully the description that mission
it isn't about the mechanism moving it's
about the molecule passing through that
black frame and so until that Moloch
crew goes through regardless of when or
whether or not the mechanism fires and
runs there's no score so it's the
molecule going through that's the
important piece not the mechanism we're
out that's just kind of icing so that
the question is is so say my robot did
reach through and trigger the molecular
motor and then later came back and
deliver the molecule with that still
count my belief would be yeah right the
scoring for the mission is about did a
molecule pass through the black frame so
yeah yes sir
now the question is is the robot drives
out a base runs out of batteries and is
dead if the team reaches out grabs it
and pulls it back do they still get a
touching penalty unfortunately the
answer I think is yes right the the rule
is clearly written about when you're
allowed to interact with the robot that
might be a situation you decide whether
or not it's worth it maybe you've only
got five seconds left in the mission in
the in your round and you decide maybe
it's not worth it right I'll leave it
will just pick it up after the time's up
then there's no penalty the other thing
would be to make sure your batteries are
good before the round sure
so the ransom both
okay so two questions first question is
if they accidentally break one of the
deliverables wallets in base can they
repair it I don't see why not I think
that'd be a good thing to do second
question was is if they accidentally
drop accidentally or on purpose drop a
pizza molecule through the molecular
motor does that count and I'd have to
look real closely at the rule but my
belief would be probably not it's that
the way it's written it's actually the
particular molecule that 80 ATP molecule
ATP mom never getting used to the new
terminology this year so it's it's
written about that particular molecule
going through so i would probably guess
pizza doesn't count sir
so the question was is what if the judge
grabs my robot I don't have a clear-cut
answer that I don't know what the
situation was I don't understood not
have happened that's a good time to have
a good conversation with your referees
before the match talk to the referee and
I hey we like to do this this might
happen can you grab it don't touch it
when it's doing this so the referees are
people too so talk to them I mean
they're standing there all day and then
watching all these kids go by having all
the fun and so you know talk to them
make them part of the fun sir that's so
the question was is for the
self-assembling molecule if the robot
triggers and it starts and the mechanism
fails partway through are you still
going to get points the definitive
answer will come from the QA the my
belief would be yes that would be
something that they would consider
probably as more of a model problem then
the robot didn't do its thing the robot
has a very clear responsibility with
respect to that model let's just tip the
little arm all right so once it's done
that the rest of its the models problem
so if it doesn't finish all the way
through that's not necessarily your
fault although maybe if you crashed into
it real hard shortly before that that
might they might make a different
decision but that would be the only way
I could think of that they might not
just go ahead and give you the points
sir
the site basically PowerPoint say if
both teams did everything space powers
so the question was is how they decide
of the two teams on the table who gets
the most points it's it's all math right
so they just add up the points so if
both teams score all the points both
teams get a perfect score and they get
tied for 400 right so in a tournament
you're not going to go with just one
round it's going to be three four or
five depends on the tournament everybody
should be getting at least three so it's
not just your first score not your
highest sometimes it's not just your
first two scores sometimes it takes all
three scores before you can really
determine who who is the winner out of
the performance site it does happen
climb over to tell them tell me climb
over the table where
so the question was is what happens if
the robot starts to climb over the wall
out of the table and the judge grabs it
real quick for you III would think you
might want to thank him but you might
also want to be in the right place at
the right time you are allowed to have
two of your team members up at the table
at all times right and so you know your
robot you know what can or can't happen
as it's running if you know that there's
that kind of a chance you might want to
have somebody close to be ready to catch
the depending upon where you're catching
you're going to suffer a robot touching
penalty but that's certainly better than
Legos on the floor way in the back
the question was is are you allowed to
attach extra pieces onto an attachment
onto the dirt trap to help guide in the
dirt pieces for the stain resistant
fabric in years past Scott has had
specific rulings in the QA about
attaching things to the mission models
and so the thing to do would be to watch
for that but it falls back into that
that category of if it doesn't say you
can't don't think that you can't write
so I wait and see right delije it's
probably going to boil down to does it
damage the model is it easy for the
referees to get undone because they're
going to need to use the table real
quick after that yeah and so you know we
can maybe after we finish with the main
part of this we can if people are
interested we can continue on with the
project the DVD has examples of teams
giving their presentations at the one of
the New Hampshire tournaments
so the question is is if there's a model
on the field that's broken and it was
broken from the round before is that my
penalty hopefully that won't ever come
up it shouldn't be your penalty you as a
team should look at the field before you
begin right this is back to that having
that that dialogue at discussion talk to
the referee if you see something on the
field the trunk bring it to the referees
attention he's a busy guy he's doing a
lot he's spending a lot of time you know
talking to the team before you helping
them understand their score making sure
that they agree and are happy with what
went on getting ready for the next round
it's possible something got missed I
mean it happens talk to them I mean
protect your your best best solution
that situation is is for your team to
protect itself take a look at the field
as you walk up make sure everything
looks like the way you expect talk to
the referee in the back the question was
is if you lose a buckyball from your
challenge set and are looking to try to
get another one how do you get one they
are the lego bionicle zam wharf sphere
yeah it there's a cool little shooter
that actually can launch them so it's
very very neat the way it works I
believe Lego actually sells packages of
them I don't think they'd be orange but
in terms of size and ability of
practices one that's what they are the
Bionicles a more sphere and I believe
you can buy extra ones it's like a bag
of 10 or something like that right in
here
I can only barely hear you quench stand
up to the the fairness bonus is that
with dressing the question was is is the
fairness bonus included as a part of the
overall 400 points and the answer is yes
so that is an aspect of the overall in
other words there's 380 points of
missions and 20 points of fairness bonus
ma'am the question the question from my
let you stand up this is Jill will occur
she's my wife and the other half of
playing at learning she's here she's
here to heckle the question was is if
people are ready to go and they're done
they feel like they've got what they
want can I get up and walk out as long
as they do it quietly and make sure that
they get a google employee who has
squirt them down by all means so they're
there Glenn is in the back waving his
arms so the only thing that google has
asked is that we can treat the space
with respect than we are escorted in and
out so if you're ready to go try to keep
in mind that some people aren't until
you're going to walk out do it kind of
in a quiet way
so the the comment was a reminder about
when the Q&amp;amp;A is valid and when it will
change and how it affects your
tournaments so the QA as it stands at
three o'clock the Friday before your
tournament weekend is the Q&amp;amp;A for your
tournament so you can't look at the turn
at the next weekend's QA and expect
anything to happen back to your
tournament so if you want to see what
the final ruling is three o'clock Scott
has promised that at noon eastern time
he will stop modifying the QA until the
weekend's over it came about because a
few years ago things were getting
modified all the way up till tournament
day and as tournament organizers we
didn't always know what the rulings were
and we would get brought these sheets of
paper and it's like surprise we've got a
pass on that this is our interpretation
and Scott agrees so the QA now is the
definitive answer to all questions it's
either as the challenges are written and
published or in the QA or nothing that's
the only way it works yeah all all the
answers to questions are public
basically
elevator from the other side go on the
other side so the question was is for
the space elevator since the there's
this sort of implied the robot can reach
across and touch the other side of the
space elevator can the robot actually go
over to the other side and touch the
space elevator I'm not sure a little bit
of a liberal interpretation of reach
across that'd be a good one for the QA
it makes Scott answer it he likes good
questions so for the the truck the truck
will be sitting just in front of the
ramp and so it's front wheel should be
just touching the little gray ramps that
are coming down so that it doesn't start
and base it's not a deliverable in that
sense it's part of the model the robots
job is to push it on to and then cause
the mechanism to lift
the the question was is after the robot
completes its missions does it have to
return to base to earn its points that
would depend on the individual missions
so the only time the robot isn't
required to go back to base unless it's
got a retrievable something that scores
in base other than that the robot can do
anything at once anything you want the
question was is is there a retrievable
this year I don't believe there is
there's nothing that scores based on its
position in Bates everything is
something that's being taken from base
and given out to the models
so the question was is G the vinyl seems
to be a little bit smaller than the
table this year how is that going to get
oriented what's the standard position
that will be something that's addressed
in the field setup portion of the
documents that get published with the
game I believe it's all about the bass
corner so the base corner will be tucked
tight so if you look at where the base
is that corner will be tucked tight in
and any excess will be at the edges away
from the base Scott made a comment at
the training about having updated the
sizing of the table so that you can
build a table that fits more exactly
most of the places have their tables
already the big issue ends up being that
they're using for those who haven't
actually looked at the mats there are a
lot different than in years past it's no
longer a laminate it's now a single
surface single material with a laser
printed and I believe its laser prin I'm
not sure baked on surface a little
tackier than years past a lot more
durable than years past and will lay
flat a lot quicker shouldn't suffer any
bubbling or crimping or anything like
that but along with it they can now cut
them very accurately and so they will be
they should be a lot more precise there
shouldn't be any of the issues with the
mat imaging be met image being a little
out of angle in the mat area so a lot of
those issues should be gone but in the
meantime they're getting the sizing
figured out exactly but that base
corners is the definition of the
placement of the mat in the board
that was my understanding the way that
Scott was talking that he was rewriting
the description of how you build the
table to fit the properly sized mats
they had written the size of the table
to allow for differences variances in
the actual cut to the mat you know what
other types of thing for does the kind
of people i challenged the question was
is was sort of two part he noticing that
there aren't any ramps or things to
climb this year and was that something
that was done specifically to try to
address the difference between an NXT
and an RC X and did Scott make any
comments to that effect then the answer
is no he didn't make any comments to
that effect the the why behind the game
design you'd have to talk to Scott and
the folks that were behind it if you
look closely at the mat you'll see
there's a sort of a red zone a yellow
zone and a blue zone and the way he
described it was macro micro and nano so
there are three different zones the
activities in the different sections
have corresponding skills that go along
with them that was the extent of the
explanations that went along with the
game I don't think he did anything
explicitly to try to level the playing
field just in case the details not
what's that mean
but you say pull tight to that corner
and bass are you talk about the wall
inside so the question was a little bit
more detailed about Matt positioning in
the table the mat is designed to have
the basic boils down to when we pull the
mat into the corner are we concerned
about the black edge at the mat being up
against the walls or the white edge just
inside the black border the mat is
designed to have a black border
surrounding all sides it's the mat not
the art on the mat that is the
definition what should be placed so it's
the actual vinyl mat itself not what's
printed on it that gets lined up
indication if that would continue to the
future because if you know to help us
make a decision this year well you know
good a trap and catch up the future
the this question was is that with
regards to the fairness bonus is that
something that is going to continue or
not and nothing was actually said at the
training as to whether or not that's
going to be something that's going to be
a part of the games going forward the
only thing that has been said is that
the game will be designed to be
accessible to both types of equipment
through 2009 now they also did say that
that may change based on the rate that
the teams adopt so if it's still you
know 50 50 75 25 and there's a
significant portion of our CX teams
there they may leave that there but if
drops down to five percent and only five
percent of teams are on IRC X's they may
push the rules and say okay you guys
really ought to all switch now so it's
not clear time will tell but they have
committed to through 2009 largely based
on the desire to support FIRST LEGO
League whether or not goes through 2009
will depend a lot on the FIRST LEGO
League community I think most people
want to be gathering on looking and
talking about
so if there aren't any other questions
up I got the key the question was is the
red and red and white written yellow ah
the red white atoms on the the what's
the mission called I forget the shaky
table 1 the blue table with the with the
red white pieces on it there is a
specific pattern and if you look at the
field set up guidelines it gives very
clear directions on how to set it up
basically when you've got it set up
there's 16 pieces there you're going to
end up with a four by four grid and
there's diagonal lines of red and
diagonal lines a white through it so
it's a very clear picture as part of the
field set up that explains it all and
it'll be as good as the referees can do
it now repeatedly
the question the question there was one
question up here from the table about
are the little features on the mat
designed to help fool light sensors I
don't think he really did anything to
fool light sensors as much as to make a
decorative the hexagonal patterns that
are there or actually modeling I believe
buckyballs nanotubes or buckyballs one
of the two so if there aren't any other
general questions you guys are welcome
to come up and look around the table and
we can ask sort of vague questions I got
at least one more general question so if
people are interested in target so the
question was is are there people
interested in talking about the research
project we can continue with that if
people are interested so questions about
the research project anybody any
questions okay mark
just want to make our plan so we're not
we're not done they're still going to be
more conversation about the research
project and will probably have to throw
people out bodily it looks like but I
just wanted to say that Google hat is
planning that is to say we are working
on plans to actually host a qualifying
tournament here the plans are still in
progress and I think you will find out
about whether or not we're doing it at
the same time find out about all the
other qualifying things what about
October first yeah that's a mic in years
past the tournament registration season
will open October first so we should
have all the information together for
all of the qualifying tournaments and
the championship tournament by then the
information will all end up be posted on
our website NCA FL org as well as the
first lego league site under the teams
and tournaments section just to be clear
we're not trying to steal people away
from their local from whatever
tournaments they've gone to before we
are in fact very interested in
recruiting new teams so if you have a
regular tournament that you usually go
to you should stay there but we're
looking forward to it the research
project questions am I got any research
project questions
well when they were talking about come
on listen I don't actually understand
what you can do with nanoscale
acknowledges the research project in
general so the question was is when
they're talking about a solution what
does that mean what can the kids
actually do the research project isn't
so much about the the end result as much
as it's about the process having the
kids imagine create you know understand
and research behind the science that
goes along with what they're looking at
you know be inventive justify what
they've done look at the feasibility
there's a whole bunch of science and
engineering that goes into the whole
process that process is is more
important than the actual end result
maybe what they're thinking of is
something relatively fantastic I mean
the space elevator as an example is
something at this point that's a great
idea but it's relatively fantastic right
there's not a manufacturing capacity
that can generate that much nanotubes so
that that would be an example maybe they
would think of another way that
something like a nanotube could be used
as a material to build something of
value to society or maybe a be used a
different way of doing medicine or sort
of open ended in that way
so the question was is does the research
project include community service it's
not community service its communication
and so there's sort of three aspects to
the research project there's the
Explorer there's the develop there's the
share so it is one of the pillars of
doing the research project whether it
means you went and talked to some of the
people at your school or you went and
talked to your your church group or you
went and you talked to the girl scouts
in the neighboring community the idea is
that you went out and you told other
people about what you'd learned it's
about the process again any other
research project questions so for those
who aren't familiar with research
project five minutes budget for a
five-minute presentation at the
tournament's your team will sit down
with a panel of judges do a presentation
on the topic that they've picked
explained to the judges what happened
that presentation could be something
like PowerPoint it could be flip charts
it could be a skit it could be a song I
mean it's up to the kids how they want
to present the judges will then sitting
toward do an interview session with them
and query them about what they did how
they did it what they learn who did they
talk to what else did they think about
so it's tweezing into the process to
understand what the kids actually went
through
with five minutes no more than five
minutes and if you're going to do
something like PowerPoint make it easy
for the kids to work with and
bulletproof too many times you've seen
kids walk in with a laptop flip it open
it's not on the batteries aren't aren't
charged battery came loose all kinds of
disasters we kind of almost discouraged
technology-based ones in favor of flip
charts or presentations or skits or
things like that that are more creative
so the question was is how is the
research project score there are set of
rubrics that go into all the judging
that's done so not just the research
project but the team work the robot
design their rubrics that are in your
coaches manual for all of them so there
are specific areas that the judges are
looking at and assessing different
tournaments use different methods
basically it's a they did good they
could have done better they really
needed to work harder on that kind of
radiated scale it is subjective in the
moment you throw judging into the the
name of what's going on it's subjective
so it
it's not an exact process score score
and judging are difficult it's more of a
ranking
the whole thing
okay question was for the research
project should we how much coaching
guiding should we do in terms of making
them really pay attention and address
the rubric right how much should we
guide them into that process ideally the
work should all be the kids were
encouraged them to look at challenge
them by asking similar or the same kind
of questions but not so much as going
through a checklist and saying you guys
did this you did this do this you didn't
do that go go back and address that but
it's a large part of what they're doing
is supposed to be exploring discovering
becoming inspired by and when you march
them through a checklist it loses that
that flavor and it tends to become more
of a race to the end and that's not what
you want to have happen it shouldn't be
an end it should be a beginning so at
the tournament they should be excited
and they should end up walking away
feeling they want to tell other people
it shouldn't be though we're finally
done with that so it's a it's a gray you
want to challenge them you want to
encourage them to grow but you don't
want to lead them through the process
any other research project questions any
other general question
question was is where can we go for
field trips related to nanotechnology
Silicon Valley is kind of a rich in
nanotechnology resources there is a
which group has the the Silicon Valley
engineering Council has the nanotech
roof yes so we're trying to get hooked
up with the nanotechnology subgroup of
the Silicon Valley engineering council
or light Ripley or it's one of those
groups they have a group that
specifically addresses the industrial
industries means related to
nanotechnology they get together they
talk about the issues we're trying to
get them to participate we're trying to
get them to set up maybe a series of
speakers but they would be a great
resource in terms of being able to
identify companies come and talk
probably once every three weeks on
nanotechnology but they're used to
talking to their peers so what I'm I'm
starting to dialogue is can we either
have a pre-session or a post session
where they can talk to our first lego
league because it's a different a
different top
our experts in nanotechnology so we're
working on that definitely people know
of folks would love to have help in
trying to get that set up so the FLL
community it was the one that set up
online kind of people contacted that
would be great yeah I seven works at
WebEx we would love to talk to them
about doing stuff like that now many
fabulous and we would typically
addressing questions from the room I
think what primarily were we are five
years behind other areas and first lego
league compared to the infrastructure in
the outreach bridges to the community
and two companies and things like that
in other areas you see everything that
firstly public has and we've got four or
five people on our planning committee
and that's it for the two thousand teams
and two thousand kids in Northern
California so we really need help that's
basically the story we're doing what we
can that's why we got involved we see
the difference in
it's let me if you send an email after
then I'll said I'll give you the exact
person it's the nanotechnology
subsection I think of the I true beauty
and that the Silicon Valley engineering
Council helps send information out
nanotechnology yeah yeah exactly and
they have a nanotechnology someone on
their board is the head of that section
for the I Triple E and that's how I made
the connection is we're trying I've to
know there's been two talks already that
I thought would be wonderful and the
problem later good job here not the
right level it has to not be talking to
their peers we had some success a couple
years ago with mission Mars in getting
NASA types by pre feeding them the
missions pre feeding them the research
project and so they then took and
applied real world science what projects
they're working on that directly
connected to the specific missions or to
the research project so it might be one
way of getting them connected and
keeping it at the right level for the
kids language and topics that they're
already talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
