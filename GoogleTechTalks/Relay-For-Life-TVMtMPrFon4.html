for five years five years and William is
also going to tell us how anything with
it really just a couple months brand new
newbie and kristin is new also she just
started a few weeks ago just found a
break from houston to move here from
Houston Texas so welcome and jeans is
going to catch oh stop survivorship so
thank you for coming we appreciate
having you here and all that you guys
take over what I hold ya glass I'm Mike
if I move will you be able to capture me
perfect well external okay basically the
reason that we're here is because monica
is a team captain she's been coming to a
lot of the team captains meeting and you
know she's mentioned she has a lot of
questions
ensure really how it started that you
graduate already motivation so hopefully
by the end of today you guys will have a
better direction I want you to do you
know how do you want your end to go
instead of clarify he didn't thank you
for taking lunch hour to meet with us
let me do when you get involved with the
American Cancer Society it's always you
tell a story a little story about
yourself a little bit of story of how
the american cancer society hasn't
impacted your life for me I'm a police
officer here in Santa Monica and I've
been here 31 years and we've been
involved with Relay for Life since its
inception back in two thousand one and I
got involved because we thought it was a
great opportunity for the police
department get involved in the community
event because you know a lot of times
law enforcement in cancer patients
really don't mix and you know they're
not you know breaking the law they're
pretty much going from point a to point
b and point a useless as their home to
the hospital and back home and so we
don't have a lot of interaction with
that and so that's how we got involved
as a police department in general and on
our third year of doing really for life
i was diagnosed with prostate cancer and
so it really hit home for me because I
was there always has been supportive of
the American Cancer Society saying you
know I I need to do more for the
American Cancer Society what can I do
and then now I turned around in it's me
that the American Cancer Society's doing
something for me which really made an
impact on my life because I saw the
money raised in Santa Monica I saw it
where it went and it actually impacted
people and how they touched their lives
so as we'll go through the program today
you'll see that I don't think very many
of us here have not been touched by
cancer one way or another and so we'll
talk a little bit about that so that's
my story about the American Cancer
Society entire to help me because now
that I'm a cancer survivor it's changed
my whole perspective of what the
American Cancer Society does for me
really for life this is our fifth year
here at Santa Monica it's a great
community event we hold it at Santa
Monica College and it starts at nine
o'clock in the morning and it ends at
nine o'clock the following day sunday so
it's a 24-hour event and you have a team
Monica's your team captain and what her
role is is to get to try to get somebody
on the
back to walk around the track for 24
hours so what you're going to do is if
your team is 9 you'll try to have
somebody representing your team from
google because you want google will be
out there so you may be walking one or
two hours and the track and then
somebody else we're believing somebody
else we believe you and at three o'clock
in the morning I'll be out there with a
lot of the committee members will be
walking along track drinking coffee and
just chatting and the nice thing about
that is that you bring your friends
family members to the event and they
share the same emotion and same feelings
and what you'll find is that if you've
been touched by cancer as you're walking
through the track you'll talk to
somebody a complete stranger and that
person will have the same things are
going in their lives that they've been
touched by cancer and you get to share
ideas and get that bond because it's all
about community involvement in education
the American Cancer Society Relay for
Life there's 53 events in Los Angeles
County their nationwide their
international but farrar for our concern
here Santa Monica is just one relay and
in in LA County there's a Venice there's
a beverly hill so there every almost
every community has a relay for life and
what it is it's that it's about like the
starbucks story and why do you say well
why don't you just have a big really
well starbucks if you'll turn around
every time you go down the street
there's a starbuck to the star but
there's starbucks right and they're all
over the place but what it is is that
santa monica is a unique unique
community in Beverly Hills is a unique
community and what you don't want to do
is you want to not shut somebody out
because a lot of people don't want to
drive that distance they want to stay
within their own community and they want
to feel like it's their part because I
want to be able to go to this event and
say I can walk with my neighbor or a
person down the street and if they go to
some other community really don't have
that by and or that bond and so that's
why relay it can be a big thing but we'd
like to keep it into our area here
because San mark is very unique what we
walk is there is three major components
to relay for life at nine o'clock
there's the opening ceremony and gene
will talk a little about it because it's
about their survivors with the american
cancer society because we're really
celebrating survivorship celebrating
people like me which I don't feel like
of a survivor but I am and they're
celebrating our our fortune of being
able to survive cancer
at nine o'clock at night there's another
ceremony which is the luminaries so
ammonia at that time this is a moment
that we have the opportunity to remember
the ones that lost her battle with
cancer in the ones that have been
victorious and beat the battle with
cancer when I walked out of the hospital
that the morning the doctor says Frank
you're one of the unique people I said
why is that he says you come in cancer
with cancer now you're going home
cancer-free and so that's a real unique
feeling to have sorry about that being a
police officer they always call you so
sorry about that and then at the third
ceremony which is the important one is
also the closing ceremony which is at
nine o'clock on sunday morning and
that's when you wrap up everything and
you talk about how much money you raised
and you talk about all these things and
of course just those three sermons are
the key components but there's events
going on through hole for 24 hours so if
you're there at two o'clock in the
morning you're going to be watching a
movie with us because we show a movie at
night at Santa Monica College if you're
there at five o'clock in the morning
sunday morning you're going to be
smelling fresh pancakes and eggs at the
local Boy Scout Troop will make so
you're going to be all over so it's
going to be a great thing one of the
things that if if I can say one ceremony
that if you have to make it's a luminary
ceremony it's a ceremony that you really
need to see how it's done because it
really touches you and just it makes you
realize how fortunate we are that we can
walk around that track because a lot of
people won't be able to walk around the
track because you just don't have that
strength and we all have that strength
here you know I mean we're way better go
out there and say okay we're going to
carry the torch for somebody else I
can't do that and that's just a little
quick overview of what relays about okay
video time we're going to show about a
three minute video it's just to talk a
little bit about what the relay for life
is about
I could have easily passed as the others
at work
just go okay join you think you're going
to just get money for our organization
that's what you think it's all about but
not one of them it's uh this is full to
universal it is a total experience it
makes us all feel for a pulse we walk
home to a campus grade school campus and
there's so many people that all care but
all fighting for the same cause that
have all lost people we loved people and
we don't go along
tapping on the society nobody I'll do is
really caring about anything nothing but
was going to write they tried eating
here teachers my children that we the
healthy a responsibility to help heal
the sick this survivor life to me is
really important to see it's an honor
see like to be out there with like some
cancer survivors in phila cancer
patients that's me feds are on
first survivor left that went on was
very emotional I cry most of my friends
that he not expected to be that
emotional but it was I think part of the
reason was because people were cheering
and clapping for us
it just lifted our spirits immediate and
we ran into a bunch of people we did
friends of ours that we did not realize
we're going through the same thing
here I illness that can effects of me is
bringing all of us together and through
that you draw straight from each other I
think that relay is magnet because
people feel like they're able to help
each other we're all humans are in this
life together it's 24 hours of your life
to get out for a moment you stop
everything you're doing do you stop
thinking about the things you think
you're going to have fun with and you
start learning something else about fun
about a penis about being together that
is just incredible
that was just a quick overview of what
really for life is about what we're
going to do is have Jean come up and
talk a little bit about survivorship and
what she does with their relief 4 life
here in santa monica one of the local
hospitals right down the street on
sixteenth Street and I wanted to make a
point I was listening to Frank talking
and before the Relay for Life of the
American Cancer Society used to have a
making strides program what they would
have out of real a walk and we were the
hospital was very involved with it and
we had a team and it was just so excited
then they moved it to what's that park
downtown so anyway it's further away and
we totally lost the Pete our hospital to
you because they didn't want to go to
another another area so when relay for
life started five years ago it was very
exciting for us at Santa Monica hospital
but it is taken us several years just to
fill back up and we still don't have the
size of team that we we used to but I
think it's very important that it is
there are all of these locations and
it's in it's right in our backyard and
when you're there you'll see different
people that you know and and it's very
very excited you'll meet people from
different companies and it's it's a lot
of fun the first two years of that I did
relay for life in Santa Monica
did the opening ceremonies which was
kind of fun because I got the fire chief
from the police chief and and let me see
who else Boy Scouts you a salute and and
that whole thing and then the mayor and
and different people and if it eats like
a small town ever everybody turns out
please chief places there but chief
homes there and it really is fun so I
did that for a couple years and then I
started doing the survivor chair and
that to me is really what it's all about
very exciting we really need survivors
to to give the rest of us the energy to
to keep this going and to realize what
we're working for and so we have a
survivor breakfast at eight o'clock in
the morning if we have a survivor tent
and we beat breakfast is being provided
by shutters on the beach hotel it's for
100s we're estimating 100 survivors and
they will have breakfast and the tent
and then go to the opening ceremonies
and the air they all have this is the
different all of the speakers it's kind
of fun it's uplifting and then the
survivors will open up relay for but
doing the first lap and it's they have
different colored t-shirts and it's I
think for the survivors it is fabulous
because they feel the energy and the
support and there are survivors there
that have been 25 years survivors like
my husband who you know is in good
health there are people there
had cancer for maybe a couple months and
they can look at that 25 years of
everything she you know I can be there I
can work towards that I can make it and
so it is very it is emotional it's also
very uplifting and then when you cross
the first lap line they get a medal
around there the mechanist it's it's
just that so what I my job is to go
around down to all the groups that I'm
in and to give these flyers to people
say if you know of any survivors at all
please have them come and be a part of
the American Cancer Society Relay for
Life because we we need the survivors
for the encouragement and and they need
this activity did I forget anything
friends nope she's got it covered Thank
You Jean you know is Jean mention about
the food for survivors we try to get as
much donated to us and so last year when
i got to the event i saw the food coming
in for all the participants and i saw
what their survivors were eating and i
thought i'm a survivor now i'm going to
eat the food because she did a fabulous
job insolite the top of the line so long
I'm not bashful about saying here but
survivor would it suits my needs but
sometimes you're going to be asked where
does the money go and that's a tough
question and one of the some of the
things that we talked about in in some
of the things are key components to
googles and to all of you yourselves is
that there's going to be a hundred and
sixty thousand new diagnosed patients
here in California this year of cancer
one in three will be diagnosed in their
lifetime and one in eight women for the
women here will be diagnosed with breast
cancer so I mean that when you look at
the odds there if you just look to your
right or your left somebody's going to
have cancer or give me diagnosed with
cancer I mean so those numbers are great
460,000 for this year in california one
of the things that the money is used for
is used for to do a lot of research in
1974 they with the money provided to a
doctor
be provided created a muppet tamoxifen
which is used to prevent prevention of
breast cancer so that's popular today
and this is founded back in 1974 the
other thing that I'm thankful personally
is they funded the research that was
from prostate cancer the PSA exam
because for me they caught that my
cancer so early I'd never had a symptom
and i asked a doctor I asked the
geologist I said when would I have had a
symptom that I had something he said
probably 20 years from today that's how
long it had been in my system before and
by you know 20 years later it would have
been throughout my entire body so they
would never you know I would not have a
chance to live so with that PSA that
that funding so when you look at what
really the money goes to Santa Monica
relay goes to American Cancer Society it
really sends a message to you where the
money goes the American Cancer Society
also offers some great programs out
there look good feel better they have
man to man they have all these programs
that are provided that are all free all
free they have what's the program for
the corporation's living healthy or
there's a program that you can contact
the American Cancer Society and what
they have is they come in and they can
work with your employees on fitness and
on dieting and things like that it's all
provided free because it's important
that you know that they have the diets
that you eat it's important that their
diet is correlation that cancer can be
reduced so those things are there some
of the things that the money is is that
the money is never used for personalized
one-on-one because the American Cancer
Society looks how are they going to
impact the largest amount of people in
an area so they're not looking to all
we're going to give money for Frank
they're looking we're going to give
money for prostate research will will
impact 10,000 20,000 a hundred thousand
people and so that's where the money
goes for research and some of the things
that you want to keep in mind is that
the money when you have your team here
Google's today you're looking around
saying God we have a small team but
imagine that in two years or three years
your team is going to be tripling
quadrupling you're going to come out of
here with Google representation because
when you look at your hundred and
sixty-eight employees they're found
these are relatives in that you may have
a potential of having a team of five
hundred or teams up to 500 and so what
you want to do is you once you get to a
point that you're about 15 or 16 on your
team you need to start thinking about a
second team so you have google one
google two and thing all the way down so
those are things that you keep in mind
because your teams will expand the day
of the event you're going to have people
from Google's that are going to show up
because they're going to be relatives
families friends are going to come on
just to support you and just to see what
it was I was talking to Monica earlier I
had the first year we were out there we
had an employee at the police station
says jan i said hey you're going to come
out to real answer she said I really
don't have something else to do I said
just come on out and see what it's all
about okay i'm going to stay five
minutes and leave so i saw her that
morning eight hours later she's still
there so what are you doing I thought
you're going to win six I can't leave I
said leave get out I can't inch the
following year she came back and she was
on our committee and she's been involved
with Relay for Life since so it's just
one of those things that you keep in
mind what we do is we do a luminary
ceremony we have a small crowd today so
one of the things we're going to do we
have any cancer survivors and not
everybody wants to say they're a cancer
survivor so if you don't feel
comfortable don't say you're a cancer
survivor okay what we usually do is in
at the relay we have a luminary ceremony
and what we do here is we'll talk a
little bit about it and it really is
what it is is celebrating those that won
their battle and those that lost their
battle cancer so if you have a friend a
relative apparent son or daughter that's
been impacted by cancer stand if you've
had a co-worker a neighbor an
acquaintance that you know that has been
impacted by cancer stan
we have one person in this room that's
fortunate that hasn't been touched by
cancer so we look at that and you get
out there I mean we're really fortunate
that we're here you can have a seat and
so what we're saying is as you look
around almost every single person here
has been impacted by cancer one where
the other we have one person that didn't
stand because they haven't been impacted
and so that sends a strong message that
cancer is out there so fundraising ideas
this is my favorite we have a team at
Santa Monica really that comes in
usually with about 26 or 27 thousand
dollars they raise one team and what
they do is they from do fundraising from
the entire year they do garage sales
yard sales bingo night poker night they
do all these things in fact there's kind
of interesting things for google if you
work with the your management at Google
you know they can have that you know
employees can get you know something
special in the in your cafeteria and
then that for an extra price of you know
you pay a dollar or something like that
I mean some some corporations have Jean
day you can wear your jeans on a Friday
and for an extra five dollars and all
the proceeds go to that Monica and I
talked a little about fundraising at
your camp sites talked about baking
cookies and something on and you'll be
surprised how many people will come by
and grab your cookie and drop in five
dollars in your bucket and you'll think
five dollars for a cookie and it's not
about the cookie because they're not
looking the taste of your vet cook so
what you know little eat it you know
they're there to providing to help you
raise money for you know American Cancer
Society and research and further relay
for life so those are some of the fund
fundraising ideas you know a lot of
fundraising ideas you know you can have
an egg toss and if you want to
participate in the egg toss you got to
pay fifty cents and then you have a
price from google google may donate
something and say okay hey at the end of
the day if you want this mug you have to
participate in this egg toss or balloon
toss or whatever it may be and then our
participants pay an external some free
and on how that money is raised and
you'd be surprised because what we did
last year we put a five gallon bottle
spark with bottle water aunty 1 by r
machine and at the end of day we had
like 400 some dollars in there so people
just stopped by and got their coffee and
drop some money in there and so there
are all sorts of fundraising ideas and
as you come through them just running by
the only thing that the college does not
allow is open fires and fireworks but
anything else water balloons you name it
they'll have their so that's pretty much
our yeah please on the fundraising side
I think that's a good opportunity for a
company like this to do something that
you know really tells people who you are
one of one of the teams that we just
signed up is a part of Youth League
football so their fundraising is going
to involve like a tackling dummy and
something that you kick a football into
a net so they're going to have fun with
it and it's going to be about football
because that's who they are their
football player is on another team is a
bunch of wellness professionals like
chiropractors and acupuncture is so
they're going to have something like a
massage table or maybe a you know like a
chiropractic type back exam that people
are going to contribute for and they'll
you know just deliver a message about
you know healthy living while they're
getting a free back exam and you know
that again it is part of who they are so
you have an opportunity to be creative I
think that's one of the best things that
this event is for teams I mean you can
do whatever you want the fundraising
idea is completely up in the air so you
can do something you guys have
phenomenal resources here you can make a
really cool booth with all kinds of
techy stuff that all the kids there
get a kick out so with the place like
this I mean you guys think Oh nuts and
you know you should so so do then and
then the other thing that's basically
one of your responsibilities as a cheap
is to you know have an event there that
makes the whole relay more fun and at
the same time when people come to your
your area there they're also giving
money which is going to create the next
PSA test or thanks tamoxifen also though
you want to deliver a message of some
kind because I think that is actually
more valuable than the money in some
ways an example of this is the head a
game I heard that somebody did called
find the polyp I guess it was this to
that kids can crawl through they made
like this double dare course and they
filled it with balloons and and the
balloons are polyps so you have to just
crawl through the tube and pull out this
balloon look at it I'm calling but it's
a simple game but the messages is pretty
clear it's that you know polyps are
things that you know people have in
their home they're just there you know
feel it you can't see it and if you find
them early and you remove it then it's
not a big deal it happens to people all
the time and if you don't then they can
metastasize and malignant and then you
have a serious problem because colon
cancer is a vicious form of cancer
that's a particularly maximum and that
game just delivering a simple message
it's fine it takes a child 2 minutes 20
seconds there crawl through a tube would
pull out a balloon but people now know
that they have to go get checked
regularly and that game probably sitting
you know a couple of people's lives
because they'll go go get checked out
they'll have their polyps removed and
that's a that's a huge accomplishment
that the event did so that's why you
know we want you to focus on delivering
some sort of message like that also and
those two things can be the same thing
but you know we have a mission delivery
person Glenn which I'll make sure you
talk to him he's got all different ideas
about how the different messages that
you can deliver but if you can
incorporate that into what you do when
you're there then then you'll you'll do
a lot for a lot of people then you won't
even realize it so that's very important
you know as I look out I see the t-shirt
and I see the jacket that says Google
people would love love to be able to
work I know my son would love to have a
Google teacher t-shirt just to work and
he's a freshman in college but imagine
if you had some type of a fundraising
activity at your campsite that the price
is a t-shirt or you know the grand prize
is a jacket o people will line up to try
to get it you know you sell raffle
tickets to get there and then at the end
of the day you're going to announce the
winner and people love to wear that with
pride because it's just something that
Google is very identifiable in a
community I mean if you say Google
everybody knows that Google is and
people say would you get that jacket I
would you get that t-shirt so I mean you
have the possibility of doing endless
things here at Google because you have
the the name already recognition is
there so it doesn't go have to be oh
what is that everybody knows Google yeah
but we're putting pressure on here we're
putting pressure on you should have you
guys are
I mean as we walk in saw these two
things here imagine having something
like that at your campsite I mean that
would be people go wow I mean that's
catching your eye on your attention
quickly and they're just that simple
it's just something a little unusual and
out of the ordinary that you have that
potential I mean we walk through your
office space and we're watching the
screens and seeing the screen so i mean
the technology is here and the ideas are
here is just taking them to the college
and implementing them and i think you
guys have the potential of being the
high team razors now we're going to go
to any questions and answers any
questions out there way or you can do
either or you can do a nice blend I mean
if google says hey we want to give away
here's 5,000 pens or pencils that we
want to give away you can give those
away and then you know they give you
something a little nice you may say hey
we're going to sell these for ten cents
or fifteen cents or twenty-five cents or
dollars you set the limit the only thing
is that we ask any team fundraising that
occurs that all the proceeds go to their
birkin Cancer Society Relay for Life or
towards your team you know we don't we
don't allow teams to come in and say
okay half of it will go to private
entity and then half goes to that we try
to stay away from that but what you set
your limits and whatever prices you
think is reasonable and at the end of
the day let's say it's not moving then
you drop the price by fifty percent or
you give it away for free or whatever
you want to do but pretty much you know
if you go there I mean if you wanted to
sell me that Google jacket for dollar
I'll give you a dollar right now I mean
I mean I musical enemy but but you see
what i mean so those things are you set
the price on those things yourself and I
mean you may want to lure people that
hate doing this hour between 11 and 12
we're going to have giveaways and then
everybody's at Google's tanta then you
can give your stuff out so well yeah
we're you're as the creativity is
whatever you want it to be
we have a member has been on the
committee for the best yes yeah
I know that they yeah they think they
given money I believe yeah you know I
say the MTV is better than booze be any
competition
I think when you get out there you're
going to take a look at it and then now
no air out if you've ever been involved
with really you're going to at the end
of the day we're going to go my gosh
what an opportunity it was because the
information that you gain and you gather
from that that you'll take to your
friends in your own family are you my
big preach for me being a prostate
cancer is if you haven't been tested if
you're over 50 you need to get a PSA if
there's a history of prostate cancer in
your family you need to start that PSA
exam early all it is is the blood test
and I mean you'll be surprised that
after i do a presentation guys will come
up and says what symptoms that you have
or what should i do because you know
it's that gray area and it's so
important to get tested same thing with
breast cancer and same thing with a you
know colonoscopy and all those things
are important because that's the message
you really want to get out there
the more exposure you have for your
employees the more people say you know I
got that information from your cancer
story and you know the number one thing
is that people don't get involved you
know why is because nobody asked them
people say nobody asked me hey you want
to get involved really fly yeah what is
that about and then you say okay here it
is ok I'll be there the way I look at it
is if you don't ask is to know if you
ask there's a 50-50 chance of getting
your yes thank you financial support is
always good always good
we look forward to having Google's
because you guys are incredible i mean
the technology you have of me the little
giveaway bags that you gave imagine if
you had that at your campsite and said
hey for a buck a mystery bag I mean look
at that I mean people are going to be
paying a buck and then they get
something in there and then the mystery
bag there's something every tenth bagger
is a mystery bag that's like oh I got a
coffee mug or I got a t-shirt you're
either so many things that you have in
the immune system exactly the things
that are because you're in the company
you're within and you go you know I get
a word t-shirt go where this and and
what people on the outside go boo
imagine if I gave my badge away people
love it you know so I mean so we take
things for granted sometimes they're so
well thank you
cake I got a t-shirt say thank you very
much we really appreciate we usually
wrap up everything with the call option
which means we're going to challenge you
we want to see Google out there to be
the best campsite in there because you
have the technology you have look you
have the personality everybody here has
got a smile on their face everybody
looks hear that you got here for a
reason I mean look at the smile on that
face who's going to say no to you
exactly exactly and I think if you stay
with nine just just the information that
gets out you get out to the your company
is worth more than you can ever imagine
because if you can have one employee
that gets tested early and gets detected
early imagine that employee will be able
to work I came back to work six weeks
later imagine in my cancer hadn't been I
may not be have returned back to work so
I mean the city's really gained a lot by
having me tested early and things like
that so I mean look at the employee base
again just look to your right look to
your left somebody in your office is
going to have cancer we hope we hope
they don't but in reality the
probabilities are high and when you
least expect it happens I never expected
to be told that but thang
