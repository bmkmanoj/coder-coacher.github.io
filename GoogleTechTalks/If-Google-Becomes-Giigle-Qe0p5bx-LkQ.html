director of the human-computer
interaction lab at the University of
Maryland and I'm also an associate
professor in the College of Information
studies the mission of the college is
actually to transform that connection
that people have with information the
mission of the lab is to make that
transformation better with technology
now the mission of what my own research
is where I lead teams of faculty staff
and students is actually to transform
that connection with information for
people that are short children you've
heard of them right well it the purpose
of this talk is is to convince you that
Google needs to transform its mission it
needs to transform from google to giggle
and hopefully by the end of my talk you
will it will not be an if but it will be
a win okay so now let me begin with let
me begin with a question how do you
think kids could help Google well I
never start with questions with a room
full of adults sorry I only work with
children and adults together and so in
fact I have a team of children in our
lab two days a week in the afternoons
during the school year and two weeks
during the during the summer and these
children their seven to 11 years old
there with us a minimum of a year
maximum of five years and they are
design partners in all that we do so in
fact when I said I was going to go to
google and I was going to talk to you
about children I asked this question to
the team how do you think kids could
help Google and in fact those are
pictures of some of the team there right
there and so so what one child said oh
not a shock okay we you know we could
help Google because we're you know today
in future users and of course that goes
all the stats about who users are and
granted you've got more than enough
users so you really don't necessarily
need them right now but anyway but you
know the stats are all saying that six
to eleven year olds are actually among
the largest user groups on the internet
so all right so you're not necessarily
going to be convinced by that so and so
we said all right well what else can we
tell them huh and well Google hey we can
bring parents to Google and that
actually goes with the literature having
to do with in fact european and american
households if you look into their houses
with computers more children are more
likely to have computers in the
household with or versus households that
don't have computers without and they
don't have children all right so but you
guys you don't really need users do you
so who cares about that so um all right
well we got the next we got the next
comment and that was uh that was an
interesting one and if I can get there
we'll be all set kids could make google
giggle all right so what did this kid
mean she meant that that kids help us
think differently it's not about
efficiency it's not about how how fast
how small how much money it's about it's
about laughter it's about creativity
it's about cool it's about what's next
and kids help us think about things very
differently than adults do and an
example of giggling if you will is the
International Children's digital library
and that is a that was started out as a
research project funded by the National
Science Foundation the Institute of
Museum and Library Services it is now
also a non-profit foundation and
essentially it is not your grandmother's
digital library let me just tell you
that it is it's a digital library where
you don't see necessarily the shelves of
books all right
it is a digital library where if I want
to find all the all the books that have
read covers that our picture books that
can make me happy okay there you go I
dare you to do that in google my friends
okay and actually I generally get cheers
from audiences but this is a different
kind of audience anyway all right
because people have a hard time with
visualizing bullion okay and guess what
kids know how to visualize boolean they
helped us do it this is a digital
library it is the most frequently used
digital library in the world for
children it had it represents books in
39 languages I think with an interface
in 13 languages it is but it has books
that will make you laugh and make you
cry they have been donated they have
been donated from around the world
either by publishers authors national
libraries and so on now today I actually
want to actually read something in here
okay so I go and click on this
particular lovely book alright and and
not a shock these books have been
reviewed by other kids go even figure
about that okay and so Kwan a row in
Honduras has given head tells me about
the book books about a girl who wanted
to have a room of her own and how does
it make him feel happy gives it five
stars and even tell and even draws you a
part in the book that's his most
important part in the book so you should
make sure that you go and take a look at
that okay and if you want to find out
about how cool he is and what other
reviews he's done so there you have jose
raul he's
on himself he's he's reviewed these
other books and so on okay all right so
you're getting the idea that this
digital library has ideas in it and has
been designed with with kids and for
kids okay but let me go back to
presentation and on before I show you
how to read a book here for a reason all
right so okay so that's another reason
okay that's another reason how kids can
help Google you want to be creative all
right I got I got wasted for you to be
creative but one another child up come
back here home sorry another child ah
not losing I'm going going for the gusto
another child said now if you're not
nauseous by this time here we go uh
they're all right if google really wants
to change the world because she heard
all the press you guys put out about
Google wanting to change the world well
then changing a child's world helps okay
you know as you've all heard you know if
you want to change the future change one
child well there it is guys you can do
it you can do it with kids and it came
home for me when we worked with now you
can see this when we worked with
children in four countries we we've been
working with children in New Zealand
Honduras Germany and the inner city
Chicago and when we first started
designing the digital library we went to
them and we went to these kids there at
the time there were seven years old we
worked with them for four years um we
asked them if they could if they could
wave a magic wand over the library how
would you change it well this child in
inner city Chicago asked me what's a
magic wand turns out that his mother
never read to him he had learned to read
by reading people magazines in the
beauty shop that she worked in he had
never gone to a public library never
gone to a museum well I said okay let's
try that again
if you could change the library how
would you do it well he said oh that's
easy I put grass on the floor of the
library because I have never felt
comfortable or safe sitting in the grass
and reading a book and I have always
wanted to all right well granted we
could not put the grass on the floor of
every library in the world okay but from
that experience we also heard from
children around around the globe about
not search sorry guys i know i'm
standing in google and i'm saying not
search okay they talked about use they
talked about they talked about when I
have that relationship with the stuff
after I find it so I cannot sit on the
floor of my concrete of my concrete
library in Germany I can't we have
stairs in our library and so the girls
in my class in the wheelchair can't get
up the stairs these are the things
children talked about and so what this
did was granted as I said we could not
change bricks and mortar but we could
change we could change how children read
books on the screen and so now if I go
back to if I go back to the digital
library I say to you this is not um
Adobe okay this is not your Adobe Reader
basically children children that we
worked with not only said we need to see
the book in a different way than we've
seen it before and I don't know how many
of you ever watched a kid read a book
but especially the younger ones they
usually want to start oh I want to start
in the part where it's a family that's
all you know hanging out and doing
really cool things so you know so I want
to start in the middle or the kids
actually you know or I can't tell you
how many times kids just flip through a
book because they're trying to select it
and so and so we have multiple book
readers
because kids have different reasons for
looking through a book there is no
digital library in the world today that
has multiple book readers they haven't
watched people really reading ok so this
happens to be now some some kids love it
some kids hate it this is like reading a
book on a merry go rounds all right I
warn you so for those of faint of heart
we'll we'll go slowly but anyway what
you're doing here is you're flipping
through many kids will not read a book
and ok and then I want to zoom in on
that book and and so on so i can
actually really look at the really look
at the pictures and so on and really
look at the text i can do that too but
many kids actually have different
purposes for reading and and the way
they go about reading these books so we
have multiple book group book viewers
and we found that it's pretty evenly
split as to what they use and when they
use it and that's why we continue to
have it in fact we actually had
originally looked at these multi book
viewers and sort of said well which
one's going to win because that's the
one we'll put up there and ultimately
none one and none lost and then we
realize they used them for different
things and that's where he went with it
ok back to back to this so i think
you're getting the idea that children
are not short adults alright um they see
the world very differently alright in
terms of how they in terms of their
challenges and their opportunities they
don't see abstractions the way we do and
understand hierarchies and and they
don't have the ability to keyboard the
way we all think everyone was born from
the womb to do so ok and the diverse
motor skills you cannot even imagine how
painful it is to watch a five-year-old
that knows exactly what they want on the
screen and they're searching and they're
browsing and they can't hit the target
because the silly buttons are too small
so we've done a lot of research in how
big the button should be and so on
there's also varying abilities in terms
of search and browse and I'm sure you've
all figured out that kids nest don't
necessarily search in certain ages they
really are doing an extended browse
because actually left to their own
devices children will most most
frequently browse than anything and
certainly their selection criteria is so
different than ours all right how many
kids do you know of at six go and say
hey this is the author and the title and
the ISBN number and all that's no it
doesn't exist you know I want to find
the purple book and it's happy and I
know there's a character one of the
things we actually from our research
we've seen is this that the interface
much must age itself that these children
search very differently by age and so
yes thirty-five to forty five year olds
they don't care the difference between
the interfaces but there is such a
difference in ten years of children that
there that you can't actually have the
ability for for kids to search the same
ways and they don't want to so younger
boys and girls will primarily look for
things with in a physical looking for
the physical properties of the book
whereas boys older boys in general will
look by genre and by and by the the way
the characters are all right more on
that later all right now how do we know
what we know it's not because we you
know stuck her microphone in a kid's
mouth and said hey talk to me kid it's
not that way we actually we partner with
children and we've been partnering with
them on from it for many years almost a
decade and what we have done is adapted
our adopted Apted the co.design and
participatory design methods of our scan
Denis Scandinavian colleagues and here
in the United States to work with
children we call it cooperative inquiry
got lots of papers on that we'll talk
about that later but and we've worked
with many companies as well as
organizations and other universities
have have picked this up as well is
the notion of how do you work with kids
in a way that's appropriate that gives
them a voice in the design process I'm
going to touch on a few of those things
sorry that my colleague Shelley isn't
here to see my design processes um
because she would she would see some
similarities and some definite
differences we work with kids not after
the adult had the great idea and say so
what do you think huh good color isn't
that a nice thing to do ok no we work
with kids for the moment we start a
project from the moment there we start
ideation and we do this in a number of
different ways so if we just focus on
that yes we use sticky notes with kids
yeah we do that with kids and adults
because it's about the elaboration
process of understanding because kids
understand certain things but adults do
too so we don't want to leave the adults
out it's about that partnership together
and so what we do as many times well as
a company will come in and say we needs
a feedback loop on this and so we'll ask
our kids and adults in the lab we
generally have six to seven kids in the
lab and and generally four to five
adults as well whether they be graduate
students or staff or faculty and we say
okay likes what are the light what do
you like about this stuff what do you
dislike one idea per sticky note and
also if you have any design ideas we
never ever have a what we call sticky
note session where nothing clumps
somehow it's amazing adults kids
together we start to see trends always
and and actually this does work with
adults too so those people that really
don't want to care about kids we've just
done that this at the u.s. Holocaust
Museum and have been working with them
on a full full lab experience so I'll
tell you about that another time anyway
um then we might go into what we call
low-tech prototyping bags of stuff art
supplies sketching ideas kids adults we
all know how to do this
what we do is we don't just sit back and
say hey kid do all the work ok and I'll
and I'll figure out what you've got
there what we do is we do we build these
things together we sketch ideas together
we do it with crazy things like cotton
balls and pipe cleaners and so on why it
frees our brain waves and again we've
done this with adults only and we've
done this with kids and adults but it's
it's something where everybody can have
a voice in the process then there's then
we get to the loop then we get to the
big ideas and so what happens is will
present these ideas okay in fact they're
talking to a screen right now what are
our virtual companions where we have a
video conference all the time one of the
companies we work with and and so we're
presenting our ideas and as we present
our ideas some one of us starts writing
down what we call the big ideas what are
the ideas that are coming out of each of
the prototype and then what we'll do is
a group is start to circle some of the
things that is the same between will
generally have two to three groups
working at any given time on a project
we'll look at those we'll look at those
trends and then we may redo the cycle
another time so what you're doing is
you're looking at an upside-down cone of
information all right you're going from
the most general anything in the world
is great and then you're going to more
specifics and then yes we actually do
build things like these these guys here
in in wonderful places and so anyway we
also do observation however it depends
on the project whether or not we do
observation one of the one of the
projects we worked on was actually
creating a collaborative a collaborative
storytelling tool for children in fact
i'm using it right now and I sure you
figured out i'm not using power points
at this point right anyway it is called
kid pat and essentially we worked on it
it was supported by the european union
and with colleagues in Sweden and
England and
essentially we started off by trying to
understand what were the problems with
kids storytelling on the computer and so
we went and we did I don't know how many
of you are familiar with Karen hold
splats contextual inquiry we do a
bastardized version of hers I fact gave
a talk with that we gave back-to-back
talks recently at NIH in Washington DC
and the two of us looked at each other
and said oh this is going to be
interesting because we don't do the same
kinds of thing but anyway so essentially
we collect the raw data in whether it's
video taped or not or where they were
sitting right there someone's looking at
the quote somebody's looking at the
activities so in this particular case
Fatima is saying no you're only you're
only erasing all the timeliness top and
then Lena says to the adult can you help
me on trying to draw a circle and Fatima
says wait I know how and and then Lena
says hello I want to move it here and
Fatima says get the red and intra so
they're they're killing each other
they're really killing each other okay
and so the activities that are going on
here is that you know they're
essentially the adults there but Lee
Lena is trying to take the mouse for
from Fatima it's not pretty um so on all
right then we go to do data analysis and
what and this is what's different about
our contextual inquiry we're looking for
less granular kinds of things than Karen
would look look at we're looking at the
activity patterns and the activity
patterns looked at struggle for
ownership shock and control the input
device and seeking help we looked at
roles to see what was going on here and
yes leader leader learner leader so but
and then what we do is we have a column
of design ideas and we start to note the
kinds of things that we think might
support this and multiple input devices
collaborative software came out very
strongly and making ownership options
unfortunately our colleagues at
Microsoft have since locked us out of
the innards of the operating system so
we cannot do the kinds of things we did
back in 99 and 2000 but Soviet it was an
interesting exercise anyway um so but
meanwhile you say to yourself well what
are the kids
doing in the lab the kids are observing
other kids yes we have the inmates
observing each other so what we do is um
the kids are actually drawing in fact
they are creating cartoon kinds of
things and and what you get from the
kids is spot on a spotlight on the most
important things all right you must do
it like this I don't want to you know
and so that's you know so what we do is
we get multiple points of view of the
same experience um so ciao challenge yes
is this easy to always work with
children um well yeah it's it's it's a
challenge um why well because kids don't
think don't really want to believe you
that that you are that you're really
going to do that this is not an exercise
there's no right answers we don't teach
that to our kids anymore do we we do we
tell them that every there's a right
answer and you must be drilled on this
the other thing is is for the adult side
of the world is to try and truly
convince them they need to partner there
are some adults there's that talk over
the kids and you want to and you want to
sit say there sit there and say there
hey hey let let them help let them be a
part of it it's the elaboration process
actually though we've had many
colleagues come and try and learn the
process and sit back and observe and
they don't understand that it is a
partnership experience between between
the kids the goal its elaboration I have
a good idea then you're going to
elaborate on and say but hey wait we
could also do this and then she's going
to say but if we do that then we can do
this the goal is to not know whose idea
ultimately was alright so a few examples
besides the one I'm using right here to
demonstrate um I really bored the heck
out of her didn't I anyway okay um it's
good there were packed house at least
for you guys anyway um yeah yeah it's
true it's true anyway um so here's a
couple more examples of the kinds of
things we've done um
have been partnering with the National
Park Service and in thinking about not
just what happens when people go home
from a park experience but what happens
how can technology enhance that Park
experience as we go along in the park
and so we start out as we always do
sitting around with our partners talking
about it and one kid says I think better
when I see trees and sky the big ideas
just want to come out so in other words
guess what kids don't think just when
they're in the classroom or when they
have to do the homework it actually has
to do with when we're outside another
one said I want to help the adults know
what I want to know we could show them
the cool places and then they could tell
us what we didn't know hmm think about
that another one said what if we could
send secret messages to other people in
the path okay so these were some of the
beginning ideas we came up with outside
of showing you the whole design process
um this is this was partially supported
by microsoft we use tablet PCs and the
idea was that we had a network outside
an outside network wireless network with
tablet pcs that we developed this is
gene shipments dissertation work that
he's been leading in fact he'll defend
it on Monday he's ready to kill me
because I'm here right now anyway um and
and basically gene developed rfid reader
into the tablet you have multiple kids
or families with tablets and they are
wandering a path and it's not just about
who else put that who else put tags on
things it's these kids have the tags
they put them on things and they start
to they start to draw they start to draw
about something so but you're saying
yourself so big deal i've seen tagging
before it's the notion of collaboration
it's the notion of creation right there
in context that these kids don't have to
go back to a classroom or a house to
actually think about what they've just
done they're doing it in context so
Jonah might draw the leaf but then he's
gone and someone comes along
his tagging and sees that the park
ranger actually asked why is this leaf
still green and so somebody actually
answers it and it's saying it's still
growing another one comes along and
notices and said but it's always green
you know so they're having this you know
kind of collaborative talk going on um
we actually piloted this em to the to
the greater public in Rock Creek
National Park and and so there you see
Diane that's actually she's talking
about that leaf and what she did was
that once the kids were done with what
they were looking at on the trail then
she went and gave a specialized tour of
the trail based on what the kids said
and elaborated on that but just like
everyone else in the world we have gone
to mobiles and and handhelds I'm shocked
right it is the computing platform of
the 21st century and it is the notion of
his notion of Keeping Up with kids so
we've been this is the dissertation work
of Jerry fails and we were at Fort
McHenry National Park doing what we call
mobile collaboration now mobile
collaboration is the notion that guess
what collaboration doesn't just happen
asynchronously distributed Lee it can
happen when I'm I have a mobile you have
a mobile and that we may want to share
information not sending it back and
forth we want to do content splitting or
we want to do content sharing and so and
so in the National Park we can create
stories together mobile stories together
by in context so we're not going back
from a field trip and having to having
to deal with that we this is this work
has definitely motivated us when it
comes to the digital library and so we
are trying to understand and we've been
and we have actually put in some
proposals to actually work with children
in Multan developing countries because
guess what those are the things they had
they don't have these they don't have
tablet PCs they have mobiles and what
happens if you they want to if they want
to actually read a book on a mobile
what does that look like how do you
share a story together and then fact
there are many many ways we can do it
that we've been exploring all right now
needless to say we've learned a great
deal from our design experiences in
terms of what to create but we've also
learned a great deal from our research
of the impact of these new technologies
on on on children and their use these
are just some examples of the kinds of
things we've been learning and obviously
everything's impressed so you know that
that's to be expected but anyway in
terms of mobile devices something that
Jean found many results from his work
but what was quite telling was that he
did a comparison of a paper a paper
version of these tablet pcs with
comparing the paper to the to the actual
technology and he found that the paper
was more personal but the technology was
collaborative what do you mean by that
it's as soon as they got paper they
wrote their name on it okay um they
didn't write their names on things when
uh when it was on the computer and guess
what there was very little of kids
writing on each other's papers didn't we
haven't we haven't we beaten that out of
them now you say to herself oh yeah well
seven or eight year olds not going to do
that he did this with kids that were
four and five years old amazing now the
technology side of things oh they were
writing all over each other stuff
constantly but nobody put there no one
kid may have put their name on on a
drawing but almost nobody almost nobody
actually did drew on wrote their name
and saw it as a personal thing in terms
of digital libraries we've just finished
our for country study in working with
these kids in in Honduras New Zealand
Germany and the United States and we've
seen that over time that yes the digital
library is very motivating for reading
especially for kids that that are not
that are reluctant readers we've seen
there is a strong cultural awareness
that books from different countries
can bring it doesn't matter if they
can't read the text they start to think
about the stories of other people they
start to try and understand what these
people are saying and certainly there we
saw a wider wider variety books read and
in terms of search you'll recognize the
the person's name here Hilary Hutchinson
who was our star graduate student that
you stole from us anyway she yes yes
maybe I spelled it wrong I don't know
but anyway uh killer Hilary got her PhD
with us and in fact that that interface
of simple search is actually the work of
Hillary and and a team of our team and
one of the things she saw was that flat
interfaces are much better for children
searchin she can probably give you tons
of detail more about this than i can but
anyway and in closing lessons learned
there is no such thing as a k-12
interface sorry it doesn't exist anyone
that does research and tells you and
tells you it's um this is great for k-12
no in fact we are disabling our children
by creating one interface for for them
to use and in fact Google you're doing a
great job of disabling the world's
children because they had yes that's
absolutely true you've got a lot of kids
that's that whose parents say let's
google it and they can't type or they
can't spell it or they don't even
understand what do you mean they can't
read it but they know they can search it
all right and so we've got so the
interface that you create for three for
a three to five year old has got to be
different from an interface from from an
interface for six to eight year old in
fact we have at least four ways to
search in the digital library I did not
show you all those ways but we have a
globe that spins the youngest children
just spin the globe they click on a
place and then they found books okay
that's in the and then it's somewhere
around third grade it starts to congeal
on simple search the interesting thing
is um is that
somehow the adults don't necessarily go
to the adult interface they seem to stay
in simple search anyway we definitely
see that taking learning experiences
wherever the children go is absolutely
important it's not again it's not about
going back to the home to create
something it is we are we are mobile we
are active and and that is the computing
platform and so if we expect people to
plug their things into computers that's
not happening it's not going to happen
it's at one of the things we've seen
again and again even when we weren't
looking for it is that we is that
children want to come together they they
are they want to collaborate they are
not just wanting to their social beings
and certainly we've all heard about you
know distributed collaboration but that
shoulder to shoulder collaboration
children clump in front of technology it
is it it is an own experience and so we
need to bring kids together and the idea
of kids understanding each other's
cultures understanding where they're
coming from absolutely critical because
maybe then a kid from one country is
going to understand that I have some of
some of the same feelings and I have
some of the same you know fears that
another kid from another country has and
that's that's critical the way we should
be doing this is not dragging children
into the world of computers okay it's
not okay to make to make automated
toilets for children all right what do I
mean by that I mean that anyone that's
been a mother or a father that has seen
a poor a potty training child sit on a
toilet and the absolutely fearful that
they were being sucked in because of
sensors that we have created that are
appropriate sensors for adults that's
what we're doing we are making automated
toilets with our computing technologies
for adults okay could I say it any
stronger all right and lastly so how do
we do it we need to drag computers into
a child's world and when we do this
guess what it may be good for it may be
good for the adult kids all of us it's
like sidewalk sidewalk cutouts we did
for wheelchairs but able-bodied people
do drag their groceries / sidewalk
cutouts you know what i mean by sidewalk
times yeah and you know and we're at
bikers use it we did it for the disabled
but it's good for all of us and so what
I what I would contend in what I would
ask all of you that's left in the room
to consider is that Google really can
become giggle and absolutely go beyond
much more where it is today not only for
children but for the whole world so with
that I'll take questions thank you
mobiles in the five point there reading
54 popular in the future yes it's a and
I like the idea that it's kind of being
on these things I was curious about
looking into both of your guys um
is that you see that happening the
people are reading on mobile devices
and that this is just the way we're all
good about all with us there is no other
option that's right and certainly in a
very developed context premier they're
really not going to meet men of those
really yeah i mean omit the worlds and
this one could be a little whether such
a strange strangers people are these two
easy to say you know the bar is just
information for excitement by teresa
technologies kids like that but the
interface i have to tell you oh um
anyway but the interfaces are wrong
still and um in fact we're focusing on
those interfaces now interview and so
ideas go sorry busy yes we do we do yeah
all right so um give me two gimmicks
your phones wha ok all right ok yo holla
phone yeah all right man it's red to
watch out that woman okay so i have a
book alright i have a book and and i
found it on the international children's
visual library shock okay and Robin says
oh I want to read that book too with you
now it's not just sending the book page
how can we see the screen if we put it
together imagine we have double screen
all right now ok now if you need your
mobile come on you come over here with
it now you come over here
okay all right and now we start and now
we start moving now you say to yourself
okay big deal we're you know we're
doubling pixels okay so what else can we
do content splitting what do I mean to
experience text their picture here I can
hear we can hear it all together it's
collaborative reading it's collaborative
readings because kids do that in fact um
there's a lot of if you if you will
watch kids ok I'll give you back your
phone but yours is much nicer than mine
so anyway and you know I'm clearly
living in the wrong place anyway um but
no it's absolutely basic there are many
in fact we were we developed the initial
the initial work and you know filed a
file a patent and so on but um that's
why I can say hi anyway but the idea is
that the notion of our collaboration in
in context we've got to be much more
creative because it's all the screens
are only going to get so big the content
is going to get more and more so what
can you do with zooming what can you do
with a Content splitting what can you do
with various different things and so we
and and so we've been working on that
and this is the dissertation of Jerry
fails that we've been essentially our
team's been working on yeah
games in Japan yep yeah but a lot of it
it's very interested a lot of it is very
distributed a lot of it is
point-to-point okay I'm sending
something to you you're sending
something to me there is that not that
notion of how do we have it together
though we have but though we do
understand that kids do we'll all be on
the same thing at the same time okay and
and will be literally looking at each
other's screens kind of thing but it is
um I you know I i would say that there's
a lot to be learned from the gaming
world a lot to be learned it's just a
question of it's a question of what can
we take what can we take and what um I
guess the other thing too is that
there's a fair amount of twitch okay and
so the the notion of how good is twitch
for certain for certain constituents
certain types of users it's not it's not
that simple you know the the twitching
the okay I'm sorry um the the pressing
the buttons so certain buttons are
certain thing it can can do certain
things on the games okay and so it there
are certain users that are much better
at this than than other users faster no
I understand it totally depends on game
and it also depends on you know and now
finally there are more games that are
bringing more genders into more genders
there's only two but anyway bringing on
instead of any kind of metrics that
someone's here for you to let that go
with the proper funding yes absolutely
yeah I we at we do have we have a
conceptual framework for thinking about
it but needless to say it's it's
something that's much larger than what
we've been able to do any other well it
is exactly that's right but thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
