Michael
walking here to to give us a talk today
dr. Michael walking is a very
distinguished career he's currently
managing scientist at exponent a
publicly traded scientific consulting
company here in menlo park he's
well-known personality he's been
national quoted on CNN nbc's dateline
and ABC world news and he's written
several books including what are the
odds the chance in a chance in everyday
life he's consulting for clients in both
government and private sector including
the FBI and Las Vegas Vegas oddsmakers
his software has also been featured in
the January 2002 the issue of wired
magazine so here is today let's give a
good Google welcome to Mike and could I
please ask that because this we talk is
being video recorded any confidential
Google questions should be left till
after the cameras have been switched off
thank you okay thanks Eddie um so today
well the title of my talk and I'm happy
to be here is a chance data mining and
sports betting and we'll see what those
things have in common I am currently
located in an exponent if you haven't
heard of it it's sometimes called
exponent failure analysis it's located
right on 101 north in memo park it's
publicly traded company that has about
800 employees in 18 offices and three
international offices and consultants
that exponent a majority of whom were
engineers have expertise in science
science math and engineering and
exponent has been consulted on various
problems and disasters including some of
the major once you read about in the
paper such as the grounding of the Exxon
Valdez the walkway collapse of the
Kansas City Hyatt the bombing of the
Alfred P murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City
Wayne this talk just stop me at any time
if you have any questions and we'll have
a couple more of a conversational tone
so I'm in the what's called the data and
risk analysis group and I'm trained as a
statistician and do stuff in probability
theory decision theory game theory and
our group develops strategies for
decision making under uncertainty and
around a variety of context one of the
things our group specializes in is
determining whether a particular
activity or product poses an
unreasonable risk and if so what to do
about it and many of our projects
involve litigation involving such things
as consumer product issues and recalls
automotive lawsuits and doing risk
analyses and failure analyses to try to
develop strategies for companies who
have products and I can't really go into
some too much detail about things that
are in litigation right now but that's
not what I want to talk about anyway I
want to talk about one of my specialties
which is chance and gambling games and
I'll actually to be talking about
actually a case that as an exponent case
along with some software and things that
are not exponent things just things I've
done so first it was going to this is a
little primer on gambling so roulette
how many of you been to a casino and
I've seen a roulette wheel okay most of
you so let's a pretty simple game to
understand there are 38 sections labeled
from 1 to 36 along with the 0 and a
double 0 and half of the sections are
written from 1 to 36 or read half our
black 0 and double zero or green you can
bet on a color you can bet on a
combination of numbers you can make
varieties of bets at the roulette table
and one of them that's is number 17 in
other words you put some chips on number
17 will respond the ball
dropped in 17 the ball lands in the slot
marked 17 you win otherwise you lose and
censor 38 sections on the wheel your
chance of winning is one in 38 if you
bet on red since there are 18 read
sections out of 38 your chance of
winning is 18 out of 38 so you're much
more likely to win a red bet than you
are a bet on number 17 so to get people
to make this bet what does the casino
have to do they have to offer higher
payoff odds and so the payoff odds for
this bet a bet on a particular number
are 35 to 1 that means if you bet a
dollar and number 17 comes up you'll
make a $35 profit you'll get your dollar
chip back plus another 35 well there's a
mathematical theorem called the law of
averages it's called the law of large
numbers by mathematicians and it says
that if you repeat an experiment
independently over and over again the
fraction of times that something comes
up will be the same as the probability
of it happening in one trial so the
probability of it happening in one trial
on this bed is one in 38 so you don't
know what's going to happen in one bed
or two bets or a few bets but in
repeated bets you'll win an average of
one in 38 and lose an average of 37 for
a net loss of two dollars so that's two
dollars and thirty eight dollars bet
which becomes five point three percent
profit for the house house being the
casino so that's called a house edge and
roulette and it's very straightforward
cut-and-dry math this is what happens if
you repeatedly make a bet anyway like I
said you can get lucky you can get
unlucky and lose sooner then at this
rate or you can win and quit but in
repeated play you will eventually lose
and go broke it roughly the rate of five
point three cents per dollar bet sooner
if you have a losing
okay so that's the those are that's sort
of the facts on betting on number 17 in
roulette and in fact I'm making just
about any roulette pet or combination of
roulette pets or other betting strategy
applied to roulette so you can show
mathematically that this is what happens
period for instance people use very some
sort of sophisticated strategies like
double your money if you lose and keep
going until you eventually win you heard
that one the double up strategy so you
start out by betting a dollar and if you
lose you bet two dollars and then if you
lose again you bet four dollars and
eventually you win there by covering
your losses okay so that's an
interesting strategy that people use in
various types of investment situations
namely if you start losing bet more and
you can show that that's not a good
thing to do and in fact it's really not
a good thing to do in a losing game and
one of the reasons it's not a good thing
to do is it because the house has a
betting limit and if you have an unlucky
sequence of losses you can't double your
bet because they want what you bet that
much and other problem is that you have
a vetting limit if you have an unlucky
sequence of losses you might run out of
money before you can double your bet and
come out ahead anyway so that's the sort
of the quick tour of roulette now if you
talk about roulette betters you could
say roulette better who makes a profit
after ten bets would be lucky but a
long-run profit would be very weird the
math says that's not it's really
unlikely to happen so a possible
explanation where somebody makes a
long-run profit and roulette they're
cheating so they have some scheme worked
out and they're not really playing
according to the regular roulette odds
on the other hand you can also detect if
a roulette better is losing more than he
or she should in fact if we let better
lose
is losing after ten bets so what they're
unlucky but if they lose in the long run
and repeat it that's faster than they
should faster than chance predicts 5.3
cents per bet that would also be weird
that would be equally weird as weird as
the winner and then possible explanation
for that the better is being cheated
okay so there are two different kinds of
weird weird good and weird bad okay but
anyway where do you draw the line
between luck and something else is going
on so statisticians that sort of the
basic question of statistical inference
traditionally five percent is a cut-off
point which is called statistically
significant if what you observe as less
than a five percent chance of happening
under ordinary circumstances you
conclude that something else is going on
so in roulette it's simple you can make
probability calculations and answer the
statistical question is what you've seen
weird or is it just within the bounds of
chance okay what about betting on
football games what's a chance at the
49ers will win next week well 49ers
started out looking pretty good in their
first couple of games but what's going
to happen next week well football is not
like roulette the same experiment is not
repeated under identical independent
conditions and so the law of averages
and various probability models don't
necessarily apply so you can't make
these cut-and-dried mathematical
statements about the persistent football
better goes broke which you can say
about roulette or craps or keno or any
of the casino games of pure chance okay
well football betting is an interesting
industry it's about a 10 billion dollar
industry right now almost entirely
illegal and the
surveys are good direct trade
organizations that do surveys and find
out in fact i'll give you a link in a
minute it's a good question but they're
illegal in the here's one answer they're
illegal football betting is legal in
this country except in Nevada okay
football betting is legal just about
everywhere else in the world so internet
gambling is very popular and internet
gambling is legal except here so that's
sort of an interesting legal issue as
you probably know because if you bet on
a football game here you're violating
some federal law but you're playing in
an online casino that's perfectly legal
that's located in Costa Rica or Jamaica
or Canada so legal is sort of a strange
term in this world but yeah how do you
come up with a number like that so there
are trade organizations that do surveys
and find out things like that okay so a
typical football bet not all the typical
football bed is done with a point spread
so a point spread is a handicap given to
the inferior team and who decides it's
an inferior team well in some sense the
betters decide so here's how it works
I'm going to go to the third bullet
point first week of the season the 49ers
played Arizona and the Niners were nine
point underdogs so that means if you bet
on the Niners in that first week you get
nine free points tacked onto their score
so turns out San Francisco lost that
first game 34 to 27 but if you add nine
points the niners win so people who bet
on the 49ers in that first game won
their bets and the people who bet on
Arizona even though arizona won the game
lost
so that's fine now the casino has to
make a profit so they pay 10 to 11 odds
so that means if you make an 11 dollar
bet on with the point spread and you win
you make a ten dollar profit so now why
does that mean how does that make how
does that ensure that the casino is
going to make some money well what the
odds makers want to do is get the same
amount of money to be bet on each team
in the game and if that happens because
of the 10 to the 11 odds the losers
losers pay off the winners and there's a
little bit money left over for the
casino so if there are two betters on a
game and each bets eleven dollars that's
$22 bet and one wins the other losses so
the 10 pain is paid off out of the 11
that's a dollar left for the casino one
out of twenty two is four and a half
percent so if the casino gets an even
split of the money on a game then they
make a four and a half percent profit on
that game it doesn't matter which team
wins so that's what they want to do now
if one team has an eighty percent chance
of winning and the other team has a
twenty percent chance of winning
whatever that means but everybody likes
the twenty percent team then the point
spread is going to be shifted so to get
more money bet on the team that really
should be the one that everybody's
betting on so the betting public is
foolish the point spread may give a
statistical advantage to the smart
better who knows that they're betting on
the wrong the money's coming in on the
wrong team so that's different from
roulette on the other hand if the
betting public is different roulette in
the sense that it's sort of like the
stock market the the odds are determined
by the public and if the public doesn't
know what they're doing the better who
does know what he or she's doing can
take advantage of that situation on the
other hand if the betting public is
smart equalizing the betting action will
also equalize each team's chance of
winning and the game will be equivalent
to a coin toss
okay so you don't want to get 10 to 11
knots we're betting on a coin to us so
in order to win in the long run you have
to find situations that in which the
betting public isn't smart in other
words in which your chance of winning is
greater than fifty percent so it turns
out that if you just look at some basic
situations like how often does the home
team win well if you look at the years
1993 to the present the home team
actually wins the game almost sixty
percent of the time but when you factor
in the point spread it's almost a 50-50
split so if you just think I'm we're
just going to bet on a home team this i
know they win sixty percent of the time
you're going to lose because the point
spread completely equalizes that okay so
what do people do well in one form or
another a lot of sports bettors do data
mining of course some of them don't
actually use software they just pour
through data by hand but nowadays there
are a lot of sophisticated sports
bettors who actually use software and so
you know in general data mining software
is used to find predictive patterns and
large data sets so people use data
mining for all kinds of things
investment strategies web surfing
patterns just to try to find patterns
and I wrote some software to search
football data that all it sort of points
out some the issues of data mining and I
was actually motivated by badgering from
some attorney friends who were avid
sports bettors and didn't like doing all
the stuff by hand and they thought it
would be great to automate the process
of trying to find good betting
situations okay so I did that a couple
years ago and it basically uses sequel
to query a football database it has a
user-friendly interface necessary for
lawyers there's a procedure in the
software that automatically generates
queries so it does random queries and it
finds good results and saves them in a
separate file and just forgets about bad
results where good means better than
coin tossing
and so it uncovers trends or possibly
uncovers trends that the user wouldn't
think of there's no best strategy when
you look at when you look for patterns
like this but instead you try to collect
a bunch of good strategies such as now
it turns out that by data mining from
2002 2006 the Baltimore Ravens were 17
and three versus the point spread that's
an eighty-five percent success record
when they lost our previous game and
their opponents play their previous game
on the road so the question of course is
for any thoughtful data miner is this
really meaningful or is it just a random
coincidence that you found by data
mining so first of all you have to
define what a good strategy is win
percentage doesn't work because one in
zero is one hundred percent and that's
course meaningless 17 and three is only
eighty-five percent so as I mentioned a
minute ago one way to define good or
weird or out of the ordinary is to
compare the strategy to an appropriate
probability distribution in this case
coin tossing so you see if the strategy
does a lot better than coin tossing and
it turns out that that's seven and three
record of the Ravens if you toss it if
that's really coin tossing if in other
words if it's just a random fluke and
the chance of getting something like
that is about one in a thousand so just
use the binomial distribution for those
of you know basic probability
distributions a chance of getting 17 and
three or better out of 20 is about one
in a thousand so a statistician would
reject the null hypothesis which means
you would say that's not just chance so
in other words that that would be
considered in some context a good
strategy so the question is should you
bet on Baltimore in this situation
okay well interestingly enough
technology changes the meaning of
unlikely and contexts and situations
like this and there's something called
the law of very large numbers which says
given enough opportunity weird things
happen just due to chance so when you're
mining through data doing lots of
queries saving the good ones by good i
mean good compared to coin tossing
discarding the bad ones the meaning of
one in a thousand sort of changes a
little bit so in fact using a modest pc
the particular data mining software does
about a thousand queries a minute when
it's doing the automated query thing
it's picking generating queries of
random analyzing to see if they're
better than coin tossing saving them in
a file if they are anyway that's lots of
opportunity for weird things to happen
just due to chance so even if you
generate this data by tossing coins
you'll find 17 and three result about
once a minute and you can turn this on
and let it run all night so you can find
all kinds of great stuff okay so
statisticians consider something
statistically significant if the chance
of occurring is less than one in 20
under suitable hypothesis in the data
mining environment even one in a
thousand doesn't necessarily mean rule
out chance so more generally these kinds
of techniques in which you're doing
repeated queries and analyzing them is
cirno comes under the general heading of
multiple comparisons you're testing lots
of statistical hypotheses at once and
what happens is you'll find you might
find some useful things you might find
some strategies in which you'll win
money but you a lot of the stuff you're
going to find is just random stuff so
that's one of the issues with it's one
of the big issues when you're doing
things like data mining of this type
that you have to deal with and of course
there are plenty of there are some
standard procedures for dealing with
that the main REM
is you apply your strategy that you've
developed by looking at some data to a
fresh set of data and see how it works
there so with a statistician we'll call
it or decision theorists you have a
training sample and then a new data set
that you'd apply your thing to and so
then even if so if it just due to chance
for mining the training said it won't
work on the new data or you can do a
simulation do a lot of random queries
and compare your results to a
probability model so for example if
you're doing a lot of random queries on
this football data and you're comparing
the you draw a graph of the results you
should see a record of 17 and 3
occurring about with a frequency of
about one in a thousand if it's just due
to chance if you get some weird pattern
in your histogram or whatever graph
you're looking at then maybe there's
something other than coin tossing going
on any questions so far
useful
that's exactly what a lot of people do
except for the part about winning one it
turns out that the 10 to 11 odds are a
little bit deceptive and you have to win
more than 50 two-point-four percent of
the time in order to make a profit
because of that and so that that is a
standard strategy people get they either
by hand or using software find lots of
these types of situations that look like
they give you an edge and they'll just
bet on them and they'll we even rape
them like this one's really good and so
a bit more on the one that's really good
and the one that's just sort of good and
I think some people are modestly
successful doing things like that any
other questions ok um so let's see an
earlier version of the software was
featured in Wired magazine in 2002 in
the street cred section but let's
actually look at the software for a sec
I can get it up here so this is the it's
called the optimizer and so let's say
you want so let's say you want to see
how the home team does from so it has
this sort of user-friendly interface
2001 to 2006 in the month of September
can you see that I guess you can sort of
see it you get the statistics and you
can see that the home team from 2001 to
the present not including last week's
games so su means straight up their 144
110 they won about 50 to lower close to
fifty seven percent of their games but
versus the point spread there almost
5050 at home this is just a home team
and this Z value is sort of that's the
measure of how far away from coin
tossing it is Z value a large Z value
means very unlikely under coin tossing
there's another kind of bed and football
called the over/under where you try to
guess what the total score were you bet
on the total score whether the total
score will be over or under a particular
number so you this
software keeps track of that too ok so
if I wanted to look at a particular team
let's look at Atlanta how do they do in
September ok so atlanta is five and
three on the road for and four at home
versus the spread in September and so on
suppose I wanted to see which team was
that had the best September record
looking at all records of this type I
just click optimize and i see that
jacksonville is actually 12 and 4 versus
the spread in September which gives them
us sitting so that's another one of
these good records and so you can also
look at what happened to in the last
game one or loss so let's look at games
where see come back to take that off the
home team just playing around here won
their last game and played at home in
their last game how did they do and so
pretty much 5050 against the spread so
this is this gives this is basically
just a statement of the query up here
okay then you can also look at a list of
the games for that query so it's just a
query output and then this part here
gives you certain situations that
accesses the file that stores good
situations okay so now the automated
part let's say you want to i'm going to
clear this let's say you want to look at
just i'm going to restrict the year
range 2002 2006 let's see if we can find
any good strategies for I don't know the
Niners so I'm just going to click random
search so it's looking for good
strategies for the 49ers and that search
count tells how many queries it's looked
at and analyzed and it's only saving the
ones with Z values greater than 2.5 and
so far it hasn't found anything oops
there it found one
let it run for another couple seconds
too so it's found two strategies let's
just look at the best one so and this is
a strategy the 49ers from 2000 to the
present when their opponents last game
was on the road and the opponent's last
game was under that means not a lot of
points were scored then the 49ers on the
road or two and 13 verses the spread
with two ties that's a Z value of 2.84
so what that suggests is when this
situation comes up you bet against the
niners because they're too and 13 okay
and then here's a list of all those 49er
games and then as I said you can look at
the save situations in there another
thing you can do with the software is
you can get updates from the web so if
you click on that it will actually
automatically download the scores of
this weekend point spreads for this week
and you can manage this situations that
means the good strategies you've already
found you can share it with other people
you can import last year's so on you can
also print out any of this stuff so I
don't have many save situations but if I
wanted to look at all the games in the
first in September I can go h1 and so I
don't think anything's on here but let's
see I'll just look real quickly all
right so if you have a lot of some
people use this software have thousands
of situations it'll find the ones that
apply to a particular game so anyway so
the part about this software that's that
I think sort of interesting is the
random search thing and that
just an automated voice automated query
generator okay so any questions yeah
yeah so that's anniversary question and
veteran we were missing with that for a
while so a genetic algorithm would be
sort of taking a good strategy looking
at the parameters of a good strategy
like what won or lost so let's say that
that Baltimore strategy they won when
there when they lost the last week and
their opponent was whatever so you have
a bunch of variables in some vector and
a genetic algorithm would do something
like perturb the different values than
the components of the vector and see if
you can get something better so we sort
of try to genetically mutate the vector
which is which defined your strategy and
get a better one out of it and so yeah
we started messing around with that
didn't it's not part of the software
right yeah
themselves are using to fight
well actually that's a that's a good
question the answer is the bookmakers
the way the bookmakers come up with a
point spread its they look at the amount
of money that's being bet on each team
and if it's not equally balanced I'll
make the point spread more favorable for
the team that's not being better they're
not really looking at much of anything
except the betting money and if that's
all automated now they have to start
with something so at the beginning of
the week like right now I'd in fact on
my way in let's see it look at this in
the lobby I picked up I stole the sports
section of today's Mercury News and even
though football betting is illegal
sitting right here in the lobby is the
mercury news latest line pro football so
I can see that this coming week
Philadelphia is a six-point favorite
over then the 49ers buffalo is a five
and a half point favorite over the Jets
and so on and then they also have the
lines for college football and if it's
bad to bet on pro football supposed to
be a real sin to bet on college football
because you're sort of corrupting the
integrity of the game but here it is in
the San Jose Mercury News I don't know
what
that's what about a right this is
the okay so right so correct so that's a
good that's a good question so he had
asked what what so your question was
what how does the automaker's decide
what are the important factors when they
start out with some of this here it is
Monday and they've already printed the
line which is roughly resembling the
various lines in Las Vegas and so there
hasn't been that much betting action yet
so they have to start with something and
so what they start with is they look at
software and they look at the records of
teams and they have formulas that give
what are called power ratings which are
just writings of how good teams are and
then they just sort of sit around and
actually to sort of talk about what how
they think the public is going to bed
and then they'll come out with what's
called an opening line and they'll
modify the opening line throughout the
week and it doesn't change by that much
action they're pretty good at coming out
open one so the things that they are and
they know a lot about football and
whatever sport they're handicapped in
fact the companies in Las Vegas handicap
sports have experts in each for really
know a lot about this board and they
also have software and so with the
software is multiple software that just
gives trends and patterns not exactly
data mining software but to use that too
but they rely heavily on how they think
the public is going to bet so so if you
place a bit so so right now the 49ers so
that's already didn't answer your
question right now if you've been on
Philadelphia you have to give six points
from Philadelphia is playing 49ers the
next week and their six point favorite
so let's say that during the week lots
of people bet on Philadelphia until they
move the points right up to seven okay
you when you made your bed it was 60 you
get six that's your that was your
question right yeah so you get the point
spread that was available when you made
your bed yeah
that
I
well you're doing this data mining
method for something similar to it
that's correct that assumption is only
moderately reasonably for a few
important reasons one is the team's
change coaches change stadiums change
and so there is it's not like the
roulette environment you get these new
situations like this year the Raiders
have a new coach and your offensive
coordinator offensive is a good word for
him and they have a new quarterback and
so it's like
okay so great so that's so what in what
people who bet on sports too is they get
these patterns they'll get these things
like Baltimore Ravens are 17 and three
let's bet on this week and then they
look at other things that might be more
connected with the real world namely and
they do what actually what a
statistician would do they would say
okay I have this weird situation now
what's a plausible explanation and if
there's no plausible explanation a smart
person would say this is just random
nonsense
people well people have used other
techniques and what people tend to do is
software like this or is to restrict the
year range and so I mean I know some
people who say if you go back more than
two years you're an idiot because
everything is really everything that's
relevant has happened within the last
two years that's almost like Markov
chains or something but then I know this
guy in sports better who says you have
to go back at least 15 years because
then that because only then can you get
enough data to establish a pattern that
there are certain underlying physical
characteristics or dynamics of football
that you can uncover by looking at big
lots of years so there's mixed opinion
on it yeah
quantization play
like
oh yeah okay so that's actually that's
more that that's actually an important
issue for a couple of scores score
things like a point spread like like six
seventeen percent of games land on a
three-point difference so if you changed
of your a bookmaker and you change the
point spread from three to
three-and-a-half you're doing a huge
thing whereas if you change the point
spread from one to one-and-a-half it
doesn't mean very much so in order to
move the point spread off of three then
there has to be a huge imbalance in the
betting so there are certain score
differences that have like seven is
another is the other number but three is
the big number so and then in fact you
can even buy a half a point its own
casinos so instead of getting ten to
eleven odds to get or 11 to 10 how
everyone's saying you'll get 625 odds
which is worse and they'll move the
points by the point just for your half a
point just for your vet so yes love so
that the attention is mainly by the
perfect from the bookmakers who are much
more hesitant to move off of a popular
actual difference in score or high a
frequent one like three and then all the
also the betters for instance three and
a half point the point spreads three and
a half then a lot of the so-called wise
guys who are the professional gamblers
will take the underdog because they know
that a lot of games will end on three so
they'll give up so they'll take the
three and a half points knowing that
they'll win a three-point game a
three-point loss so that brings up
another little dynamic of sports betting
and that is there are basically two
camps of betters who the bookmakers call
the squares and the wiseguys and it
sounds kind of funny and it is and the
wise guys are the professional letters
and the squares are like you know
go to Las Vegas for the weekend and your
bet on the home team but they actually
use that they will not move the point of
some wealthy square comes in and makes a
huge bet on the team they're not going
to move the point spread in the same
manner that they would if a well known
gambler comes in and makes the same
better and so there are some well-known
gamblers a little football betting more
sports winning or well-known gamblers
who actually hire people to go make bets
for them because they don't want to have
that effect on the odds and the gamblers
would go bet on them are called beards
okay so um so your question I think is
do the wise guys do better than the
squares other people who
well let's put it this way there are
people who are so good that they make a
lot of money from the sports betting
industry now I know a couple of these
people and I know that they make a lot
of money by selling information what do
they actually make any money by betting
on games is an open question but they
will have tout services in other words
sale sell like there's a there's a
publication called the gold sheet that
sound comes out of Los Angeles in which
you can buy at any newsstand costs I
think seven bucks now or something comes
out every week they did in football and
basketball and so the guy who who is who
originally found that it was an avid
sports bettor and I he passed away now
but I used to know the guy and I don't
know if he ever made anything actually
betting but he had 35 thousand
subscribers to this weekly little sheet
and plus a lots of you know people who
buy it off the newsstands only made a
lot of money in the sports betting
industry
and so to put the typical gamblers the
mini but but there are some people who
seem to make money at it and I don't
know how much anything else
some of them perform well actually there
are a few I don't really market it
anymore because too busy doing other
things but it's available on a website
and there are some people who have a
group of of users who swear that the
strategies work that they made lots of
money and I personally haven't really
been doing much better the more the
developer not the gambler hi
situations huh
hearts spades against that they're
offering insight
typically in football they all stay
pretty much the same because as soon as
one changes a little bit people are
going bad what they think is the right
team and they'll force them to comply so
it's just a betting public is so
versatile they would especially because
of computer technology and stuff like
that come they won't let Todd to be much
different from one casino to another
because you can do things like clay head
you can hedge if there are different
odds and so you can make you know bets
on each team in different places if you
have different point spreads so hedging
is not easy in pro football betting
because everything especially with
online gambling there's just so much of
it going on that everything is within a
half a point usually so you can say them
going to the point spread minus plus or
minus half a point there just about
everywhere by the end of the week but
now if it during the week if an injury
occurs or something happens and of
course the point spread might move a lot
the other
it's ok I'm going to go to something
else you know it still has to do with
sports betting so it's ok so this is the
website if you're interested you can
download a free 10-day copy if you send
me an email send you an authorization
key to use of these are for 10 days
would be anyway it's Snoop datacom of
this software ok I'm going to talk about
now about another little spin we have a
few minutes and talk a few minutes about
this an actual case that I got involved
in as an expert so i won't talk about
little about internet gambling so and
i'm going to answer your question in a
minute internet gambling is a about a 12
billion dollar industry actually it's
more that's more like a 20 billion
dollar industry now illegal in the US
except for horse racing so I'm not just
talking about sports betting internet
gambling is illegal in this country
technically except for horse racing now
what does that mean I mean so I mean I'm
sure a lot of you have seen websites
like party poker or you can play poker
online if you play on party poker in the
state of Washington you are guilty of a
felony right now you're not going to get
arrested but there's a low new law in
the state of Washington that makes
internet poker playing a felony so it's
a very weird situation now notice I say
except for horse racing so that's
interesting and in fact there's a law
that's sort of moving its way through
Congress right now which in which the
people supporting the bill and making
these impassioned speeches on the floor
of Congress about how internet gambling
is destroying our moral culture and
ruining the lives of compulsive gamblers
and it has to be outlawed except horse
racing
and horse racing of course betting on
horses is legal in California in various
states and so they sort of have a lot of
lobbying pressure and so horse where I
thing for some reason is above the fray
here and isn't immoral and you can bet
on horse racing on the internet and it's
perfectly okay so right now except for
horse racing there about their over 2000
internet casinos and they're all
offshore except for the horse racing
websites they're about to 23 million
internet gamblers in 2005 8 million from
the US in April of 2005 the World Trade
Organization ruled that the u.s. is
violating certain rules because they
don't treat foreign and domestic
internet gambling businesses equally in
the sense that everything is illegal
except horse racing and so far nothing
has happened however recently the
federal government has arrested and
thrown in jail to people who own large
internet who are CEOs of internet
gambling websites offshore one guy from
England who has who is the CEO of a
company that's well-established website
completely legal in in England in fact
has traded on it's a publicly traded
company on the london stock exchange he
was going to jamaica and he had to stop
over in dallas and they the the feds
busted him in dallas and threw him in
jail where he still sits a couple months
later and they still it's not quite
clear he sees charged with violating us
wire laws but still there you know
they're not going after no one's gone
after individual betters at this point
okay so here's there are some articles
that talk about these things so here's
an article from
Louisville Kentucky courier-journal
which talks about how horse racing is
good here's an article about that poker
law from the seattle post-intelligencer
which talks about how poker is bad and
then here's one of these trade
organizations the American Gaming
associations of you goo if you google
the American Gaming Association you'll
you might find this article I can email
you a copy of this if you want if you're
interested and where these stats come
from that I'm putting on some of these
slides they're one of the organizations
that gathers data on that industry okay
all right so here's a story there was a
businessman a few years ago about five
years ago and he raised 40 million
dollars in investments for a company
that was supposed to be on the verge of
obtaining a patent for a lucrative new
tooth whitening product okay raised 40
million bucks okay there was such a
product but this guy had no connection
to it he was a swindler in fact he had
seen about this product he had seen this
product advertised on the Shopping
Network and so he started raising money
for it claiming he had a patent and that
he was going to sell it to Procter &amp;amp;
Gamble okay well he spent 10 million of
this 40 million bucks to buy homes
condos nice cars and he gambled away all
the rest of it 30 million bucks betting
on baseball at an offshore casino
okay so we went completely broke the
investor started asking for their money
for their hearing promised them you know
100 to 1 return on their investment and
he didn't have any so he got busted he
declared bankruptcy he was sent to
prison so the victims of the swindle
retained the law firm that specializes
in recovering funds from bankruptcy
cases so they got the they got the homes
in the cars seized and got money back
from that they got a few million bucks
back from that enough to pay the
attorney fees basically and then they
filed a lawsuit against the casino and
they said a bunch of things one they
said the casino wasn't doing its due
diligence they should have known this
guy was a swindler this was all done
online and by telephone they said they
shouldn't you know was this kind of
money and stuff you know they should
have checked up well in fact the guy was
betting directly by wires from the bank
of montreal that were sent into the
offshore account so the bank of montreal
was equally culpable so they sort of
gave up on the due diligence argument so
then they alleged in this lawsuit that
the online casino has to return the
money because that the casino was either
cheating the swindler or the casino was
involved with a swindler in a
money-laundering scheme in other words
it's one there wasn't really losing this
money were just feeding it to this
offshore account and it was going to
later split it with a guy around the
casino all right well the guy ran the
casino had pretty good records and he
could show that you could show that he
was keeping that money for himself and
wasn't going to share it with anybody
especially some guy just got out of jail
and is working at a gas station so they
decided to focus on this if the casino
had given the swindler proper betting
odds he couldn't possibly have lost 30
million dollars over a two-year period
in other words the result couldn't have
been due to chance sure what I was
talking about before with good
strategies in other words they the
swindlers losses were just too extreme
to be explained by chance ok well the
swindler was betting on baseball games
he was betting an average of ten on ten
games a day 15k a game and when the
baseball season wasn't on he was betting
on hockey ok so if you translate that to
15,000 a day 15,000 a bet ten bets a day
over two years you get about a hundred
and ten million bucks and betting action
which is called churn okay so that's how
much betting action we have from this
guy before you finally got busted he
didn't go broke he just got busted yeah
well I guess he was pretty much broke at
the time so the question is how much on
average will again we lose when he bets
110 million in relatively small
increments over time and of course the
answer is it depends depends on the bets
in particular it depends on the house
edge which is sometimes called the hold
percentage in sports betting so with
roulette the house edge is five point
three percent so if a gambler makes
roulette bets with a house edge of five
point three percent at that rate ten
bets a day 15,000 of that you lose an
average of about six million
in fact you can also compute a
probability here for roulette the chance
of losing 30 million or more making
those kinds of bets is less than one in
a thousand so it's really unlikely that
this guy was playing roulette he would
lose that kind of money well support as
we have we've seen sports betting is
different from roulette but still you
can talk about the whole percentage well
in baseball betting just real quickly
there's something different than a point
spread it's called the money line and
money line is just another way of
stating payoff odds and so the favorite
has a negative money line which means
you have to bet more to win a certain
amount and the underdog has a positive
money line so it's all in units of a
hundred so anyway you can take these
money lines and what they do is they
shade one of the money lines so that
there's a slight imbalance so it isn't a
fair bet as we've been on both teams you
break even and so when they do that and
a typical that what they'll do is I'll
take 20 points off the underdog line
starting with some number that they
think is good for dividing the betting
action again the bookmaker makes a
certain profit and in fact for a typical
baseball bat the profit that the whole
percentage will be in the neighborhood
of 4% similar to point spread bets so
baseball's dis betting on a team in
baseball yields about the same profit
margin for casinos per dollar bet okay
it's not and it depends very much on how
much money is bet on each team in a game
but anyway that's so when they so
typically that's what bookmakers make
though on a baseball betting somewhere
around four percent okay well if you do
that if the swindler had been making
random bets with a four percent
three-point-eight percent house edge for
that whole run of 110 million he would
have lost about four million it was
actually if he actually was using any
skill in baseball betting he might have
even done better might have lost less
than 4 million where you can have skill
and still lose money of course if you
have skew can have skill and just do
worse than randomness and because of the
odds you can still go broke so you can
be a skillfully bankrupt but in any
event this guy lost 30 million so the
question is was he being cheated well it
turns out there's another kind of
baseball bat called a parlay bet and
some of you may know what a parlay bet
is partly that just means you bet on a
bunch of different events and they all
have to happen for you to win so for
example here's the four-team you can do
that in any sport here's a four team
parlay you bet that San Francisco beats
Florida Pittsburgh beats Milwaukee
Oakland beats Kansas City and the
Yankees beat Boston if you make that bet
all those teams have to win in order for
you to win your bet otherwise you lose
so the payoff odds are somewhat high
their huge payoff odds in fact you get
the payoff odds by multiplying the
probabilities together for winning the
for each of those teams roughly speaking
getting a little taking a little bit off
for the bookmaker profit so it turns out
that these these types of debts are
highly profitable if you win but on the
other hand there's a huge house edge or
hold percentage because the casinos
don't want to expose themselves to the
risk of taking huge parlay bets because
of the big payoff odds so they'll
they'll make the odds such that they're
not so good for the better okay so a
typical 14 / leave at the house edge is
between 25 and 30 percent
okay the same is true if you make if you
if you look at games with high payoff
odds a house edges always work like like
the state lottery for instance the house
edge equivalent is 50% the the state
keeps fifty percent of all the money
back keno is another game mckean if
you've seen the game of keno in a casino
that's that's a type of lottery keno
bets typically have a twenty to thirty
percent house edge because you can win a
whole lot of money for a one dollar bet
so on games like that we that have very
high payoffs with very low chance of
winning the house edge is typically high
so these four team parlay bets four or
five this guy was spending four or five
and 16 parlay bets generally he was so
he was exposing him he was exposing the
casino to was betting large 15,000 of
that he's fourteen fifteen sixteen
parlay bet so any win he would get like
hundreds of thousands of dollars and so
the casinos the online casino was
hesitant to take the money on such large
bets they don't usually so they spread
it out around other casinos and so the
money trail gets sort of dispersed and
anyway let's just look at the bottom
line let's say the house edges beat
about twenty seven and a half percent
and that's what this guy was doing was
making these parlay bets in 110 million
dollars bet you x 27.5 percent you get
30 million and that's exactly what the
guy lost so i'm going to stop with that
for a run out of time but i will answer
questions
okay if anybody wants any other
information just come on up and get it
