I'm brought ha no in here to talk a
little bit more about some of his latest
work with the robots he's emphasizing
robots and kids this this time around
and he currently lives in New Zealand
and is sponsoring a variety of programs
to get kids more interested in
electronics and robotics so without
further ado here's ha no Thank You
Charles and thank you google for having
me back here I was here exactly a year
ago I'm talking about my damn spot which
is a balancing robot that dances with
kids using computer vision and this year
i'll talk about 12 blocks which is a
simple block language that lets kids
program sophisticated multi-core robots
very easily so first i'll talk about a
little bit New Zealand so I moved there
five years ago now and there's a bit
more than sheep down there I contacted a
couple local companies in Christchurch
New Zealand which is where I live and so
this is what my neighbors and friends
are up to Glenn Martin is building in
the first practical jetpack $100,000
buys you a backpack you strap on and
lets you fly through the air thousands
and feet up for about 30 minutes and it
was shown at the last Akash very
successfully hike bike could fit in
really well here at Google with the
segways it's a very light folding bike
fits in the back strap it on and there
you go a friend of mine is doing a GPS
boomerang so it flies up to edge of
space with a helium balloon and returns
with a GPS sensor right to about three
hours later hits you on the top of your
head and gives you your sensor readings
and lots of telemetry information about
what's going on in atmosphere another
friend of mine is doing the first color
x-ray so they developed a novel sensor
for CERN and that's currently being used
at the Mayo Clinic to grab color images
from x-rays so they're still using the
same x-ray emitter but are using a
special detector to count actual photons
looking at their energy level and with
that getting the composition of what the
x ray went through another guy is doing
whisper gin and that's a 4 cylinder
Stirling engine which provides
residential heat and power and it's
currently in trials in Europe and
another guy's doing a pivotal engine so
instead of a piston going up and down in
an engine this has a pivot where the
explosion happens in the same chamber
but it's stationary on one side so it's
pivoting and so with this you get very
high power density it's quiet and it can
run on hydrogen to be able to watercool
the whole engine and the piston and
there's another company called jade my
search that does a very high speed
database so I have to keep up with these
other guys and so I've been busy too I'm
more busy on the hobby and electronics
and getting kids into robotic side and
sought take a minute to talk about what
I've done there so I wrote a book what
some other co-authors we're all using
the parallax propeller it's a high-speed
multi-core summer conductor chip that
lets you do a lot of the things that
I'll talk about here today so it has
memory it has eight processors running
at 80 megahertz and it has a lot of
input enough appends to let you
interface with sensors and actuators and
motors
so this is a 500 page book and I wrote
about my balancing robot that I talked
about here last year I also developed a
prop scope so this is a two hundred
fifty dollar a little blue box that
reads analog signals on one side and
connects to your computer with USB and
it also can be used as a function
generator expect from analyzer a logic
state analyzer so basically everything
that you did in college with a big lab
full of instruments is now in a little
box that you can take home and look at
signals okay and I'm also developed a
tool called viewport that lets you
develop very sophisticated projects to
build on this parallax chip and I'll
show it at a little bit of my demos and
that includes very graphical debugging
tools so it includes the standard
breakpoint and call stack and memory map
and stepping in and out of it syntax but
it also has simulated instruments like
an oscilloscope a logic analyzer that
let you look at what's going on in your
system so if you've ever wondered why
your program isn't running the way it is
but it should and with this you can go
back in time so you can see well ten
minutes ago this is what happened this
is what the sensors were reading this is
what your mathematical model was doing
and that helps you develop more complex
more sophisticated and edit systems
integrated in here is opencv so a
complete computer vision libraries in
there as well as fuzzy logic tools so
that's all in there and finally 12
blocks so 12 blocks is my answer to my
daughter when
she asked me what are you doing you're
always programming i was in computer can
I try can I do something she's five
years old and I didn't think it would be
a good idea of giving her a see book and
I'm showing her and teaching her
complete language at the time she was
playing with LEGOs and putting them
together stacking them there are other
software out there mit scratch develop
the wonderful graphical tool Lego
Mindstorm also has a block based
interface but there's a lot of problems
with those and I tried to come up with a
solution to those and 12 blocks and 12
blocks is also a language that is
completely focused on embedded systems
so it's a visual language but it's
developed for robots for embedded
systems that have actuators that have
sensors and go from there so I call it
12 blocks because when everything is
contained in a block so very object
oriented then it's very easy to build
very sophisticated things in a small
number of blocks you're no longer
looking at pages and pages of code all
the demos that I'll show you today our
in a handful of blocks and there are
many blocks available so there is a
library you can create your own blocks
and there's about a hundred plus blocks
I'll show you a sampling of us a little
bit later and I like to say that it has
a very gentle learning curve but it
reaches very high so you can start out
using this when you're still in
elementary school and when you're still
just dragging a couple blocks together
but you can keep using it to university
beyond because it's very functional it's
very sophisticated and
there's a lot of power there it has live
edit capability so you can keep editing
your program while it's running a shot
at graffle to graphical debugging which
lets you look at graphs instead of
looking at variables and looking at
lines of code and it's integrated with a
wiki so with an Internet you can look at
videos you can look at schematics share
everything with a wiki and it's all
integrated there and you can create
standalone programs so similar to how I
build the props go by developing some
firmware and building a pc user
interface this lets you with 12 blocks
develop both the firmware running on the
embedded system but also the user
interface that other users that don't
have access to 12 blocks can use to run
the program and I mentioned you can
customize your own blocks and it's very
easy to transition to other languages
parallax the company behind the
propeller developed a optic oriented
language called spin and it's a very
nice very powerful language for writing
textual code for the propeller but there
is also an CEC available so if you're
used to see you can program these types
of robots and see as well and you can
transition from 12 blocks all the way to
writing C code and going from there so I
won't read all these off but there is
plenty of capability there's a standard
computer science where you have arrays
and yet state machines and events and
messages strings user interface graphic
capabilities so plugging it into a TV
and then building a graphical game what
sprites and vector graphics sound so
type in your own score or browse sound
effects play MIDI files as well as
reading and using actuators and sensors
so looking at a proximity sensor looking
at a wheel encoder all that sort of
stuff that you typically deal with
robots with embedded systems is it's
always just a block where you drag the
block somewhere connected and away you
go so the robot that I'll demo today was
built by Chad and it's a very
sophisticated platform that fits no
kidding so it's light small robust made
out of metal you can screw Meccano and
becks components to this as well as
plug-in LEGO pieces so again going from
very simple basic Lego type
expandability to really doing hardware
expansion and this is really designed to
get you started with robots at the
simple level so driving it like a remote
control car where you're not programming
at all but also lets you do things like
logo i started with logo in elementary
school where you have a turtle and you
tell it to move forwards and then turn
right and you repeat for a while and
then you move up to using sensors so
some of these sensors that i talked
about and integrating that to control
what the robots doing and all of this is
done with 12 blocks where you visually
program it and i'll show how you can
transition to the text bags languages as
well so what I'll do my demos is I'll
use 12 blocks which has is library which
has a worksheet where I assemble
programs and then has views and within
the view I can look at what's going on
in the robot
and on the team outside there is a
shared memory that's share it between
the pc and between the robot so both
have access to it it's actually in the
t-bot but i can read and write it from
the pc and later i'll show how that same
concept of shared memory can be extended
to when you have multiple robots so
again there is memory on each ki baat
but the key bots and 12 blocks can read
and write that memory remotely and on
the teapot site that memory controlled
how the motor moves how the speaker
sounds what the microphone is doing so
it's all a very simple architecture that
is very functional I keep saying that I
keep focusing on this benefit of being
able to easily transition from grade
school to very advanced things but now
there's a lot of robots out there that
are targeted at one specific item and
one specific challenge one specific
competition and I think that this lets
people use the same platform what
expanding it either is through software
through hardware through electronic the
changing things and on the software side
starting with 12 blocks but then growing
into spin and ncc code at the end
little tease for the advanced people so
what I'll show at the end is using
wireless to compete to connect multiple
robots and using sensor information from
one robot to control another robot while
monitoring the whole system on the pc
and this can be extended to programming
remotely wirelessly as well as
connecting to internet so causing the
robot to move or to play a sound of
something on the internet a stock of
weather changes as well as sending data
measurements from the robot if it's
video if its sensor reading sending that
back up to the internet and of course
internet mobile devices so bond movies
always have a scene where you take a
robot and you drive a car with a iphone
or android so that's that's all possible
here too so demo wise these are some
things that people could do wed out of a
box what does where they start with
remote controlling a car this is what my
daughter wouldÃ­ve starting out with or
even my son then moving on to drawing
logo shapes moving up to integrating
sensors and using those to control the
robot then line follow is a very common
challenge where it is a black line on a
white paper and you try to stay on the
line though as quickly as possible
communicating with the shared memory
male terminal so a very functional
communication networking protocol for
sending data back and forth and then I'm
trying C code and spin code so moving on
to demos
I'll clear a little bit of an area here
here's here's a robot and I will switch
over to 12 blocks so 12 blocks is a
windows application and it has this
interface I can start a new program and
as I mentioned it has this library
section where you have multiple types of
blocks to let you do graphic
manipulation to let you do sensor
measurements and even to build user
interfaces and here in the middle is a
worksheet and for this first program
I'll do what the simplest thing that we
can do with a robot just to have it move
a little bit and so we start with a
start block so I'm just dragging it from
the library on to the worksheet and I
take a block from the tee box section
the move block and it shows me that
these are able to connect of course I
can't connect it to the top and I can't
connect it to the library so this is the
one place where I can connect it and now
I can hit the Run button and this will
load the program into the robot and
cause it to move backwards for one
second so it's a very simple program but
it's something where I've just taken two
blocks connected them and right away it
did something so next demo that I'll
show is doing some basic input/output so
there is a proximity sensor on here
there is line sensors and there's wheel
encoders what we'll do in this demo is
look at the proximity sensor to see if
there's something in front of it and
there's a full color LED on there and
but now it's showing a blue light so i
will i'll be able to control the light
the color of that light so i'll take
away to move block i'll just throw it
back into the library and i have a start
and what i'll do is i'll set the led to
a color and i will get the proximity
sensor value and this is a specially
shaped block which fits into another
block so here is a variable assignment
block so set x 21 that's how it starts
out but i can drag this and dock it in
there so now i have three four blocks a
start block a block that sets the color
of LED and a block which sets X the
variable X to the value of a sensor just
to keep this going I'm going to use a
repeat block so this is a loop and I'll
dock these inside of the repeat block so
this is pretty straightforward and I'll
hit the Run button and the LED starts
out red you can see it's right there and
i mentioned that i can edit things as
it's running so i can click here on the
red and pull down from these choices and
select a different color and so now i
have a blue light shining on the robot
and so i can do that with all of these
items that are in yellow these are
parameters and these are changeable
while the programs running the value of
x is supposedly being set to the value
of the proximity sensor typically with
embedded systems you have this problem
where it's in the processor but there's
no way of looking into it so typically
what you do is you hook up all sorts of
other gadgets to
the nice thing here is that we're
connected to the PC and on the pc i have
a interface for looking at these values
so here is X and here is a value of x
and it's right now at a certain level
and if I if I put my hand in front of it
I'd change that value and I can plot
this over time so right now I'm plotting
just the X verily value and I can plot
this over seconds there and so I can I
can look at the value as it changes over
time what I'll do in this case is move
on to showing how to build a user
interface based on this so instead of
having to go in here and clicking these
values and changing from blue to purple
or some other color I'm going to build a
simple user interface for that so I'll
go into the user interface section and
there's a background and I can use a
text box and just drag that on top of
there and this text box will set the
variable n to whatever is typed into it
so instead of setting the led to the
color purple i'll set the led to the
number n and now when i run the program
again i have i can type into this number
into this text box a different number so
0 is red and now when i type 120 into
here it changes the led to a different
color I can save these 12 block files so
i'll just give it a file name and i can
also save it as an a standalone
executable
so i can save as and in here i can call
it google and in this case a google exe
file and I can hit save and that file is
now saved to this directory so I will go
there
12 blocks tutorials and here is a new
file just created right now 254 and i
will close 12 blocks so I'm I've now
given this to a colleague of mine and
they want to change the LED on my robot
and so they can just run this megabyte
file and what this first does is it
loads the firmware to the robot and then
it gives me this little user interface
that I've designed and 12 blocks so it
just shows me n equals this I could type
a value in here so 120 is what i had
last time and then it changes the color
of that led so it's building the
firmware inside of 12 blocks as well as
a user interface to work with the
sensors work with actuators and bundling
all of that into an executable that you
can then run somewhere else
so that's what 12 blocks and with 12
blocks we can do more I'll now move into
transitioning from the 12 block visual
language to spin so when you're more
advanced or when you want to go into
building your own blocks or when you
want to use a more powerful debugger
then you can do that with the text
language so I'll take the same code that
I had before so I'll bring up 12 blocks
again
go
ok and I'll take our google one that we
just had and what I'll do now is just
like you do on the Internet you have a
in an internet browser you have a view
code button and so you have that here
and what view code does is bring up a
tool that's called viewport that has a
syntax highlighting editor in there as
well as lots of graphical tools to let
you debug that program and inside of
here i have the spin equivalent code of
my program so you can see down here that
it's doing a repeat loop and it's
setting the hsl to end and in here i can
make changes I can I can do that but
first thing what I'll do is I'll just
load this program so from a different
environment I'm now loading us to the
robot and I have a tool like the DSO
viewer so in here I can look at the
values or I can change a value so i get
a text box again for setting the color
of my LED so it started with 0 and 1 20
is a nice color blue so i can do
something like that as well as graphing
that over time so there's ad and then
over time it goes down and what's also
in here is I can set breakpoints so here
is 989 and i can now compile this with
debugging information and load this to
the propeller to the robot and this will
now stop on that break point and give me
all sorts of debugging tools for this so
i can look at the files i can look at
the code but i also have a memory map of
all the information nuts in the
propeller as well as a watch list of
variables a call stack a profiler seeing
word the time is being spent a view of
the pin
the sort of actual hardware interface of
what's going on with the propeller and I
have a command interpreter so I can for
example take ten steps and it'll take 10
steps in there I can take one step at a
time so sort of going between those two
so the traditional Visual Studio type of
debugging is integrated in here
and the last thing that I'll show here
is that I can make changes in here so I
can change the intensity of the LED so
I'll make it very dim I'll set it to
five and I can save this file and now
when i go back to 12 blocks it says do
you want to reload it so it noticed that
the file that i was viewing had changed
and now i can say yes to this and then
the the values are changed and it can go
from there next demo so i can transition
to see so in the same viewport tool that
i showed earlier i can look at a see
project and this is a standard code code
blocks project files so i can change the
compiler options the link 0 options
environment options and i can look at
the standard ansi c that i can compile
for the same robot and this this is very
simple it blinks the back LED on here so
it is a little LED right now it's
blinking very very fast but also for the
NCIC part there is a compiler a debugger
and so I can compile up with debugging
information and now in the c compiler CC
debugger i can set a breakpoint and run
up to that point and keep stepping
around here and now you can see the LED
is blinking every time i go past that
instruction
and so so far we've seen at the very
high level using a visual programming
language and using and interfacing with
the sensors a higher level which is the
spin language and then going all the way
down to C code and stepping one line at
a time to Lincoln led okay now shared
memory requires two robots so i'll have
two robots running here and what I can
do here is I can open a single program
so this is a slightly longer program but
it still easily fits on the page and
what this program does is it runs on two
robots and uses a shared memory
structure that I can monitor with 12
blocks to set the LED color on one robot
to the proximity sensor reading of the
other robot so I'm going to change the
proximity value on one to change the
color on the other and I need to load
this into both robots so I'll start by
loading into one of them what's the
which one first I have to
hmm
both robots are on
so this robot on the right now I can
look at what the sensor reading is doing
here and what's that what this one's
doing is in I three it's putting the
value of the proximity sensor so you can
see that it's going from dirty ish when
i'm close to it to 180 s 0 when I'm
further away y'all graph it so we can
look at it okay so you can see on the
graph that as I'm moving my hand back
and forth that the center value is
changing and this is the sensor reading
is put into the shared memory of itely
so idly is where this one is putting its
reading I can now connect to the other
robot that was and load this robot with
the same program but that robot is
looking at I three to set its led and
storing its sensor reading into i0 ok so
we'll look at both a 0 and r 3 and now
if you look at the other robot as I'm
moving the as item and I'll disconnect
the so I'll make this one truly wireless
and so what's going on is it's taking
meetings with the proximity sensor and I
can look at those readings on my graph
over here so you'll see the red line
goes up and down as I'm moving my hand
back and forth over here and the other
robot is receiving that information and
using that to change its state so we're
taking readings on one and affecting the
behavior of other and it goes both ways
so I can
changed reading over here to change the
lady over here
hmm
okay so that's what I was here to show
12 blocks going all the way from
starting a program adding a move block
moving the robot all the way to using
shared memory to control a robot
remotely with wireless and looking at
the results on the pc any questions
so I noticed your your blocks was looked
a lot like a flowchart rather than
dataflow program did you think about a
data flow model at all so there are many
different visual ways of creating a
program this one is still somewhat
linear so it starts at a top and goes
down it is in two dimensions so if so
some of these programs that i have or I
can sort of show you so of course you
have two dimensions and so you can put
it together this is what I thought would
be the easiest for a beginner to get
start up with reading from top to bottom
and naturally reading what's going on so
so I have a couple questions one is I
know this is very different from the
Arduino microcontroller but could you
say it comments on how how this compares
and would your programming language
could that be ported to the Arduino okay
um so yes at the moment everything I
showed here use the parallax propeller
multi-core processor the nice thing with
that architecture is that it has eight
processors in that trip and so I'm using
one of those processors to establish the
shared memory connection the connection
is just a serial interface and there is
a documented protocol of how that
information is shared between the two I
currently so on this device list over
here I currently supports oval robots as
well as a simulator as well as Java for
the lego mindstorm NXT and so already
I'm taking this visual programming
language and outputting different codes
depending on what device you want to
interface with so if you want to
interface with one of these robots then
it would output the spin code that runs
natively on the device if you want to
run in a Python simulator than the same
program that you have here on screen can
be saved and run inside of a Python
environment or it can be saved as Java
code so you're just mapping blocks to
the native language that you want to
support so in terms of Arduino support I
don't have it right now but the
interface the communication link is
serial so that's straightforward and on
instead of outputting whatever commands
I used here to move the robot back and
forth I would have to or someone else
would have to write the library to do
that and map that back to these blocks
okay and I noticed that you have
primitives like set led which is
different from your set you know
variable is that set led how is that
tied to the hardware and so there is a
block manager under tools and what this
lets you do is map the blocks and what
they look like and how many children
they have so if you're looking at nested
items like an if or a repeat and it lets
you map those to your language that you
want to support so if you want to go to
spin code what you have is you have
object files that you include and you
need to set up some global variables or
variables to pass information and you
need to set something up at the
beginning of a program and use something
in between so when I'm blinking an LED
this is driven by I squared C so it is a
nice crowd see chip in there and so when
you set the led to a certain value the
driver that's actually doing that at
a day is written in assembly and doing
some bit banging to set the I squirts
the device to a certain state whereas
the variable assignment in this
particular language is straight forward
like it is a most were set X 21 does not
require any other variables does not
require any other objects it's just
setting a variable to one so some of
these blocks are very complex and some
of them are very simple oh and how was
the robots were they communicating over
bluetooth um so we have different ways
that they communicate today they're
communicating over X B it's a $19
solution different ways and you can have
multiple robots up to thousands and this
particular one has a range of about a
kilometer and works very nicely 100 100
some killa babu kilobyte per second and
when what we did is we developed a very
flexible communication tool that lets
you share memory but also send messages
back and forth like mail where you're
forced to respond and were you able to
command other robot to do something as
well as terminal eminent emulation so
all of us running on the same hardware
pretty nice
so it might have missed this but using
this for sale or is this just a project
right now I'm getting very close so
about a month or so away from selling
the tea BOTS and they were initially
designed for summer camps where students
go to summer camp and are mentored and
at the end of a camped as a competition
and so that's what these are built for
12 blocks has been for sale if it's only
enough for six months now and the prop
scope parallax elves up and viewport I
saw that as well if you go to Han
