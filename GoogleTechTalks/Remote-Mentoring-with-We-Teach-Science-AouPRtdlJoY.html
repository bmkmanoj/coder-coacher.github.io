and I just want to do a brief
introduction to get us started when I do
job interviews I sometimes ask the
candidate what would you do if you won
the lottery if you could do anything you
wanted with your life how would you
spend your time I think it's really
interesting to see how this exposes what
people feel is deeply important when I
first met today's speaker arrogant he
seemed like the kind of person that
could do anything and it's been really
interesting to watch him slowly realize
that he didn't want to spend his time
working in a high-tech startup that what
he really wanted to do with his life was
to teach kids science why is helping
kids learn math and science so deeply
important right now here to give you
that perspective and to show you how you
can each participate is arrogant
burlingham and Dino Moskowitz of we
teach science thank you thanks for the
kind words don't it's a pleasure to be
here today and thanks for setting all
this up as well so as Don mentioned I am
an engineer by training aerospace
engineering I spent about 15 years in
Silicon Valley working at design
consultancies primarily in the research
and development roll my specialty was
data analysis so that's kind of the
angle i came from but through all of
that I mentored kids I went spensive
time at lunch working with kids at local
middle and high schools to help him get
better at math and science two years ago
I decided as as Don alluded to step away
from all of that and really focus on
this effort full time so we'll talk
about that a little bit about the
program we're doing but the one thing I
wanted to share with you today before we
start everything is to really put this
in the context of why this is important
imagine showing up for work your first
day at Google and being told that to
two out of every three people that start
at the beginning of this work here will
have failed 12 months from now imagine
hearing that at the beginning of your
first day of work and that's effectively
what's happening with kids in algebra
only one out of three I'm meeting the
state standards after their first year
of introduction to the subject so it's
truly shocking it's it's something that
not many people are aware of and it's a
real problem so what are we trying to do
to fix that we're not getting involved
in and with the schools but what we're
doing is providing mentors people like
yourselves and pairing them up with a
student for the entire academic year to
help them explore math and really see it
through the eyes of an engineer you all
have this approach we all do of looking
at the world through engineering eyes
and marvel added every day it's
something we take for granted but a lot
of kids never have that they don't have
the parents necessarily that are fired
up in that way they may not have
brothers and sisters so the only chance
they get to learn math and science each
day is with that teacher and so that's
what we're that's what we're working on
so the final piece i'll add before
dinner steps in is the how we came to
this final model of remote mentoring
initially we started by trying to get
engineers like software engineers like
Don into the classroom for one hour a
week to work with the kids but we found
is just too far it's too hot too far to
go it's too difficult and so we moved to
a remote mentoring model where you
literally just stay at your desk and
you're able to connect with your
students so I'm going to step away at
this point and let Dena talk to you
about the details of the program Dena
came on board in March she comes to us
with an experience from a teaching
background and she herself also wanted
to reach out to many more students than
you would do with in one particular
class so come on up dinner and walk us
through the program thank you
hello feels a little funny to be on a
microphone okay so my name is Dina
Moskowitz I'm the program manager at we
teach science which means I kind of
recruit and train and support mentors as
they provide this kind of this product
to students over the course of the
school year and will right at the
beginning of our second pilot right now
school starts next week and we're hoping
to have the program up and running and
in about a month so first of all how r
California's students doing in math
great kind of in the middle kind of not
so great not so great a little bit of
somewhat positive news came out of the
most recent star tests in general that
just said we've done slightly better but
in general we're not doing real well and
as Aragon talked about specifically in
algebra were really not doing well and
you know not even half of our students
are passing and as a state um were
pretty low right now I believe we're
number 46 or so on our state tests
compared to the rest of the states um
and then this is what Aragon was talking
about specifically um if you break it
down by county I don't know if I have a
laser dealio here but you'll notice
santa clara county is that dark red so
there's sort of somewhat in the middle
Alameda is kind of moving down in
general though we're around as a state a
third of our students so this is
disturbing and especially being here at
Google we need people who are strong in
math and science right so what we're
doing is something called the remote
tutoring and mentoring program Aragon
kind of explained it it's you connect
from your desk and it's each week and
you have the same student and your goal
is to kind of take this child who's
excited about math it's at one point you
know early on in its career and that's
like slowly kind of around eighth grade
they're not
nearly as excited and to kind of bring
that back out in them and that
excitement for oh my goodness what can I
do because as you guys know math is
really not just about being able to pass
a test or two um you know it's really
about creating solutions to problems and
understanding the way things work and
all these other things and so if we
don't have good creative critical
thinkers we're not going to be able to
get there so i'm going to show you an
example i'm hoping it's going to work ah
hold on one second it is working but my
I'm not connected with sound
if you guys are up for it then this is
an example of one of our sessions sounds
good okay and I'll explain things that
may not be as obvious so Dan Boyle
defenseman for the san jose sharks and
brian campbell so what we have here is a
web-based and former San Jose Sharks
don't turn that down a bit I've skating
around during warmups yeah that's
possible real quick and there so what we
have here is a web-based whiteboard so
basically the students at the end of the
school day will go to the library and
they'll log on to their computers and
sign on to our go through our portal to
this to this web page and you'll see
here we've got the names up on the left
their mentors waiting for them and
basically they can't see each other
we've got video capability but we've
been asked to turn that off by the
schools but as you can hear they're
talking to each other and they share
this whiteboard space where they can
draw and see what what each other a
writing so it's really like you guys at
work standing up by one of the
whiteboards back there and exploring and
sharing ideas so with that in mind we'll
just carry on here
problem out of kind of something she had
seen or thought up when she was watching
hockey if you guys are up for it and
I'll show you to my profitable sounds
good okay and I'll explain things that
may not be as obvious so Dan Boyle
defenseman for the San Jose first and
Brian Campbell defenseman for the
Blackhawks and former San Jose shark are
skating around during warm-ups and they
happen to look up and see each other
while they're both on their own goal
lines and they give each other a look
and simultaneously take slap shots aimed
at each other if Dan Boyle has a slap
shot at 95 miles an hour and Brian
Campbell has a slap shot at 90 miles an
hour at what time do the pucks pass each
other Oh mixture problem
so what if we split this down the middle
so that you guys can both work on it and
then one of you work on one side and one
of you work on the other but at the same
time we can all talk about it so the
first question would be is what time did
the plugs pass each other the next one
is where do they pass each other and
it's possible you make exactly enough
information so if you don't let me know
exactly so i would start setting up the
problem okay so um so it goes on and
they continue that each kind of work it
out um one of the things that I feel
like this really shows is a we're using
a concept that they've learned in class
and really applying it to a new
situation and be that each student is
coming up with how to solve the problem
on their own and not being led through I
think very often we're very quick as you
know teachers and mentors and supporters
should try to just get a student to the
right answer and the real goal is put
out information and let them quell kind
of what they can from it and where they
should start and then kind of support
them as they go so that's kind of what
we're trying to do where we're working
in this remote setting it's every week
with the same student and over the
course of the year you develop this
relationship where you're hoping
students are asking questions and being
active participants in this to sort
tortoise towards their own learning so
um we have actually a few more
statistics that are up here so all at
this point but we're still in the
process of gathering data from our first
pilot it's very small amounts of data so
we're just not making any statements
really yet until our researchers from
Stanford get back to us but here are
some really basic things our students
did slightly better on district tests
without normed analysis they also did
slightly better on the star tests also
without a normed analysis so I can't but
we're pretty sure they've done a little
bit better on the math star state tests
this year and they were really positive
we interviewed all the students at the
end of the year almost all of them were
really really positive about it 61
percent had a parent who didn't graduate
from college and that came from their
demographic data that they give to the
school so it's clear that there's
definitely a need that they need people
in their lives to support them and help
them fifty-seven percent of our students
were female and we had one female mentor
so we're really looking
bring on more female mentors and we do
have some more that are coming on for
this year their grades went up pretty
significantly from their seventh grade a
third trimester to their third trimester
this one student number 21 hearth grades
went down and it was pretty clear she
wasn't really her kind of interest in
school kind of waned over the course of
the year and she wasn't really very
interested in a school or be mentoring
so unfortunately she did not do better
but these students in red were some of
our focal students that I was kind of
watching were really struggling in
seventh grade and did quite a bit better
in eighth grade so that was great to see
and many students did a little bit
better this is what it looks like a
tower on our whiteboard it's through it
as a snap this is a screenshot of one of
the of our website and you know each
mentor and the students would click on
their mentors name and then it pulls up
that page that you saw in the video and
so our goals with this our basic goals
are you know standardized test scores
improvements and grade test score
improvements but those are just kind of
the beginning we're really hoping to
kind of improve their concepts of math
and their understanding of the
application willingness to take risks is
a huge one and as you guys probably know
you have to be willing to try out
different things even if you're not sure
it's right asking good questions are all
really important to being strong
mathematicians and so you are interested
there are a few steps to go through
hearing this information session we do
kind of a short phone call to kind of
make sure that you understand kinda what
you're getting into and give us a sense
of who you are so I can match you with a
good student everybody who works with
kids in California needs to be
fingerprinted there's a little bit of
paperwork so I didn't fix that there's a
orientation actually on the 18th and
then ongoing meet with your students
once a week and we try to have workshops
once every three months or so this last
one scientists in the classroom is we're
hoping to bring in one of our one of our
mentors to each class once
month so not all of our mentors will do
it but come in and have kind of a
conversation with students and talk
about kind of what you do in your work
or it could be something that you're
just really passionate and excited about
anything that kind of has to do with
math and science in the real world and
these are all companies of people that
mentors that we have on board some more
than others right now we have one Google
mentored on and we're hoping to have
more and then there's a number of other
companies that we've managed to bring at
least one mentor on there's any
questions touch base on a couple of
things here the the whiteboard session
that you saw there with Helen the kids
are fed problems where you're given all
the information you need except one
piece and you're asked to solve for that
every time and I think we all know
that's not how the real world operates
you've got to go in actually asking the
question is the hardest part and then
researching it and knowing what
information to throw out and what to
keep and then working towards the
solution and this is a key skill that I
think can't be taught early enough so by
working with these engineers with people
like you they really get a handle on
that from the get-go and it's absolutely
critical as you've seen with the with
the scores and how the kids are doing
it's not looking good and one of the
things we didn't mention here as algebra
is considered a gateway to tertiary
education if you fail in algebra and
eighth grade there's a good chance down
the road that you're not going to be
getting into university and not getting
a degree has been tied to all kinds of
things you know the income you'll earn
over your lifetime your health many
different things so this is really we're
focusing on algebra right now because
it's a key key gateway to the program
the final piece i'll add is we've this
is the pilot that we're doing right now
is the second in a series of three our
first pilot light last year was 23
students this year we have a hundred
students and then next year a year from
now we're going to have 500 students
throughout the Bay Area so we're growing
at a rate of about 4x right now and
that's it do you have anything else to
add dinner but um could you comment a
little bit about the science part since
yes absolutely so
so right now we are called weekly
science foundation we decided to focus
on algebra at the beginning because it's
clearly it's it's more clearly defined
both in the textbooks and how its taught
and the information that's transferred
to the kids what we did in our first
year was just focused on algebra what
we'll be doing this year is tying in
with the teachers and letting letting
the mentors know what's being covered in
the science class each week so what we
do is we encourage our mentors to track
that and there's a quick sentence at the
beginning of every week that says hey
your kid this week is doing this in
science and this in math and to really
tie it in we also have access to the
textbooks online for both subjects and
those are available to all the mentors
as we develop and we figure out this
mentoring model of taking subject matter
experts like yourselves and creating
strong mentors will expand into science
in a more traditional way like we've
done with algebra
so are you founded exclusively by the
sponsoring companies or what how is it
funded yeah yeah so funding comes we're
a 501 C 3 funding comes from three
sources we've got individuals corporate
America and foundations so predominantly
over the past two years we've had our
greatest support about eighty percent
from individuals both foundations and
corporate america tend to hold back
until a program is well established
before they start volunteering or giving
money so we're at that crest right now
where that's starting to change as you
can see with with these companies up
here we've really crossed that barrier
at this point with corporate America and
some of these companies are actually
providing dollars with their employees
to fund the work and then finally on the
foundations there are getting a lot more
interested now that we have our first
year behind us and we'll be presenting
data to them so we'll be doing a road
show in the next month or so presenting
to all the Bay Area foundations for more
funding good question thank you anything
else great well thanks to all of you for
listening don thank you so much for all
the effort in getting this setup i
really appreciate it and we look forward
to hearing from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
