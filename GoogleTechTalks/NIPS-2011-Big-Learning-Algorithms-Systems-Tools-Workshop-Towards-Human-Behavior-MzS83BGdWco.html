she got her pinky from MIT media lab
working on all sorts of intersection of
learning and UI and Dex problems and
then she was at MSR most awesome
research lab in the world of course for
about seven years but then she decided
to she wants to go back home and now she
is running all of our indeed Allah to
data mining and Goethe modeling research
I shall tell us today about mobile data
thank you can you hear me is this on
well thank you for the organizers for
inviting me to give this talk ah I just
nice to be a warning in case the talk is
not what you expect I were gonna say it
before so like before i start in case
any of you you know things this is not
what they are interesting so i'm going
to give an overview on the range of
projects that we are working on that
deal with large-scale data but i'm not
going to go into the detail any
technical detail on any of the projects
because i only have 40 minutes of course
i'm more than happy to give you the
details or send you the papers after the
talk but the purpose of this talk is
mainly to sort of like entice you with
all the sort of like interesting
problems that we are working on and also
show how you know machine learning and
data mining algorithms have a lot of
applications kind of like in the real
world and this is joint work with
another team in addition to my team and
then a group of the researchers of my
team and PhD in turn students a lot of
pieces interesting that we have in the
summer this is the only of the talk
first i will just say a couple of words
about telefonica because even myself who
I am originally from Spain when I
decided to move back here I didn't know
much about telefonica and why should I
go to the phonic I come from MSR so I
just give a little bit of an overview of
the company and then I'll talk about
what kind of data we have and why you
know if we have big data and the nature
of this data and then I'll just present
some exemplary projects that we do with
these data from social network analysis
to characterize the mobility of people
predicting the socio-economic levels or
inferring
personality of people and I'll just have
some conclusions so telefonica have you
heard of telefónica and maybe some of
you remain if you are here in Granada
for a week you probably have interacted
that Lee with telefonica already it's
actually the largest integrated
telecommunications company in the world
is ice huge it operates in 23 countries
in Europe in Latin America and it also
operates in China because he owns ten
percent of China Unicom and it has about
300 million customers were light and
about all those 300,000 employees so
it's a really really big company and
that I'd even though when I went as I
mentioned it operating in European
different countries and Spain UK Germany
Ireland czech republic and slovakia in
latin america people is pretty much in
any country in Latin America services
there I'm also has a very big backbone
and international network it actually
handles about ten percent of the
Internet traffic in the world and it has
a 2-1 IP backbone that connects the
entire planet then within telefonica
there is telefonica R&amp;amp;D which is the rd
branch of telefónica and it is a very
large R&amp;amp;D company as well it is located
in Spain in Brazil and we have a center
also in Israel because the laconic
acquire voice over IP company called
jajja recently we are about 1,200 people
mainly developer software developers and
a small group of researchers but we also
have designers psychologists is a fairly
multidisciplinary company and we
collaborate a lot we have a lot of open
innovation and we do a lot of
collaborations both with universities
research centers and also other
companies if any of you is in academia
and you have PhD students we have an
internship program in Barcelona and in
Madrid so if you are interested you can
talk to me later so within telefonica
R&amp;amp;D we have the research branch which is
where I am and
we have two locations Madrid and
Barcelona but the headquarters are in
Barcelona this is our building is a
really fancy brand new building by the
ocean so very attractive location and
these are the area that we are working
on we're working on mobile computing
human-computer interaction user modeling
and we have a sub section working
specifically on recommender systems data
analysis multimedia data analysis
complex systems and networking both
fixed networks and wireless networks and
I am solely responsible for the top
areas that I mentioned this is just some
pictures of like the different people
from the lab we have all nationalities
with speaking English with Anna speaking
Spanish or in Catalan it's very
international and I'll just move on into
like the actual talk so big data so what
kind of data do we have if we are a
telecommunications company so before
they go into the details of the data
something that I think probably many of
you are aware of but there is definitely
there's a lot of discussion about this
both in the World Economic Forum and in
industry is the fact that data is the
new currency and data is really pretty
much the most valuable asset that many
companies have today mainly Internet
companies you know that's what what
makes Facebook valuable or Twitter or
Google or telefonica and there is still
questions about how we can monetize this
data besides advertisement which is sort
of like you know the main streams of
like most typical way while taking notes
into account the privacy of the users
because a lot of these data is user
behavioral data so what kind of data do
we have we have a lot of customer
provided data so we have the names of
people when they have a contract with
Telefonica we have all the preferences
if they obtain all the contact data you
know their their home addresses so we
can build them telefonica board about a
year ago a social network company called
20 which is the most popular social
network in Spain for the younger bracket
of the population they have about 90
plus percent of the market share so we
have a lot of the data from the profiles
of the social network we are
do surveys and through the service you
know people answer and we get this kind
of data we also have a lot of sensed
data we can sense the connectivity
estados the type of terminal people have
the location of people a lot of network
data telefonica also has a TV sort of
like cable TV service so we have the
viewing patterns of TV of people they
also have an online portal called Terra
so you can have all the online
interactions and then we have CD RS
which is what we have been playing the
most with which I'll explain later what
they are if you don't know what they are
and then we also infer additional
attributes above people from all these
data a very important concern in any
company is the churn rate which means
the rate with which people leave you and
they go to a competitor we try to
identify who are the Alpha users we try
to characterize the mobility of people
this is economical status and then the
behavioural age which is what really
matters so here they tell us their age
but what really defines people is not a
chronological age but their behavioral
age and these you can only infer from
the actual behavior and then their
personality which is one of the latest
price that we have done so what LCD ours
which is the main data set that would
have been dealing with in the past
couple years so this the CDR means call
detail record and it is a record that is
generated every time a mobile phone
makes or receives a phone call or sends
or receives and SMS or an mms and every
time this happens there is an entry and
the entry has the calling party the
number of their color a number of the
colleague the location of the base
station that the person is connected to
the timestamp and when they call it
started the duration of the call the
result of the call if you were
successful or not or if it ended and
then the type if you send SMS or if it's
voice so we have these records for all
these countries and the question is what
can we do and you know with all this
data but before I go into that then
I think I need to see question is to say
well how much is this really because
you're probably familiar with the query
logs from Yahoo or Google whenever
you're not familiar with the site with
the city ours the size of these CDRs
this is just so you understand a little
bit how the mobile network instead of
which I assumed you all know so there is
a number of cellular towers all over a
certain geography and in cell tower is
responsible for a certain area and the
way we typically do the modeling is we
do some volunteer desolation of the
physical space and then we assign all
this area to each of the sort of like
towers in the center of the cell this is
an example of how some of the entries of
the city s look like in order in yeah
these are for example an example of the
desolation of Madrid the city of Madrid
so you get a sense of the density this
is like a block of houses the density of
towers in the downturn of see this is
very dense in rural areas is less and
less dense obviously so just to give you
an idea of the amount of data we have a
lot of data just to put it in
perspective the daily CDRs only for UK
are about 1.1 billion and the daily
pageviews for ebay all values 1 billion
and the daily searches for google
worldwide are 2.9 billion and this is
only for one country so if you multiply
by 23 countries we get a lot the custom
for example they are going to get a data
for our customer data the data warehouse
is in the orders of hundreds of
terabytes or larger the network data is
the largest data sort of like source of
data that we have and in fact is so
large that it cannot even be a stored
because we wouldn't have the capacity to
store it so there's a 74 terabytes of
data are being generated with network
information for example and as I
mentioned in UK example 1 billion of
daily CDRs and in Spain that is 4
billion of daily CDRs that are being
generated so as you all know the fact
that we have all this data doesn't
really mean much because you know how do
you interpret the data and how you
handle this data and there's a lot of
challenges we're doing all these big day
stuff one of the biggest challenges is
that all these data sets are in
different countries and different
databases even for the different
services if there are in different
databases so it's very difficult to have
a unified view of the same customer you
know they can't the TV that they watch
and where they are and so forth because
all these data sets are very different
physically located in different places
and also using different protocols and
different sort of architectures for the
databases so the collection is very
challenging of course the processing is
also very challenging and we have big
data architectures that I'm not going to
go into the detail we use a distributed
computing we use Hadoop etc we are
working on a scalable machine learning
algorithms like was the tutorial from
yahoo before and of course that is very
big privacy issues and we are extremely
careful with this ah because it's a very
sort of like sensitive topic in terms of
the problems that we are trying to solve
a lot of the problems are related to
better understanding our customers and
this is what is called business
intelligence so we the goal would be to
have a very good idea of who our
customers are what do they like doing
what they don't like doing who their
friends are so the company can provide
services that are meaningful for these
people and can improve the quality of
life of these people we want to increase
customer satisfaction as I mentioned we
want to reduce the people that leave the
company and go to another company maybe
because they are not happy with the
service of the company and then of
course the marketing teams are very
interested in doing targeted
advertisement and having more successful
marketing campaigns than if you don't
know you know who your customers are and
what do they like in terms of the
network there is also a lot of
applications to be able to put the
resources in the right place depending
on the behavior of people in certain
places you may need to allocate more
resources and so for predict for example
traffic in the network to prevent a
blackout etc and then we are also
working on some new applications there
is an emergent area call a smart cities
we
I don't know if you have heard of but
almost every city now in the world is a
smart city and the idea is to see how
these pervasive data analyzed in an
aggregated fashion not in an individual
fashion when Lina an aggregated fashion
can help urban planners are better model
the behavior of the city to provide
better services in the city or to decide
you know when they decide where to put a
park or where to put a public transport
line they use this real data to be able
to make those decisions there is
obviously a lot of moral location-based
services that you can design if you have
a very good understanding of a half of
people and what people need and how
people move and then we're also working
on contextual recommendations so now I'm
just going to give a quick overview of
some of these areas or problems that we
are working on and the first one is
social network analysis and this is a
very big area in itself and it will be
like many talks that you know we could
just give only on that so i'll just give
some little like you know snapshots of
the projects the ones are like the folk
the first focus on the social network
analysis work is to understand how each
customer is being influenced by its
social network and it's also influencing
their social network so traditional
models that didn't that didn't use the
social network information for example
for churn they were just connected as in
the behavior of one individual but what
we are doing is saying well people don't
live isolated they interact with other
people and those people have an
unemployment on them so can we build
models that not only depend on the
behavior of the individual but also on
the influence that the social network is
having on these people so before they go
into more details well I just wanted to
present with a couple of these lights an
explanation on how we reconstruct a
social network from the cold detailed
records because I supposed to social
networking companies where people
declare certain and people as their
friends we don't have that explicit
declaration all we have is the phone
calls that people make through a certain
time period and from there we need to
infer the social network so there are a
number of criteria that you can use you
know that
number of bi-directional phone calls
between two people the number of SMS is
that they interchange the number of mms
mms is that is the interchange etc the
total accumulated length of the time
that they have spent talking to each
other but those are and somewhat
heuristics and in the social networks
community that is a lot of research that
is being done on defining a link between
two nodes in the network this is still
an open research project that is not it
doesn't have a clear answer before I go
into the definition of the of the link
between two edges another problem is the
dynamics of the social network so the
way we typically bila social network is
that we take a snapshot of the network
say one snapshot every month we look and
all the phone calls that have happened
during that month we beat the social
network and then we try to integrate the
information from different snapshots
into one global is now show that
summarizes the the social networks from
each of the snapshots and in order to do
that we need to take into account the
dynamics of the of the communication so
you don't worry if there is a link here
but that link doesn't appear here then
we add a decane weight into that link we
need to be able to characterize
temporary connections versus more
permanent connections etc so to better
characterize the link we have a PhD
student who is doing her PhD exactly on
on this and we have created a new
quantity a call transmissibility which
is our instead of assigning as a weight
in the social network between two nodes
the total number of phone calls between
them or the duration of the phone calls
we assign to the note this new quantity
that we have defined call this
transmissibility and with the
transmissibility represents is the
probability that a certain piece of
information is going to be transmitted
from node I to know j in the network and
the nice properties that it has is that
is able to characterize bursty behavior
so some of the latest
finding see the social network community
particularly in lonavala vs team as you
have heard of him is the fact that human
behavior is bursty and this has been
found in different contexts not only in
phone calls but in email and in other
types of behavior so people don't
interact with each other at homogenous
so like rates but they interact a lot do
not deal in a certain time period and
ended on interaction and they interact a
lot and we do the same when we work we
work a lot of something and then we
don't work on it and they will work
against this is called bursty behavior
so the transmissibility is able to
characterize behavior that is bursty
disabled to characterize also
correlations between incoming and
outgoing event so conversations that
might be happening within a group and
also they appearance and disappearance
of links which is one of the challenges
when you create a social network to be
able to have the links disappear and new
links appear so if you are interested in
this particular topic I can point you to
the papers on this another problem that
we're working on is in identifying
communities within the social network
where a community is basically a
subgraph within the overall graph of our
people that are regularly interacting
with each other and of course you can
have a strong or weak ties and there's a
lot of parameters and tweaking that you
can do but so like that's the basic idea
something important is that the
algorithms that we developed for
identifying these sub graphs within the
large graph it cannot be exclusive so we
allow individuals to belong to multiple
communities because they could be the
work community versus day a family
community versus the friends community
etc this is just an illustration of how
they survive communities work so we have
this network here there will be these
two communities here and ending with
this will be the resulting graphs that
represent each of the communities if you
take into account you know the nose and
then the links between them so why do we
get our communities um one of the
reasons why we care about communities is
because a turn has a social component
and what we have found in our in our
work is that about fifteen percent of
the people that churn people that live
in this case telefonica have a previous
turner a previous person that that left
the company in their community and this
can go all the way to twenty-three
percent so that's a fairly big
percentage of the arabic influence that
the community has so we observe in a
community that a person is living we can
infer the probability that the other
people in that community have to be
living as I mentioned this is what we
can do identify the people and then also
we use to matrix to characterize the
influence that a certain person has on
the community which is what I'll explain
actually before I'll explain this and
I'll explain that so this is just to
illustrate this concept that we have of
charm pressure score so imagine we have
this community and there is these two
people that charm that leave the company
and these are the seats for the churning
and then we look at the influence area
of these people which would be this this
one's here which are the people that
have been in contact with the ones that
have left and then we just build
predictors on what is the probability
that each of these people has in leaving
the company and then we assign a weight
to it to each of the people and we say
well this person has a ninety percent
probability of leaving the company so
the marketing team then asked us you
know who are the people are most likely
to leave we can provide this information
and they can offer them special offers
or treat them preferentially to prevent
them from leaving the company as I
mentioned we quantify the influence that
a person has it with two variables the
first one is the actual influence which
is the influence that each person exerts
on the other person and that will be
this probability that have shown before
but we also assign a monetary value
because not all customers are equally
valuable from a military perspective is
not the same if a person spends 100
years of my professional spends 10 euros
a month so we also attribute a monetary
sort of like influence that a person has
if it is a community
where there is one person that maybe
only has fifty percent chances of living
but the monetary value for that person
is 500 euros maybe more important to
target our person another person that
only has a moral value of 10 euros so is
when you're going to realize there's all
these factors to take into academic make
it a little bit complicated so I just
wanted to illustrate here sort of like
the the benefit that we can get when we
add this vital churning and something
interesting is that um it is much
cheaper and this is important this is
why companies scale returning it is much
cheaper from many perspectives not just
monetary but also in terms of customer
satisfaction is much more beneficial to
keep a customer than to recruit a new
customer so it's much more important to
any company to cut their customers happy
and loyal and engage than to be
recruiting new people because they
learning curve and the cost of
recruiting people is much larger than
the cost of keeping people happy that's
why it turns a very important concept in
any company this is actually that we
have in operation and is run weekly and
then the results are being shared with
the marketing teams because this is
these all concerns the marketing teams
another type of work that we do using
communities is profiling people and this
is all related to the concept of form
awfully which I think most of you are
familiar with basically or mostly means
that people tend to have sort of like
friends as friends people that are
similar to them and there are two sort
of like sociological explanations for
this the first one is the the social
influence phenomenon so when you are in
a social setting you are influenced by
the rest of the people and that so like
makes you imitate the behavior of the
people that you interact with and the
second process is called selection which
means that we also choose who are our
friends and we tend to choose people
that are similar to us and this is a
phenomenon that has been well known
since the beginning of times so artist
oral already was saying people love
those who are like themselves or Plato's
and similarity it gets French
but probably all of you have heard the
birds of the feather flock together
centers which captures this this concept
of am awfully so what have we do some
awfully force we've used for a couple of
things the first one is to infer the
socio-economic level of people so we
don't have information complete
information for all our customers
obviously and in fact in Latin America
ninety-five percent of our customers
they don't provide any information to us
because our prepaid customers which
means for ninety five percent of our
customers we don't know anything except
for their behavior so all these
influence algorithms are extremely
important because there is really no
information and other people so in the
case of this particular project what we
want to do is to infer the such economic
status of people in a social network
given that we only know the
socioeconomic status of some people in
the network and we just apply or mostly
and the community detection algorithm
and we are able to predict with about
ninety percent accuracy this is economic
levels of the community of the entire
community as a group we've also used
this for a handset prediction so there
is an influence on the type of cancer
that you have do you influence your
friends are your friends influence you
in the type of Francis that you have so
for example if an individual has this
particular model of phone is 17 times
more likely than their friends are going
to have one of them so this is very
valuable information obviously for any
company there's also another interesting
and woefully phenomenon between
blackberry and the services at the
blackberry hunt the services that people
use so if one friend has a blackberry 17
times more likely that often have a
blackberry that's what I said before any
two close friends have a blackberry you
have 50 times more chances than not to
have a blackberry if we look on the
services that people use we also have a
similar behavior so we can multiply by 5
if you have a close friend that uses a
particular service and you can x 31 if
you have five friends that use a
particular service so this is very very
interesting
results that I think it's indicative
also like human behavior another area
that we're working on related to social
network analysis is customer acquisition
so customer acquisition means how do we
target new people before they are not
our customers so something that we
observe is we not only observe the
behavior of our customers but when our
customers called no customers or the
other way around there is a record also
in the CDRs so when this person calls
this person that is not a telefónica
customer we do get a record even though
we don't know anything about this person
but we see that there is a person there
you know that is being called to so what
we can do is build the social network
and build the communities even if it is
with known customers and then try to
identify the most likely known customers
that would have a propensity to become
customers because of the type of social
relationship that they have with our
customers we think that because of the
influence of these customers and the
phenomenal for more fully and social
pressure there will be good candidates
to become a new customers and that's one
of the strategies that is being used to
identify potential customers when we do
that we are able to increase the
performance in terms of targeting
potential customers 20 28 times when
compared to not looking into the social
influence parameters and this is a very
big improvement another interesting play
that we do with the social networks is
fingerprinting and this is there is this
kinase a concept called spinners have
you heard of that okay so cheers are the
people that leave the company and
spinners are people that leave and come
back immediately because there is a
better offer so they said the people
that are constantly looking for the
offers and then they leave a company and
then they join a different offer and
then they come back and then they go
somewhere else and then they come back
again and so forth are they always
chasing the offers and the problem is
that there is no persistence because
they change the number
the phone number even there's the same
individual there is no persistence in
our database is saying that this is the
same individual because it's a different
phone number and maybe that's the only
information that we have about the
people so what we do is we we create a
fingerprint of each people as
characterized by they social network and
i'm just going to illustrate this with
this example so say we have the social
network right now and this is the
spinner customer and then this person
leaves disappears from are you know
entries that person is gone that phone
number doesn't exist anymore but then we
have a new customer here the happens to
have the same social structure as this
one here but it's a different number
because he joins again so because of
using this fingerprinting algorithms we
are able to realize that there is a very
high probability that this guy is the
same as this guy because it has the same
social interactions as the other person
unless it is like a clone of that person
so we are able to assign probabilities
to the two people thinking that spinners
or not and this is very important
because as I said we want to
characterize people as as good as we can
and we already had you know inferred
information about this person we can
achieve you that information to this art
to this other node we are also working
on household identification I'm not
going to go into the details but this is
actually a pretty interesting problem as
well which is to identify all the phone
numbers London and mobile that belong to
the same household so in this case the
community would be the family that is
living under the same household and by
combining not only the social network
information but also the mobility
information were able to do this this is
very important with prepaid customers
and with a lot of households where there
is only mobile phones there is no
landline phones for example in Latin
America there is many many households
that they don't have a landline phone so
we really have no information about them
and finally you know we we can also
relate it to the community
identification problem you know we can
label relationships into personal
professional etc with pretty high
accuracy now open are going to inter
mobility
so as I mentioned the CDRs not only have
the Kali and the cold and the duration
of the colon so forth which is what I
have been explaining until now but it
also has the cell tower that the person
is connected to and by using that piece
of information we can infer some aspects
about the mobility of people I don't
have a lot of time so I'll just try to
focus on the most important things so we
do multiple things here we do analysis
at the individual level and also at the
guy aggregate level at the individual
level the first thing we do is that we
look at the communication patterns over
a long time period and we always split
and this is very important for any
behavioral analysis always splitting
monday through thursday friday could be
the same or could be as a separate
valuable and then saturday and sunday
never mix weekends with weekdays people
behave completely different weekdays
versus weekends so this would be sort of
like the signature of a particular
customer in terms of the pattern of
course during the week and during the
week during the weekend what we do is we
create that for all the customers and
this is sort of like our representation
this is our input to our algorithm and
then we cluster them and then we find it
very interesting clusters on different
behaviors that people have so for
example this cluster would represent
people that are pretty much calling all
the time weekdays weekends they have a
pretty homogeneous pattern of calling
the only really not calling when they
are sleeping these are the people
however talk more in the evening done
during the day these people talk much
morning the weekends and during the week
and these people for example talk only
during the week so this is probably a
professional phone iPhone disease for
business so you know we can do that for
all the people and cluster and five
maybe ten clusters of ten different
behaviors and that allows us to segment
people by the behavior by the type of
calling patterns that they have and then
because we have the location we can also
identify relevant locations for each
person and then we also do this pattern
clustering on the cell towers themselves
so we look at each cell tower and we
look at all the phone calls
that are happening in the cell tower
over there certain time period and we
are great that and again we are split it
between weekdays and weekends and for a
particular cell tower this could be the
pattern of behavior so in a weekend in
the week that he has this behavior and
then we can stress this behavior and
then we apply clustering algorithms on
these signals and then we obtain a
certain number of clusters that this is
just an example we have we obtain more
but this is just an elusive example that
characterize they behavior of the
different parts of the city so this is
for example the behavior of industrial
parks and offices there is a lot of
activities in the weekdays and it's
almost nothing in weekends this would be
commercial areas because they have
activity during the opening times of
like Commerce's and businesses this
would be nightlife because he has saw
reality it has a lot of activity in the
weekends etc so we can already and this
is really actually fairly interesting
because we can segment the city nor by
neighborhoods which is a traditional way
that cities have been segmented but by
behavior and automatically identify
there is a delay sure there is a
nightlife areas the areas that are
commercial residential etc and of course
this might change over time for example
nightlife areas are not always the same
because we have this data and we can do
this analysis you know every month or
whatever you can start also looking at
the dynamics of the changes of the
behavior and then what we do is we
combine both things so we combine the
behavior of people with the D havior of
the areas that way that they are in and
then we are able to better understand
you know what is the meaning of this
area and what do people do there for
example here we find that the behavior
of this person was when he was in this
area was similar to what we think is
leisure and nightlife and it turns out
that when doing the segmentation of the
space we also find that this corresponds
to a leisure area so that is a matching
between the behavior of the person and
the behavior of day of it of the cell of
the aggregate behavior of the cell tower
there and we can do that for the
different behaviors and because I'm
beyond because we can do that we can
have a better idea of the points of
interest or what are the relevant points
of interest
for the different uses are for the
different location so this is relation
and nightlife probably this would be
bars and restaurants and so forth you
know if this is office buildings maybe
you want to point them out like banks or
ATMs or etc we're also working on
characterizing the eff activity of
people i know gonna go into the details
because he estonia have five minutes but
these are two very important concepts
which is the concept of area of
influence and radius of gyration so the
area of influence is basically there
were people spend most of the time and
there's been a very famous nature paper
a couple of years ago by marta gonzalez
and last mobile devices level and now
you're familiar with it where they it
was in the headlines of everywhere and
it was talking about how human behavior
is predictable from the perspective of
mobility and they were talking about how
this area of influence is fairly small
for most people so we can do these types
of analysis and understand not only how
people call and where they are but also
where do they spend most of the time
them and also their social network and
all these studies we can also do them at
the aggregate level and this is relevant
for as i mentioned stuff like the smart
cities concept so I aggregated mobility
matrices for an entire city
understanding commuting patterns when
people move from one part of the city to
another part of the city etc for
everything for any spatial temporal so
like time series analysis of course two
variables that are very important is the
tanger morality and the spatial gonna
molarity so all this all the analysis
you can do them you know with different
spatial derivatives and also with
different tempo loggin on like this you
could do it every way you could do every
month you could do it every season etc
and very quickly I'll just present the
last two areas the first one is
inferring the socio-economic levels of
people from their behavior and this is
very relevant in Latin America because
there is very well-defined
socio-economic levels and the
differences in income it the differences
economic levels are very big so what
people can afford on the type of like
that they have in the differences
economic levels is very different but we
have no information as I mention about
any of these people because all of them
are prepaid customers so within this
project is
see is just by looking at the behavior
of people in particular the CDR
information which as I already mentioned
you can have purely consumption
valuables like the duration of the phone
call the monomania you spend the type of
hands etc social variables and then
mobility variables so if combining all
these variables we are able to infer the
socio-economic statuses secure misters
if you are not familiar with it is
usually defined by a pyramid from A to D
so it's ABCD sometimes II as well and
then there is a well defined range of
income for each of the levels in the
pyramid so the the study that we did was
in a city in Latin America that had
three types of socio-economic levels a B
and C and this is the ranges of income
from a zero to 100 the for the people
that we want to each of these economic
levels so the way this is done today is
by data collected with the National
Statistical Institute in every country
and this is our very slow process very
expensive process and it's a process
that they only do every five to ten
years so there is a big opportunity for
technology to have an impact here
because we could be doing this every
month or you know every day even in a
much cheaper way so one of the first
problem is well the first point that we
have to solve with this project is
figuring out the home location of people
because basically the way you attribute
at such economic level two people is to
saying they live here and according to
the census information the social
economic level of this neighborhood is
this so the first problem is figuring
out the home location to do that we use
genetic algorithms and we had fairly
high accuracy in 15 are the home
location of people once we have the home
location of people this is the
segmentation as given by the National
Institute this is the segmentation given
by our cell towers and as you see the
non little match so we have to do some
weighted sort of like attribution of the
sort of like the cell tower versus the
such economic levels so we can you know
make them match it's not a big deal buy
something to take into account so at the
end of this process where we
is the cell towers for each cell tower
we have as a second ohmic level and then
we have all the cell phone usage
variables that I mentioned before and
the challenge here is to say well as
training data we we have a few people
that we know that such economic level
and then the rest we don't know anything
and we have to build a model that is
able to previous economic level so we
did a number of algorithms for future
selection we selected sort of like what
are the top features because we usually
have around 400 variables as input
variables which is too many so we always
have to do future selection and then we
tried with different classifiers from
support vector machines or random
forests and they all returned around
eight percent accuracy in predicting the
socio-economic level this project in
particular received a lot of attention
from from united nations and we are
actually looking into collaborating with
them there is an initiative called
global posts and there is this concept
of data philanthropy where they dia is
to use this pervasive data that is
everywhere and that so many companies
have and public institutions for social
good so and in fact predicting the
stress economic level is one of the
programs at United Nations has and in
particular they are very interested in
understanding the impact that the price
of food has in human behavior and
condition to the socio-economic level
that people have so if we can predict
such economic level and we also can have
a lot of information about the behavior
of people because we see how people move
we see the type of phone calls they make
etc we correlate that with the price of
food we can start providing valuable
information to united nations on what is
the real impact that racing you know the
price of bread by once and has in real
people this is one of the examples of
the problems that they're interested in
another pray that we have done that I'm
not going to be talking about here is a
study on the propagation of the h1n1 flu
in Mexico so we were lucky to have data
from Mexico and we created a deceased
propagation model that includes human
mobility real human mobility as infer
from the mobile data and my last project
in my last minute s
psychographics so the goal of this
project is to see we can infer the
personality of people from their
behavior and how do you characterize
personality I don't know if you're
familiar with this but there is a very
famous and well adopted model called the
Big Five model where the personality
people is characterized as a point in a
fine dimensional space and these are the
five dimensions which I think you
probably have heard of so openness so
how curious people are versus how kind
of like conservative conscientiousness
how organized versus not very organized
extraversion agreeableness and
neuroticism so this is a well-known
taxonomy that is being used by
psychologists to assess people's
personality and what we were interested
in was saying well can you infer if a
person is extroverted or not or it's a
curious or not yes from the way they use
their mobile phone from how they move
from you know the size of the social
network etc so in order to do that of
course one of the first challenges is
the ground truth we never asked the
personality our customers when you're
going to become a customer telefonica
obviously so how do you actually have
ground truth so this so what we had to
do was to collect it so we did a study
and actually let me just skip through
this so we did a large scale uses use a
study we recruited about 700 people and
these 700 people and it was very well
taken care of they were of a certain age
ranges they all had to have be had been
telefonica customers for at least six
months because we needed the data and
they were all fifty percent for
metropolitan area fifty percent for mine
or metropolitan area and fifty percent
men fifty percent females and what they
did was they both filled out a standard
personality questionnaire like the one
that all psychologists used to assess
personality that's considered the golden
standard and they gave us access to
their call detail records and we use
that as our training set and then the
goal is to state to see if by struck you
know serve like we can predict
personality basically from the data that
we are safe from the cold detail records
and the answer is that you know we had
pretty good results I'll go into the
classification results
we try with different algorithms we
obtain similar results out of the 400
something variables we did feature
selection again too many variables and
we got about 87 or up our classification
results so you have to conclude
basically is going to say that you know
this is an industry their communications
are maybe you haven't heard of because
you've all heard of Facebook or Google
but maybe not so much about a
telecommunications company but you know
we have a lot of data very challenging
problems and real-life progress that you
know we are working on and there is a
lot of machine learning problems to deal
with and I'll just finish by saying that
all of this that we are hiring so if any
of you is interested in any of these
send me an email and thank you for your
attention
if there is two minute there is a new
subscriber
yeah yeah yeah yeah we will no no no
where we allow people to belong to
multiple communities so one person can
be no tomato from units but they are not
overlapping yeah so it could be the work
community and then you could belong to a
family community but I mean it could be
the case I can see you within so one
person can belong to multiple
communities but the communities
themselves like the rest of the people
in the community I don't think they are
overlapping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
