product manager and the Adsense team
here it's my pleasure to welcome
professor Marshall they all started
Google today marshals were concerns
information economics to add context on
the subject I'll say that Wikipedia
states that information economics is a
branch of economics that studies how
information affects economic decisions
information special because it is easy
to spread it's so hard to control it is
easy to create but hard to trust and it
influences many of our decisions however
the special nature of information
complicates many standard economic
theories information economics focuses
on three areas the study of information
of symmetries
goods and the economics information
technology
professor Marshall Van Alstyne speak to
us today about recent research that
applies information economics to
fighting spam this talk will discuss up
creating such attention market to solve
problems more effectively than even a
hypothetical what
perfect filter that has either false
positives or false negatives this
multi-disciplinary approach blends
important ideas for solving pollution
problems based on the course they are
signaling and screening for those of you
that's uh professor Stieglitz last week
here at Google he had pioneered the
concept of screening the result creates
a market instead of shutting it down the
talk wall success briefly novel
applications for privacy advertising and
spread of viruses and a new economy
please note this talk will be
distributed at Google Video professors
invited questions through at the top and
just be aware of confidentiality
information that you include in your
questions because it would be a good
my pleasure is up me and love me
Marshall van alstyne signal is bad okay
well thanks very much for coming ash
will try to make this interesting and I
certainly welcome questions throughout
the talk sometimes saving them till the
end you know it doesn't get much of a
discussion going but I feel like to have
that happen and feel free to interject
at any point I'll see if I can
paraphrase the question and come back I
also want to acknowledge my co-authors
in this work p loader and Rick wash of
an instrumental in making sure that
things have actually move forward on
this but I'll give you a little bit a
background on some of the information
economic research we do we cover a large
number of different areas this includes
for example the economics of network and
product design and we look for example
how you would set standards how you'd
create barriers to entry how would you
price information codes is one of the
first items we also look at how
information flows and communications
might affect productivity we ran a
five-year study sponge bone ash inul
Science Foundation tracking all the
emails in a firm all the white-collar
email then correlating that with the
productivity of the workers within the
firm if we could actually track the
social networks and see what folks are
doing with that happy to build questions
on that after the talk we also take a
quick look at some economics of open
source business models how is that you
capture the broad properties of open
access and distribution and then perhaps
recapture some of the benefits of
incentive mechanisms as well and can you
bring those together but the one I want
to speak on today is really the
communications markets can we actually
do something with communications and
improve the problems with spam so I'm
going to see if I can introduce you a
couple of ideas from information
economics maybe make a controversial
statement or two among those we'll see
if we can support the claim that we can
actually do better for users than a
hypothetical perfect filter with no
false positives and no false negatives
and how is it we would be able to make
that claim so want to see if I can walk
you through something ideas of how we
would actually support development on
the communications market now let me
give you overall agenda the description
of the problem we're going to tackle
from a number of different dimensions
will take a look at it from a regulatory
angle from a technological angle and
suggest why I think they're going to be
some difficulties taking that particular
approach and then want to move into the
Coase theorem and show why a property
rights approach might actually be very
helpful in this particular context and
adding in some of the ideas as Matt
Conde mentioned from Joe Stiglitz on
signaling and screening there's some
very powerful ideas there for
information revelation finding the good
information finding the gems in among
the bad want to compare it elects you
show you a model of what this would be
like relative to a perfect filter and
let's see if we can actually do the
comparison why we think one would be
better than the other and then in the
end I like to cover some of the
surrounding issues not just the
technology or why we think it works
would also cover some of the adoption
the free speech viruses and spam zombie
questions about how that would be
affected by such a mechanism okay so
here's a little bit of data this comes
mostly from the pure internet reporter
from New York Times or some other
sources one of them estimated yearly
losses to businesses are about 20
billion maybe more if you estimate you
know two dollars per head per month that
winds up adding up very quickly both the
United States and abroad so it's quite a
substantial amount if you look at the
cost of filtering the federal ken spam
act when in place enacted in 2004 with
new United support of Congress
superseding eight state laws but there's
been almost no impact in the amount of
spam and effort if you look at the time
right Mel is about fifty five percent
all communications were spam in
2003-2004 is up seventy-seven percent
it's still hovering around there you
guys might even have more recent data
than I on some of that but it hasn't
actually had much of a dent another
interesting implication is that most of
the spam comes from zombies at the
moment people if you could actually
trace it and find out who's sending it
you like to be able to shut it down but
a lot of it is being sent by these
infected machines and the owners of the
machines are not aware that their
machines are actually sending out spam
so how did how can we deal with that
kind of a problem then lastly is a
really interesting problem in that no
one has been able to really effectively
define spam certainly not on the basis
of content if you look at the Pew
Internet report most adults ninety-two
percent would agree that adult or
pornographic unsolicited communications
are spam but it's still
something like seventy four percent
political and religious unsolicited
communication is considered spam this
drops to sixty-five percent for
charities then down to thirty two
percent for unsolicited communications
with the prior business relationship and
then all the way down to eleven percent
unsolicited communications even when you
granted them prior permission to send
you solicitations so it's really
interesting trying to define it on the
content or in some sense on these
behaviors this is a nice photograph down
here Alan Ralphie interviewed by the New
York Times you vowed to carry on after
the can-spam act was enacted okay so
what are some of the issues with
existing approaches to spam if we take a
look at the legislative approaches we
can look at things like taxing banning
labeling things of that we've got
difficulties first with defining spam as
we just noted with the definitions in
the pew internet report we've also got a
big problem with jurisdictional issues
if folks can reach anywhere across the
internet how is it you can actually use
laws to reach them it's very difficult
to actually training them and get
traction through the legal system or if
you label it you require labeling then
people simply set their filters to take
a particular message send it into the
digital circular file and then the
effect of it is simply nullified so that
folks are there's no incentive reason to
actually label your message as
advertising and then finally if you try
taxes it taxing it's very blunt because
it affects all messages not just
advertising messages or spam messages so
we've got a big problem there the
technology the filtering one's actually
going to a couple of nice examples of
that there's some interesting thing some
of the most successful approaches are
the Bayesian filters and some of the
challenge response systems let me see if
we can go into a couple nice examples of
these and again happy to take any
questions on the technologies here's a
fun one that was developed by someone
presented at the MIT spam conference
short while ago the idea is to tie up
the tcp/ip port for those machines that
are spewing unban messages you can
identify the ones that actually have too
much traffic on the matte red tie them
up in a very clever idea with tcp/ip
pattern detection this is an anomalous
pattern so you could say error 451 your
spam is important to us please stay on
line how is very innovative approach
this is one that you probably all will
have seen as you have had to take a
compute completely automated public
tests to tell computers and humans apart
the typical CAPTCHA so the idea here is
that you need to do pattern recognition
in a way that a computer often finds
very difficult the fascinating thing
about this is that the spammers have
inverted the captures they now require
what they do is they send the captures
out to human beings in exchange for
pornography so the humans solve the
capture problem for them get them
accounts from what you then send out
spam so it's an interesting way of
inverting the computer test yes question
male the content
beautiful beautiful example what they do
is they reverse the problem so that your
filters can't pick it up they'll send
the spam in an image I'll actually show
an example that thank you in just a
moment another interesting problem this
is a nice illustration developed by
fellow jonathan grahm coming how to beat
an adaptive spam filter the idea here is
if you can train a filter to recognize
spam you can train a filter to recognize
spam so that any technology in the hands
can be used in the hands of an attacker
to defeat the same technology it
provides an arms race reciprocity
recursive definition problem and in fact
when he pried it on his own email he
found that Berkshire Marriott and
wireless were effectively email
kryptonite they could always go through
his filters we'd have to train it but
the idea is trained one filter you can
train another filter what these guys do
is they take accounts on yahoo and
amazon AOL and others and if the spam
doesn't reach those accounts they train
it on the other side to realize that it
hasn't gone through so they've been
doing some very clever things to get
through i want to take it a little bit
farther though so i gave you a caution
here this is actual spam messages have
been sent out so i'll give you full
political correctness warning few of
these are risque so i want to take a
little bit further and suggest there are
reasons to believe this is going to an
extremely hard problem to solve okay
where is the word viagra or naughty body
part used in any of the following
messages all right here's one get a Trog
like a fire hose right that one's
straight through because it was actually
using clever use of metaphor but using
metaphors to actually figure it out and
the computer had not gotten that one
this is a linguistic one take a look now
at this one that's it right is your
flower wilting will help it grow right I
defy you to write a program that will
recognize that kind of metaphor in
advance when you haven't seen the
metaphor and know what to anticipate one
of the ones I thought was really fun was
an adapted cartoon which is there all
these cats and dogs showing up here with
their tails erect the fellow standing by
his bedside is saying that's odd this
bottle was full two days ago
well you and I know exactly what he's
talking about but of course that's very
hard to pick up in any kind of computer
fill filtering system so I'd like to
argue that language and metaphor and
visual images are sufficiently plastic
it is extremely hard to write a program
to do that at the point you can you'll
probably have a program that can pass
the Turing test so I'd like to suggest
that there perhaps ought to be other
ways to try to attack the problem these
are actual spam these are actual spams
right so now I want to see if I can
address the original problem if we're
going to address it we first have to
define spam what I'd like to do is no
what is spam if we show that cascading
list of different beliefs in what the
content might be there's no consensus
agreement I like to submit to that in an
economic sense it's actually relatively
easy to define spam is information or
message pollution it's that spillover of
a small fraction of the market trying to
reach some other small fraction of the
market that's willing to buy fake Rolex
rock watches or herbal supplements or
diplomas or things like that it's really
a spillover a negative externality once
we recognize it as a pollution problem
you start to analyze what other forms of
analysis have been tried for this
particular kind of a mechanism among
them we see exactly the same phenomenon
we've seen for spam they are things like
regulation filters and one more for
regulation it's things like taxing the
effluent at the rate of the damage
another one's particularly interesting
that's good revelation about the power
of economic interpretation is considered
filters if you apply a filter to a
pollution problem where do you put it
you put the scrubber on the pipe on the
effluent or the smokestack and see if
you clean it at the source one of the
things you should see is it the current
solutions to spam through technology
have a very interesting problem we're
putting the filters at the destination
it is as if every man woman and child
had to have the equivalent of a water
filter a gas mask to drink or breathe
because it's on the receiving
that ought to suggest to you that is
extremely inefficient and it's one of
the reasons why the losses from spam are
so high it would be great if we could
apply the technology at the source but
instead we're having to apply it at the
back end the other approach is economics
likely suggests the best way to do this
in an economic sense is to apply the
Coase theorem this is in effect to
assign property rights coast got the
Nobel Prize in 91 for clarifying the
significance of transactions costs and
property rights in institutional
structure and functioning of the economy
if the traditional approach to solving
pollution problems have been taxes Coast
argument one of the most important
things to do was to assign property
rights in negative externalities what's
interesting is the very year he got this
was the very first year that they
actually had carbon trading rights
pollution trading is one of the ways is
starting to solve pollution problems but
let me drive at home in a more local
sense how many of you use an ATM card ok
I see almost every hand is going up all
right let me see if I can give you an
example of why economics and security
systems matter is a very nice
illustration from Ross Anderson why
crypto systems fail in the United States
liability for ATM fraud effectively
rests with the bank unless the bank can
prove the consumers at fault the but the
bank has to assume responsibility for
him in the UK liability rests with the
customer unless the customer can prove
the bank was at fault the customer has
to assume responsibility which is easier
who has the record-keeping and who has
the security systems in place that would
be responsible for it what's interesting
is that Anderson observes that the
incidents of fraud in the UK was
dramatically higher in the UK than the
United States the reason is effectively
where are you putting the rights on this
case you just certainly want to put them
with consumer because the bank is in a
better position to police the fraud
would have the incentives to do so it'll
be harder for the consumer to prove
fraud in the other direction ok so let's
make it local to the spam question
alright so the Coase theorem is this the
solution is to sign property
lights how are we going to do it what
we'd like to do is to assign property
rights to your attention the value of
your time and what it is that you're
doing so what we'd like to do is to
create a mechanism to charge for the
waste that others create how we're going
to do that we're going to assign the
property rights to recipients yes
questions
what
okay okay so the question is going to
give a clarification of the Coase
theorem certainly all right let's seal
it back up for just a second the Coase
theorem originally said that how you is
there are two pieces of the kind of
coast there one is that how you assign
the property rights don't really matter
because you can trade to get the
efficient solution unless there are
transactions costs if there are
transactions costs you want to assign
the property rights to the party with
the higher cost of avoidance in the ATM
case you and I have the higher cost of
avoidance so you assign the property
rights the person the ATM as a way to
think about that okay so that's that in
a nutshell is the Coase theorem thank
you ok so again in this case we want to
send the property rights to the
recipients imagine that you were to
assign the property rights to the
senders and they could threaten to waste
time effectively encouraging extortion
they would offer to send as much unless
you sold them the right it's interesting
it seems obvious but we have to be
careful about it the reason I say that
is we also think of the property right
as a right to be heard there are times
when as the sender you do want your
message to go out and you'd think that
you would want your message to reach
another's ears how would you do that how
would you balance that again the last
piece of this is the Coase theorem which
is that if the transactions costs are
high assign the property rights to the
party with the higher cost of avoidance
and in this case that would be your eye
the recipient as opposed to the spammers
who are the parties who could decide not
to send out that waste in the first
place ok so if I'm going to make a claim
about whether or not this is better than
a perfect filter I'm going to need a
model in order to be able to say which
one is better and which one is worse or
which one wins and under what conditions
so what I want to do is I want to just
present a little simple framework that
I'm going to then illustrate graphically
of how you could process messages and
what the value of those messages might
be in the top is simply representation
of the lower bound and the upper bound
to on the value to a recipient for any
given message here is a lower bound and
upper bound on the value to a sender
of any given message the key distinction
here is that a sender will know the
value of a message before it's been sent
because they composed it they wrote it
the recipient won't know the value of a
message until they've actually read it
so that's one element of the information
asymmetry that we're going to try to
model within the problem so the
recipient over vine till after reading
it there either can have a cost the cost
could be zero it doesn't really matter
and filtering will reduce the amount of
the number of messages to get through by
some fraction very simple framework
graphically on represent in the
following way if he put the value to the
sender along the x-axis everything above
their value their cost of sending will
be things that they would prefer to send
to the recipient everything above their
costs of processing would be things that
they would want okay see if I so here we
give you a couple examples of this in
the bottom right quadrant I'm sorry the
top right quadrant you know are examples
of things that are sent and that are
wanted these are your project updates
and friends long-lost high school
buddies that manage to reach you
recruiting leads from friends things
like that in the bottom right these
would be things that would be sent but
it would not necessarily be wanted this
might be market researcher focus groups
polling persuasion for vote X as you get
farther and farther more negative you
get pornography phishing scams and
viruses and keyloggers right would you
know the sender would love to get that
out but the value to you of course would
be negative in the top left would be
wanted top level be wanted but not sent
these will be things like a personalized
loan application knowledge of your own
credit history subscription content or
custom news Google Answers is also a
nice example of this kind of a problem a
little bit of interesting razzing is do
here is actually quite curious what the
value of Google Answers was so I posted
on Google answers the question how much
revenue passes through google answers
the question was deleted so an
interesting question there and the
bottom left is not wanted not sent this
would simply be messages that are
actually counterfactual you could
envision embarrassing news sent to the
wrong person but you wouldn't expect to
see it so we'll be concentrating in the
other
quadrants okay total value is the value
to all the parties involved that is
simply represented as the green area so
if you look at what's the value to the
sender's and watch the recipient that's
the total welfare and that's everything
above that 45 degree line crossing
through the cost again I really don't
care what the costs are I can move that
around anywhere but that basic shape
will hold okay so there's the in the red
however is negative value that would be
messages that effectively destroy total
social value that should be the phishing
scams and viruses and things that would
get propagated so can we then visualize
the impacts of the different
interventions well let's take a look on
the far left you can see as we increase
the costs this might represent taxes
stamps computational challenges you can
see that the cost of sending an
individual message shifts to the right
and so you're lopping disproportionately
from messages that you don't want which
is the effect that you would hope for
okay if you take a look at filters you
get a different effect here filtering
would lop off the things that the
recipient doesn't want if we have a
jaggi line here this might represent the
false positives and false negatives for
things that do get through that you
didn't want and things that got filtered
out that you did actually want so that
won't be what if filter might look like
but notice yes quick question
parties of all
say why
what something
receiver
disagree all right okay let me let me
suffer for a benefit of other somebody's
paraphrase a question how do we get the
sum of values is the 45 degree line and
is that realistic the answer in in
almost any trade situation you'd always
want to look at the surplus to both
parties the buyer and the seller would
be a common metaphor for that in
economics would you always want to do is
to look at the total surplus across both
parties so it's the benefit to all of
the transacting parties that's why you
want the gate the gains from trade as
you transfer one good from one person to
another they'll get the decrement in
value to the center presumably a higher
increment to the buyer which is why the
transfer creates wealth in this case
what we want to look at is when is it
that a message transfer creates wealth
so the sum of those values will be the
weather some this may be reaching which
is slightly negative to the consumed the
recipient but so positive they're
willing to actually pay for it such as
market research here's where you get the
credit report that you really like to
know your own score but it's costly for
them to generate so you want to pay them
to do that is that representative we
actually think that you can represent
almost any pairwise interaction that way
would be fairly standard mechanism to do
that that's how we get the 45 degree
line thanks any other questions
for real filtering
that's
I don't see how you
force way it's like that photograph
that's a filtering
things like
select recipients but my favorites
infuses
so inside you send
message which is has a good it's the
developer
but the thousand people
and the people instruction has an
individualized from there
okay actually so let me rephrase a
question or the individualized nature of
filters would be representative in this
so each different people would have
different filtering preferences so
different messages might go through the
beauty of this is that we actually want
to represent this would be the
preferences of an individual user so a
message that might be positive to you
and not to me would have a very
different schedule in this but you can
still represent it as the pairwise
interaction with your preferences or my
preferences which ever one you happen to
be enacting at that time so it should be
a very good representation of whatever
your preference whatever you want is
going to go through to you it's all this
does is it operates without cost it
makes no mistakes by your definition and
let those messages through and no other
that's all that does so again we want to
make it a perfect filter by an
individual person's definition and then
we aggregate over different people okay
all right notice this message is these
messages get filtered out and those
messages are messages that aren't
generated so what I want to imply is
exactly the classic gains from trade
that you have from economics is there
room for any negotiation is there a room
for creating wealth by encouraging
messages to get sent that should have
been sent or compensating folks for
messages that senders want to get out
and you don't necessarily want them how
is it we're going to actually achieve
something like that is their region for
game again what I want to argue is not
so much of this mechanism going to
propose is better at false positives or
negatives it's not what it should be
better at is giving you more of the
messages that you do want and few of the
messages that you don't want and for
those that you don't you actually get
compensated so both parties turn out to
be better off okay as an example of this
messages that aren't sent up here we
actually did fun we got challenged when
you first put this out all these
messages aren't sent clear they don't
exist actually found some great examples
here's one from New York Times someone
who's paying for 15 for each sales lead
that comes through this flower shop and
Google Answers is actually a really nice
example of this where you post a bond
in order to get information tailored to
your specific answers so it really is an
example of that top left quadrant ok so
this race is a difficult problem though
if it go back to the Coase theorem it
actually assumes costless negotiation
well now we got a problem because how
are you going to negotiate descent
communication and communication itself
is the source of the problem we've got a
nasty catch-22 here how are you going to
resolve that well in this case we're
going to go use the ideas of signaling
and screening there's an information
asymmetry present that is one person
knows the message content and another
person does not that's the information
asymmetry the person that wrote the
message knows the content the recipient
has no idea if it's a stranger they
don't know the person and I haven't read
the message so we're going to use the
resolution to information asymmetry
problems is typically found in signaling
and screening signals are actions taken
by the informed party to tell you that
they really know something suppose that
you're considering two identical
products and you offered a warranty
you're offered one product as is and
your offer the other product with a 30
day money-back guarantee which product
would you have more confidence in
purchasing in terms of its quality the
warranty serves as a signal of the
higher quality good because it's an
expensive prospect if they're going to
have to take it back then they're going
to actually have to incur a cost they
know though how the seller of a higher
quality good is more willing to warranty
it's it's claimed function than someone
who doesn't has a low quality good
screening is a choice taken by the
uninformed party this is how you
separate out the good type from the bad
type for example when an insurance
contract is led out on a life insurance
policy often it won't kick in for six
months or a year from the date of
purchase why is that well the person
taking out the life insurance policy
would have much better information on
whether or not they're likely to have a
terminal illness so you write one policy
if you're going to ensure for x 0 you're
at a different policy if you're going to
ensure
from the future you're more likely to
separate out people who know whether or
not they have a terminal illness by
using that kind of a contract by using
that kind of a screen so we're going to
use those kinds of mechanisms to
separate out the good legitimate senders
legitimate advertisers and long-lost
friends from spammers who know the
content of their messages okay so if the
senator knows more about the message in
the receiver what we want to do is force
them to reveal that private knowledge
you want to screen based on intent
rather than content I tried to argue
earlier that because of metaphors and
technological difficulty that is a very
very hard thing to do we're going to do
is rather than doing an ex ante
classification problem of the content
which is extremely difficult we want to
do an ex post classification of was it
spam which is really easy so what we do
is we ask this an unknown sender to
simply post a small amount in escrow a
tiny bond the recipient gets to choose
that in proportion to their opportunity
cost I'll show you why in a moment
they'll choose it directly in proportion
to their own opportunity cost of time
unknown senders post that otherwise
their messages don't come through it's
simply ding so if you're not recognized
and you're not willing to promise that
it's not spam you never clutter the
person's mailbox on reading the message
the recipient chooses to claim or return
the bond after the fact okay it's like
returning the product based on whether
or not it actually did what it said it
was going to do the effect is the
willingness to post that helps to screen
people have the intention of sending
legitimate mail from the people who have
the intention of sending illegitimate
mail a spammer cannot afford to make
that promise because they will break it
and the cost basis doesn't justify it
they can't make any money they currently
make money on one in 10,000 messages or
so if you're going to actually if enough
people claim these bonds they can't do
that the economically won't make any
sense it shifts the task from ex-ante
classification which is really hard to
ex post verification and that's easy and
it also compensates you directly for any
wasted time
huh
about the
send us back over
most residents
to have hours
sending that email
as
I like the all right so the question is
have we just reversed the problem about
senders identifying which recipients
they want I actually i'll come back to
that a little bit about honey pots and
reputation systems I think you're
absolutely correct but I think we have
the solution for that alright in a
nutshell when look at is marketers
spammers aren't going to want to send to
honey pots and marketers are going to
want to send to it either so the list
should become self correcting I'll come
back to that in a couple of slides okay
okay this is simply an example protocol
of this actually one of my colleagues we
first discussed implemented a low level
version of this in paypal i know that
some other companies have actually tried
to implement this kind of thing in
massachusetts so here's what would
happen if sender sends a message
initially sends that out then goes to
the recipients mail server and if
they're not a stranger it simply gets
delivered it goes straight on through if
they are a stranger then there's a
simple bond challenge it's like a
computational challenge but instead of a
puzzle it's actually a modest amount of
currency specified by the recipient it's
then authorized by the escrow service or
if it were an unusual amount in those
rare cases then the sender might have to
authorize it or not suppose it would
bond challenger in the amount of ten
dollars as opposed to two cents then you
would want to actually have some veto
power over it but usually this would
just happen in the background with no
human intervention okay so either so
they could authorize it or deny it once
the money is escrowed it's in the third
party safe safe house and then recipient
is modified and the message is delivered
at which point the recipient can simply
acknowledge and return the bond and it
goes back or it simply expires so the
money can simply be reused again or not
at all yeah
get what
that viral tack is exactly one of the
things that that was one of the nastiest
problems to solve we actually have a
solution to or it so the question was
can use a botnet to actually show us a
infect the machines and then use and
then drain the accounts we actually have
a great solution to that I'll ask you
with an anticipatory question do you
carry a credit card if you do then we
will have solved your problem hold on to
it okay now the last one was a warning
on risk game message this is a warning
on economic so I fear I'm going to have
a couple of equations up here cuz i
wanted to justify the claim that i made
earlier all right so without going into
a great deal of detail most of this is
actually in our paper the first
equations all of these do is that
calculate the area in which the bonding
which the choice of bond would be and
how much value that would create so
that's a calculation of that area up
there we can in calculate what the total
amount of benefit to the recipient would
be that's what those equations do then
we look at the total amount of benefit
the area from the perfect filter and we
can compare those two areas to see when
one dominates it is it is not always the
case of the bond can be the perfect
filter there plenty of occasional filter
can actually do better but plenty of
situations exist in which it is actually
possible for this solution to leave the
users with greater benefit than even a
perfect filter and that is actually the
gist of the of the mathematical proof
that we provide in the paper to show
what happens but we've shown it
graphically and you can see as you'd
move the spaces around why it might be
the case we could recover some of those
yellow areas that are lost by filtering
mechanisms precisely because it promotes
trade and exchange okay so here's here's
how you choose the bond he's all you'd
set it to your opportunity cost if you
that would be the basic message if as
you increase the choice of bond there's
the risk of seizing something and the
potential cost goes up to sender if you
send it up too high you risk losing
valuable messages that you would want so
you'll want to reduce that to level
where you don't risk losing too many
valuable messages but notice that if you
do get messages you don't want
your value is actually increasing in
this range so that you're actually
because of the transfer payment effect
if you actually do claim the message so
that's in this that's the sense of what
you're compensated for wasteful
communication right and what you're
doing is you're literally maximizing the
area in that region but you're really
just setting it proportional to your
opportunity cost of time is what you're
doing okay and if we introduce different
classes of senders there would be
different distributions with different
effects so for example if that were you
know the class of friends relatives
aunts and uncles so there's effectively
good mail up there some messages you
didn't necessarily want in there and
that's the class of bad mail from
spammers advertisers or things often
that category of other consumption where
folks consider it spam and you can see
what the effect to the different
mechanisms are as you've got more of the
area above this line in actual captured
surplus as opposed to here where it's
simply filtered and thrown away right so
you've actually we've done again simply
trying to demonstrate across multiple
distributions that it's possible to
actually do better by users and by
senders by promoting an exchange in a
mechanism where we didn't have to
negotiate we used signaling and
screening mechanisms to actually get
that to happen okay one quick question
this one comes up from The Economist
they're always very draconian this is
why not just sees the bond all the time
well there a couple reasons why you
might not do this one of these is you
definitely want to distinguish yourself
from a honeypot so that if you want
particular kinds of messages you want
news on camping gear you want something
you don't claim those kinds of messages
the other thing is you can easily
implement a feedback mechanism on this
the feedback on ebay for example exceeds
ninety-six percent positive ratings
these feedback mechanisms are very
powerful at getting people to do the
right thing the action at a distance
rung strangers when you report on their
behaviors tends to lead to very accurate
behaviors or congenial behaviors in
there so we think those kinds of
mechanisms can help solve that
particular problem not seizing it all
the time
well they could do that but if there's
one is it worth your time to threaten
for two cents or a nickel right it's not
it's probably not worth it at that point
right and if you could just refund it at
two or five cents and you're not out
anything even if you didn't if you
wanted to the question was you know why
not threatened to extort on that just
like at the beginning I think it that
transactions cost it probably does not
worth it pushing the back
see so far
yeah that's actually a great question so
the question is how but what about shill
bidders which pump each other's
reputation there you can use exactly the
same kinds of mechanisms that eBay
currently uses to identify shield
bidders when the things go back and
forth and back and forth with no
communication outside the particular
closed Network you can often use that
network topology to identify subnodes
sub networks that are that are
problematic I also suspect that it'll
show in a moment the folks at do
marketing will be very careful and will
use a couple of test messages and your
reputation become very valuable over
time exactly as your credit cards do
they'll try to sell you particular kinds
of services based on your past behaviors
and you'll it's your behaviors in
transactions with other third parties
that will help to determine what
additional information you get as a
result of them as a result of that so it
should converge over time
individuals health hazard
if you get an email from
was to be a customer
ya know what to tell whether
oh one thing that you should never do is
you easily set your default so that you
would never reply with a bond anyone
who's coming in and spamming has the
problem of first reaching you risk
putting their bond at risk but to a
response you don't do it you never
someone has already solicited you and
you should never attach a bond in
reverse that should solve that problem
it's a great it's a great example of an
adverse selection problem but they have
to put their stuff at risk before they
can even reach your mailbox and you
probably won't respond it's interesting
question okay no so let's go on to some
of the adopt so let's go precisely on
some of these adoption infrastructure
and policy issues some of the honey pots
and questions like that how would we
actually deal with some of those
questions okay one of these is consider
the advantages for direct marketing
anyone know what the costs of printing
and posting direct mail piece is well
I'm google I'm expected i really
expected someone have an answer for that
okay all right not I mean that side all
right Direct Mail cost for printing and
postage if you include the actual cost
of creating the document and then the
bulk rate mailing it costs at least
thirty cents maybe sometimes sixty cents
to do that so direct mail piece can
actually fairly expensive in comparison
with that the economics of this are
extremely attractive you could probably
get something posted at least for
somewhere between two and five cents in
the mechanism like this so the relative
economics on a one-to-one basis are
extremely attractive second the receiver
gets the benefit not the printer or the
mailer if you're getting direct mail you
would get the benefit you would actually
go into your bank account as opposed to
spending it on third-party access and if
you're if you don't want it it's also
not polluting environment in this case
you're not circular filing it toast to
all digital another thing that happens
in this is that you get more information
on the other end you get vastly better
information than on TV radio or even
direct mail campaigns because if they
claim LaVon they've effectively told you
they don't want communication on this
topic and there's no way to get that
same information on a direct mail
campaign
if they'd act positively to make a
purchase that doesn't cover the ground
where geez they're kind of interested
but you didn't have anything in the
catalog this time that you really wanted
here you get direct feedback on the
preferences when folks say I don't want
any more of this so in some sense your
lists become self cleaning from the
question in the back from earlier direct
markers will be very adroit at looking
at who has claimed these things in the
past and sending them more of the kinds
of information on which they have not
been claiming the bonds because that's
the nature of the preferences they have
expressed through their own behaviors
okay if you take a look at the marketing
on that the size of the direct marketing
spending is about fifty two billion and
this is of about 270 billion in
advertising these numbers are actually
from 2004 from the US statistical
abstracts I suspect you guys may have
even better numbers on advertising as a
whole than I in this case they claimed
internet advertising the only about
seven billion dollars it may be more I
suspect I'll be getting no information
on on that any event the ad market is
actually quite large in this case and
you may be able to do lots of resource
reallocation for the benefit of users as
opposed to spending it on printing and
postage okay not consider the advantages
for users suppose that you were outside
a system protected by this kind of a
mechanism and you send your very first
message to a person in the network
protected by such a mechanism what
happens well the first thing is you
might get a challenge response back it
says okay adopt this plugin and you'll
get the following four things first
you'll get your message delivered so it
will actually go through second your
spam problem be eliminated because all
in the future anyone else having to
reach you laughter them engage in
similar behavior so you won't have a
spam problem third you won't have to do
this challenge response thing again for
anyone protected by this mechanism of
network so no more captures for you this
thing has been solved once for everyone
else inside the network and forth oh
yeah we're going to create a small bank
account on your behalf in which
advertisers can start dropping nickels
all of a sudden the done adoption
dynamics look a lot more attractive when
you're actually suddenly getting paid or
underwritten to do something like that I
would submit to you there's even another
interesting variant on this the
advertising market is around 270 billion
dollars and even know what the size of
the credit card market is in the United
States all credit instruments and ATM
cards debit cards and any idea what that
is
it's approximately 1.7 trillion dollars
imagine the possibility that if you were
to attach this kind of a mechanism to
the email channel you could have the
equivalent of emma's on 1-click to any
kind of acoma ecommerce purchase
anywhere all of a sudden you can start
to tap into that one point seven
trillion dollar market as opposed to 270
billion dollar market and now you're
talking real money so it may be possible
to actually do something interesting
with the economics of it if you can
actually get a tiny piece of that
revenue stream because anyone with a
system like this could use it to make
purchases from amazon used to make
purchase for magazine subscription
llbean anything conducted online okay
how it concerns this raises a number of
interesting concerns I've heard for
example honey pots and viruses at least
among some of them so let me see if we
can actually address some of those okay
one of these honey pots all right great
I'll set up a honey pot and retire so
here's one possibility as a marketer
what's your incentive to
indiscriminately mail bonds to buyers in
the presence of honey pots answer almost
none you will start to be very careful
because just want to start targeting
those those are expensive messages now
you're going to target them as direct
mail pieces are targeted to people who
are good prospects in this particular
area this is exactly what should happen
in effect we have caused the people who
are spamming or in this case advertising
to internalize the costs of the waste
that they produce by internalizing that
cost they start to focus their messages
on good prospects matching preferences
and this is exactly the behavior that we
want question
while I can sort of say welcome
you're not something
absolutely fine fine point so the
question is what about privacy with
respects your own preferences there are
at least two different solutions to that
one would be to use an account that
won't post that information in which
case marketers would probably have to
assume that you are potentially honey
pot and no it's very high risk using
that another is that you could use an
account that does post information but
provide muddy signals you could post a
very high bond and never sees it you
could post a very low bond and always
sees it in which case there's no
preference elicitation so any of those
mechanisms might actually achieve the
privacy goal that you're talking about
okay second one this is one kind of
interesting nice one actually won't a
financial mechanism exclude much of the
world's poor who have no bank accounts
maybe the intent of this one's actually
very very nice one I actually think is a
really good set of issues in here right
but to be honest I actually think this
is asking the wrong question I think
that a better thing to do is to ask how
can a financial system be used to help
the poor in a situation like this really
the question is if we take a look at the
moment advertising supports the access
to television and radio for millions of
people at present why couldn't it also
be used to support access to isps for
millions more people at present I think
there's a better way to view this which
is what is the one thing that the
world's poor would have in great
abundance time time but they can't
transact on their labor at a distance
imagine the potential that if you're
actually able to give folks a bank
account and give them a means of
communicating and transacting at a
remote distance anywhere around the
world and you can underwrite that with a
form of advertising then all of a sudden
you might actually be able to do a great
deal of good and I actually think there
could be a possibility of that if you're
skeptical anyone know what happened last
Friday with the award of the Nobel Peace
Prize it was actually awarded to
Muhammad Yunus for microcredit
microcredit is a form of loan given out
to some of the world's poorest people in
Bangladesh
and it is an extraordinary
accomplishment because it helped to
create wealth what they did is they
allow very very small loans and poor
Bangladesh's that apply for these loans
in small groups and no one else in the
group can actually get the loan until
the rest is paid off they claim the
repayment rate is easily as high as
conventional banks in a system like this
so they're using micro credit and I'm
going to argue that it may be possible
to do that kind of thing in the
communications channels to underwrite it
and actually provide transactions and
facilitate trade at a distance the one
thing they have got in abundance is time
and I think we can actually take
advantage of that okay this is an
interesting one doesn't this risk
limiting free speech I am totally honest
that compared to a baseline no
intervention case this actually does
introduce more friction on communication
than no intervention whatsoever but I
want to pose the question to you with
respect to what do you want the no
intervention case where it's if you're
trying to get a message out it's very
hard for you to rise above the noise at
the moment you might well be interpreted
as spam because it is very hard to
distinguish legitimate communications
from illegitimate communications this
would at least give you a mechanism for
filtering out legitimate communications
from illegitimate communications there's
also interesting problem remember the
original slide on the data is how many
people think political and charitable
speech are spam there's seventy-four
percent for political speech and
sixty-five percent for charitable speech
if people tune their filters to turn
that stuff out you can't get through if
which are comparing it to is a filtering
mechanism with individuals can choose to
set their filters to what they think is
spam and you're trying to get a
political message out you can't get
through it all because there's no
negotiation the mechanism like this you
could get through if you set it as a tax
again the same thing you get seventy
four percent collecting it versus
everyone paying it I think they're
actually certain advantages for
mechanism like this there's one
additional advantage that's quite
significant and this is would you want
any centralized Authority determine
which content you got would you like the
Chinese government the North Korean
government or even yahoo or AOL Time
Warner determining which content was
communicated or a communications
channels if i'm not mistaken and it may
be on this I believe that Yahoo may for
have policies against soliciting people
on yahoo for other ISPs accounts well
why not extend that to critiques of
Yahoo or other things like that a
mechanism like this is actually
completely decentralized and content
neutral it makes it possible for almost
any kind of communication to go through
and there's no centralized authority
that gets to determine which content is
legitimate and which content is
illegitimate so I would argue that
partly in comparison to other potential
mechanisms it actually has a couple of
very desirable properties so there that
was one of the questions on free speech
now how about the one on spam zombies
all right someone had asked about spam
zombies on that if sixty-five percent of
spam is sent by infected zombie it
doesn't this create a user nightmare and
one of the biggest problems is and this
one came up from original we heard this
was actually on slashdot we first
published some of our research we got /
dotted and one of the biggest objections
was what happens when this head when all
of a sudden the spammers can seize
grandma's account all you're going to be
doing is spending grandma's money
grandma can't be a systems administrator
doesn't want to be a systems
administrator isn't that a terrible
thing I do at the time that sounded like
a very serious objection I think
actually is very simple solution okay
how many of you have credit cards how
many of you have ever paid from major
fraud on your credit card all right
every almost every hand went up for a
credit card but almost no hand but no
hand is going up for actually paying on
major fraud why the credit card company
knows that the value the expected value
of your transaction so far exceeds
expected value of your losses they're
willing to ensure you in order to get
the value of your business suppose what
we do is that we simply ensure folks
against fraud on their account provided
that the ISP gets to maintain the
antiviral software now grandma doesn't
have to be a systems administrator and
we've used the Coase theorem to put the
incentives and the property rights in an
area where someone actually wants to
maintain it and has the skills to do it
this could actually make it harder to
infect grandma's machine so if we use
these mechanisms carefully it may be
possible to actually thwart the spread
of viruses you can also think about some
of the propagation on detection
mechanisms from the bigger networks if
you were to try to spend down grandma's
account you might try two different
approaches one you could either try to
spend all of our account at one time
this is almost surely anomalous because
grandma isn't sending out all of these
messages at one time the way a spammer
might write so that would probably flag
it exactly as the transactions are
pulled up on credit cards when they
start making three thousand dollar
purchases of plasma TVs I actually had
this happen and and MX called me about
it now consider the possibility that
they stride geez I'll take a nickel from
this account a nickel from this account
and nickel from this account at present
there is no feedback mechanism there's
no information going back to the
infected owner to let you know that your
machines infected with this mechanism
one of these parties is likely to say
geez I didn't mail this what happened
you build in a detection mechanism so
that a centralized authority can figure
it out and say gene maybe they didn't
maybe they're a couple of these other
messages that we can act your start
tracing it so you start to create an
information trail to figure out which
machines are in detected so we think
that it may be possible to detect the
attacks to the patterns better with a
mechanism like this then via existing
mechanisms okay so let me leave you a
couple of parting thoughts okay one of
these is the potential social benefits
in comparison to direct marketing we
think it's vastly better than existing
things like direct mail it's cheaper the
receiver gets the benefit as opposed to
the communications channel provides
information feedback and it avoids
harmful reputation effects in their
recipients also now have one really
interesting thing as recipients now have
reason to publish their
contact information at present I hide
several of my contact email boxes in gif
images because i don't want web crawlers
to actually spider than spend me more
spam with mechanism like this it doesn't
matter you want to publish this
information because then people who
reach you only the legitimate folks are
willing to take the risk if there are
stranger so you know publish that
contact information as opposed to hide
it we shift the arm race to crypto it's
this ex post verification and the
cryptography in the bonds and this is a
much more easily winnable arms race than
the problem of trying to detect is this
a metaphor for herbal viagra or not
that's an extremely difficult problem to
solve it permits otherwise potentially
filtered communication if you tune your
filters to tune out certain kinds of
political messages those simply don't
get through it all and this would
actually help help it go through it also
tells you individual preferences if we
look at that whole cascading different
series of who believes what is spam each
of you can have a different set of
preferences and you can decide to seize
it or not depending on what you prefer
finally this this is kind of fun it lets
you reclaim the value of your mailbox
from any marketer from any list once
you've gotten on someone else's list you
may be able to get off of it but they
let they often require you to go 12
pages deep into some HTML file now take
them off your white list if they do hbu
syou're attention then they're going to
have to bond themselves in order to get
back through again so you can get off
any list you want because you've got the
property right in your own time and
attention as opposed to assuming that
they happen so we think that actually
gives you a lot of more benefit in that
so it really helps you get off put any
of those lists so then leave you with a
couple of parting thoughts on that one
one of the biggest things I think we've
done is to actually recognize what spam
is if you define it as information
pollution then you see a whole host of
other phenomenon associated with spam
and figure out what why it is the
different approaches work or don't work
and why it is that the technology
solutions are so inefficient and they
make each and every one of us put on
filters when it should in fact be the
burden on the people sending the mail
the property rights provide these very
valuable signals in the attention market
that
tell you what time and attention are
worth and help to elicit the preference
information you get lots of revelation
of people's desires what they do want
and what they don't want is is captured
in these reputations and also there is a
potential a little bit of strategic
interactions as you do get these
honeypot potentials that's absolutely
one of the potentials but it does force
the spammers and the advertisers to
internalize their own costs so it's got
these feedback mechanisms and combined
with these two sided insurance markets
you can reduce the spread of viruses and
spam zombies so it's a whole system of
economic principles that we can actually
use to try to address the problem and
help shut it down so with that let me
see if I can take any further questions
we do have we do have a full paper
academic I have some popular treatments
of this that we're happy to share on
interest and at the end also still happy
to take any questions on the
productivity of economics of open source
questions I think you had a question now
must address on the problems we have fun
was just about are there any problems
with you
any problem i like that question are
there any problems that we haven't found
good answers to yet there are a couple
of really subtle attacks one of the
cleverest attacks i heard was if you
could get into grandma's computer could
you seize an incoming bond and grandma
wouldn't know about it and the other
person would just think grandma's a jerk
that was one of the clever ones to do
that I think there are ways of getting
around that as well but that's where I
think you're going to need some more
thought for that particular kind of
problem all of you once you put
financial transactions on the table you
create more incentives for folks to move
in and actually skim off some of the
value those are different attacks that
and I think there are some solutions to
that but I think we can also use some
economics to croute me just make it not
worthwhile when what's in the table is
to sentence or five cents yes
full costs are
in five sites
okay all right that's that's a great
question that's a setup question here
will pay for pay for that with a good
setup question all right why don't why
don't microsystem why don't
micropayments work all right you know
people have tried micropayments why
don't they work all right let me give
you two different answers to that all
right one of them is it advertising
works when you can track the
transactions across a platform when when
the original micro payment systems for
advertising were set up there they're
kind of out of band channel and you
weren't looking at the communications
the nice thing about TV and radio is
that you know when someone's watching
sci fi or kitty programming you know if
they're listening to classical or
listening to rock you need to track the
transactions across the platform to
elicit that preference information if
you don't have that then you're getting
missed targeted ads and there's also a
big problem the amounts that people were
talking about we're below the
opportunity costs of people so there's
no reason for people to go there there's
an out of bound which is inbound
communications problem the reason it's a
great setup is actually because the real
answer is also found in two-sided
markets and that's actually a special
area of research that we've been working
on matter of fact there there's an
article in this month october two
thousand six harvard business review on
two-sided markets and why those things
help solve those kinds of problems
anytime you introduce a new payment
system you are going to have resistance
in the system imagine how long did it
take for credit cards take hold
initially how long did it take for
American Express to launch matter of
fact they recently sued mastercard visa
for being in trench and not being able
to get in there are very very powerful
network effects the issue is really any
time you've got a new kind of a payment
system why your merchants going to
accept that form of payment unless
consumers carry it why are consumers
going to carry it unless merchants
accept it you've got a two-sided market
and you must solve that problem
simultaneously the original micropayment
systems didn't actually do that to solve
that you need to subsidize one side of
the market what's the subsidy and credit
cards you and I get free frequent flyer
points that's a subsidy as long as
you're paying the paying your bill on
time that encourages you to do it you're
also getting free
insurance on that so you're getting
unlike if you're carrying two hundred
dollars in cash or a thousand dollars
whether you can catch when your travel
you got additional insurance on your car
that you don't have in cash so you're
getting additional benefits additional
subsidies if you solve the two-sided
market problem you can introduce a new
