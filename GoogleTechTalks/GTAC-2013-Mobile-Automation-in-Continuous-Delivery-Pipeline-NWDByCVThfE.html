welcome back this is always one of the
toughest talks of the day it's right
after lunch you're gonna be a little
sleepy we could try some things we could
maybe have this elevator go up or down
maybe you'll wake up truck could drive
out here if everybody is as I could
squish to the middle again just to leave
the this easy-access seats for people to
go and sit down and then if you need the
caffeine it's a it's still in the back
there so coffee juice soda you can also
just run laps back there if you need to
with that I'm gonna go ahead and kick
off the the next talk we're gonna do a
couple things in the afternoon here so
we have two full length stalks here
actually we have three full length
stalks and we're gonna have a series of
lightning talks and the lightning talks
are really going to be like lightning
they're gonna be very fast and there's
gonna be five in a row so with that I'm
gonna go ahead and kick off the next
talk here it is going to be eager
they're off ski and Kaustubh wand a are
going to go and talk to us from Expedia
about mobile automation and the
continuous delivery pipeline and so with
that well come on guys thank you just to
introduce ourselves I'm Igor and he's
costume oh sorry I got that messed up I
was just checking if you guys are awake
or already asleep after lunch okay good
so let's jump right into it before we
get started I joined Xperia 2004 and how
many of you have been in a situation
where the number of automated test is
zero how many of you have heard your
business or the product team say you
engineering team you just cannot ship
fast enough you just cannot go quickly
enough how many oh not bad Chris okay
all right so what I'm here to talk about
is I heard the same things for many many
years and
I'm gonna talk we're gonna talk about
some of the things we've done in the
last couple of years to try and address
both of those situations so if you're in
that situation stay awake
it will help so let's get right into it
so he has a graph of what Expedia has
done over the last few years so the the
blue bar is the number of hot fixes
these to ship 2005 and the green bar is
the number of releases we used to ship
and the number of the red is the number
of what we call business a B tests where
business can try different functionality
on the site and let the customers decide
what's right for them right so in the
move in the web world
that's where everything is going you
ship fast you try different things
you let the customers decide don't
assume you know what they want or what
they like and the last is my favorite
the purple one the experience talk
presses up twice I wish the stock prices
of 20 times versus the releases were up
only two times but unfortunately that's
gonna have to wait for a while so this
is the best way to hide out what
continuous delivery can do for you right
it can help you ship faster more
releases and then ultimately make you
rich so what does the agenda look like
I'm going to talk about test automation
some basics because we have a wide
variety of audience here and online and
so I want to make sure we talk up the
basics we'll show you what the
continuous delivery pipeline of s looks
like for Xperia
specifically for our team we work on the
Xperia front end site so everything you
see on the Xperia or calm or one of the
Xperia sites its are items that shipping
that including mobile we do mobile web
mobile apps and so we'll talk about a
little bit about the test mythology and
some of the unique things we have done
in the last few years as well as and
then Eagers gonna talk about the
specific tools we use everything is
almost everything uses is open source so
it's very cheap free and then we will
talk about the key benefits that VF
garden as a test organization right so
specifics on what benefits I have
personally seen and measured
alright so there's a lot of talking in
the industry about agile
continuous integration continuous
delivery most recently figures are
falling there's a lot of talk of DevOps
there's a whole DevOps movement going on
so this is the best light I found out to
explain what what continuous delivery
really means so you start in 2006
Expedia was agile but we didn't really
have a continuous integration system in
place well then we fixed that 2006 to
2009 we had continuous integration in
place didn't only have continuous
delivery in place so it's been a
progression the last few years we've
been focused on the continuous delivery
piece and my talk is going to be focused
on the Andy who's gonna cover up the
automation tools they using and the test
automation piece of continuous delivery
so it's basics most people know what a
test automation pyramid is what I'm here
to tell you is just one simple thing if
you're serious about continuous delivery
get your test automation pyramid right
it's super critical to getting to
continuous delivery which means lots and
lots dozens hundreds of thousands of
unit tests a small number of integration
tests and a very small number of UI or
you know how end-to-end test as we call
them it's super important I'll show you
a quick graph so just about the last
year the Green is obviously the number
of unit testing that we have added
orange is the medium or the integration
test and the red are the large tests for
a long long Tong experience pyramid was
inverted
we were lots of you automated tests some
integration tests and very few unit
tests man it was so difficult for a
tester to catch bugs only relying on
your outer mission it was crazy
so this has been a huge part of you know
helping us get to continued delivery is
get or test
pyramid correct measure it and drive it
insanely
so let's talk about the conclusively
pipeline itself so what does the
pipeline look like before a developer
checks in any piece of code there are a
series of pre-comic tests that they need
to run and re and the first talk
referred to this most of these are unit
tests they run in milliseconds and you
can run hundreds of
thousands of them very very quickly once
that once is checked in in a single
branch called trunk again the Google
Talk referred to this as well
single branch all developers are
checking in code in one place
we run a couple of tests sets of tests
for the mobile team we use Java Script
unit tests so there's an open source
tool tool called Jasmine we use that
there are plenty of other tools you guys
can pick what you want and then we run a
series of trunk smoke tests so what are
these smoke tests these are basic happy
part functionality that a typical
explained user would do so it's for a
flight booked a flight so it's for a
hotel booked a hotel so on and so forth
so we make sure the basic
functionalities working even before the
build gets promoted to our live servers
once it gets promoted to the assuming
the previous tests pass it gets promoted
to the to a next stage where we run a
much broader set of acceptance tests
these are a little bit more involved so
it's for the hotel change the dates
click on a few things make sure like all
the pry one try two scenarios are
working great those are green then
deployed to an environment that is very
special this test environment does not
have any live dependencies no live
services downstream no life connections
to third parties one of the most
interesting problems experience as to
solve is we have live connections to
hundreds of Airlines global distribution
systems which is where the airline fares
get filed and you have to talk to them
in real time because airline will
availability and prices can change
literally in seconds I'm sure lots of
people who have seen price changes all
the time right and so we are dependent
on third party data in real time and
imagine trying to automate that one of
the most harder one of the hardest
problems I think so what we do is we we
must put all those dependencies and say
we're gonna focus on the UI only we are
going to stub out or mock out all the
dependencies so that whatever we're
testing only covers the UI and we can
find things fast the things that our
devs might have broken so we run those
on the iPhone Android
and then we use Chrome as basically a
base device it covers all the other
devices that are out there that are
slightly older but they are still in use
in usually asia-pacific countries and
some of the European countries and
things like that so we try to cover as
many of her as a customer base as
possible keep in mind know of none of
the test run unless the previous thing
has passed and is green all right so
some rules are on the pipeline right um
it has to be green at all times okay
there are hundreds of check-ins coming
in not to the scale of Google but at
least we have 400 developers we checking
in every single day the changes conflict
with each other things break so it's
important that there's a certain amount
of discipline keeping the pipeline green
at all times otherwise you cannot get to
continuous delivery if a build breaks
which can happen it auto locks the
branch so no more check-ins can get in
let's not pollute the codebase so that
we can figure out which CL had has
broken the branch and then what we do is
we say okay if the build is broken we
have to fix forward in ten minutes or
less or else the CL is going to get
reverted there is like it's very very
like low tolerance for people keeping
the build broken right and the reason we
kept that in 10 minutes is we float like
flirted with the idea of five minutes 15
minutes and all that good stuff and what
we realized is the simplest reason for
the build break is when devs miss
checking in a file accidentally and it
takes no more than five to ten minutes
to get the file back in and and call it
green there's a big coach role where we
REO take responsibility amongst
different T different team members
developers testers we actually have even
have PMS do this so that they understand
why it's important where if a build is
broken their job is to get it green in
the ten minute time frame and what we
have found is initially it used to take
us
six hours to you know actually get bills
where they need to be but now we are
down to 10 minute 15 minute interval so
we have seen some good success there all
right so let's talk about the overall
methodology that we use in in testing
and then Iger is gonna talk about the
specific tools we use to cover each of
these so experience very agile company
like we and customer is the most
important thing to us I think there is
no test that you could write better than
simulating exactly what the user is
doing right and these BDD tools and egos
won't talk about very specific to let me
use like to simulate exactly the user
actions and the the best part about it
is you can have PM's product managers
business even write them because it's
written in English you don't need any
technical degrees you don't need to be a
superstar a CTE to write the koo kumba
scenarios you are test engineers your
PM's can write them as well when it
comes to so we used to be really mostly
for UI and integration level testing
because that's more users of scenarios
at the code level we really strongly
encourage our developers to take a TDD
approach write the tests first then
write your code and your code is not
good until the test passes we have had
mixed success with this so we're still
working on getting it better
all right you have the all these great
tests in place now fantastic what's next
let's take them put them in Jenkins
which is the build system that we use
when you increase include them in
Jenkins you we have to make two key
decisions what is the speed of the tests
that are running and how often do you
want to run them if they are really
really fast you can run them very often
an aspect of every single build so you
get lots of regression coverage if they
are really really slow like the large
test or the you are at the end-to-end
test well guess what you're going to
have to figure out whether you want to
run them few times a day or like once a
week or whatever
I again going back to our restock this
morning he talked about the chord the
chord repetition of the problem this is
why we choose to run a large test only
20 times a day
every two hours so they do not run as
part of every single build just to go
back what that means is what you see
here are all the regression test cases
that run except the large test that can
take hours to run some of our tests take
3-4 hours to run you can't put them in
the build you got to run them at a
certain frequency so we run them every
two hours all right so you have these
tests they are in Jenkins but again what
do you do with live dependencies that's
where you use mocking stubbing remove
them so that you can focus on testing
your code the stuff that you are devs
changed once you have this you need to
have visibility people need to know
what's going on with the with your
builds with your tests so we use some
Jenkins plugins these are called build
and test radiators we're going to show
you some examples and we also have a
video of how the process works in the
air time a little bit later I have been
in this situation way too many times you
have tests they run they fail and people
ignore them they just don't care or they
just go whatever I mean it's the testers
job to go take a look at them or the
automation engineers job so it's again
again discipline in terms of how quickly
react to the failure and how quickly can
you fix it again the video will
highlight how we have done it and
hopefully that will be helpful for some
of you cuts so over to Igor he's going
to talk about the specific frameworks we
are using for mobile and how it's
integrated into the whole Jenkins system
Thank You custume enjoy the speech a lot
I hope you continue until the end but
anyway my name is Igor I'm TAS lead
engineer at Expedia for the past year so
wasn't mobile department like second key
when I started and I had to basically
solved what kind of tools we have to use
and how we can map them into the test
pyramid to fulfill all the problems and
solve all the problems we had at that
time so
they try to go fast as fast as you can
because we are limited on time there are
other talks and this conference about
the specifics of some of these tools but
what I tried to focus on how it fits
into the continuous delivery process so
I'll start with a jasmine so jasmine is
a giant task framework we used that to
basically fill it in a top of the
pyramid which is the functional BDD kind
of even though it says unit tests I
still think it's a BDD approach for
testing the JavaScript so in order to
run the JavaScript test in Jenkins we
used the Jasmine gem which is the Ruby
library with the CI reporter to generate
Jamiat xml reports that helps us to draw
graphs in the jenkins to see how we
progress over the time and the good
thing about jasmine complements other UI
functional tests which is our selenium
tests and in order to write the selenium
test we using Ruby as the main language
and cucumber on top of it to write out
tests and English because tube was
mentioning it's important that the test
has to be written in the language that
everybody understands including project
managers developers and also QA
obviously right even product our team is
looking at the test to see what kind of
coverage do we have later I'll show you
example of a cucumber scenarios who have
a bad idea for those who never seen that
before we also use the cucumber with
Ruby
to write our integration level test
which is the API test for mobile
Department specifically and we use just
regular HTTP library with a JSON parser
and it works very well for us again it's
all written in cucumber in English so
but it fits in the middle layer of the
pyramid that's our kind of integration
test and for the low level pyramid we
use tests and G before we had the J unit
but the problem
Jade was it was kind of hard to paralyze
a little test and Destin she solved that
problem for us so we as Dustin G as our
primarily unit test framework to test
our platform which is a back-end kind of
platform for the whole Expedia and
astute mentioned earlier that it's
important that the test executes fast
right so we're not we're not going to be
dependent on the live environments and
that's when easy mark we use as a
marking solution for our unit test and
for the UI test and as well as the
integration test we use our custom
stubbing solution so that helps to speed
our test execution in the continuous
integration environment okay so the
previous slide was actually mostly
focusing on the mobile web and mobile
web tools that we use here you can see
we also do the mobile apps as a part of
our team that we have to test both on
iOS clients and Android clients so
specifically for for the IES we use the
Frank it was the first framework that
would trial started looking at last year
and that was supporting cucumber like I
mentioned earlier for us the BDD tool
cucumber was the main focus plus we can
use the Ruby that means we can reuse a
lot of our test methodology that we
established before even for native
clients and that's why Frank fell to
that category at that time and will
start using that the only part that the
kid not test was Frank is a hybrid apps
it doesn't support the web views in your
native applications so for the Android
we're using robotium currently but we
look in the calabash because calabash is
very similar to Frank they're pretty
much identical the calabash is basically
that's what we're looking for to
transfer our test in the future migrate
all of them from robotium to calabash
and we're start doing that
I already converting end-to-end test
functional tests for Android and because
would also have a pipeline for the
native apps as well just like for the
mobile web we tried to solve our
stubbing solution with a tool called VCR
and it's not a joke is like regular VCR
it records live responses into the
cassettes which you can replay later
and this is our stabbing solution it's
open source you can find it easily
google it it's great tool for the
testing native apps if you need a
stabbing solution okay so if you already
probably know these guys that we are big
fans of open source tools and Expedia
because this is simply free and a lot of
people contributing to them and but
unfortunately all of them has an issues
so some of you using the selenium
webdriver either on iPhone iPhone or
desktop browser like Chrome Firefox and
maybe an Android but because we're
mobile obviously we're dealing with the
mobile clients so specifically for the
Android selenium webdriver we found
interesting issue we never try to test
HTTP pages and there is invalid
certificate on your live test
environment your drive will basically
get stuck you're gonna get blank page
and that's it it's a failure so we this
the workaround was basically generate
the certificate on the regular Chrome
browser and then imported it to the real
device and it worked very well
another problem with the Android
selenium webdriver we encountered was
the drop-down boxes or drop-down options
the : right so we couldn't solve the
problem because the selenium driver
couldn't help couldn't handle that so we
use the jQuery as the hacky solution and
it works up-to-date so we use a sim
launcher it's
Rubi a lightweight server to start our
IES simulator before we start executing
selenium tests and the problem was that
that particular framework didn't have
the flexibility to rotate the simulator
while you do a test execution so one of
our engineers in London actually
contribute he wrote Apple script to add
that functionality so whenever we run
your whenever we run our selenium test
we can rotate simulator and see how a
responsive design will render our mobile
web application in in the webview so
basically those problems are related
obviously to the selenium webdriver both
on the s and Android now on the Frank
which we used to test our native app on
iOS client we just couldn't figure out
how we're gonna collect the logs if the
application crashes right so what we use
the third party of framework crashlytics
which is not free but it's great it
gives you a lot of and so probably only
framework is not free we're using but it
gives you great information and logs
it's free now there we go awesome
crashlytics enables us to get the logs
and crash logs as far as networking data
to analyze if the application crashes
and we also use the police body put here
is basically on when we are doing
besides debugging we try to collect
analytic data we you steal this body to
change the configuration application in
the runtime it helps also to do more
like I would say analytic logging and
testing in that matter and finally I've
been mentioning cucumber many times for
those who haven't seen that before this
is this scenario written and guram
language in the cucumber format which is
if you guys look at the screen it's very
English oriented readable it supports
multiple languages English is not the
only language the power of this is that
you
you write your test in the business
logic as your acceptance criteria and
then all the parameterization all the
parameters you don't have to hard code
into your code like we used to do with
the unit test frameworks everything is
here this is the text file right and if
you can look at this specific scenario
where we try to test the hotel search
against multiple countries in the
Seattle area and make sure the image is
there if you want to just expand the
number of countries you want to test
I mean localization if you want to
change the Seattle to New York you can
it can be done here it gives us the
flexibility and scalability meaning that
we are flexible in terms of adding a
changing test on the flight without
looking at the code it can be done by
non-technical people like project
managers QA s developers at any time the
cost three amigos right and another
thing it's a live document it replaces
the old test cases and all test Suites
so we do not an Expedia mobile we do not
have any test cases we would not have
test Suites cucumber the cold and
feature files are replacing those if you
guys start the video so right now this
is the live demo of how we execute our
mobile web tests in parallel it's
important to have running tests in
parallel for the speed of the pipeline
right you want to get coverage as fast
as you can and this is UI tests which
are slow they are the largest test the
go end-to-end and you want to execute
them as many clients as possible here on
the demo you can see this both the IES
similar I phone simulator and Android
simulator running the exactly the same
test but what you don't see on this demo
that it would do in real lab running
against real devices on mobile web so
this is a great example that
pluralization
saves the tons of time which you will
need if you want to implement the
continuous integration into your
into your department into the company
this is the sweetest part of optimation
when you see this working
I think it's 2-minute video once which
is basically keep the balls test they
are not starting all the time at the
same time the Jenkins control that so
for the purpose of the demo we recorded
both back-to-back simulators started at
the same time but they could be like
delayed but it depends on the check-in
they are triggered automatically ok so
ok web built radiator is a Jenkins
plug-in that we're using at Expedia to
monitor the house of the pipeline and
the real time this is the tool that
helps us basically to spot the failure
right away and to jump on it and make
sure the developers fix it as soon as
possible because to mention 10 minutes
period it's pretty fast
that's why visual representation is very
important I'm sure that probably most of
you been in situation where you are
running your tests and there's a failure
and nobody look at that for a day at
least right
so this radiators are running on a
big-screen TVs around the office and
you'll see the video in a few minutes
we're gonna see that how it helps to
visualize the house of your pipeline
it's really important and the red color
is basically a representation of failure
which you know track attention right
away if there is one so this is the we
called web test radiator this is not
plugin
it's just confluence page where we are
basically representing the graphs from
different Jenkins job to see overall
picture of a product so this is the
mobile website that we're using right
now currently for the mobile hotels and
you can see on the left side the graph
is much greener than the right side is
because it runs against top data and
mock data on the right side the test
running against the live services which
is test environments these live services
which undergo a lot of changes during
the day and that's why it's much more
redder so when you are building a
pipeline it's important to have both and
see what's going on with live services
and stop data
okay let's play the second video it's a
self exploratory
you
it helps us to launch raid so yes this
is exactly what we do
responsive to the failures during the
execution you see what happened
developer check-ins tailcoat broke the
test key a look at it and it's not
necessarily QA sometimes the project
manager is even the director of the
whole team comes so you were whited
radiators rat so it's very important
it's actually the whole team participate
in the process and if they spot the
failure they react to this fix it and
it's green again and before I give my
term back to Chris tube I just want to
make two key nodes what I learned for
the past year what's important in order
to be successful in terms of embedded
test automation and continuous delivery
is you always have to plan ahead always
plan your testing is this BDD task
functional test or integration test at
least a week or two weeks before you
start a sprint especially with the agile
company it's very important besides that
it's very important to understand what
kind of tests you will put into the
pipeline not all the tests go there be
very selective
it cannot be large for those tests that
you think are the one that is good
candidate for the automation for the
pipeline always make sure you consult
with developers ask a second opinion
talk to the project manager if it's good
for the product and for those tests that
would be like for molecular integration
environment or any other life
environments that will take longer time
like large test for two hours three
hours execution put them there make sure
you segregate right it's very important
and now cuz tube will wrapping up yep so
just a quick recap of some of the
benefits we have seen from doing this
just this is just last couple of years
we have increased our Java releases
content releases can go out every day
right but Java releases the hard core
changes that can break a lot of things
we have increased that almost four times
the typical regression like I said you
check in a bug often times it takes a
day to find the bug a day to find like
and verified well with this new system
you just saw in a matter of minutes
there was the the code got checked in
something broke we noticed it we fixed
it moved on right so worst case scenario
when you have massive breaks maybe four
hours to fix the whole thing end to end
but a lot of the time it's its min
minutes that we can get issues fixed we
run hundreds and hundreds of stubbed
regression runs every day that find all
kinds of issues and then you combine the
number of regression you run with how
quickly you get they get fixed it really
enables you to do continuous delivery
just from my team standpoint at the
testing time we have saved by doing this
is in the order of minor for 40% so
something that used to take us five six
seven days to test and shift you're
doing it like two days or less and
that's helping us move faster get more
agile and obviously the obvious one is
the woman you have automation you can
run it on multiple devices in parallel
so we have four times in the device
coverage we have today then what we had
a year ago and as the number of devices
in the industry are scaling you really
need a solution like that that you can
just keep scaling more and more devices
that's it guys questions
great thank you thank you yeah I learned
a lot all I need to do a mobile testing
of Expedia as a cucumber a radiator and
some velcro to stick my phones on a wall
so thank you okay in all seriousness if
you have questions please do line up at
the mics I'll take some questions off
the moderator here and let's see first
question up did you find automated tests
in a different language Ruby then you
were application this was hard to parse
it says did you find automated tests in
the language in a different language
Ruby then your application limits
developers collaboration on tests well I
take that so we made a very conscious
decision here last year when you were
picking selenium we knew we could run it
with either Ruby or Java and we said
we'll go with Ruby although all our devs
are really good at Java in fact it was
the developers who came and told us you
know Ruby's a scripting language works
much much better for automated tests as
compared to Java which can be a little
lot heavier so it wasn't collaboration
with DES when we said okay what is the
right tool to use and we agreed on using
Ruby has it limited the collaboration
absolutely not we have our devs writing
Ruby tests all the time I just got an
email yesterday saying a new dev that
joined checked in 75 new tests that are
now running in the pipeline so I think
the devs are actually really part of the
solution here is collaborate with them
and find what tool is right for you hey
thank you all right so we have two live
questions so I think you got here first
you can see a name your company if you
want in your question any pieces you'd
like hi I'm Chris McMahon with Wikipedia
that we can media foundation I'd like to
ask you about enthusiasm for creating
feature files in cucumber how do you
build enthusiasm do you have
enthusiastic contributors for your
scenarios and how big of a backlog of
scenarios and feature files do you keep
at any given time so I'll answer that
question when I started I was the only
enthusiast
but I have a full support from
developers and I think think about that
as a living organism right you have to
in fact everybody on the team like a
parasite and make sure that people all
get the disease of koo kumba right and
then what happened is a year later right
now everybody writing this let me give
you a good example project managers
write acceptance criteria in the sprint
in the cucumber format then developers
and QA picked this up massaged it out to
make it look clean and nice and put it
Ruby logic into a page object model and
all tests become live so it it I'm in my
opinion it's only successful tool that
when everybody's using it everybody
means everyone on the team if it's only
the QA s you will fail is the answer
question well the statement was let's
take this offline later absolutely just
so it's on the mic okay I will there's
one more okay there's live question sat
down I got guess they got their
questions answered we'll go to the
moderator here does testing mobile web
apps on real devices find more bugs and
testing on a desktop browser resized
with fake user agents actually it's a
good question sometimes we have to test
in real browsers and the good example is
a Facebook Connect so facebook login
feature for Expedia because of the
limitation of Android selenium webdriver
and is selenium webdriver we cannot we
couldn't launch the new window and to
test that functionality so we used the
Chrome with the iPhone user agent where
we actually did some resizing to test
the responsive design and also were able
to launch the new login page for the
Facebook so yes we actually we try to
use a lot of open source tools lately
just to solve problems around the driver
so wait for the APM talk I think just to
quickly add yes I think there's a
there's a place for both you want to use
Chrome with user agent strings but you
also want to use simulators and
also the early devices it's there's no
one-size-fits-all you'll have to do all
three because they find different types
of bugs agree great thanks
yeah so here's a question that's been
popping up further and further on the
interest list it says there's testing
mobile apps sorry actually somebody just
it just got itself to go down was the UI
demo run with mocked data is your
deployment to prod automatic or is it
gated with manual intervention so how
much automation do you have are you Mac
mocking out your data so that the reason
why we focused our talk on the test
automation piece is because we haven't
fully flushed out the continuous
deployment piece what I do know is that
you know we it is to take a seven days
to do a manual test run with with all
the different languages now it takes one
day so there is manual intervention but
it's like significantly lower and one of
the things that we did was we take
screenshots as the app runs and we push
them automatically to our localization
team who are the experts in the UI they
look at that and we get feedback in less
than 24 hours
so using automation to speed up the
local arif ocation process yeah okay I
think we have time for more questions
I'll take the live question right over
here
hi my name is Anthony I work for ITA
Software Bailleul thank you for being
such a great customer I see that in
cucumber you have product manager
writing the definition well the test
objective in freeform at the beginning
of the chat and then you have a test
engineer come and Bright's use a test
itself over time with such a large body
of tests how do you manage the tests
drifting from the definition so we we
have a regression plan right and we keep
that up to date and whenever a new
feature changes part of the job of the
QA engineer is to go and update the
existing tests that are there and also
deprecated tests we routinely go in and
even deprecated tests are no longer like
valid so it's the good thing is you
don't have to go to a document and
update the test plan now you're actually
updating your live automation right so
which means that
it's going to get run if it sits there
you have a choice either it has to pass
or you have to remove it so that you
know it's no longer applicable to the
feature so it's part of the spring
development process to go and update
that and we use tagging for that it
helps a lot we create different profiles
yeah we have tags right very nice so
thank you costumes Thank You Igor and if
you guys want to suggest a topic table
tomorrow it sounds like cucumber is
gonna be a hot topic so sure thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
