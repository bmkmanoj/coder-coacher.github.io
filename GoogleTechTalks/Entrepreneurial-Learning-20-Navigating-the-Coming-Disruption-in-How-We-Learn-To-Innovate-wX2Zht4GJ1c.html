everybody I'm absolutely thrilled to be
here talk to you about creativity
innovation entrepreneurship and have to
admit a little bit intimidated to be
coming to a place like this to talk
about those things with people like you
so I'll thank you for the opportunity
and also for your forgiveness if I speak
about any things that just don't need
saying to you guys I'm very excited to
be here we have about an hour together I
understand you don't want to use the
whole thing with me talking out to you
some of that time as well for some
conversation the goal would be put a
couple of concepts on the table let them
around a little bit and then have some
time to have a conversation so that's
what I'd like to do today as you can see
i'm going to try and do that using the
concept or at least talking about the
concept of creating really big value and
what i mean by that is is the big stuff
not not innovations that happen when you
are you're taking apart your watch to
try and rebuild it and make a time
machine and just sort of kicking around
the lab or the kind of things that
happen when you are innovating a product
and trying to make that better for the
existing market i'm talking about the
really big game changing kind of stuff
the disruptive innovations that affect
the whole industry value chain or that
open up a whole new market that kind of
thing the original title for this or the
long title of this talk is just probably
saw from the abstract was entrepreneur
entrepreneurial learning to point o
navigating the coming disruption in in
how we learn to innovate something like
that and i have that i guess as a way to
segue into share with you a little bit
that about me that I never expected to
have the job that I have today I teach I
teach at an at mount royal university in
Calgary and I teach entrepreneurship
which I never expected or planned to do
it's a job where I spend my time helping
18 17 18 to 25 year olds do that create
really big value whether it's for
themselves or whether they're doing that
for the people that are going to employ
them let companies like you guys or if
we really want to talk big picture the
competitiveness of our nation's or
Canada or the US for example and that's
the big the big context for it but with
my background in which includes about 10
years in the geomatics space I'm an
engineer by training originally I've had
jobs ranging from inventor to doing
project management and product
management co-founding an innovation
department which I may not recommend to
you as a way to foster innovation but
was a really good learning experience
and as an a VP in a startup that was
insane spaces as the street view we used
to talk about one day Google's going to
start doing this and try and get there
before they did and of course you do but
but despite all of that it's the it's
the experience that I've had teaching
this stuff helping young people think
about these things and get to a stage
whether they're in graphic design or
interior design or business or in some
kind of technology or tech transfer
program to another place whatever they
might be doing that pro the process of
helping them think about and actually
start doing some of this stuff is what
gives me just enough confidence to come
here and talk to you today so I hope
you'll let me provide you a bit of a
perspective or lens to look through when
you look at what you guys I know you
guys do every day already so that's my
intention for the next next few minutes
we're going to do that up on the top
right and slide you can see what I'm
hoping to say to you a little bit on
innovation just to put a common ground
out there a bit of a foundation for us
to be able to move forward from what
this idea really big value means Mount
Royal tell you a little bit about where
I'm at and what we do and then this
concept as an example of venture design
studio so design thinking rather than
business planning to get to these really
big ideas and then I'll close with a few
parting ideas just to just just kick
start conversation
so that's what I'd like to do I'm going
to start with two big opinions and these
are somewhat founded if you go and do
some reading you will see that that
others are saying the same things but
I'm sharing them with you as opinions
because I'm not giving you any evidence
to back them up other than to put them
out there so the two main messages I
have when you see those words up there
those are all industries that have or
will be disrupted in a major way by the
internet or web 2 or whatever you want
to say my point is or what I propose is
that higher education it's the time will
come for higher education in the same
way and i'm not saying our institutions
will be gone i'm saying that those that
do well will will change their roles I'm
coming speaking to you as a faculty
member at one of these places I thought
I'd try and bring this perspective to
the talk you guys know better than
anybody how accessible information is
today the idea that compared to when I
went to school I can get with 82 grads
today can get access to all types of
information on the flip side of that you
have people coming out of school with
fifty 250 thousand dollars in debt so as
a bit of an imbalance there when you get
access to all that information but
you're paying that huge amount for it
and that to me speaks in the end to some
kind of disruption happening and that's
again just my opinion so what's missing
for young people graduating is the
credential and that's the reason that
they're going to through the programs
that we have it's that layer between
information and knowledge so turning all
that stuff the flow that we're teaching
them to depict the right stuff out of
into knowledge they can use to create
value and probably it although it's
starting to happen some form of business
model that's viable as an alternative to
the way people learn today but these
things I would propose our coming and
that so that's sort of my first my first
opinion that I'll throw out there or
theme the second is this one the
creativity innovation and
entrepreneurship are very very important
now we all hear that all the time from
President Obama's speeches in the u.s.
to you know the three big CEO sitting
down with our prime minister
to in Alberta where I'm from we hear
about that in terms of all the programs
that they have the Alberta action plan
the techno printer ship encouraging all
those things you guys know that in what
you do in the people you try to hire but
I'd like to just speak to this one in
terms of the way or from our students or
recent grads or the people you might
hire from their perspective those guys
are told if they're listening they're
told that the top ten jobs that are in
demand next year didn't even exist in
2004 and I'm stealing these facts from
somewhere but just trying to throw it
you some of the things that they hear
they're told that that they will have 14
jobs and that's just by the time they
turn 40 years old so you should get a
feel for the sum of stress have and some
of the skills that they will have to
have and the abilities to to change the
way they think so personal creativity
and entrepreneurship they're told we're
all told that for every Canadian born
today there are I think its nine is the
number in the us-born 37 in in China and
50 odd 54 something in India born so
they get this pressure to if you're
going to help us compete as a nation
that you need to be creative innovative
and entrepreneurial and and then in
Calgary like everywhere the the
businesses are mall but small and
medium-sized enterprises make up way way
over ninety percent of the businesses
and we're told in Calgary that twenty to
thirty percent of those folks are going
to be retiring in the next five years so
there's this huge weight on these
people's shoulders and you're looking to
them to bring into organizations like
this and the answer in my mind is
innovation creativity entrepreneurship
and where try where you'll see we're
bringing that mindset not just the tool
set but the mindset to grads in any
discipline in any program so that those
are my two initial thoughts for you that
sort of under run all of what we're
doing so we are a program of
entrepreneurship in four year
undergraduate focused institution and
that's the context for some of the
things i want to share with you so I
thought I'd start with this whole
concept of innovation because the term
gets abused and misused and a good place
to start is knowing what we're talking
about and seeing if we agree that we're
talking about the same thing so I often
start with a
brand new class people straight out of
high school asking them this question
why has there was this the ipod so
successful so I'd ask you that now just
throw some things out it's sexy okay
yeah okay now that's an answer I
wouldn't get from these guts but ok so
very very deep answer on the biz small
and absolutely yeah anybody else okay so
you're talking about the hit the
evolution of music devices and and how
they okay and then the others incumbents
were sitting on their laurels yes okay
yeah go ahead yeah
okay okay so soon yeah so simplicity and
interface is that fair to capture that
way okay yeah go ahead okay so okay so
Britt leadership anyone burning to get
in on this before i move yeah go ahead
aesthetics okay okay this want to come
back to I asked them and I'd ask you not
to answer this but give these some
thoughts just trying to give you a
flavor for some of the conversations we
have in the classroom I ask why sales of
these guys went up last season a year
ago despite the did the downturn and
we'll look at things like what does
innovation have to do with post-it notes
and some of you may know these stories
and that's okay I'm just trying to give
you a taste for the kind of
conversations that we have to kick start
these conversations how long have these
been around and that may surprise you if
you don't know just how long not this
one but the digital cameras been around
is an amazing story have you heard of
the following a nutshell ask you guys
this because I want to use a couple of
these examples have you heard of these
this this business so what's the deal
with swoopo
it's a lottery site hiding itself as an
auction site okay why what's the
difference between that and another
online auction site lose your subsidize
the winners yeah okay yeah so you guys
have thought about this okay so it's
it's can I tell you it is okay swoopo in
my understanding and its variants you
just go to swoop Oh calm you can watch
the action it's pretty interesting to
watch but it's an it's a bidding online
auction site but what they have is a
paper bid model so you pay to bid and
and like everybody's saying somebody
goes home with the prize but in the
meantime they can sell it for a fraction
of retail because they make so many so
much money on the competition and just
what since we're on air but once it gets
right down to the wire and you're close
to the ass price or the end time they
extend it by 10 seconds so it all starts
again and then they extend it by 10
seconds so it all starts again now I'm
no expert on this so if I'm speaking out
of turn forgive me but that's my
understanding so they have this pay for
bid model so we'll use that as a bit of
an example later to another one is this
I assume everybody in here will have
heard of Hulu I see lots of heads
nodding so it is rather than being
receiving TV shows the way I normally
receive them I receive them through a
web service that's the basic concept and
they've got they've starting to build a
very successful model so these are the
kind of things we kicked conversation
off with because everybody can relate to
them a little bit I want to share with
you just got two slides with real
content and this is one of them I want
to get a couple of concepts across like
I said a foundation that we're all in
the same page and that is actually we
spent I could spend an hour with a group
with many different groups throwing only
those three words at them and say come
up with a definition and an example of
each and it's amazing because every
group will take a different path but
almost always get to pretty much the
same thing with in some some some
facilitation it's very interesting so
I'm just going to get to the punch line
on these but share it with you to get
get us past get us so that we can build
on it the idea is these use these terms
are used and miss you
used in media in within corporations
within it with institutions like I work
all the time and I just want to put us
at least something out there for us to
talk about whether you agree with it or
not the idea is that discovery is the
domain it's stereotypically the
white-haired scientists the person who's
in the lab trying to come up with new
knowledge or new ideas and so you could
talk about that as developing new ideas
where it's different from invention its
invention is purposeful implementation
of those ideas and so the very simplest
example if somebody has somebody
discovers or has the idea of the concept
of electrons passing down a wire and so
that is new knowledge it's an idea
that's testable the inventor then would
say so Steve's in the back there I would
sieve and I would want to invent use
that knowledge to invent a prototype
telephone and we'd pass use it to
communicate with each other in the lab
so we can invent that and then the
difference between that and innovation
is that innovation is exploiting that so
somebody sees that maybe we do maybe
somebody else does sees that and says we
can exploit that and now of course I
mean you guys here are well into the
into that whole industry where it is
today where it's evolved to that that
value is being created and reaped
everywhere and and so that's the basic
difference between the three at one
level and i know this is small on there
but if you look at it later or can read
it where you are the idea you've got
discovery coming up with these new new
ideas you got innovation or invention
sorry coming up with other new
technologies or new business models and
then that's an interesting concept and
an equally valid in terms of creating
value and then you've got innovation
which is products services experiences
processes and so on that happen so then
then I get into the conversation at I'll
ask you quickly where does the
entrepreneur spend their time in this
cycle or in this path value chain
typically yeah innovation yeah and you
can argue invention as well but
typically and when I talk to a group of
young people trying to to do this we
frame them there so your job is to be in
the innovation box and and be really
good at that the exploitation of
inventions so then we say do you need
to invent in order to innovate I see
heads doing that's no you don't need to
you can be really good at finding the
right invention and and one of the
biggest things new aspiring
entrepreneurs do is try to invent their
own business model and that's one of the
worst things you can do it and you
should just rip it off from somebody and
others I mean I'm not first to say that
but that's that that's sort of a key
learning as well and then then you get
into things like the fact that discovery
we start at the bottom innovation is
almost always intentional effective s I
don't have to hadn't had someone
successfully argued that it can happen
by mistake but invention could be either
way and discovery is often accidental so
there's those kind of conversations and
i hope this just gives us a bit of a
footing for replacing some of the things
we're going to talk about in context
then you get into creativity I just I
guess I upset people sometimes but I
just think of it as the grease and the
wheels and for this this value creation
process and and then you have your
finder's in your makers and what's great
with this when you're talking to people
in other disciplines than then
engineering and technology is that
people can place themselves if your
scientists see themselves in the
discovery side you know the design folks
might see themselves the invention and
innovation and and the engineers will
find themselves quite happily in
innovation that the business folks will
find themselves created so it allows you
to place yourself as well so then we
give it our standard textbook definition
and we move on from there but the
important thing to take from this one
this idea is that innovation is a
process it's an intentional process that
you can undertake you can get better at
I just one through which you create
value in society or economy and you do
that by meeting an opportunity or
seeking some advantage so there's your
standard textbook definition and the
examples help to just me bring that to
life a little bit so then I asked
students why I have one of these and
it's it's a trick question and and
typically will work better as a trick
question for that audience the broad
young audience than it would for you
guys because the answer the question is
I have one of these because I'm a big
geek and I've always been a big geek and
I thought I'd actually prove that to
today because this is always fun so I
know I'm supposed to be on the mic babe
I can't do both so i'll just talk loud
but i thought i'd show you some evidence
of why i'm a big geek one pieces of
times it's also utilize you get to know
me a bit but also always fun to walk
down memory lane this is oh and for
those who are not here this is a picture
of this 1985 my dad came back from japan
and gave me this it's a credit card
sized radio built by sony just does FM
but i was this was my ipod and i was I
felt like I was the coolest kid on the
sea training Calgary back then and so
that was the start of it for me with
this guy and then next I don't know
usually see some heads nodding when you
pull this guy out but was this guy and
and very very cool you can oh I should
advance that too so if you're not here
you can see that making your own tapes
recording from radio writing building
your own covers all the kinds of fun
things we do now in a totally different
form but all went with this guy so then
the next one was probably this available
not this one this one was mine but but
later and so but I had these dating back
before this model as well but CDs and we
all create our own CDs downloaded the
music from all sorts of places illegally
of course and normalized the volume
remember doing all of that stuff cut the
CD you make the cover and all of those
the fun things so so making it you know
what makes tape for your girlfriend went
from that to making it make CD for your
girlfriend and than that so that was
next and then after that was this guy so
this is my first mp3 player so talking
appalling from the thoughts we had here
this is a very this was very very cool
for me little cartridge on which 10
songs fit which was amazing at the time
and I had three cartridges so I was
pretty pretty deluxe could take whatever
I wanted where I needed it but this was
my first stamp un same thing and you
take those those songs you had
downloaded or your collection and you
normalize the volume and you put them on
and all of us that was after that and
then order right was this guy we all
recognize this guy but the click wheel
classic ipod i forget how many gigs this
was but the promise of holding all your
songs in one place so they're also very
exciting then was this guy so really
holding all my songs anyway in one place
and much smaller run with it do all the
things you can with it this was sort of
next for me then this guy which was the
the first generation ipod touch and
really could hold all my songs and half
my photos and all of that stuff so that
was that was exciting and then finally
today i have like many of you do the
iphone which is ringing and and and and
we all love that so I forgotten a few
steps on the screen there but you can
see the progression and so just to share
a little bit with your vote my history
this my point was again I have an ipod
because i'm a geek and i would had one
anyway the question when asked he is why
do non geeks have one of these things
and be granted this i wasn't quite
truthful this was my wife's he was given
to her at work and she'll have to
forgive me later for using her as an
example today but she didn't even know
what it was she opened it up along with
her colleague who got one at the same
time and didn't know what it was and he
got really excited so she brought home
to me figuring i would get really
excited and I did I got really excited
and she wanted really nothing to do it
cuz she was still on pretty much the the
Walkman she was quite happy with her
tape Knicks and doing all that so my
question for you today would be what
made her go and I don't drive it she she
was in the with the Walkman she didn't
have any interest in this downloading
songs normalizing the fallout not no
interest at all in that but this about
three weeks after I had it or I had it
after she had it she was sold and has
been ever since what happened yeah go
ahead
you had to do what sure you no longer
had to be technical to use it agreed
although you didn't yeah okay I agree
absolutely you don't have to do all that
stuff I was doing you're right yes
you're right exactly ok fair enough you
won't have to be technical to use it
what else that and that was a selling
point no question there was something
bigger for the marketing she didn't care
I admit that's for some people but she
didn't care about that she didn't even
know what it was it's what it's an
accessory yeah okay yeah please yeah
right that's going in the right
direction for sure for her and I'm very
specific for you what you've said
applies to every different people but
yet it fit in her purse yeah that's true
although the other mp3 player did too so
what what really got her was when I was
sitting in front of itunes and she could
see she could listen to 30 seconds of
any music and she could see that whole
process and they told her well if you
like this you would like that too and
she really got sucked in on the iTunes
front so I want to make that point not
on through so in a minute thumb because
I want to talk to you about how how one
creates really big value those game
changers that we're talking about and
use this as a bit of an example and as
I've said it was the iTunes and also
talked to that minute so first want to
say in terms of bit of the innovation
things you might do changes you make
changes others make that you have to
deal with I'd ask you to imagine you're
in some value chain you're creating
value and somebody makes a change that
will result in innovation that could be
either technological or business model
like we've said already so those are the
inputs the outputs look something like
this and I'm stealing and modifying this
framework a bit from someone but it's
useful because it helps explain what we
just talked about you've got a change
that can have an impact for existing
users or new users or intended for
existing or new users and it can be an
existing offering or a new offer okay so
the the existing existing case is
sustaining innovations the evolutionary
case is that you either take something
you already do and you ecstatic to new
user
or you take a new offering push it out
to your existing users and then the last
boxes can be revolutionary in that new
offerings go to new users and that's
your intent or it can also be disruptive
and I'll talk about the difference
between those two so it's just a way of
thinking about but very important for if
you're sitting down to do something and
you want to innovate which box do you
want to be in and we'll talk about which
of those creates really big value and so
that's where I'm headed the difference
is imagine that you're cruising along
the bottom axis there is time and the
vertical axis is the performance of your
product the dotted line is what the
mainstream market expects from your
product and you're cruising along your
performance is above your exceeding just
fine as time goes on you keep working at
you cut new code you've developed new
versions whatever it is that you do and
and you are indeed sustaining
innovations to sustain what you do the
other is a new innovation comes in at
some point in time and at this point it
can be either evolutionary revolutionary
disrupted the point I wanted to make is
this really big ones like the case we
just saw with the music players was
disruptive and this is based on guy
named Christensen stuff that most a lot
of people have heard about innovators
dilemma and all that stuff but the idea
is that nobody expected it at first when
you were back here it could have gone
either way anyway in fact its
performance was less than everything
else when it first came out but over
time it knocks him out of the ballpark
and so you could look at the apple 2e as
an example of this mainframe computer
users are developers are people selling
building those didn't worry about the
apple tree because it was being marketed
to kids and if they had asked their
customers data said don't worry about it
it's just a toy I was on to those kids
actually remember my dad teaching me how
to program in basic on the apple 2e and
and and so has a personal emotional
attachment for me but of course it did
that it became it blew personal
computers we all know that story another
one is is if you look back at Kodak
Kodak is that top line back when the
digital camera wasn't yet interestingly
they are the ones who patented the
original digital cam
if you're interested I can show you
pictures of that later and and over time
of course this is what happened in that
industry as well so those are the big
game changers that difference between
disruptive and revolutionary so then
again we visit why this was so
successful and I would propose to you
where did I leave it best way to do this
is to show you should just hold up both
of these I would propose to you that
going from this guy to this guy was not
all that biggity it's better to use it
gets more songs and all that but it's
probably sustaining it may be
evolutionary and that new users got
involved and excited about it but it's
probably just sustaining despite all
that and this is just a proposal take it
or leave it I don't mind I'm just
putting that out there that this would
have just been sustaining if it hadn't
been for this guy for I chains itunes is
what really hit helped them hit out of
the ballpark and made these ones frankly
I don't want to get sued made other mp3
players forgettable and made this so
successful okay and when you look at
that it came out with a new offering
completely so it's in the top side of
this thing it was a web-based service
for distribution of music that wasn't
there before and it certainly attracted
new users as well so that made it
disruptive is also disrupted because of
that curve there's no question we all
know the story about how that happened
so this is just an example of telling
what we already know into this really
big value framework that's what I'm
trying to do I thought it was fitting
perhaps to talk to you about Google Docs
or at least the way I see it and you'll
forgive me if I'm wrong but I have
students to say to me when I get them to
use google apps why are you making me
learn this thing I've got really good at
Microsoft Word over the last four years
and you're killing me here because it
doesn't perform as well as all this on
all that and and the answer it
especially if they're in this class this
sort of topic we're talking about this
kind of thing is yeah sure its
performances is perhaps lower in certain
aspects it can't do everything that work
can do but you just wait over time it's
one of these guys no question about and
I I mean I only read your press release
I don't know what's going on internally
but I remember a product manager
recently coming out and saying a year
from now you better watch out and so no
question that it's an example I would
say of this
thing going on and it's one of many
examples so let's talk about swoopo
again where would you put it on here
there's lots of giggles is there
something about swoop oh I don't know I
Colonel box okay okay we're ignoring the
ethical side of things we're just
talking about about the the innovative
side of things so and don't tell anyone
I said to ignore the ethical side which
is having a conversation would it be
disruptive to ebay and that kind of
thing yeah it's another kind of auction
okay anybody really want to make a case
for anything else revolutionary okay we
got them all I'll give you my opinion is
that ok it's a new entrant but it is a
it's an auction type site it it aims to
so it's an existing offering i would say
a different different better or
different group offering a new venture
but it's either going to be sustaining
or evolutionary depending how many new
users it can detract so just to make the
point that this business model
innovation very very successful how to
imagine from a money standpoint i don't
know their numbers but may fall in the
bottom left or in the bottom right did
you have a question
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah right yeah
right no and so the argument you're
making I think if I can summarize is is
it depends how you look at it and what
lens you look at it through so I was
trying to look at it as as an auction
site and make that argument but yeah
sorry go ahead okay let's enjoy some
right to exist yeah so from a business
perspective it's very different right
here you know that makes sense to me too
yeah so we can Rican dice this either
way but but the point was to try and
place these things and no I appreciate
and agree with you on those things so
how about this guy hulu so evolutionary
okay which box new offerings existing
offerings okay okay
so we go ahead yeah I can't hear you
sorry right okay so you don't think
they're innovative at all they're not on
here okay okay yeah okay well I'm going
to go on a limb may be alone here and I
would argue at least in the way I think
of it that that it's a new offering and
that it's a web service rather than a
cable service and I'd also say that that
it's it's fairly disruptive in that
initially it didn't mean but you had
people saying yet I can't get the shows
i watch or it's too slow for me but over
time I would argue it's going to be
disrupted now I'm not trying to push
that on you guys make make your own call
and I'm not not saying it's right or not
but I would have placed it there
interestingly if you can go and look at
what just happening cannon at the end of
last month Rogers on-demand came out for
Rogers customers they can't get shows
that they want through Rogers on demand
so in contrast I would have said that
this guy is is to existing users because
you have to be a rogers customer of some
sort and that it's a new offering so
they're evolving it's an evolved
evolutionary innovation to try and get
into the game or at least protect
themselves when the game hits him over
the head so that that's my take on and
again all this just to put into context
and have a bit of a conversation so I'm
going to shift gears a little bit and
talk to you about mount royal university
and what I do know I my brother when I
first interviewed to go tomorrow I never
intended to teach there and never
expected to but he'd been a student
there and I asked him what should I how
should I give a teaching demo part of
the interview and all that and and he
said whatever you do tell me who you are
and what business you have being up
there so this is my attempt to share the
little bit about my background other
than what music devices I've owned and
swear I've spent my money there but I
just share with you that that I i
graduated in engineering at University
Calgary in the geomatics program and
that
top three school in the world in that
area and typically when I speak to an
audience like students or otherwise that
I'm trying to explain what I did for 10
years I'd say do you know Google Maps
and they say yes because before Google
Maps nobody knew what I did nobody
outside of the area could relate to and
they say yes so then I said you know the
satellite button they say yes and I say
okay perfect when you push that button
it's not satellite imagery for the most
part anywhere you care to see ya it's
actually taken from aircraft and and I
was involved for ten years in the
systems the hardware and software my
side was the software and algorithms for
the gps and inertial navigation systems
that allowed all those images that are
taken to be mosaic together seamlessly
in an in a geospatially consistent way
and that's what i did i did grad studies
in that and started a master's degree
that transferred into a PhD then finish
that and when came to toronto actually
and then joined a company that probably
supplied the hardware that did that
probably supply well over ninety percent
of that more of the of the airplanes
flying that stuff had that on it and
they also did some of the ground based
stuff and things like that i then went
back to calgary got less or got out of
the hard core algorithm development
coding and more into into managing
groups that did that managing rd set up
an innovation department which was a
very interesting learning experience and
then quit my corporate job to do an mba
and to do some consulting and i joined a
start-up as i mentioned you before that
was very similar to the the guys that
collect the street view data and we used
to sit around saying one of these days
to google we should go drive the
Googleplex before it happens all that
stuff of course it did happen so so
anyway that's a brief synopsis and then
i ended up teaching as i do today this
stuff which is very fun so there's a
picture just for fun about 10 years ago
me with a bunch of stuff strapped to me
running around with it have more hair
and i'll tell you this being able to see
yourself there's no better way to see
how much hair you're losing
gosh I thought I'd never show this at a
group like this so I thought I'd take
the opportunity and I'll show my grad
supervisor but that's when I said I
invented the technology I was a
co-inventor of something that measured
the gravity field of the earth and those
are the changes in the gravity field of
the earth and yes they change with
topography and with underground things
like oil and gas which is a big driver
of what we were doing and the scale you
see on the bottom is is 10 to the
negative 6 of what we're feeling right
now so it's small changes but it's real
and and that was the traditional system
for doing it we took the navigation
systems are devices that were on
airplanes anyway or a slightly better
version those and algorithmically sucked
out gravity and so that's what we did it
was a fascinating thing there's a
picture of a cartoon of all the things
we had going together where the airborne
stuff fit in and and that was a segue
for me because it's exactly the same
algorithms into the airborne mapping
stuff that I did for a good portion of
my time before going to do what I do now
and there's a couple of my favorite
spots that I got to go to one the
Canadian Rockies right in the mountain
tops collecting data and one up in
Greenland so so very fun stuff now when
i started at Mount Royal I have a
business card that says that I teach
entrepreneurship and I tell you when you
give that to somebody people will say
can you even teach on and they're not
shy can you even do that and at first
I'd say well I hope so because there's
only paying me to do it and I did and I
hadn't really thought about it and I
guess my point would be just a segue
into what Mount role is doing now and
this whole thing that that nobody
everybody will debate that with you
forever and I realized the f does just
flip the equation a little bit and start
talking about the fact that nobody will
debate that people get better and all
this stuff by doing it serial
entrepreneurs of the case in point and
so you get better by doing it so our
goal then is not to teach
entrepreneurship but to create an
environment where people can get better
by doing it and that's what we do so
share with you there's where we're
located that's the very fortunate where
we are it's a beautiful part of the
world and that's a picture of the
business school where this is how we
intend as you now we're all well enroute
to
a minor in entrepreneurship offered
across campus to all disciplines it's
championed in the business school but
it's truly across campus initiative and
this is what the pieces look like so
this minor in entrepreneurship you've
got two courses on the left side of this
chart here that are really an inch deep
and 30 feet wide on the process and they
make you very uncomfortable if you're
not comfortable with change and their
goal is is as much mindset as toolset so
you come out of that and I'll share with
you some of what happened in the
entrepreneurial experience course and at
that point those folks are average age
18 it's the first course they've taken
in this stuff the next is rather than as
delivering to you by phase of the new
venture life site or bi bi bi functional
area sorry so marketing first and then
finance and then leadership and those
kind of things we deliver by phase of
the new venture life cycle so you come
in with ideas and that's the opportunity
corsets there you come in you park your
ideas you beat them up and the goal is
by the end of the course we call it a
junior sweat where you stand up in front
of a panel much like a panel of VCS and
they give you a thumbs up or thumbs down
on your idea but you spend a whole
rather than in business planning courses
where you typically get two weeks to
come up with a business plan and the
other 12 weeks to defend it and wish you
hadn't come up with that idea here you
spend the whole the whole this is a
whole three months trying to come up
with go from initial idea to marketable
insight to opportunity and eventually to
a pitch and representation that you get
feedback on and they get a thumbs up or
thumbs down and those ideas go through
the program you're passionate you can
even take a thumbs down idea through the
program with you and and what'll happen
is a natural grouping of people around
these ideas so you know you and I are
working on something in your idea was
great mind kind of bomb so I think I'm
going to join your group and teams form
naturally and these ideas flow through
the program from modeling and start up
to as you can see start up to survival
and growth and beyond and and the team's
work on these are pulling on the
curriculum to make this happen and
faculty members or advisors we're not
the traditional here's a text book
here's a lecture on this stuff you'll
listen to me write a midterm and final
and come back it's it's all about
solving these problems and we're there
to help bring in people from industry
make that happen and all that stuff so
it's been very very fun very exciting
very different from what's done
typically I know some folks here in town
do similar things but but we've had a
lot of fun doing something very new
we've had a 14-year history with an
applied degree now we're doing this
minor across campus minor that's more
innovative scalable business focused so
we talked to our students about this
concept of t-shaped individuals and I
share it with you today because it's one
of the biggest things we try to get
across to them and and it's t-shaped
because you've got this T it's a concept
I've stolen I admit but it's very useful
in trying to get the idea of mindset
across students from a discipline like
for example computer science will come
in with a very strong skill set or
they're building a very strong skill set
and that's the bottom of the T what we
try and encourage is to think about the
top of the team which KSA is knowledge
skills and attitudes but this portfolio
of abilities creativity innovation
entrepreneurship knowing what those are
being able to persuasively picture idea
of being able to be look big picture and
understand what if i'm going to innovate
how do i get that really big value
created and all those complementary
skills so we talked to them about this
as a major objective of what they do
it's not enough to be this to be the
very core very good for example somebody
who can cut code like crazy but doesn't
see the big picture doesn't doesn't care
why i mean those people will be a
graduate no question but but it's not
enough for that business schools often
get criticized for this you got people
who it is or the whole range of that
whole portfolio of skills but no depth
in any one area so we're trying to get
everybody in the room to look like this
and grow to this and it's fascinating
that she and and and the arguments are
out there we don't have to make them
that people who do this are have more
fun in their career because they're able
to meet their objectives I figure out
what those objectives are meeting more
successful and employers look for these
types of people as well so the second
thing is the types of knowledge we
deliver and I'm picking on university
education bit today I don't mean to
except to say that make a point here
that the types of knowledge that
University
grads typically come out with and grads
are criticized for is you know all about
something you know what's going on but
you don't know well maybe a little bit
of how but you don't you don't know when
y where to apply it you've never done
that and you don't know you haven't
learned through experience II haven't
done York white green you haven't done
anything so our goal is to the top of
this ladder every single course every
single time and I just share that with
you sooner you get a feel for what we're
up to is that you learn what we're
talking about and there's tons of that
it's the academic side you learn how to
get things done within that context we
push you to be able to deal with those
situations and bring out those tools at
the right place and have the mindset to
do it and then of course the top is you
actually do that stuff during the
program as well so i'll share with you a
few things that we're up to outside of
the core curriculum you're welcome to
check this out it's our open textbook
site or it's even a little bit bigger
than that that's what you're looking at
is a snapshot of our community of
practice so trying to engage the
community entrepreneurial leaders in our
community and so on with our student
body and students from across campus the
top link there is is the community the
next one is our open textbook site all
of our curriculum is available openly
and being developed in a collaborative
way with with the teams that are doing
this and and and available to any of you
if you want to check it out we'd love
your thoughts on it this is a picture
that open textbooks I'd just a snapshot
to give you a flavor so you can come in
look at topics and activities courses
and programs and so on if your bill
developing a new course you just want a
piece where you want to put on a seminar
for groups like you guys you just pull
on some of the topics and activities and
make those available it's a very open
access semi-open semi open source kind
of situation for fun I'll tell you this
whole thing is developed with we decide
to try and do in a bootstrap mode spend
absolutely no money to do this and we've
done it with Google Apps education
Edition which has been absolutely
fabulous both from our side putting this
thing together and engaging the
community but also the students
collaborating on all their work in
Google
lights and so on it's been really
fabulous and with videos uploaded and
that kind of thing so here's an example
of a teaser for one of the courses that
I'll tell you about and a little bit
more on it some of the things that just
to give you a flavor for what it looks
like and you're welcome to go check it
all out here's here's what actual course
looks like and it's really no more than
an index to the topics and every topic
has an incredible all the details you
would need you could not you could
choose not to be in class and get all
the content you've missed the activities
that go with that most choose not to do
that which is great but it's all there
everything is there so last thing I'd
like to do before closing is share with
you this idea of a venture design studio
so rather than business planning as the
mechanism for coming up with this big
idea the idea is to use this venture
design studio and Design Thinking so
here's a picture of it and I should tell
you some of it was inspired by in
philosophical ways by Google's 10 to the
100 project and that came about because
I usually in my senior class have group
of just about to graduate entrepreneurs
working with a client who comes in some
entrepreneurial company that needs some
help with something and that person
cancelled on me with less than a week to
go and and cruiser cruising down in
Google News one night before falling
asleep I saw about Google 10 to 100 and
we we made something up on the fly that
eventually became this design studio and
so it in philosophy you'll see some of
those things there that we kind of kind
of look to it was very very helpful at
the time and our students all entered
that competition that kind of thing but
here's what it looks like for them they
have a course with a whole bunch
activities the design studio comes in
these four blocks so there are four what
we call iterations this is an approach
that generalizes from the classroom but
we push them through this kind of thing
right right at that level and remember
that they are this is the first course
it's the first time they've ever taken a
course in entrepreneurship and at what
it looks like is something like this you
come into the first class and we step
the stage which is really here's all the
tools go read them there's some examples
to get you started it's all available
online but that we've got now set the
stage you know what you're trying to do
and and the second class is here's a jam
session where we all get together the
facilitation the back-and-forth Hatton's
entrepreneurs might be there to help
that kind of thing and then the third
class you have to come in and pitch your
idea and that pitches to a panel of
people they've never met before
and they have their assess on whether
that idea is innovative and feasible it
has to be both at the same time and then
it happens they've got web content where
they develop not a business plan but a
business model and captured me and
elements that model and they do that
collaboratively the pitches is
videotaped using little flip video
cameras they do that during the class
they upload the pitch they can look at
it and hate to look at it as you can
imagine you would too the first time
through and then they do some reflection
on it as well that all happens again and
so the second time goes through they've
got two versions of everything third
time goes through they've got three
versions of everything and the fourth
time goes through they've got four
versions of everything and nothing
matters except that last iteration so
what you've got in the end is what you
get graded them because all the only
live ammo we've got we've got no money
on the line we've got no mortgage is on
the line we've got grains so the idea is
it all comes down to your last iteration
make-it-or-break-it use feedback how
you'd like to towards the middle of the
end or whatever you'd like to do and
what's very fascinating is how well this
works to come up with those really big
ideas so I'll share with you this this
is every one of those iterations they
get this feedback not for me but from
the judges and I I facilitate the
process and and sort of cap it for them
but they figure out where they are on
this feasibility and innovativeness ski
and of course you want to be in the top
right that's what you get rewarded for
what typically happens is what's shown
there some groups will come in with
something that very feasible but not
very innovative like a landscaping
company or a painting company something
like that that's easy to do it's been
done we know it works and that's that's
fine another person will come in on the
top left they're wanting to save
everybody in Africa who's starving but
has really no idea how to do it and so
you've got the highly innovative not so
feasible and of course we we give all we
do is say okay nice work here's the
direct honest feedback go to it see you
next next time we do this and that's
three classes later and so as a class
and these are this is fictional but it's
representative of what we see it so as a
group you get this kind of this kind of
spread the first time around ideas all
over the place but typically towards the
bottom right very feasible not so
innovative so we push them back on that
try and give them the help they need to
get there
you get students cool how do I do that
and it's very clear what the criteria
are for innovative and feasible the
judges all use the same picture so they
go to that sheet and say well I've got
to do this this and this well where how
do I do that and they run to the
material figure it out and then they go
to the entrepreneurs or help them and
come to us and this it's a cycle of I've
got to make it more innovative feasible
and over time second iteration might
look like this the third one there's
some of them migrating up to that top
right corner and you're starting to get
close to that really big value the
original business model is completely
gone and completely unrecognizable other
than the people who are pitching them
and it's fascinating to watch those
videos as you go and then at the end you
probably got some tight group that you'd
want to talk about that have made a
really good contribution and are getting
close to that kind of thing so that's
been very very fun very very successful
I don't I mean my days of the innovation
department and and that I would say my
understanding of how to encourage and
foster this kind of thing is it boosted
incredibly by this experience there's
nothing like having to teach let alone
foster or help a whole group of people
through this process to make you
understand how it works but this design
thinking approach every week coming back
or every iteration coming back it's
almost like when we iterated on code
development you push it out you test you
to push it out to test and get better
and better all the time with these
constraints so it's worked very well and
been very fun so a few parting ideas for
you first of all our roles and I'm
talking people in post-secondary
institutions including students I would
say our roles I know that may be a bit
tough to rebut the bottom left side of
this is your traditional I'm giving a
lecture you're listening to my lecture
here's the text books or some stock of
knowledge that you're getting you will
repeat it back and you will do well and
that's what is traditional given the
disruption that I'm saying will happen
in education given that we are
ironically trying to encourage
innovation in what we do it has to
change and I would say we're probably
right there now to where the faculty
member the teacher the person
facilitating is motivating and
facilitating rather than the authority
on the knowledge in fact there's a lot
of things I don't even know about when
we start but we bring the right people
in
can the learner has to go from being
totally dependent on the textbook and
the content than that process to being
interested in involved or engaged in the
process and where we really want to go
is this top right corner where we just
were like delegate errs we're
consultants to the pros and super
self-directed and involved and I would
say you know this talk I can't I can't
share too much about it with you but of
how applicable this is in a corporate
setting for this kind of process not
this on the screen but this potential
design design thinking for now I don't
know this you guys know way better than
I do but this concept of slack time or
twenty percent time adding some some
structure and feedback to that and I
don't mean structure in a bad way but a
way to get to see where you are on that
two by two of innovative feasible if you
really want to aim for that top top
right corner that kind of thing and the
last thing I would share with you is
this guy that this is this is taken from
somewhere I don't expect to be able to
read all this but the idea on the left
side is at the initial stage of idea
development you could have three
thousand ideas that come to mind there
are seven stages in this person's model
they've done research of patent patents
that are out there and they're their
evolution or the ideas but for every
3,000 drawn written idea there's only
one point seven launches so the annoyed
the enormous challenge that's involved
in that in trying to get just to there
and I would propose to you that those
1.7 launches it's a small fraction of
those are really big value or that even
survival and alone so so this is a
really big challenge in and I would say
that I share with you a quote that I
love even blind squirrels will
eventually find acorns but until they do
there's a lot of wasted energy so I'm
just trying to throw at you I'm very
much in the early stage of the ideation
or I idea development process and I'd
recognize there's a lot more to it but
at that stage we found by not just being
blind squirrel run around room you can
you can make these things happen we've
got groups of we had our venture design
studio finale last week where where we
had students group 12 teams pitching to
a pen a tough panel that I'm sure Steve
would have met some of the vamp venture
form and they were saying to us for 18
year olds
pitching these kind of concepts in the
way they pitch we don't even see that it
consistently at at the the BAM venture
form so they were they were ecstatic to
see it coming out of this so I'm just
thrilled to see where this might go as
we as our program evolves as these
concepts evolve and as they are taken
also outside of the school setting into
into industrial context it's very
exciting so in closing I'd say to you my
gut feel you can get a degree in your
field you can join a great company you
can access incredible amounts of
information like we could never to
access before you can work hard and put
in your 10,000 hours like we here we
should do you can build a great network
of people it can be full of you can be
full of good ideas and I suspect you can
even have twenty percent time to help
develop those ideas but you may if
you're lucky be one of the 1.7 launches
if you do all that right and not
necessarily one of the really big game
changers so you can still fail to really
create the big value and I'd propose you
need to understand creativity innovation
entrepreneurship and we've touched a bit
on that and had some fun with that today
you have to have the right mindset and
that's the person who can who you guys
can hire and they walk in and to tell me
what be looks like i'll figure out how
to get from A to B I don't need you to
walk me through it but get all the way
to be just by come see if they need you
to be t-shaped the people who can who
are excellent in one or more cord
bottoms of the tea but also have that
compliment on top to be in the right
environment like I said to we're trying
to create this environment you guys have
that environmental question and and also
to have the right process and to that
I'd say some of this design thinking
stuff is very exciting for that so I
thank you very much for your time and
appreciate and would welcome any
questions if you have any or if there's
an opportunity to do that so thanks
Steve yeah yeah you're asking he's
asking for whether there are any
examples of ventures that have spun out
of the program yes we've been around 14
years as an applied degree some exciting
examples I know you want tangible answer
to that I wanted to say to you too
though that what we're starting to see
with the venture design studio is these
of the 12 the pitched four or five that
were really good i guess it was pitched
in a public forum so it's I'm sure
debating whether i can share those ideas
because they weren't mine but they were
pitched in an open public forum I'll
speak vaguely about each of the ones
that come up so so visually impaired
student came up with a really
interesting application our solution to
visually the challenges visually
impaired people face when they start or
when they when they want to order food
in restaurants and I feel let me I'll
leave it at that but but that originated
as not such a hot idea and turned into a
very hot idea that was very exciting as
an example try anything I'm trying to be
careful not to another one is actually
and it's just been it was funny these
poor guys came up with this idea that
evolved over the the term and and four
or five days before they had to pitch it
to the judges they were looking on some
of the tech review sites and somebody
came out with exactly what they they
came in and they said okay we got to let
you know what happened Alex but what do
we do with this and and they had an idea
around iphone app remote universal
remote kind of thing that it was
actually quite a very very good idea and
it's actually you can you can google
those words you'll find a solution
probably actually not quite as
streamlined as theirs but some of those
so that's the second example you get the
guys who who have to be careful what I
say because I'm not supposed to talk
about in
a team that did very well took the whole
thing was a team that was not even
engaged in the process to later on and
came in and the last minute what what
felt like the last minute incredibly
late and came in with this idea and
pitched it like like Steve Jobs can
pinch and and and and blew everybody
away because one of the things that in
mentioned is that students are invited
to invest in their peers and for every
share they have in a Pierce venture they
get a certain chunk of percentage added
to their course so they're very invested
in who wins and these guys came out of
the blue and took the whole thing and
nobody had invested in them and they
ended up winning the whole competition
with their idea so this is very exciting
but then there are a lot of other
examples from over the years that you
know for everything from Dance Studios
to pimped up garages to to the the more
medium to high tech stuff too but we're
really seeing where we had a couple of
those ideas a year we're starting to see
many more ideas at or above those levels
very very quickly in first-year students
so it's very exciting please yeah have
we got the question is have we gotten
place to protection for IP I'm
intentionally somewhat ignorant of the
process but I don't mean I avoid it I I
know what I need to know and by that
should be careful on that one too I I
know I know the situation we're also
institution in transition the deal is as
I understand it I oh nothing I'm they're
doing my job of helping these people
through the process the student owns
everything they come up with because we
give them a tool set and they've used it
well my only hesitation really is these
are not my ideas to share with everybody
it's their decision whether to share
their idea and I don't want to step out
in front of them and do that so that's
where I'm hesitant the IP issue i think
is pretty clear for them is that what
you meant
right now yeah that's a challenge and so
what we say to students is if you have
an idea you are that worried about don't
use it here and invariably they do I
mean it's the same thing as the guy who
who refuses to talk to a VC without
signing an NDA and the VC says get out
of town i'm probably talking to five
guys like you already and so that's part
of learning too and we had a team that
was very keen to miss the finals because
they were afraid they'd been coached by
I mean another person I it was in my
class but the got a call from their IP
lawyer and and so we say well you've met
the course requirements it's up to you
whether you pitch or not and having that
learning at 18 is really something
having those thought processes at 18 is
really a good i'm thrilled to have it
and so I don't I guess I didn't mean to
be flippant on it I I know where it lies
in and we're in if I'm hesitant it's
because I don't want to go it's not my
job to share with you their ideas you
know especially they'd say what are you
doing taking our ideas to a bunch of
skilled people like that and I'd be the
jump so yeah that's a good question
there's two answers that because there's
the open textbooks initiative I showed
you which is a tool to get things done
in completely bootstrap mode and and in
part train ourselves on the the open
philosophy I mean even even using a
website to wiki staff thing to develop
content rather than word is new for some
pho so so it's very much a make-do get
it done prove the concept out and so for
that it's highly feasible and somewhat
innovative now there's another answer
that which I'll be coy in answering
button but we there are ambitions to
truly enter the open textbook space you
know for-profit or nonprofit button do
do that right if you let me which I
think would be very both high feasible
high innovative
and it's you know it's there's no magic
to its along the lines of you know a
division or license of content
separately like iTunes dance with music
I mean it's those kind of ideas and then
you have arguments about would you focus
on these top rated e innovation
entrepreneurship or do you you know or
do you make it Road do you really just
go go whole hog and try and win the game
and it's interesting and so we're not in
that I mean we're just not where we
don't have I don't have a develop IM
there's no development I am maintenance
and so we're just making it go and then
it's working but that's not that
wouldn't be the solution that would get
to the top right corner is that what you
mean yeah I value profit and I'd like to
change the world well in the course I'll
an see that we have a lot of students
who say I want to have a non-profit and
we talked to them to that we say that it
was what we call it venture not business
design right and and so we say say how
do we deal with that and the answer we
say is treat them the same except that
when you get profits in the nonprofit
case you reinvest those towards your
mission and we mean the guys in the
nonprofit area would probably frown at
me simplifying it that much but that's
the way we handle it especially nearly
courses is create as much value as you
want but frankly if you're doing that
right it should be profitable and maybe
those those resources monetary resources
don't come through sales of gizmos but
but in any event you've got a revenue
stream of some kind it could be donation
could be you're a foundation whatever it
is you've still got some profits to
reinvest hopefully if you're doing
things well so we try and speak with the
same toolset mindset to all of those
things is that what you mean yeah yeah
and it's a tough thing to do because you
develop criteria for that to buy to the
innovative infeasible matrix and you
have to double check whether they apply
realistically to a non-profit scenario
or or a political party or a George
church organization or you know an
academic program like ours that's trying
to be innovative and can you develop
those criteria that you can have
external stepien and assess on and and
still drive the learning and and the
process up to that top right corner
it's surprising how innovative fees
write your ideas right see and creative
a kind of creative finance is something
that we've gone through it's just
amazing in your condo that treadmill of
just perched on the edge of of growth
part that that one of a lot of slices
you yeah it really makes you here on the
focus on yeah so you say to you what's
on the line will yeah no question if you
can survive yeah so do I sense for those
who may not be able to hear you say when
there's when your mortgage is on the
line there's nothing like that to
sharpen your your energies to get to
that top right corner and you know just
to say it in a small scale that where we
try and make the process authentic is is
that your grades are on the line your
your junior sweat is on the line your
you if you succeed in that corner you
get extra little extra letter grades in
and so we try and we don't have live
ammo like you're talking about but it's
amazing how when the last few iterations
come around things get into shape and
the focus is there and it's very similar
very analogous to what we're trying to
teach and have them learn
notice ever had you know that's that big
to you right that's right again no I
agree so and then and then in terms of a
you know I think back to when we had the
innovation department and I mean you
could do something similar to this where
you guys have like founders awards and
where you just put a really big carrot
at the end and then maybe that would
motivate and seeing what you're talking
about I'm not sure how long Steve you
want to go I'll leave it just check with
you you can if you want to do that if it
was a it worthy of being thrown out then
I I'll leave said that no thank you and
thanks for having thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
