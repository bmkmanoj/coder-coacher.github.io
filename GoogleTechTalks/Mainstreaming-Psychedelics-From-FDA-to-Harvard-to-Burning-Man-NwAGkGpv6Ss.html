famously say that one of the most
important things he did in his life was
taking LSD now if a person like Steve
whose life is probably not poor in peak
experiences makes such a statement you
wonder actually we know of various
people of his caliber like Nobel Prize
winners religious leaders artists
accomplished scientists who would phrase
their experience with psychedelics in
very similar terms and the reason seems
to be that somehow the psychedelic
experience is not just a hallucination
but seems to convey some well-formed
information about aspects of reality
that on our default consciousness we are
typically not aware of
now unfortunately is a prevailing
paradigm in our society to do with such
experiences is to uniformly label them
as drugs so whether it's a glass of
whiskey cocaine or psilocybin mushrooms
it's all getting this uniform label and
it's somewhat pity is that we have so
this undifferentiated state of the
ignorance and it hasn't been all the
time like this in more a shark societies
the person who knew about psychedelic
properties of plants or other substances
was a revered person a little bit
similar like a good doctor or
knowledgeable professors in our society
but for us it's still a bit of a taboo
and that's actually where Rick comes in
and his organization and maps who has
actually spent a lifetime to provide
legal context for the beneficial use of
psychedelics and Rick is an accomplished
person in this area he got his PhD from
the Kennedy School of Government in
Harvard on a thesis on regulating
medical use of psychedelics he also did
some very interesting follow-up studies
on famous experiments studying
psychedelics such as the Tim Leora's
Concord prison experiment and the Good
Friday experiment and today we will hear
about his latest work so I'm very
pleased to welcome Rick to Google thank
you it's a pleasure to be here today I'd
like to thank hooli and hardmode for
making this talk possible it's really
kind of great to be here at MIT Google
there was a period of time when Google
even censored our purchase of keywords
to advertise some of our studies and
that has since ended so now we're able
to get communicate through Google and we
really appreciate that shift so what I'm
going to be talking to you about today
is how we move from a situation where
the drug war is starting to erode but
it's still extremely powerful and it
makes it very difficult for us to do
research with psychedelics to do
research with medical marijuana and
there's a general sense that in terms of
evolution that us as individuals and
humankind in general has intellectually
gone incredibly far and that's typify
here by the work that's being done at
Google and elsewhere but that our
spiritual and emotional development is
lagging way behind and psychedelics are
one tool among many to help with this
acceleration of our spiritual and
emotional development so we have a
situation now where we have the
technology that's so powerful but we can
and we can and we are destroying the
world killing species we have just an
incredible complexity of what we're
doing with the tools of our mind but we
don't really have the spiritual
emotional development to handle it and
so I think for that reason and others
that it's very important to bring us
into balance and that psychedelics are a
tool for that and that as we move
forward
we'll see that our culture which has
previously had this massive backlash
toward psychedelics that there's a way
in which our culture can grow to
incorporate these states of mind and
that it won't necessarily remain as
hidden and underground and in fact the
good news is that we're now moving
towards mainstreaming of psychedelics
now Maps is a 501 C 3 non-profit
organization I started it in 1986 when I
was still a college undergraduate and we
have three parts of our mission the
first part is to treat conditions for
which conventional medicines provide
limited relief such as post-traumatic
stress disorder pain drug dependence
anxiety and depression associated with
end-of-life issues by developing
psychedelics and marijuana into
prescription medicines our culture is
more open to science and medicine and
healing than it is to religious use to
use for creativity so we're focusing as
a strategic matter on the development of
medical uses our the second portion of
our mission is that we would like to
implement in psychedelic clinics and its
most likely social change always
proceeds in gradual stages and so it's
very likely that the initial opening of
the door to psychedelics will take place
in highly regulated clinic environments
and so we'd like to establish some of
these clinics as models for others to do
as well and then our public education
mission of which being here today is
part of to educate the public honestly
about the risks and benefits of
psychedelics now I'm going to give you a
bit of an overview I'm going to talk a
bit about the backlash that happened and
the Renaissance that we're currently
enjoying and look more closely at the
causes of the backlash and then how
we've tried maps and other groups as
well have tried to mainstream
psychedelics by working at at Harvard
because many people think of Timothy
Leary and Harvard as the place where
psychedelics went off the track went off
the rails in the 60s so to bring it back
there it was really important as part of
our strategy and then also at Burning
Man
in terms of envisioning a
post-prohibition world there's always
going to be challenges with psychedelics
they're not risk-free they're not
perfectly safe so that we've done some
work at Burning Man to try to help with
this integration mainstreaming process
but then the core of our work is at the
FDA so I'll speak a lot about our
studies are going at the FDA and then
I'll just mention that we're gonna have
the world's largest conference with
psychedelic researchers from all over
the world and quite a few years it's the
largest in the United States in 17 years
and it's going to be held in San Jose
April 15th to 18th that's the
anniversary of the weekend that Albert
Hofmann discovered LSD and the
psychological parts of it the last
conference 17 years ago maps also
organized and that was on the 50th
anniversary of the discovery of LSD in
1993 now this graph shows you the
publications in scientific journals
about the therapeutic use of
psychedelics it's a little bit hard to
see but the the peaks here are in the
the late 60s and then it it starts
really declining and this tail end here
where from like 72 on to 95 there are
some papers in the literature but none
of them are from new research they're
all about follow-up studies two old
research or their meta-analysis but
there has not been any new research into
the therapeutic use of psychedelics
until very recently so it's like the the
repression that that came down that
criminalized these substances in 1967-68
and the Controlled Substances Act in
1970 ended up wiping out the research as
well because the problem with a highly
repressive prohibitionist system is that
it depends on propaganda and fear to
justify the incredible infringement of
human rights to take people who are
using substances and throw them in jail
so in order to try to continue to
demonize drug users and drugs the system
that we have has tried to suppress the
research because the research is another
way to in a more unbiased manner to talk
about the risks the actual risks of
these drugs so that the struggle for the
research has also been a struggle for
honest drug education and we're we're
making progress in that to some extent
now we are at a unique situation in the
last 40 years we are now in the early
stages of a renaissance of psychedelic
research that's taking place all over
the world and this is a series of
studies that I'm that maps is sponsoring
for MDMA for post-traumatic stress
disorder and MDMA is more gentle than
LSD and psilocybin shorter acting and
psychiatrist and psychotherapist
themselves are less frightened of it
than LSD it's not so much that you feel
like you have to surrender to it that
you're going out of control so I think
that MDMA is the drug that is most
likely of all the psychedelics to be
made into a medicine first and
post-traumatic stress disorder I think
is the clinical indication because MDMA
really helps with the reduction of fear
and it helps people process difficult
emotions and right now we have such a
social concern over the returning
soldiers coming from Iraq and
Afghanistan there's a lot of concern
about post-traumatic stress disorder we
hear it all the time recently an Army
psychiatrist went crazy and murdered a
bunch of people and he was a part of his
job was to help treat people with PTSD
so that we have a unique opportunity
with MDMA for post-traumatic stress
disorder to move into the heart of the
culture we've started our first study
was in Spain started in 2000 and was
shut down unfortunately in 2002 there
was some positive media about it and the
anti-drug Authority in Madrid was strong
enough at the time to shut the study
down and we only got up to 75 milligrams
it was a dose-response study we didn't
get very far into that study and then it
became clear that we needed to do the
work inside the United States and that
would have multiplicative effect all
over the world so then in 2004 we were
able to start our u.s. MDMA a PTSD pilot
study
and that's recently completed I'll tell
you the results in just a second and
we've been moving towards doing work in
Israel I grew up Jewish and I felt like
part of my mission was to contribute to
healing some of the trauma in Israel so
we've started a study in Israel we've
got a study underway in Switzerland
that's just about done and then we're
moving to do another u.s. study and vets
and where we've been approved in Canada
for by Health Canada and by an IRB we're
still waiting to get the permission to
import the MDMA and we're also going to
do a study in Jordan in an Arab country
for trying to build Israeli Jordanian
collaboration where we focus on healing
we find that people of different
backgrounds can come together now these
are all what are called phase 2 pilot
studies they're all pretty small but we
are able to learn about our method to
look at our methods to try to figure out
how to train therapists so there's a lot
of learning going on in these early
phase 2 studies and part of the reason
for this international distribution of
our research is in case there's another
backlash that happens in any of these
particular countries or in case it
happens in the United States we now have
studies distributed so some of them we
believe will survive but actually I'm
much more hopeful I think that they're
all going to survive and we're going to
continue this is an example of the the
best image that we've ever seen about
MDMA for psychotherapy I mean a lot of
you have heard about it as ecstasy I'll
show you some other images from the
other side but this was from the largest
Israeli newspaper and it's about a man
it seems like he might be a soldier
there's helicopters in the background
it's a blood-red sea and he's holding on
to a happy face which is the ecstasy
pill or MDMA and so this was about our
our study in Israel and so the sense
that these substances can offer hope to
people who have previously been unable
to break through the the trauma that
they've suffered it's so different than
a lot of the demonization images that
I'll show you a bit later
now our us study was
completed in September 2008
it took us 22 years to do I started maps
in 86
MDMA was criminalized in 84 I actually
learned about MDMA in 82 and that was
involved in a lawsuit against the DEA in
1984 when they first tried to
criminalize it actually got college
credit for suing the DEA and it's
capable that I went to new college in
Sarasota Florida and you could do the
kind of study so I managed to get no
college credit for suing the DEA also
for starting Maps so 22 years it took us
to start this study it took four years
to conduct 1.2 million dollars to do a
lot of that was for incredible length of
time of the political struggles to get
it approved and then there was a lot of
fear so we had to spend fifty thousand
dollars to ensure the institutional
review board from being sued by the
patients they were so worried that some
patients would have a bad trip and they
would sue the institutional review board
we had to buy million-dollar insurance
policy for them we had to have an
emergency room doctor and nurse in the
next room we had to do all sorts of
things to get the study started but we
had no serious adverse events at all
these are now people that had manic
stress disorder an average of 19 years
and a large percentage of them no longer
a PTSD after the study and our outcomes
are much much better than zoloft and
paxil those are the two drugs approved
by the FDA for post-traumatic stress
disorder so based on our us study it
seems like we can make MDMA into
medicine but then we have to replicate
our results can we do it in other
cultures other teams and so our Swiss
study is now enrolling the twelfth out
of the 12 subjects and we've done a
preliminary data analysis after nine
subjects and we're getting statistically
significant results in our Swiss study
as well the results aren't quite as
dramatic as in the United States and
we're trying to figure out about
cultural differences is it true that
Swiss people are really more unemotional
and mechanical and they don't respond as
well you know it's hard to say you know
because we're varying the therapists
team
we're varying the culture and the
subjects are somewhat different but we
do have statistically significant
results after only nine people and the
last several have been doing well as as
well so that we are now going to have
two studies that both are sufficient to
make MDMA into a prescription medicine
so that's where we're extremely hopeful
that eventually we can move through the
system now there's also a series of
studies going on with people who are
dying of cancer or other diseases the
reason that we have these studies is
both because there was early work in the
1960s with LSD for cancer patients with
anxiety but also because part of our
primary strategy is that we need to show
that psychedelics are not for hippies
that want to dance all night at a party
or college students that you know want
to move off that they're actually we
have something to offer to the
mainstream and so the people that are
dying and are scared of dying are a
perfect population for us to show that
we can be of some assistance to and
that's also all of us are going to be
dying all of us are going to have
emotional issues related to that so that
post-traumatic stress disorder it also
works with people that are respected and
appreciated by our culture but not
everybody is going to have PTSD but
everybody's going to die so there's a
whole series of studies now with
psychedelics for end-of-life anxiety
including an MDMA cancer anxiety study
at Harvard and we were able to also
start LSD research in Switzerland we've
broadened it there it's not just cancer
patients but people dying from any
different cause and then a group called
heffter Research is sponsoring a series
of psilocybin studies with cancer
patients at UCLA the study was just
recently completed and then at NYU and
Johns Hopkins now some of you may know
that in 1963 Aldous Huxley who wrote a
whole series of wonderful books brave
new world and Island that he was
inspired by psilocybin and mescaline and
LSD he had a series of psychedelic
experiences that were really important
to him and as he was dying he has
his wife Laura Huxley to give him LSD
because he felt the surrendering that
happens with LSD would help him as he
was actually dying and so Laura wrote
this beautiful book called this timeless
moment about the the dying days of
Aldous and the article that he was
trying to finish as he was dying about
Shakespeare and death it's a beautiful
beautiful book and this has been an
inspiration for most of us in the field
and that also helped contribute to our
decision to be working with end-of-life
people there's also research going on at
Johns Hopkins into psychedelics and
spiritual experiences and it's been
recently published the pilot study was
in 2006 the follow-up was in 2008 and
what they found roland griffiths what he
found was that people who were ready for
a an experience with psilocybin and he
spent a lot of time you know finding
that people to enroll in this study but
they took those I've been individually
in a hospital setting and a substantial
majority of them had a mystical
experience that they rated as one of the
top five experiences of their lives and
so this is now outside of a formal
religious context and it suggests the
fundamental human rights abridgement of
the war on drugs that if you can have
one of the most five spiritual
experiences of your life most important
spiritual experiences and not just even
spirit most important experiences of
your life under the influence of
psilocybin without a formal religious
context the war on drugs that is
preventing people from having those
experiences is a fundamental abridgement
of human rights now trying to
communicate that to the culture trying
to change that it's really difficult but
these studies were based on earlier work
that was done by Tim Leary the best
thing that Tim Leary ever did when he
was at Harvard in terms of research was
the Good Friday experiment it was 20
subjects who were divinity students and
they went into church on Good Friday the
Reverend Howard Thurman was Martin
Luther King's mentor at Boston
University and he permitted this
experiment to take place in his church
and nine out of the 20 people had a
mystical experience eight out of those
nine had the
psilocybin and I later and I'll tell you
more about it did a 25 year follow-up to
that study there's also research going
on with Zen meditators in Switzerland
who go into the lab this is a EEG cap
that this fellow is wearing Vanya
Palmer's he was the head of the the one
of the leaders of the Zen community in
Switzerland and he felt recently that
he's had to leave his formal role
because then is not that friendly with
psychedelics but he's found that
psychedelics have been very important to
him in his personal development and what
this experiment is doing is it takes
meditators and it does series of brain
scans and then it gives them psilocybin
and then they meditate again and then
they look at how that changes which
parts of their brain are activated which
leads us to a whole other series of
studies psychedelic neuroscience
research which is taking place and many
people probably are not aware that there
is LSD research going on right now in
the United States at UCSF looking at
brain function they're also doing
research there with MDMA MDA and salvia
divinorum the University of Zurich is
the biggest team of psychedelic
researchers in the world and they're
doing all sorts of receptor mapping and
incredible stuff with psilocybin
ketamine and MDMA
they're moving eventually towards
therapeutic studies as well there's
psilocybin fMRI studies going on in
Bristol England and there's even
research with ayahuasca and EEG in
Barcelona so we have now established an
incredible pace of studies looking
therapeutic applications neuroscience
applications spiritual religious
applications and it's our job to try to
communicate to the public what's going
on in a way that keeps people
comfortable with the research continuing
Fran's vole inviter who initially is the
head of the lab and Zurich said we have
moved beyond the model psychosis
paradigm we have left that behind it
used to be that psychedelics were seen
as producing an experience that was
similar to psychosis and we've now
clearly understand that that's not at
all happening Sigmund Freud even sort of
spoke earlier about this was at the end
of his life he said the future may teach
us to exercise a direct in
by means of particular chemical
substances on the amounts of energy and
their distribution and the mental
apparatus it may be that there are still
other undreamt of possibilities of
therapy so I think the psychedelics are
and also all the drugs that the
pharmaceutical companies qualify is what
he was saying as well but even Sigmund
Freud was thinking that some way you
could augment the psychotherapeutic
process he worked with dreams but he was
thinking substances as well Stan Grof is
the world's most experienced psychedelic
therapist and researcher he's the mentor
to myself and to most of the researchers
currently working he said psychedelics
used responsibly and with proper caution
would be for psychiatry what the
microscope is for biology and medicine
or the telescope is for astronomy
psychedelics are that much of a reliable
tool into the unconscious Albert Hoffman
who invented LSD said I believe that if
people would learn to use LSD vision
inducing capability more wisely under
suitable conditions and medical practice
and in combination with meditation than
in the future this problem child could
become a wonder child and that's what
we're all working towards now let's
envision the future when psychedelics
are mainstreamed so this is a Google
Maps and some one it's a little bit hard
to see but someone has put in
psychedelic clinics and you can see that
there's psychedelic clinics all over
America this is the future that we're
envisioning this is a another research
the sponsored ads on the right I guess
it's too small for you to see but
there's one for mapping psychedelic
clinics another one for indigenous
grandmothers endorse a particular
psychedelic clinic and then mcdabble ins
billions of molecules served so we think
that one day these things will be
mainstreamed in this way there'll be an
apple phone app here's the maps one for
finding the closest psychedelic clinic
to you here's a fella that's having a
little bit of a problem and is looking
now for where he can go have a
therapeutic experience with psychedelics
there'll be storefront clinics of all
sorts and the psychedelics will be
incorporated into religion you'll notice
that it meets from Saturday at 9:00 p.m.
till Sunday at 9:00 a.m.
in time to clear out for the regular
other people to come in for their
service and it'll be fully compatible
with any different religions
psychedelics are like neutral tools and
there may even be a harmony this is the
psychedelic dating website here at the
bottom it says which psychedelic drug
would you like to do on your first date
putting the e back in harmonious
relationships so we are talking about a
movement from therapy to spirituality to
a broader post-prohibition world now
just to make a distinction quickly with
medical marijuana that there is no
Renaissance with medical marijuana
research the pharmacopoeia marijuana was
taken out in 1942 there is no private
production of marijuana in the United
States if you want to make marijuana
into a medicine you got to get it from
the government and they don't want to
give it to you to make marijuana into a
medicine so that's why we have all these
state losses because there's no route
through the FDA and in 2001 we started
an effort with a professor Lyle cracker
he's the Rosa Parks of the medical
marijuana movement and he's a botanist
senior tenured professor and it ended up
that we've had to have a DEA
administrative law judge lawsuit and we
won it DEA has tried to block it and now
we've been able to stall their effort to
finally reject it and President Obama
has not yet appointed new leadership at
DEA that's what it's going to take he's
appointed a new drug czar who's more
open-minded than the last he's appointed
new people at Department of Justice
they've said the feds will not come into
states that have medical marijuana laws
but as far as trying to make marijuana
into a madison through the fda we're
still waiting to break the federal
monopoly this is my old college roommate
Allan hopper who's head of the ACLU drug
law reform project and myself in the DEA
courtroom for that lawsuit which we want
and then after the DEA tried to reject
that here's our protest on the lawn of
the DEA and professor craker is on the
right of the screen who wants to do the
research now what happened in the 60s
why was there this backlash part of it
is that the culture wasn't ready birth
was medicalised women were
tranquilised death was hidden away you
didn't discuss it my aunt died 21 when I
was five years old of cancer and my
grandparents didn't even tell her she
had cancer you just something you didn't
talk about sexuality was more repressed
yoga and meditation were totally weird
unfamiliar frightening rites of passage
religious rituals were pretty much empty
for most people and psychoanalysis was
just endless talk therapy so the
emergence of the psychedelics came in a
culture that wasn't ready there was also
a tendency on the part of the proponents
to exaggerate the benefits and minimize
the risks this was in Time magazine all
students who had taken the drug and this
is about the Good Friday experiment
experienced a mystical consciousness
that resembled those of the Mystics and
aesthetics
now first off I said it was only eight
out of ten that had the psilocybin had a
mystical experience but what are those
two that didn't was so moved by The
ministers talk that he felt he had to
tell people that there was a man on a
cross so he left the room he went
outside he was running down Commonwealth
Avenue in front of the church Tim Leary
and others had to go bring him back into
the the chapel and they administered
Thorazine to him and that was completely
covered up in the research for 25 years
until I did my Good Friday experiment
follow-up and discovered to my dismay
that what I thought was one of the best
studies ethically and scientifically
that there was a major cover-up of the
risks so I think that there's this self
blame in a sense on the psychedelic
community for the backlash by this
minimizing the risks and or arresting
the benefits and because of that more
than a few people were unprepared for
the depth of their experience a lot of
bad trips and so parents were worried
scared manipulated by politicians so a
lot of people think this is the reason
for the backlash that psychedelics gone
wrong but I think there's something
deeper and I think it's when
psychedelics go right and there's a
deeper spirituality so what the people
in the Good Friday experiment said that
they told me they experienced enhanced
appreciation of life in nature deepened
sense of joy deepened commitment to the
Christian ministry or whatever other
vocations they chose enhanced
appreciation of a new
experiences and emotions increased
tolerance of other religious systems
deep in equanimity in the face of
difficult life crisis now this is for
this would be true for any kind of
mystical experience not drugs but where
it gets even further is that this
feeling of unity the core essence of the
mystical experience is this sense of
unity connection we're all one and that
leads to greater saya solidarity with
identifying with compassion for foreign
people's minorities women the
environment and the feelings of
timelessness and eternity reduce
people's fear of death and empower the
subjects to take more risks in their
lives and participate more fully in
political struggles so we have the
counterculture movement in the 60s as
many of them the Beatles we know very
influenced for the LSD that the
psychedelics were part of motivating
people to get involved in social justice
movements and I think it's this is the
reason that second of the backlash
really happened
we have the self-identification as the
counterculture this is Tim Leary turn on
tune in drop out that when you identify
as a counterculture that you're dooming
yourself the culture is bigger the
culture doesn't like people leaving
parents don't want to raise their kids
and have them drop out so although the
culture wasn't ready it's this
identification as the counterculture
that I think doomed it and made the
backlash more inevitable and that's why
we're talking now about the
mainstreaming of psychedelics that
psychedelics can coexist in any kind of
a society and particularly in ours it
went to the extreme where President
Nixon called Leary the most dangerous
man in America now MDMA came on the
scene in the middle 70s it was a
underground psychedelic therapy tool
even though it wasn't illegal it was
kept quiet and it was used by hundreds
of psychiatrists and therapists under
the code name Adam but some of the
people that used it that way said aha
here's a way to make a lot of money they
transformed it into ecstasy they started
marketing it in public and we knew that
there was gonna be a backlash but we
were preparing for the backlash we were
working with people who wouldn't
otherwise used illegal drugs so brother
David Stein the rust Catholic monk he I
worked with him he tried the small doses
of MDMA to help meditation in the
monastery and he said a monk spends his
whole life cultivating the same awakened
attitude it gives you as almond shakhter
Orthodox rabbi said you call the Sabbath
a delight MDMA is like the Sabbath at
the end of a long week and we were
getting these things in the media and
the Newsweek and Washington Post we were
winning the the education public
education war with the DEA and that
caused them to emergency schedule and
then becomes the demonization so this is
dance with darkness ecstasy and
predatory drugs from the DEA website if
you want to know what a rave is like you
go to the DEA website this is a guy in a
gas mask
now maybe this is a rave in Israel and
they're under gas attack or something
Scud missiles from Iraq but this is kind
of a scary image now the perversion of
science this is NIDA the National
Institute of abuse put out this postcard
the brain on the one side looks really
alive these are SPECT scans blood flow
through the brain and you look on the
right-hand side and there's parts of it
seem to be missing it's it's not an
accurate representation of what's
actually going on this was testimony to
the Senate by Alan leshner who's now the
head of the American Academy for the
Association American Association for the
Advancement of science he was the editor
of science magazine or I mean science
magazine was under his direction and
this was testimony to the Senate and he
shows this baseline highlights specs can
again highly activated brain and then
two weeks after MDMA what he didn't say
is that these sort of changes are
temporary but what he also failed to say
because he probably didn't realize is
that to be in this study people had to
have been heavy MDMA users so his
baseline brain that he's showing is
totally healthy is of a heavy MDMA user
so it's twisted science and then this
was the worst it got on MTV and Oprah
this is an effort this was a young woman
who had drug problems and she went to
get her spec scan and they showed that
she had all these holes in her brain now
this is completely graphically
manipulated they just set the anyplace
where there was
less than a certain amount of blood flow
they turned it into a whole if people
actually had holes like this in their
brain they wouldn't be alive they
wouldn't be walking talking this woman
was on MTV and Oprah telling about how
horrible her career was as a drug user
but there was evidence of brain damage
and she was working for the partnership
for a drug-free America to try to spread
this kind of information
now the culture is ready that we have
midwives birthing centers home birth
over 3,500 hospice centers in the u.s.
sexuality is less repressed yoga and
meditation are familiar and comforting
we have the dance culture we have
ayahuasca spreading throughout the
United States we have all sorts of rites
of passage and psychoanalysis has been
largely abandoned in favor of
evidence-based psychotherapies and has
said we do have prominent people who
have spoken about how their psychedelic
experiences have been valuable to them
this is Kary Mullis discovered the
polymerase chain reaction the key to DNA
analysis and he was a maps member for a
bit and he said I think I would be
stupid in some respects if it weren't
for my psychedelic experiences so that's
quite something coming from a Nobel
Prize winner of course Steve Jobs in LSD
one of the two or three most important
things he done in his life from this
book what the Dormouse said how the 60s
counterculture shaped the personal
computer industry many of you are
probably aware of that now
Harvard is a symbol both because of
Leary and because of its preeminence and
psychedelics and the academics I mean so
we brought MDMA research to Harvard and
this was an article in Newsweek about
the start of our MDMA study but how we
buried the ghost of Timothy Leary this
was the study and there's also going to
be cluster headache research but the way
we did it is that we focused first on
the risks and I think that's the key
part is that we have to be careful about
not repeating the mistakes of the 60s
the government is not trusted about the
risks because they exaggerate them
they're not trusted about the benefits
because they deny them and suppress the
research but we can't do the opposite so
I've worked for years to bring a study
to Harvard of the risks of MDMA of
ecstasy and neurocognitive consequences
and as it turned out all the research
was all complicated by the fact that
ecstasy users used also
of other drugs and I got an email from a
maps member who said he had the solution
that there was a group of people who had
done only ecstasy and when it was clear
that he was writing to me from Utah we
figured it out there's a bunch of young
sort of fallen Mormons who have rebelled
to the extent of using ecstasy but
they'd not use tobacco alcohol marijuana
and any of these other drugs so we gave
a fifteen thousand dollar grant to
Harvard to do a pilot study they found
these people really existed and then
they got a 1.8 million dollar grant so
part of mainstreaming psychedelics at
Harvard was to show them that it's
financially lucrative to do this sort of
research and we also have got a quarter
of a million dollar grant from Peter
Lewis to do the study and we have to
work with compelling patients cancer
patients people who are dying we have to
again reach out to the heart of the
culture and that's what happened again
at Harvard but we took years to get
permission for the study the leadership
changed at the hospital a new guy came
in and he was there five days later we
got final permission from the DEA for
the study of marijuana it turns out that
this new director had worked for the
drug czar and he didn't like research
with psychedelics he tried to block it
but it was clear that there was so much
institutional support for it that maps
had to withdraw as the sponsor we had to
make the donor donate directly to
Harvard but the study is was able to
continue yes here's the ghost of Timothy
Leary near near the end of his life
isn't that actually it goes quite yet
but you know so he's still on the minds
of the people at Harvard and in our
culture two months after our study was
continued but maps had to withdraw the
director left Harvard in a cloud of
scandal sexual relations with patients
and we're still working to try to get
our relationship back with Harvard now
at Burning Man our work there to
institutionalize this kind of
psychedelic harm reduction because again
one of the things that did lead to this
backlash was people having terrible
experiences going home and you know
going to the hospital things like that
so Burning Man is a place where we think
about it as a way to build the future
culture
yet there's heavy use of psychedelics
and there's a bunch of people there that
run into problems with psychedelics so
we figured if we could take our vision
of a post-prohibition world and build a
team of therapists to help people just
the same way that there's a medical tent
that now there's a psychedelic therapy
tent at Burning Man and some of the
Rangers had tried to create that as well
and so we're trying to model and protect
the advances were making with research
in 2006 Burning Man was started in 86 I
was maps so we had our 20th anniversary
at Burning Man this was a empty on
village and it was sort of the fruits of
psychedelics to society in terms of
religion science art and community but
it turned out that the Burning Man
organization is suffering under the drug
war and so the drug war has made it so
that if you do harm reduction work if
you own a bar or something like that if
you are aware that drug use is there
they can put you in jail and take your
assets from you so the Burning Man
people for three years refused our offer
of help and this just shows how perverse
the drug war is however some of the
Rangers did accept help and we were able
to bring in therapist from around the
world to work and provide therapy it so
it's not like talking people down it's
talking people through and helping them
have more productive experiences and it
got it grew and grew and grew to the
point where we sort of had training
programs for people who came to Burning
Man and 50 60 70 people were in our
teams we had staffing 24 hours a day six
to eight hour shifts you know six seven
people at a time and it was really quite
something
however I went to Bernie - boom Festival
Portugal in 2006 we helped maps did in
2008 and what we found out is that there
is drugs are decriminalized and the boom
was just is the example of psychedelic
harm reduction it's terrific and so we
started asking the Burning Man
organization to put sanctuary on the map
to tell people about it and the police
already knew they brought people to us
but that made the Burning Man
organization uncomfortable this is just
some pictures of boom to show you how
out front these are all facilities for
people
who have difficult trips there right on
the it's easy and Bernie man has hidden
away so the Bernie man organization
wasn't ready and they felt that our
process was our program was getting too
big so now the Rangers have taken over
the sanctuary space it's more it's
institutionalized which is good but it's
still hidden away in all sanctuary
volunteers have to be Rangers now so I
found out that even at Burning Man if
you go too fast that you get rejected so
it's a major message for incremental
change and we have to be very careful
about that so our main work is now at
the FDA and this is nonprofit drug
development the pharmaceutical companies
aren't interested in psychedelics
because they're not patentable they're
off patent they'll be generics and
they're not administered very many times
so there's no funding for drug
development research from the
pharmaceutical industry the government
won't do it because they're still too
involved in the propaganda of the war on
drugs and major foundations the support
medical research are still it's a little
bit too controversial but that will
change but for now it's it will always
remain nonprofit drug development and
that's why we depend on contributions
from individuals and family foundations
to make this happen and it's it's
difficult route but it can be done and
it's also controversial but one of the
major models is the abortion pill are
you 46 which is developed by a nonprofit
organization into a drug FDA is our main
ally the government is not monolithic
the FDA is not in favor of psychedelic
research they're in favor of science
looking at psychedelics and that's all
we need so the change happened in 89 90
where the team at FDA that had authority
to regulate psychedelics was shifted to
a new group and this new group decided
to put science first so the message here
is that individuals can make a
difference in a big system that
courageous individuals can make a big
difference in 92 there was a big meeting
about how to handle psychedelics and the
FDA said we're the most rigorous agency
in the whole world
as far as evaluating medicines we'll
just look at psychedelics and marijuana
the way we look at any other drug
and that will be our approach and
because they emphasize they were so
rigorous the drug czars the night of the
DEA people said great well we'll give it
to the FDA and nothing will come out the
other end but it was a brilliant
maneuver on the bureaucrats at the FDA
because now they're actually letting us
do this research and as I've said before
we have some progress now people will
say that it costs 800 million dollars to
make a drug to a medicine how could a
non-profit ever do that and the truth is
that we can't raise 800 million dollars
but it doesn't really cost that the
number comes from the top Center for the
study of drug development they work with
the pharmaceutical industry their
consortium of pharmaceutical companies
contribute their data to this Institute
they can't share the data with the other
company so everything is kept
proprietary and it was started by this
Lewy lasagna dr. Joe Demasi did the
studies and he estimated eight hundred
and two million dollars but half of that
money is from the opportunity cost on
the money of her Masuya companies or
businesses they figure they should be
making at least eleven percent a year so
half of that money goes away we don't
have to spend at opportunity cost for a
non-profit there is no such thing then
the costs of failure is amortized to the
few successes pharmaceutical companies
do all sorts of drug research but very
few of them make it through the other
end and so the cost of the failures are
amortized into that and for example for
the new drug approved 5,000 chemicals
are synthesized in screened 250 or made
into brought into animal testing five
into human testing one approved so the
success rate is only twenty percent
twenty one point five percent the cost
of the failures is one hundred and fifty
five million or so forty percent so now
we're down to like 250 million to make a
drug into a medicine but we have some
advantages as a small nonprofit we don't
have the overhead the salaries that
pharmaceutical companies do we had a
volunteer we have refugees from the
pharmaceutical industry that are helping
us do what we want to do for a fraction
of the cost
monitoring studies are expensive we had
a bit of 175,000 and we were able to do
it for 15,000 with donated labor but
that's not really the big way
the big thing is the Aikido strategy
psychedelics are demonized drugs and in
Aikido you use your opponent's energy
and momentum to your advantage so the
fact that psychedelics are demonized is
good for us because governments of the
world have spent hundreds and hundreds
of millions of dollars on what's bad
with all these drugs and all of that is
published and in the public domain so we
don't have to replicate that all we have
to do is these more narrow the studies
into our particular patient populations
I'm just saying here in NIDA budget is a
billion dollars a year they spent almost
16 million in 2004 and it's climbing and
they've spent a lot before been so that
we have in the peer-reviewed literature
in MEDLINE there's 3,000 this is a few
days ago thirty five hundred and twenty
six Studies on MDMA or ecstasy it's
incredible how much we know about these
drugs and now let's do you similar so
that it's hard to estimate what all this
research cost but assuming around a
hundred thousand dollar average and like
I talked about the MDMA neurocognitive
study at 1.8 million that's only gonna
result in two papers the pilot study
data in the final paper so that's the
900,000 average for those two papers so
$100,000 average seems reasonable three
hundred fifty million dollars so all
we're gonna need to spend and is around
ten million dollars in the next eight to
ten years to develop
MDMA into a prescription medicine the
cost to complete our phase two studies
is 1.2 million over the next two and a
half years this is a chart just to show
you how we have projected out our
budgets for all the different studies
all of our phase two studies that's 1.2
million over the next three years and
this is leading towards what's called an
end of Phase two meeting with the FDA
where you design the large-scale phase
three studies we're starting a new study
with vets with PTSD it's going to be
only in vets it's going to be a three
arm design low medium and full doses
that'll help with the double-blind the
FDA likes that kind of design and we're
testing that out for Phase three and
healing the heart of America MDMA PTSD
research and vets this was a cover
article of the Washington Post Sunday
magazine and the article was titled the
peace drug they talk about MDMA as the
poppy straw
and so we are able I think to really
move into the culture with this sort of
research and incremental change is again
our by word the reintroduction and
reintegration of psychedelics in our
culture must be done gradually so it's
not to catalyze a counter reaction and
it means response so to speak similar to
what transpired during the 1960s and
this idea of mainstreaming psychedelics
bringing them into our culture Albert
Einstein said if at first the idea
doesn't sound absurd then there is no
hope so many of you might agree it's
arts does seem science and it's kind of
absurd that we can actually do this but
I think that we can and this is to let
you know that we're having the
psychedelic science in the 21st century
conference in San Jose April 15th to
18th and 2010 and you're all welcome to
come and attend and learn from the
leaders of this whole movement so thank
you very much for this opportunity to
speak to you about this and I look
forward to some time for questions now
way did anybody have a question one
question yes
yes
ah okay so if I understand the question
the question is that we are making
progress but what do we think about
whether it's possible for another
organization to come in and either make
these drugs into medicines faster than
us or try to or try to stop it
oh yes yes so the question is will there
be a backlash or I think it's very
possible that there could be and I think
that's why we need to proceed extremely
slowly that's why we have the
international strategy and that's why we
have to recognize that once there is a
backlash it can last for decades and
decades I mean we're basically coming
out of a forty year period of this
suppression of the research so we have
to be exceptionally careful but I think
that's possible but also the need for
this kind of work our culture in general
and around the world has such a need for
this you know the rise of religious
fundamentalism I think that psychedelics
can play a role in that so we're hoping
that there won't be a backlash and the
whole sort of from my life trajectory I
was a draft resister I was thinking I
was going to jail from the Vietnam War
and and so I've sort of worked through
that you know criminal because I was
using psychedelics and then moved
through Harvard through the Kennedy
School of Government and sort of my
whole own life is sort of becoming more
mainstream and legitimate I go to the
PTA meetings I have a wife three kids
and you know so I think that it's
possible I don't know that it's gonna
work but I do know that the effort to
make it work is incredibly satisfying
and important so it's beyond any one of
us to say whether there will be this
backlash but it really is something that
we have to be aware of but at the same
time it doesn't make me think I should
go do something else I think that it's
it's satisfying just doing this work as
I'm doing now yes
yes okay that's a great question so the
question is our sample sizes in our
studies the u.s. study is just 21
subjects the Swiss is 12 those other
studies that I mentioned are also 12 our
vets study will be 18 how does that
compare to what the FDA wants to see the
answer is that the phase three studies
that are going to be required and you
need to large-scale phase three studies
they will probably require about 300
people in each one and we don't know
exactly because what you have to do is
you figure out the effect size and the
variability and that helps you design
what you need but for pilot studies
which is the stage that we're at these
are appropriate sample sizes and also we
can do a meta analysis with all these
studies so we're gonna probably have 80
or 90 people in our therapy studies now
if we had more resources if you know
somebody had extra Google stock or
something that wanted to donate I would
like to see these pilot studies be
larger but we just really can't afford
it so we're just doing toeholds and
we're trying to extrapolate as much as
we can on the most minimal of data but
but that's the situation you know the VA
in the year 2004 spent 4.3 billion
dollars on disability payments to people
with PTSD it's up to around 5.5 billion
per year and we've been able to take
people who have had PTSD for 19 years
and at the end of the process they don't
have PTSD and are can we get some money
from the government to work with that it
would make sense from the VA economic
point of view but again we're sort of
clashing we've had five different teams
at the VA over the last 10 years around
the country teams of cearÃ¡ therapists
and psychiatrists who wanted to do MDMA
research and they haven't been able to
get permission it's been squashed so our
sample sizes are more or less
appropriate for what we're doing but we
need way more people and so that's where
I'm saying we'll probably need 10
million dollars to do the larger studies
yes Herman
okay all right so everyone is asking you
know who's doing the best job of
explaining how they work and who has the
best models so the first thing I'll say
is that from a political strategic
perspective I don't care how they work
and nor does the FDA in order to make a
drug into a medicine you have to show
that it works but you don't have to show
how it works so because of this limited
resource situation we are focusing just
on providing and doing studies with how
they you know if they work however we
have people in Israel that are doing
fMRI of our patients before and after
and they're paying for that themselves
other researchers in Switzerland we have
a team that's doing work with EEG heart
rate variability startle response again
paying for themselves with our PTSD
patients but I think the the best team
in the world for how they work is at the
University of Zurich
so it's dr. France Poland biter leading
that team and he's got we're gonna have
a one day post conference workshop where
he and Dave Nichols from Heffner are
gonna do psychedelic neuroscience and
they'll explain how they work
but again there's a lot more to be
learned but we have such incredible
tools now that we didn't have 40 years
ago so that the current psychedelic
research is getting pretty close into
which brain systems are activated which
neuro transmitters systems which
receptor subtypes so it's but at the
same time the therapy overview it's
there's a personal it's not just the
pharmacological so there's a lot about
trust faith courage that is part of the
therapeutic method that we're trying to
figure out as well yes
okay so where we add as far as
cross-species dosages so I think what
you're saying is of what relevance is
the animal model - what's happening with
humans and that was a very big issue
with MDMA neurotoxicity because a lot of
the work was done in rats and monkeys
and the model that they used the species
scaling model gave very misleading
results it made it seem as if doses that
were within the range that people were
taking were equivalent to what the
animals were using but those models were
shown to be flawed and now we're having
a much better understanding but the
other part of your question for me is
again that because animals are really
it's very difficult to find out if an
animal had a spiritual experience or if
an animal you know was you can do a lot
of studies with animals on fear and how
they get over post-traumatic stress
disorder but until the FDA asks us to do
more animal studies we're again not
doing that so that the the cross species
scaling models are mostly for toxicity
studies and what we have with
psychedelics is a really good situation
where they're only given a few times in
the course of therapy our MDMA study is
a four month process of therapy and
there's only three days that people get
MDMA and they get weekly non drug
psychotherapy in between so the toxicity
of these drugs is fundamentally
different than any kind of a drug that
the pharmaceutical company wants you to
take every day or twice a day for months
or years at a time so the toxicity
issues are very easy and that's another
reason why I think it'll only be about
ten million dollars to make MDMA into a
prescription medicine because first off
the government has spent all these
hundreds of millions on toxicity but
secondly there is very little toxicity
we've done neural cognitive studies in
our first MDMA the PTSD study in the US
and we showed that there was no change
after two to three sessions now actually
the neuro cognitive performance went
slightly up but that's to be expected
because people who are depressed or
anxious do less well on neuro cognitive
studies because their mental processing
is occupied by the
sort of dampening of the depression or
anxiety so I'm hopeful that we won't
have to do animal studies we've had some
of our don't you could imagine that a
lot of the donors sir psychedelics are
vegetarians and animal rights activists
and so it's dicey for us to get involved
with animal research because a lot of
our donors will abandon us if we do I
personally believe that animal research
is appropriate and it's ethical and I
think you just have to take really good
care of the animals so I'm not against
it I actually we did a study with dogs
and rats in 1985 and I felt like since I
was kind of responsible for that study I
went to watch the I went down to check
it out and it turned out that I happened
to be there the day that half the
animals were euthanized and dissected
and it was amazing it was this high-tech
Mississippi lab in a major hospital and
when the animals were killed it was like
this mystery that was bigger than
everybody this life death transition and
then they were taken immediately and
four different teams were dissecting
these animals and I sat in the middle of
these teams and sort of told them
stories about the therapeutic uses of
MDMA about why they were doing it and I
felt that there is something wholly
about the scientific process and the
scientific method and so I feel like I I
need to work exceptionally hard to
justify the animals that have been
killed in order to do this work and
hopefully we won't need to do any more
of that but I think there is a role for
animal studies and fortunately you know
it's very difficult to do one of the
reasons that psychedelic research has
renewed in humans because the NIDA
funded researchers that were doing all
the animal studies felt that their
studies were becoming increasingly
irrelevant because unless they could
correlate them with human data who knows
what they mean so that was a big impetus
for the renewal of psychedelics and that
was a courageous move on the part of
these animal researchers funded by NIDA
to say they want human studies yes
okay so the question is you know we
mentioned Steve Jobs and his experiences
and so what is the role of people coming
out in public and talking about their
experiences I think we can make a link
to the gay rights movement that you know
most everybody knew somebody that was
gay they just didn't know that they did
and if people who have been influenced
by psychedelics were to reveal
themselves as to what benefits people
would be shocked and so I think it's
very essential that we have this sort of
coming out from people who have been
influenced by psychedelics and and I
encourage a lot of people to start with
their parents to start with their family
and you know I think that that a lot of
work gets done where you you know speak
to those in your close intimate circle
and explain if psychedelics were
valuable to you and I think that there's
again it's such fear they because of the
war on drugs that if you acknowledge
that you have done these drugs that
there'll be some problems and in fact
the researcher that we're working with
Andrew Feld Mart in Vancouver the reason
that he and I got in touch with each
other and some of you may have heard
this he was crossing the border to visit
his children in the United States he has
been here 30 40 times and the u.s.
customs age and did a Google search
okay so Google then they did a Google
search on his name and they found that
he had written a paper 20 years before
about his use of psychedelics when he
was younger where he affirmed that they
were valuable to him and the custom
agent said you are banned from coming in
the United States he is still banned
this was several years ago The Colbert
Report did a sort of humorous thing it
was in the New York Times so that there
can indeed be consequences but they're
more there are consequences and it
requires courage but I do think that
it's important for people to carefully
become more open about their experiences
with psychedelics that's what it's
really going to take to continue this
mainstreaming process and it's important
for people who use these things to show
that they are still part
anticipating and having families having
normal lives that psychedelics are not
inherently disruptive of work you know
family spirituality community that these
things can enhance life rather than
detract from them well I think we're a
few minutes over our time the video
conferencing system would be used for
another talk but Rick is there with us
for a while so anybody who still has
questions please join us maybe we go
over for coffee and can continue the
discussion yeah thank you everybody and
also all the folks on the video streams</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
