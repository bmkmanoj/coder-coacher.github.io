talk about girls weaknesses and property
testing kind of things maybe I need to
speak okay thank you very much for the
great opportunity to give the
presentation here at Google my name is
dating Gilman and from Seattle
Washington and I'm going to talk about
data representation by graphs matrices
formulas and continued fractions and
inverse problems for Laplace separated
so what I would like to show that grass
and matrices can be used to represent a
lot of very diverse information in a
uniform way and then it can be used for
data analysis and also a lot of
transformations that data can be
represented by grasso matrices and then
I will talk about a one problem in
particular in more detail so first I
would like to talk about three different
briefly very briefly about the projects
whatever I work phone in microsoft
research and this is collaborative work
is this lonely would Steve altshuler
Ledward junk in the Greg Ridgeway so
this three rajat have resulted in six
united states patents and i would like
to show you the just several different
areas where the matrices and grouse
appear and then i would like to talk
about one project in much more detail
about the ground about indoors problems
for for a graph for a plus separator
this is a problem where one tries to
observes a graph or random walk on a
graph one day at the boundary and would
like to figure out what how the graph
looks like inside and there i'll talk
about it later there are a lot of
problems in mathematics for example that
can be converted to this problem so if
it even if it sounds and not very
familiar you will see a hope that many
problems can be can be converted to this
one so a graph is a set of nodes
connected by the links and it can be
directed or not directed and it can be
annotate it can be semantic graph and
then saw something like this so a matrix
usually associated to a graph is a
matrix which is n by n where n is the
number of bound number of nodes in the
graph and the matrices i will talk about
today mostly they have the following
structure if there is a connection from
node I to know j then the entry in the
matrix is non zero so this matrix a is
not zero if there is a link and zero if
there is no link and such a matrix can
be called adjacency matrix 0 applies
matrix for a graph so I would like to
show just very first three projects and
especially because they are connected to
the internet problems and web web
propagation data and a web for example I
would like to show where you first talk
very briefly about this project and just
show how grass and matrices can be used
in very different situations so first
project is the following is suppose you
would like to suppose you would like to
advertise a certain web page to our
users then what we can do he can look at
the historic data how people were
looking at other web pages and then to
interfere from this information so
called influential rumormongers we can
see the we can look at the weather and
which people are looking at the other
web pages and from it did you sue is
talking to who and who influences other
person other person decision to look a
lot to look at the at the web page so
suppose you would like to edit either
pay a web page see let's first look how
people are looking at the web pages a
and B for example
so suppose we have the following data
that you have web page a and web page B
and we know that users three at the day
one so let's say this is day one day two
day three day four day five suppose you
look at the water in reach the people
are looking at the webpages worth 32 35
then we can sort of Gd you that maybe if
if a person one was looking at the web
page after person see maybe the person
three Scott was talking to the person
one and his first suffers the web page
and then recommended to the person one
and the same thing here maybe people
three and five very influenced by the by
day by the suggestion of person to to
look at the web page so here we can
represent the data by the following
graph we can represent the users that
are looking at the web pages by by graph
where the entities are will represent
users and from this we can deduce that
maybe person one is talking to person
two and two is talking to person five
and two is talking to persons three and
four is talking to a person C so this
was the one one of the projects is to
given the historic data of how people
are looking at web pages and be try to
figure out the graph of influence who is
talking to who and then once you know
this graph we can choose the influential
rumormonger is the people who talk to
many people and rather than just
randomly give an advertisement give it
for example to person one and then you
can be sure then in two days everybody
it's two three and five uomo at the same
time if you do not know this graph then
you have to tell to everybody for
example then we can miss you can for
example it go give redundant information
so tell the person three enter person to
at the same time this is this is very
natural for purse for people to
recommend web pages to each other
so it's better to give a person too and
then the person 3 will know from the
person too so once the once the graph is
learned then we can very efficiently
spread the spread the advertisement for
example and what we learn from this
process if there are a lot of
connections if people talk to each other
a lot then it doesn't really matter who
you are talking to because it is a
phenomenon like six degrees of
separation at the same time if the graph
is disconnected then it's very we
convene a lot by learning this graph
first and then either using grid last
greedy covering graph algorithm or
looking at the clusters we can we
convene a lot by figuring out this graph
first and then given the information to
influential room and morgans hell in
this case it may be two and one for
example so just very briefly this is of
course this is a very interesting
problem how to figure out this graph and
so forth and then algorithms how to
choose the people who the influential
rumormongers so I just worry briefly
want you to show that in this case the
matrices them in graph theory presented
I used to represent users users that are
looking at the web pages on the internet
so then the next project was the project
about semantic graphs suppose a person
is doing it is trying to find out what
is suppose a person has a following task
I would like to go to a movie that is
located somewhere where my friend lives
nearby so this is a complicated query
for example to a database at the same
time it can be represented by again by
semantic graph so this is another
application of grass
so in this case the the nodes of the
grass you represent the entities that
are involved in the query and then the
links have notation that show
relationship between these entities so
even such a complicated query can be
very efficiently represented by a graph
suppose you can have a person so the
entities are person moving location of
the person's house like a location of
the movie location of the person's
friends house for example and then the
person and then the such a complicated
theory can be sis can be decent by the
way was done in a it was used in a
sidewalk application by Microsoft that
shows what entertai what what's going on
in ECT and so and then using the graphic
and show the connections between those
entities person is looking for a movie
movies playing at a certain location
then there is relationship between
locations that this should be close to
each other and then there is a
connection here that person leaves at
the certain location so this is a rip
this can be this is a different very
different application of a graph for
example that shows how to give a
complicated query and then for example
we can have a what once we represent the
once you represent information in the
following way there are so many things
that we can do also suppose a person is
looking for a for a theater
then once you have this information
there are represented as a graph there a
lot of interest in the transformations
of a graph that can be done and this
graph can be analyzed called semantic
graph so for example you can also know
that movie just separate if that movie
theatre and concert are all part of
entertainment part of part of part of
entertainment there for example suppose
you advertise been a concert then for
example one of the very efficient
transfer when were very important
transformations it can be done to this
graph is generalizing it we can see the
person is looking for a theater and the
movie playing at a location then we can
we can see from this that the person is
actually may be looking for
entertainment that is just playing
somewhere where his friend lives or her
friend lives and so in this case we can
see that we can generalize this graph so
this is one of the transformations on
the graph and replace theater and movie
by entertainment and then fold suppose
you have it advertisement for a concert
then this would be very this would be
very relevant to give a such a person
the advertisement for the concert
because it's also a a part of the
entertainment so we did a lot of I
various work with this graph clustering
algorithms then once then for example we
needed to find the Defiant distance
between such graphs for example if you
would like a person to help to complete
a task then the person we would go to
historic data see what he or maybe or
maybe the person's friends were making
similar queries and then we define the
distance between these graphs and then
see what to hell person to complete so
for example person just starts to write
the query and the program would finish
it for for for the person and so we did
a lot of work
dead and for example here it's very
efficient once you represented by a
matrix you can for example Boruc Lydian
distance from from the it so then it's
very easy to define the to define a
distance between graphs once they
represented by vectors and matrices we
work with the distance that was related
by we put all these graphs into the
latest and with the transformations of
generalizing or ad on different entries
and then we would say that the two
graphs are similar if they're aware if
there is a short set of transformations
that would lead from one graph to
another or especially if there are
special if there are big common sub
graphs then we would say the two graphs
are close to each other so this is a
this is a different application of
graphs also matrices and then I would
like to show just one more one more one
more application of graphs suppose we
and then I will talk in more detail
about the inverse problems for God's and
applause separator this will be more
more technical than this is just to give
you an idea how graphs are can be used
so suppose you are looking at the person
looking at the internet web pages and we
would like to predict what would be the
next page the person would look at to
forecast the usage then we could speed
up the physical prefetch question so in
this case we could speed up the download
of the pages for example so here we can
use matrixes in the following way this
is a example of collaboration of a
person and the computer so there was so
the project I was working on was the
father and a person is looking at the
patterns in the history of a person
looking at the web pages and then a
person would give would make certain
hypotheses about the pattern zipper a
person is looking at so for example
patterns of the following way if a
person is looking for news on Monday
news internet pages on Monday probably
the person we look at on Tuesday also on
the internet on the news web pages and
Wednesday because they're working days
and maybe if a person is looking at
game pages on Saturday then probably
would look at game pages on Sunday also
so a person can make different different
hypothesis about the patterns that a
user is about the users looking at the
internet and then using that to the
program would take this hypothesis a
check it against the historic data and
give the weights to each of the
hypothesis and then to come combine them
in order to produce the in order to
produce the final forecast for what a
person is going to do so in this example
the predictions were made in the
calendar like fashion so for example
Monday Tuesday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
to the sunday and the way a person would
make predictions is suppose blue color
corresponds to news then we can say that
if a person is looking at the web pages
on monday probably here look at web
pages on Tuesday they can color it this
way and if looking at web page news web
pages on Tuesday probably look at them
on Wednesday also they can also color it
and boot and so forth and then for game
pages you can use for example a
different color this is for games for
example and then the program would go
look at the historic data and see when
maybe five days of the week the person
was looking at the news web pages and
then the only weak weak weekends the
person is looking at the green game web
pages so then the programmer that just
have a printout would destroy so the
person would make certain predictions of
that kind and then the the program would
go in the historic data and see which of
the traditions are more true and less
true and then the it would give so the
hypothesis have different colors here
and then to the 0 hypothesis awaited to
corresponding to the validity
against the historic data and then this
can be used for predicting the the this
is sick line corresponds to actual usage
and then the sceneline corresponded to
the forecasts that is made so if you
would like you can take a look at this
this is different so this is one of the
united states patent so they said these
are all projects i was working on in in
the reading the microsoft research so
now i would like to talk in more detail
about about graph more more graph
theoretical program and it in much more
detail so what time we have have you
started a little bit later or 40 minutes
30 30 mins okay yet so i'll talk in more
detail about the the inverse problems
for planar graphs so this is more graph
theoretical kind of problems so it's the
fall and motivation from this problem is
from non-intrusive test we are we going
to make certain measurements on the
boundary of the planar graph and try to
find out properties of that graph or i
will also talk about continuous case
when it's a dumb way in this weight and
the motivation is from medicine where
you can would like to make maybe only
measurements on the surface of the body
and to figure out what is inside and
also from oil and gas production
industry where people are looking at
electromagnetic fields and the boundary
of the Earth's and try to find where
what is inside but you can also see that
this problem very many problems in
mathematics and in graph theory can be
transferred to this so here is the
problem suppose we have a planar graph
we're playing our graph means that it
can be drawn without self intersections
then the very important the very
important matrix that represents the
planar graph is so-called Laplace matrix
or joy or joints jason c matrix so this
is going to be the following matrix if
there is no connection between two
vertices then we put zero so for example
one is not connected to 482 so there is
going to be 0 here and 0 here and one is
connected to three and five and then we
put minus conductivity we can think of
this graph also the electrical network
for example there are different models I
can you sir let me talk about it as
electrical network for example then
suppose you have conductivity here then
you put a minus conductivity in the if
there is a is there is a link between
two vertices so this is symmetric matrix
for example and then on the air gonna we
put some of the old conductivities so
gamma I one for example some over off
all conductivities this is so-called
Laplace matrix photograph so if what we
are what the problem is the fall and
easy fallen suppose we observe the
pattern of potentials and currents of
this graph at the boundary nodes and
boundary for example in this case can be
one two three and four what can we say
about the graph inside and usually
boundary is much smaller than the
interior so here i wrote i drew very
little boundary nodes but it can be
there can be a lot for example so this
seems to be a difficult problem because
because interior is usually much larger
than the boundary what can be said about
the graph from looking at potentials and
currents on the boundary of the graph or
equivalently observing the random walk
suppose we look at the random walk on
this graph this also related here also
this random work can be viewed as
looking at the web pages for example but
suppose you look at the departing end
in the probability at each particles
enter the graph then go through the
random walk according to the probability
probabilities proportional to the
conductivities and we look at where they
enter and exit this is equivalent to
looking at the potentials and currents
and the boundary of this nature and
they'll write an explicit formula in a
second so what can be said about the
graph so and then there is also
continuous analog of this problem if you
have a positive conductivity function
you can also apply potential at the
boundary and look at the current so all
boundary measurements can be very
efficiently put into this map we apply
potential at the boundary and we look
what currently results so what's what
what's happening when we apply potential
at the boundary there is going to be
potential inside and this matrix allows
very efficient very to write it very
efficiently so care Goff's law Gill
Garson domes law can be written away can
be written very efficiently in this case
the suppose we put a certain potential
at the boundary then the potential
insights let's call it u vector u user
by potential then the fact that the gig
of slow satisfied at the node I can be
written as mu ice coordinate equal to
zero the continuous analog here is the
following also if we apply potential f
at the boundary the continuous NLF is
the following gamma u sub X sub X gamma
u sub y sub y equal to 0 and this is a
Laplace separator and so this is where
the name for the Laplace matrix is so
let me let me write it now in more
explicit form what what is this what is
our data in
what we are looking for so we are
looking for the graph for the links and
also the conductivity what we are going
to measure and they are going to measure
potential and currents all potential and
currents can be can be recorded in the
one matrix and this is so called
deliciously to know a man where did
Ashley a data is potential moment map
Norman data is current so we can
explicitly calculate directly to gnomon
method actually have all the boundary
information that you are working it in
the following way so let's partition the
matrix M into blocks corresponding to
boundary nodes and interior nodes so
this weekend number for example boundary
nodes first and then interior node
second then matrix M has a block
structure ABCD suppose the apply
intensional you then there is a
potential on the boundary this is what
we are applying and then there is going
to be potential inside and due to the
character Ohm's law here we are going to
get zero and this is you because there
is a keurig of slow on the onslow
satisfied here and we are going to get
some current on the boundary so GD
tretinoin web that has all the
information about heating probabilities
of the random walk or it's a map from
potential to the current is the map from
F to G and this is a linear map we can
explicitly calculate it this matrix also
called it's called directly to normal
maps sometimes it's called response may
of how the object response to potential
responds we can explicitly calculate it
in discrete case so let's make a little
calculation what this block structure
tells us at AF plus bx equals G and C F
plus DX equal to zero so we can solve
for x x is d inverse C F and then we can
just see that g equals to a minus B G
inverse C F so this is the the lambda
directly to normal map and this is true
also in continuous case that this is a
permit from potential stir current is
the linear map and so it can be written
as f of theta if we parameterize the
boundary equals integral over the
boundary so g g of theta equals integral
over the boundary
so indeed in continuous case the yiddish
little normal map is represented by a
function of two variables that is a
kernel and this is continuous version of
a matrix so when they are working with
the huge graph is small links then the
more efficient then the model becomes
continuous and this is very important
for scalability questions for example so
given this so this is the project I
would like to talk in more detail now is
the following it's a connection between
continuous and discrete model and what
can be said about the graph from the
from this matrix and this matrix has all
the information about what you can say
about the graph not noted without
intrusion only on the boundary because
this is that all the measurements here
can be made only from the boundary and
we are trying to find what is inside so
how to find out what's what what can be
said about the graph well first maybe
you have seen this form somewhere before
this is in general true if you are
looking for the inverse of the matrix
and the matrix has the block form then
the block in the inverse has the same
similar form so in general suppose you
have a matrix a BCG we look at its
inverse X Y Z W so the inverse means
that this is identity identity 00 then
one can solve this in the
one can solve this system of equations
these blocks of the matrix CX Z equals
minus G inverse C and then x equals a
minus B G inverse C inverse so this is
another way to look at the deliciously
to Newman map it's this is if this is a
matrix M then this is inverse of this
matrix so this matrix that has all the
information about the random walk at the
boundary and potential to current map
has it's a block is it is is a block in
the inverse of the Laplace matrix so
what can be said about the graph well we
need one more identity this is called
sure complement of the matrix the short
complement of the matrix with respect to
block G this is called full complement
and it's sometimes called written as M
sure complement G so and there is
identity that connects the determinants
in the shore compliment it's the
following one suppose we look at the
matrix a b c g
I will prove it and right at the same
time d inverse zero then here you get
exactly the shore compliment so this is
the obvious identity and what it tells
us here is the short compliment this is
a DDT to Norman that this is the Laplace
matrix and so this since its diagonal
operator then determinant of this matrix
is just one over determinant of G so we
can see the determinant of the of M
divided by determinant of D and this is
also identity so determinant of this
matrix is exactly determinant of lambda
and this is true for any any entry order
block so once you know deliciously 291
web we know ratios of determinants in
the Laplace matrix and so what it tells
us this gives the first connection
between the matrix so we have two
different representations of the graph
as the graph and as a matrix and this
gives the first important connection
between the graph and the matrix is that
if you know directly to newman map we
know determinants of blocks in the
indlela plas matrix now this tell this
can be worked out to what graph
theoretical transfer my information can
be can this be transferred it turns out
then that what is the determinant of a
block and the matrix it's a sum of a
product of terms and each and how these
terms are constructed they we take one 1
entry from each column and each row this
is how determinant works and so if you
know a determinant in Laplace matrix
what can we say about the graph turns
out that
we can look at the nonzero terms in the
expansion for the day for the
determinant so you can take matrix
lambda look at certain set of rows and
columns these are just rose for example
in columns and this has to be equal this
is just 10 is the same so this is going
to be equal to sum of products and this
products are certain gamma IJ s with
certain weights and turns out that if we
can actually trace every to every
nonzero term in the determinant into a
path in the graph and this is where you
can see the random walk interpretation
is also very very convenient so suppose
you have a nonzero term since yet we can
just read from with the conductivities
that are not zero and if every nonzero
term is going to give us a disjoint path
in the graph because just join because
you exactly take always one and one
entry from each row and from each column
so this is going to be a sum over
disjoint paths from P to Q so here is a
small example suppose you have the
following graph just very small graph if
you look at it directly to Norman map
the determinant if we take columns 1 2
and Row 3 4 determinant is going to be 0
because there is no way to connect this
jointly one two and three four if you
look at the Jewish tretinoin webmatrix
and we look at Rose 23 and columns one
for then it will be non zero because
there is a disjoint path so this is a
first step in solving this so-called
inverse problem and usually for word
problems are pro
terms of solving equation and inverse
problems are problems of finding
equation from its solution so here the
forward problem is finding the matrix
from the graph G dash do to know a man
map and then the inverse problem is
finding the graph from the from the
directly to normal so what we can see
then that if you know deliciously
tournament we know all these joint
connections in the graph well there are
certain transformations of a graph and
these are transformations very similar
to rather Meister moves in the North
theory and also this is transformation
known as Y Delta for transformation in
electrical engineering they do not
change the connections in the graph
disjoint connections in the graph and
these are the following transformations
whenever in the graph we see the
following pattern whenever in the graph
you have a vertex of valence is three
you can replace it by a delta so this is
like why replaced by delta and the way
it should be recalculated in the
following way if this were a B and C
conductivities then the new
conductivities are a B divided by a plus
B plus C and here is going to be CB
divided by a plus B plus C by C and here
is a CA plus B plus C so this
transformation that it's very easy to
see that doesn't change this joint
connection of agri in the graph if there
are was just joined connection between
boundary nodes it still will be there
it's a very simple chair so this
transformation cannot be seen from the
digital normal map and then there are
other transformations that can be
obtained actually from this one by
setting ABC to zero or infinity suppose
we have some where a B then you can
replace it by one conductor a plus B
suppose you have two conductors in
series then we can replace it by one
conductor
suppose you have a just a conductor of
that is connected to only one no then it
can be ignored and the last one is
suppose you have a closed conductor then
this also can be removed so this is the
first result it turns out to be the
following that if you know directly to
Norman map of a planar graph then we
cannot find the graph up to these
transformations so first of the results
is actually this is an exact result if
you have two graphs that have the same
deliciously to Norman map then they can
be a transplant can be transformed into
another by sequence of these
transformations so graph can be found
from directly to Norman map up modular
these transformations I will show you a
little bit idea how this can be proved
and and the answer all other there are
other questions to ask suppose we know
the graph can we find the conductivities
so here we assume that we do not know
neither the graph no conductivities
suppose we know the graph can we find
conductivities so to answer this
question
there is a very important to give a
planar graph in the following way using
its so-called medial graph so I drew
graph here as links and edges but one
can introduce a medial graph of a planar
graph it's the following suppose we are
looking at set of curves on the plane
suppose you just have set of course on
the plane then this always divide the
plane into regions that can be colored
in HS like chess board like fashion so
we can color these these maybe I use a
black so there is more more more chest
like
and then whenever you saw whenever you
have set a fair arrangement of course
they divided the plane into regions and
then we can construct a planar graph
from it by putting a node in every for
example black region and then connecting
connection the denotes if there is a
common point between the regions this
way we can obtain the graph from
arrangement of curves and we actually
get two graphs the graph and it's dual
and dual graph would correspond to a
different choice if you chose white
regions to be our points so then we have
a graph and it's dual dual graph means
that every edges are talking out to an
edge of the original graph so it turns
out that every planar graph has a medial
graph associated to it and these
transformations look much simpler for
the medial graph the transformations
look the fall in the following way so if
you are making y delta transformations
and this and the this transformation
from electrical engineering then the
medial graph changes in the following
way whenever we have a loop like this it
can be removed whenever we have a lens
like this
it can be removed also and then Y Delta
transformation is the following suppose
we have a region looking like this then
we can move this above and get this
transformation so this must they
resemble the moves rather monster moves
in the North Sea area by these
transformations any arrangement of
curves can be can be changed into
arrangement of pseudo lines
and sue the lines are curves that occurs
at the same time they behave like lions
in the following way they have no no
self interceptions and they do not
intersect more than once and there are
no closed curves so turns out this
notion gives a answer to the second
question suppose we know the graph and
we would like to find out conductivities
from the DHT to Norman map then
conductivities can be found uniquely if
and only if the corresponding medial
graph is arrangement of sudah lines so
in this case if you know the medial
graph then we know the graph and
directed to normal maps gives us
conductivities and this also gives an
algorithm how to figure out the graph
itself so there is an identity
connecting the connection the
arrangement of sued alliance usages
joint connections
basically when you have arrangement of
sued alliance then we can look at how
far the physical jdx occurs in the in
the arrangement of course you can see
how far they go inside the graph and if
they return quickly it means that there
is no disjoint connection so it's not
very difficult to find out the the order
in which the DJ Isaacs and the seuda
line arrangements live and exit the
graph from these joint connections and
by the way i should say this is a
collaborative work is Professor Curtis
morrow from University of Washington and
from and this reu program are you summer
school program on the inverse problems
so the graph then can be figure out in
the following way this also gives the
delga written for finding the graph from
the diversity to normal map so if you
know directly to newman map we can find
these joint connections in the graph
from these joint connections we can find
the return E&amp;amp;G isaacs so the order in
which the X enter and exit from this you
can figure out the arrangement of sudah
lines and from sudahlah and arrangements
we can figure out the geodesics x y
delta transformations and from this we
know the medial graph and from that we
can find the graph itself so this is the
line so then there is important question
what given a matrix is it a directly to
newman web classification what are
possible matrices that arise in this
fashion from planar graphs and turns out
that the answer is also can be given in
terms of determinants whenever the
so a matrix is a DDT to Norman map of a
planar graph if it's symmetric has some
of the rows and columns 0 because if you
apply potential one there is no current
flow and so this matrix times constant
vector has to be zero and then all
determinants have to have particular
sign depending only on the only on its
size so whenever you have a matrix that
has a following sign of the determinants
in it then we can always construct a
graph then you can always construct the
graph whose this matrix will be directly
to Norman map so we can completely
classify the data would pour water
possible observations that can be made
the way the matrix is valid only if it
has all determinants from P and Q do not
interlace here
do not enter lace the same through the
same synth is true and this is
collaborative work is Professor morrow
from University of Washington is for
continuous case it turns out that the
same property is true for the function
of two variables that represents dearest
a tuna mmmm up in the continuous case
and there are four one can take the
continuous directly to Norman map look
at its restriction and construct a graph
to generate a grid so that it's directly
to Norman map is going to be exactly the
so the same the same determining if it's
lambda okay it's also going to be true
so what it tells us that restrictions of
new of continuous delish of kind of a of
continuous dearest written on maps i
discreetly discreetly normal maps so
this suggests the way how to construct
grass whose deliciously to normal maps
approximate the continuous one so for
example this is a this tells us how to
connect discrete and continuous problems
so how much time they have more i first
okay so just one more thing i would like
to show to say is there doha five
minutes okay so here is one more amazing
fact I just let would like to mention
there is an example of a deliciously to
Norman map in the case conductivity
equal to one then the dearest attunement
map can be explicitly calculated because
if you apply potential if you apply
potential f sine alpha k then the
corresponding potential inside you is
going to be our to the K sine alpha K
and then if you look at the current its
derivative of this function this is
going to be k sine alpha k so the in
this case it's very easy to write the
spectral decomposition and the of the
dish latino women map and this is a
complicated map its eigen functions are
sines and cosines and eigenvalues are k
the the frequencies what turns out that
what is the ovary the amazing amazing
fact that was noticed by Professor
Ullman from University of Washington is
the following that if you look at lambda
squared even though lambda is very
complicated non-local operator if we
change a little bit F somewhere on the
boundary the G current is going to be
changed everywhere if you look at its
square it turns out to be k squared sine
alpha K so this is just simply minus
second derivative of
of the of the function so this is an
amazing fat node this is an amazing fact
that such a complicated operator has a
very simple square and to understand the
connection between the continuous and
discrete case and this is collaborative
work with Vladimir drew skin from
schlumberger and Sergei shoigu reformers
flamby J and Shari Moscow from
University of Florida and landed news
nierman from center of geological in
expedition and Moscow is that the same
the same the same we were working on
connection between discrete and
continuous case it is possible to
construct this period graph that debt
has the same property that it's directed
to neural map as a complicated object at
the same time it's square is a simple
matrix of second differences 2-1 so
there is a discrete notion and that have
constructed to such graph just recently
just several weeks ago one infinite
graph and one final graph it just showed
that different kind of connection
between continuous and discrete case
that they say this one scene is just to
look at the approximations how they
differ at the same time is to check if
such a phenomenal is true in discrete
case and just to finish I wanted to say
more about the continued fractions so
I'll just I don't have time but to
understand the connection between
continuous and discrete case it turns
out to be very important to look at
continued fraction expansion of
functions and I'll just say one perfect
for example golden ratio is an example
of a number that has a very nice
continued fraction
so I don't have time to stay in more
detail by just in general the continued
fraction of a number as if is is
expression like this where a are
integers and for example all numbers
have exactly one continued fraction
expansion attraction expansions if they
are rational then the continued fraction
is finite if you look at at the
restriction of several floors in the
expansion then this give optimal
approximations and the optimal optimal
rational approximation of a number and
if a number is quadratic number then p
then continued fraction is periodic it's
the different as decimal expansions of
numbers where if number is the ration of
them it's periodic here it's if it's
quadratic number its periodic and so it
turns out that the connection between
discrete and continuous model is very
similar to the connection between number
and its continued fraction expansion I
don't have time to say in more detail
I'll just prove this identity why it's
true if you call this X then what's
happening if you take 1 / x + add 1 then
we get X again right so and there are 4
X has to satisfy a quadratic equation
so this give exponentially fast
approximations and this is this allowed
us to construct grids that give it
exponentially fast approximations of
discrete model on the continuous ones
