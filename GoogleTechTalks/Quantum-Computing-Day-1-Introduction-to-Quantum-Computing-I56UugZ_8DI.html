the three-part Tech Talk on quantum
computing as first it's about
introduction to quantum computing and
actually what I'm trying to do is to
take an unusual look at quantum
computing we want to take a look from
the vantage point of synthetic
intelligence essentially a notion I
would like to promote is the idea that
in order to create artificial
intelligence and by this I mean tasks
like pattern matching machine learning
has a lot to gain from employing quantum
computers actually what I would claim is
if you were to have a working quantum
computer of sufficient size on your
table today the business of doing and
saying machine vision learning algorithm
what entirely change and since this has
such dramatic effects you might want to
know ok do I have to bother or worry
about quantum computing before I retire
and here's another thing I would like to
get across working quantum computers we
may probably or may be only a few short
years out action the next talk we will
go as far as this computer here this
little app top has actually a MATLAB
program on it that ties via web service
and java web service into a quantum chip
that is admittedly still small but
despite of what you have maybe read in
the in blocks a popular press this is a
real quantum chips that exists today and
actually what we have done was it its
take the human level task object
recognition and build a pipeline a mix
of classical and quantum algorithms to
break this task down map it on to the
quantum chip and bring it all the way
back and I think this type of task will
I have the feeling that quantum
computing might be the missing link
because that brings true human level
intelligence to machines so it's that
the soul
there's an idea not very far-fetched
this so does the brain have anything to
do with quantum computing so actually
today the answer would be bluntly no
neurobiology is the current paradigm has
it that in order to understand higher
brain function or we need to look at is
an organizational level above the single
neuron and beyond
so essentially looking at neurons as
classical devices that cooperate or
compete with each other bringing about
the neuro dynamics that this is all you
need to understand higher cognitive
function but something I would like to
predict is that sort of pipeline of the
nature I have described before and our
increased understanding how we might
harness quantum processes to perform
meaningful computation this paradigm
might get challenged or is ripe for
review
so probably quantum computing will
inform our search for the quantum boxes
Johnny codes would call it okay so um
after this introduction to the
introduction let me jump to the first
part the basics of quantum mechanics
again Z the intended audience is
computer scientists and I realize it's a
tall order to bring the base concepts of
quantum mechanics across in less than an
hour which normally is taught within the
semester but let me drive first let's
look at a few phase experiments and I
kind of assumed that everybody of Nuno's
to various degrees about quantum
mechanics I'm sure you have seen
something on TV or read a book
you're an educated audience so first
thing an experiment from which which
actually shows a property of nature from
which quantum mechanics got its name the
so called Ashtanga experiment and how
this works and I try to use his mouse
instead of my hands you have a little
furnace out of which silver atoms come
and silver atoms have a magnetic moment
so you can think of it classically as a
little sort of compass needle
coming out of your furnace and of course
they are sort of randomly organized so
this is cloud of little compass needles
flowing out of your furnace and then
there's this big inhomogeneous magnet
that pulls and pushes on these magnets
depending on their orientation and then
what you would expect because it's
random some get pulled up some get
pushed down but it's essentially a
random mix so what you see here on a
classical prediction if you put a photo
plate behind it this elongated patch is
what you would expect to see now what
you really find is you only see two
patches so this is if you would have a
little compass would mean if you look at
it you will only two things compass
needle app or compass needle down so
this is contrary to our sort of
macroscopic experience and shows sort of
a first fundamental effect or effect
physical observables are quantized so
it's like money it comes sort of in the
smallest denominations as you one cent
of nature the tip is this one cent of
nature is typically denoted by H H bar Z
and Planck constant and this said
observables are quantized is true for
energy for angular momentum for many
important physical observables so first
fact but this effect has an important
impact on how we observe nature so let's
look at something that physicists do all
day long speed measurement essentially
you can sing of speed measurement in the
following way you have a little radar
gun here in my example and you shoot
little photons towards a car to measure
its speed so if you think about it
really those photons have momentum and
they push the car a little bit but you
would agree you will not get away with
the excuse saying hey officer you I
wasn't that past that make sure you
really pushed my car the reason you
won't get away with this excuse is
obviously the momentum of the photons is
so small that it doesn't really affect
the system under observation
but now assume we want to observe
something microscopic so the car gets
smaller and smaller
so and given that nature is quantized
I can not always or I do not always have
the luxury of having a probe fine enough
that it is much smaller than the system
an observation or a different way of
looking at it
if sort of your probes would get larger
and here in this example he would shoot
bowling balls at the car then obviously
this measurement will affect the state
of the system and this is in the
microscopic world generally true that
observation effects the state of the
system okay second important fact
certain part in fact he is sort of the
quintessential experiment in quantum
mechanics is the double slit experiment
I'm sure you have heard of it in various
ways the thing of it the following way
there's a light wave coming through the
first screen here a screen one and
spreads out think of it like a water
wave and I have thrown a stone into a
lake that was calm before so this wave
spreads out reaches the second screen
and then sort of two waves come out from
there so it's like throwing two stones
into a lake and we all know this effect
and sort of these waves interfere there
can be superimposed and you have
constructive destructive interference
and it creates an interference pattern
like shown here these black and white
stripes but now if you would take a
closer look
essentially again realized by a photo
plate and you look at this picture here
on the right side the ABC and we look we
gives a photon stream make it very weak
so that only one photon per time unit
comes through then we see a build-up
like this sort of you get little impacts
on the photo plate and essentially you
get this wavy pattern here so
essentially what we see if we take a
closer look that this wave pattern only
gives us a probability where we might
find the impact of a particle as is also
called a wave particle duality and you
can do this with photons meaning with
light or you can do the same thing with
electrons and again you can do
it even if only one electron at a time
goes through the slits so it interferes
with itself so the important lesson here
in superposition in a sort of a fancy
word of this wave-like behavior that you
can superimpose the states so
superposition again it worked for
electron and photons is a general
principle in nature
those three important facts so here
comes a big jump I don't want you to go
home without formula so the easy
philosophy of this talks will always be
give some intuitions and then jump to
the formulas and I cut out the middle
piece so here's pretty much all quantum
mechanics you kind of would ever need or
you can derive the rest from this one
single sheet so how does twenty
mechanics formulism describe nature
first if you describe a system you want
to know what its status so it's state is
here denoted by PI and these funny
brackets around sy and the signal so
called Dirac notation this is just a way
our quantum physicist you know the
vector subsides just a vector and the
funny thing around is the vector sign
and the state of the system lives in a
Herbert space Hilbert space essentially
for our purposes you can think of it as
a linear vector space with a scalar
product over it it's a complex vector
space and moreover via once it's norm of
the state vector is one and we will see
in a second why zeiss's okay now we know
what the state is in quantum mechanics
next thing you want to know how does my
state change so how the temporal
evolution turns here what for it comes
about is essentially in nonrelativistic
context through the so-called
Schrodinger equation you see the
Schrodinger equation is basically
differential equation that shows you the
changes the first servation according to
time so the change of your state
dependent on what see on the right side
and what's on the right side is called
an operator acting on the state and this
operators called the Hamiltonian so the
Hamiltonian essentially has
to do with the overall energy that's in
your system so depending on how much
energy is in your system and how its
structured spacial temporarily the state
will change in different ways and
actually there's a equivalent way of
writing it if you go here to the right
side essentially here the Hamiltonian is
put into evolution operator so basically
you have a state here
saya it's a time t0 then your evolution
operator thing has a black box you know
you push your state in at time T and
then you get the state at time T out of
there so state in temporal evolution now
it's important to see this is the
differential equation here was linear
the state space is linear so we have a
linear theory and this allows for an
important fact that in particular means
if I have two possible States
so I 1 and I 2 then any linear
combination for example likes I 1 plus I
2 is a solution as well yeah and so here
you see the superposition reflect
reflected so two states I can
superimpose them and again I have a
valid state now comes the third part how
do I measure the state and here in
classical mechanics you wouldn't find
much you know if there's a position of
the car you're sure it measures the
position of the car so there's the state
of the system and what you observe is
kind of the same thing but earlier in
the speed measurement example we
discussed that in quantum mechanics is
is more involved so in quantum mechanics
you describe and observable like energy
magnetic momentum through a matrix here
a an operator and this operator self
adjoint which basically means it allows
for a spectral decomposition into
eigenvalues of this nature said where
the eigenvalues m are the possible
measurement outcomes and because this
operator is self-adjoint it guarantees
that those measurement outcomes are
numbers remember everything before was
complex numbers and you don't really see
complex number observables in nature you
only see real numbers the fact that this
observable is described by self adjoint
operator insurances so basically and it
has a complete basis so the
eigenfunctions of a complete basis for
the hilbert space where the state lives
in so you can express any state in the
decomposition like this is some CI over
the different states so again as a large
linear company superposition of the
individual eigenstates of your operator
under consideration and then the
probability of finding a measurement
outcome it's essentially the modular
square of the coefficient in front of
the eigenstate where you find your
system ok this is called the born rule
and after the measurement your system
will be in state AI corresponding to
what you measured ok so that's maybe
there is the trickiest part to
understand observable corresponds to
self adjoint operator meaning and has a
set of real valued item values these are
the possible measurement outcomes and
essentially if you decompose a state the
way it's written here the born rule
gives you the probability of finding the
system in a certain state ok so the last
part that traditionally was not taught
as an important fact is how do you
compose to two quantum systems you have
one and you have a second but you can
imagine if you want to build a quantum
computers this what often happens that
it will be built or composed out of
subsystems so subsystem composition is
actually not that difficult you what you
do is you take two here but spaces h1
and h2 and you form the outer product of
those Hilbert spaces so this is now the
total space your system lives in and
then you can
in the simplest way take a state out of
one of those two spaces and like here
this fire and then you take a second
state out of the second system and you
build the outer product the tensor
product of these two vectors and you get
a new state these special states are
called separable States but again we can
build super positions we can put a sum
in front of such states and get what's
the so called entangled State so just in
case so here's sort of an important
off-ramp if you ever have heard about
the einstein-podolsky-rosen thought
experiment or about quantum
teleportation the ingredient you need to
do things like quantum teleportation are
entangled States and we are not going to
explain this today just sort of if you
study literature this is all of the off
ramp you have to get to you have to
understand what an entangled state it is
then you can proceed understanding what
quantum teleportation is okay so wow
this much may be a little bit too much
on this one sheet let's try to break it
down I think in the next slides it will
sort of I see a lot of shocked faces I
hope sort of applying this a little bit
will make something simpler so let's
look at a very simple situation let's
take what's called a potential well we
take a particle that's an electron and
we put it into a box and we don't want
to let it out and here's the classical
and analogue would be let's say you go
into a hall or let's say you have a
large bucket and you put a basketball in
there and it bounces around in such a
situation we want to look at so the
Schrodinger equation for this situation
is written up here and again you
recognize it here was is the Hamiltonian
we have to use in this and the
Hamiltonian was sort of associated with
the total energy of the system and you
might know if you have something like a
bouncing ball you have essentially two
types of energy kinetic energy how fast
this ball is flying around and such the
potential energy how high is it above
the ground so these two terms together
make up
the total energy of this particle so
here we have now differential equation
first lands for the non mental mutation
think so dammit looks difficult to solve
but from here on it's only mathematics
and it's a little bit simplified by the
fact that because the potential doesn't
change in time the Hamiltonian is time
independent and then this allows for a
solution that's down here where the main
thing I want you to look at is that this
solution is again a linear superposition
of these states Phi and Phi are the
eigenstates to the Hamiltonian so this
is how you can compose a general
solution for your Schrodinger equation
and here let's look at a special case
where our potential is sort of
infinitely large than what you see here
you know in your little box the wave
functions know the name for those
solutions for different eigenvalues E
and different amounts of energy your
particle can have sort of this how they
look you know yeah little bend it like a
parabola wavy sort of wave with shorter
wavelengths so these are solutions so
now more interesting let's go to a
situation where the box is not
infinitely high it's not an infinitely
deep well well
but it's only a finitely deep well this
is here shown on the right side so what
you see here is something very important
and we get a first sense of how this can
help us in computation you see that the
wave functions don't go down to zero
right away where the border of the
potential well is actually there is
still a finite probability of finding
your particle outside of the well and
this is called the tunnel effect so and
I could use it imagine it wouldn't have
been a well but just sort of a barrier
so essentially a potential well but was
a sin barrier since this particle could
escape there even though it doesn't have
enough energy to jump over the barrier
it goes through hence tunnel effect so
think of it here's this bus
denotes the situation classically if
this basketball if I throw it in if it
doesn't have enough kinetic energy
that's a point to jump over this wall it
will never get out of this potential
well so now for handles for computer
science everybody of you has worked
let's say with optimization problems we
know that getting stuck in a local
energy minimum as a major occurs
whenever you express your problem as an
energy optimization problem so I think
you will have a taste for the fact hey I
have a new mechanism here to get out of
a local minimum and that's indeed an
effect that we were harness for
computation actually adiabatic quantum
computers do basically this they help
you finding the global minimum and an
energy function by exploiting the tunnel
effect okay
so let's sort of go through this one
more time
again we have learned that a state of a
quantum system described at T 0 by a
state function Phi of T 0 and then we
have essentially two ways how the state
can change the first one is continuous
via unitary evolution or via the
Schrodinger equation sort of a
continuous change over time for of your
state and then some nasty physicist
comes along or any human and will do a
measurement and then oops
after this measurement sort of I
drastically disturbed my state and I
come out in this state a I one of the
possible measurement outcomes in my
measurement and then from there on if
nobody interferes again it will continue
to evolve again like an unitary
evolution via the Schrodinger equation
so that's basically what was on the
sheet sheet but as certain ugliness
versus you wonder when does measurement
occur shouldn't the measurement
instrument I mean this is a part of
reality too is it's a box with some
pointers and some iron and cables
shouldn't this obey quantum mechanics as
well and shouldn't it sort of follow and
unitary evolution allows reading our
equation also so what does really
constitute a moment where measurement
happens and as the original serve when
quantum mechanics came up the first
complete formulation the Kuppam hardin
formulation of quantum mechanics
unfortunately failed to give a clear
definition of what is a measurement and
this and at least in two cases you can
imagine that this yields problematic or
paradoxical results one is a closed
system so you have a box and you have
some things in there like let's say
decaying nucleus and a cat and we saw
that when the state evolves actually we
didn't show this but see the Schrodinger
equation sort of like superposition so
it takes a clean state and sort of
spreads it out and then create those
super positions we saw about so what
does this then exactly mean for a cat
when it's in a superimposed state in
particular if you just think of it as a
cat that it's life or death so I'm sure
you have heard about Susie Schrodinger
paradox in this situation essentially a
cat in the box and no observer involved
and this essentially has to do with the
fact that we don't have a clear
prescription of what a measurement is
and this leads us to and there's a key
question when it comes to interpreting
quantum mechanics what constitutes a
measurement and again in 1927 when the
cop mahogany interpretation was
formulated again it unfortunately failed
to give a clear definition what is a
measurement so in 32 phenomen came and
said you know what i do it much cleaner
I also treat the measurement apparatus
as a quantum mechanical object and I use
only quantum mechanics to describe
the whole thing and to end just an share
of my state I have my measurement device
and I have sort of an observer that
looks at it and then I analyze it in
those terms and essentially what you see
and you have a state here in a
superposition in the general situation
then you bring it in contact
please remember system composition you
bring it in contact with the measurement
apparatus here in that state ready and
you're also bringing in contact with an
observer again stayed ready and now
here's this little arrow arrow
essentially denotes Schrodinger
evolution again then what will happen
what the Schrodinger equation does it
will bring about it's like a zipper any
things that the state touches goes into
a superposition as well so as soon as it
as the system we want to observe which
is in a superposition gets in contact
with the measurement device causes the
measurement device to go into a
superposition as well
and then even worse if the observer
looks at it it will go into the
superposition as well so this is
contrary to our everyday experience
let's say here's this water bottle seems
to be only at one position it's not in a
superposition of multiple states and we
rarely see somebody in the superposition
between life and death so essentially
the fun Norman program depending on how
you look at it failed essentially the
way out that phenomenon suggested is to
say the final wave function collapse so
that you get sharp real States
measurement outcomes as we experience
them this only occurs this final
measurement occurs in the observers mind
and I just so what happened at that
point is that essentially the observers
mind becomes a primitive notions that is
foundational to constructing physical
reality and I'm just mentioning this
this was 32 so phenomena is not a new
age kind of guy he was a very I mean you
probably familiar with his
what I want to point out is that quantum
mechanics by its very nature it's very
suggestive of bringing or giving the
observer special status and this will of
course be very important in the search
torque when we look at the brain and
quantum mechanics so the last way to
deal with what constitutes a measurement
and a very radical one but one that's
very popular among people who do quantum
computing it's you ever it's many-worlds
interpretation so what he essentially
said it's essentially very beautiful and
very symmetric idea of it is how you
know what it's not only one measurement
that comes out if there are thousand
possibilities all possibilities will
occur eventually just they happen in
different parallel universes in
different classical universes so in this
notion to give you a feeling for this I
tried to use this time proven allegory
of plateau where Plato discusses human
perceptual abilities in a situation
where you have a fire and prisoners in
the cave only watch sort of
two-dimensional projections of really a
three-dimensional world and he discusses
their limitations and how what really
picture of reality that would construct
so in the many worlds or maybe better
called many Minds interpretation is a
similar situation the wavefunctions eye
is this enormous lehigh dimensional
beast and what we see and this is a sort
of reality however what we perceive as
reality are low dimensional projections
so essentially our classical world as we
see it in this view would be only a tiny
sliver of a much richer reality and so
this is the many world many Minds
interpretation which from an
epistemological or sort of an internal
consistency view if it is correct that
quantum mechanics is a linear theory
since this is probably the cleanest
interpretation of quantum mechanics okay
so these were the basics of quantum
mechanics so you can take 10 seconds
breathing and we go now to 20 computing
how can we use this now to build better
mousetraps for our trade let's quickly
review classical computing I don't have
I think this audience doesn't need any
explanation what a Turing machine is as
a model for computing and you probably
know that any Turing computable function
can essentially be brought into a form
where you have a function f that goes
from a binary in n-dimensional binary
space to an M dimensional binary space
and basically or you have the option for
a physical logical realization there's
those gates like n Gates or gates not
gates and basically a program on its
lowest level can be broken down as you
have a bunch of zeros and ones and then
you push those through a set of gates
and at the output side you essentially
here and the space and the n-dimensional
binary space you look at your result and
you also know that I don't really need
all those gates subsets are enough to
construct everything like for example if
an out gate and the NAND gate is a
universal set of gates so this is pretty
much all you need to represent any
Turing computable function so this is
essentially the gate model using logical
gates for classical computation now
let's look how this looks in quantum
computing actually very similar you
start with a state here and denoted 1 0
0 this is actually a my simplified from
nouns in notation I had explained what a
composed system is using this tensor
product symbol sometimes leave it out
and just concatenate the individual
vectors like this or just write the
vector like this so these are all sort
of just different ways of notation
so the main story here is you start with
a state and you push it into a gate
actually in quantum mechanics the way to
sing of a gate
it's just Schrodinger equation doing its
job for let's say a fraction of a second
again or as a way of saying it you have
an evolution operator that acts for
finite time on this state and then you
get some result a very analogous way to
classical computation but now comes to
the trick let's replace this state by a
superposition state and if I had let's
say it's three qubits acting here you
can say use a state like this and push
it through the gate and the gate doesn't
care the gate again is represented by a
unitary operator that it doesn't care
was I've got just sort of a single basis
state or a superposition state like this
it will do its same job and that's cool
so with one gate operation I can act on
all these guys with one clock cycle hey
I need to do this more so you go make a
more radical superposition and you
realize it if you had sort of in binary
notation and digits then the number of
basis states that you have available
grows as 2 to the power of n in one
clock cycle you can act on 2 to the n
phaser States now it's fun as I think
obvious that you can expect some
computational gains from this
unfortunately superposition states as
you make them larger they're fragile
that they tend to break this is one of
the engineering challenges and we will
discusses in the next talk how to keep
this decaying of superposition States at
bay we are still in the intuition phase
a different way of understanding the
power of quantum computers as follows
and I mentioned it earlier you know that
many problems can be expressed as
finding
sort of the minimum in some objective
function you know or if the in the
physics context if this would be some
energy landscape I want to find the
minimum point and again doing this
nozzle isn't computationally expensive
proposition and doing this with
classical methods like you're probably
familiar with gradient descent simulated
annealing or genetic algorithms that
essentially all flavors of gradient
descent and they're all bound in some
way or the other to get stuck in a local
minimum so this is fundamental
limitation but remember the tunneling
effect this can help us in certain
conditions to get out of this local
minimum and find the deepest in some
ways the quantum mechanical particle can
see if you want to allow this metaphor
where the lower status and has there you
have in a gradient descent approach it
essentially gets as Quentin boosts that
comes from tunneling and and this is the
second model of quantum computing
there was a gate model we looked at
earlier and as he could adiabatic
quantum computing principle watching I
would show action the second stalks are
equivalent at the abetik quantum
computing zuv thinking about quantum
computing in this picture and see gate
picture we looked at before those I
equivalent and the abetik means slow and
were the next talk will be extensively
about adiabatic quantum computing so who
will explain this why is the term slow
enters there a last intuition and I
actually wanted to take the slide out
initially take it with a grain of salt
but still I I find it's a powerful
metaphor that's not too wrong let's put
it like this if you again you know that
many problems can be posed and forms of
the decision tree and if you are sort of
a person confronted with decision so you
have a classic classical particle then
finding let's say were the longest
branches in your
Sisson tree the way how you go you go
down one branch and check its lengths
and then you go back and you take the
next branch branch down and we have all
these different algorithms how to do
this in a smart way but at the end of
the day you have to always try one
branch and come back a quantum
mechanical particle again by virtue of
exploiting superpositions has a much
easier time sort of grasping all
possible states the system can be in and
sort of explore this decision tree in a
much more economic way so this again it
was a grain of salt but I gave you the
twofer into first intuitions were exact
and this is sort of a little bit
metaphorically speaking so now again
jump into the calculus let's first
introduce is a qubit which the name
suggests it's a quantum bit it's the
quantum generalization of a bit and the
like sort of the bit in classical
computation it's a simple two-level
system you can think of essentially it
we are in a Hilbert space that is
isomorphic meaning it looks like C to C
being the complex numbers so basically I
have two states here denoted as 0 &amp;amp; 1
these are two linearly independent
states and again you have heard again
superposition superposition
superposition we can have a general
States I using a general linear
superposition of these two base vectors
and then what you heard earlier also was
that a state vector needs to be
normalized meaning the norm of this
vector which is shown here needs to be 1
actually I still always explanation why
this is you heard me talking several
times about the bond rule and how
quantum mechanics the calculus
essentially doesn't tell you exactly
what the outcome is in general it only
gives you probabilities but in order to
properly speak about probabilities and
have a probability calculus this needs
to be normed there hands sort of quantum
mechanical States need to be normalized
so that probability interpretation makes
sense
No and then there's one more thing so
actually when you look at the state you
would say okay my quantum bit basically
is described by a complex number alpha
and the complex number better and you
know each complex number can be
represented with two real numbers they
would say okay I get this qubit is
essentially equivalent to four real
numbers not quite again we had already
one knocked out this equation here takes
one of the four out and there's actually
a second one that goes out and you can
also understand why as we said earlier
our measurement results always model
square of the coefficients in front of a
state so essentially a phase factor
whose modulus square is one just makes
it to be multiplied by 1 so it has no
physical meaning in the sense that
wouldn't change your measurement
outcomes so you can take any quantum
state and multiply it by a phase factor
of this form and your measurement
predictions that's all what quantum
mechanics does gives you measurement
predictions wouldn't change so actually
there's a second parameter that goes
down the drain so once I realized this
we can essentially Express by doing some
little massaging and expressing is a
complex numbers by angles and you see
that a general state such a general
qubits I can be represented like this
with two angles theta and Phi and
essentially a qubit hence can be
visualized as a unit vector moving on a
sphere and the sphere is called the
Bloch sphere so maybe another thing to
take away from here is that a qubit sort
of is not an analogue nor a digital
saying it's something in between before
its measured sea state itself is
obviously an analogue entity but then I
measure it I will only get two outcomes
it's in state 0 or 1 which is eminently
digital
so this is something beyond digital or
analog it's not either/or it has
properties of both so going to the
general gate model of quantum computing
I think you can already imagine how this
goes again varies we looked at it
already it's just sort of repeat
essentially how it works you have a you
prepare your state with let's say you
have a bunch of qubits here so it's
precise in this of qubits then you have
gates single qubit gates or multi qubit
gates again these are little evolution
operators acting for some finite time
and they massage your qubits into some
final state of your qubit and then you
measure it and hopefully you'll get the
result you were looking for
so now let's sum and one more time three
steps for a quantum computer first
prepare your quantum computer in a
well-defined state like let's say zero
zero zero and a bunch of qubits then
manipulate this state using unitary
transformations and it will lead to some
final state so I F and then you measure
the state F and read out the result
that's how quantum computer works so now
let's see what your kind of probably
waiting for show us that the quantum
computer does something more powerful
than a classical computer so the first
algorithm to illustrates is the so
called or adagios our algorithm and it's
a very artificial example it doesn't do
anything beyond showing actually
historically it was the first example
where it could show that quantum
computer does something faster with less
clock cycles then classical computer so
the problem was as follows you have a
so-called function f that goes from 0 1
to 0 1 this function happens to be
called an Oracle so you have the Oracle
function f and essentially here's a
little table that shows there are only 4
possible functions if you give it a
binary variable X which can be 0 or 1
then this Oracle function here for
realizations of it two of
as a function is constant so whether the
input is X or one its output a zero and
here F 0 and F 3 are constant oracles
and F 1 and F 2 and not constant no in
this context called balanced so think
about it classically how many runs of
the Oracle would you have to do in order
to find out whether your functions
constant or balanced for that's actually
only only to know you apply your Oracle
to 0 and you apply Oracle to 1 and then
you can see which of the four functions
it is so classically two runs but now
shows that it was a quantum algorithm we
cannot do it was only one run and this
works as follows
here's our gate model we prepare two
qubits one in state 0 and 1 in state 1
and we have some gates here two types of
gates one is called a Haram our gate and
one is cause they're always the Oracle
gate and they bring those qubits into
new states actually we will ignore even
what's happening down here we are only
interested in what happened to the first
qubit here and then we will measure it
and even though we present these two
qubits only once we go through this
algorithm only once we nevertheless get
to know whether F the Oracle is balanced
or constant and that will shows us here
so first I have to explain you what's a
hardiman's oracle gators again those are
just unitary operators acting on qubits
so essentially here Z you see how the
harem agate acts on a state 0 basically
these guys produce super positions it
takes 0 and brings it over to 0 plus 1
and if you had a my gate X on a state 1
then you get a superposition 0 minus 1
so we create superposition and you saw
earlier that it's helpful to have super
positions because you push one
superimpose States through your gate and
the eight gates act on our basis States
and then there's the oracle gate
which you see we have put CF in there so
essentially the Oracle the gay takes the
qubit X Y and brings it over to X and G
on the right side you have Y X or F X so
if you verify it's Oracle gate again is
a unitary operator and we are not
concerned at this point how we can
physically realize it it's just as
humans because it's a unitary operator
there's some physical realization for it
whether it's easy or not different story
so now let's run it we start with 0 1 we
say this earlier it's Chen so the harm
our gates act on our state 0 1 and
produce this state then the Oracle gate
acts on those and you can just punch in
those formulas and you see you get this
unwieldy expression here then I massaged
this a little bit and then I get this
expression here sorry like here you see
where the mouse is moving and then we
ignore this portion here we only look at
the first qubit which is in this
superposition state actually pull this
out piece here and then we apply a harem
a gate one more time and then we get the
state that's down here it's a state for
the first qubit it's a superposition of
0 and 1 which is here in the last line
and now if you take a closer look you
see in the exponent F of the value 0 X
or F of the value 1 and this XOR
operation if you go what's back here if
you look at the truth table this XOR can
only be will be 0 for the constant
functions and will be 1 for the balance
functions and then if you plug this in
here you see that if it's constant then
it's 0 and then essentially the second
term here disappears and the output of
my first qubit will be 0 and if the
function is balanced then this you can
itself out and you get as a result one
so it's either zero or one depending on
whether the function is balanced or not
and again we have done this but only a
single run it's not necessarily
important it's a guinea-pig
problem it's just an illustrative yeah
it's just how the problem is posed as I
said it's artificial very simple problem
has no application so probably what
you're saying now our Hoffman is doing a
poor job here this is Jesus I I mean I
kind of get it we used unitary functions
and we go just work off the calculus and
we get a result and that's really
intuitively I don't quite get this
actually this is this part of the lesson
the lesson is that the gate model of
quantum computing I personally also
don't find terribly intuitive and
inventing new algorithms in this
framework is not all that easy
however in the next lesson again we will
talk about adiabatic quantum computing
which has a much nicer geometric meaning
it's much easier to design algorithm
it's a question of taste I think for
people who have a good algebraic mind
they will come up with good algorithms
in this world not sort of it is using
the gate model is tricky and there are
only a few known algorithms that do
something useful in the gate model might
have to do was the fact that it's a bit
unwieldy only a few minutes left will
rush through the next example which is
quantum search and again posing the
problem it's very similar again we have
an Oracle function f but right now it's
from the binary space n-dimensional
binary space to 0 &amp;amp; 1 essentially what
this function does it marks one item in
the input space let's call this item X 0
and it marks it as 1 and it's this
function 0 for our other input possible
input values and the goal is to find X 0
so that's already more meaningful a
quantum search and we will just study a
very simple
case where we assume that n is 2 so
finding one item marked out of 4 this is
what we would like to do and in order to
calculate it I assume that C marked item
is this is 1 0 the binary number 1 0
okay so finding one marked item out of
the number is Quentin search and it's so
it's called solve this is so-called
growver algorithm again you have here's
this gate model where you have Harmar
gates you have this Oracle gate again
you know these guys already and then
there's this ugly Big D gate in there
and if you look closer it gets even
uglier but it does something very simple
so we will look at this in a second
again think about it classically if you
want to find one marked item in n then
basically you have not any the best
algorithm you cannot come up with will
be of Big O and so basically you have to
look at all your items with the quantum
algorithm you can do this in square root
of n and again as the proof of this all
it needs is you construct an Oracle Gate
where again you put your function f in
there and then you prepare your state in
an initial state like 0 0 1 and then we
will go through this now only in a
superficial way we apply the haram our
gates that generate a superposition then
I evaluate my function by using the
oracle gate and then I get a result here
sorry in the before last line this one
here and you see what this did already
out of the for States remember I had
assumed that F marks a state 1 0 you can
see after those massages the state 1 0
is marked with a - oh I have marked it
already but unfortunately I haven't
marked it good enough because minus 1
again modulus square if you measure it
is the same as 1 so I cannot really
discriminate -
one from one here as a prefactor so
what's this ugly big beastie here does
is nothing but essentially changing the
phase factor into an amplitude and what
if you apply D what you get as a result
is the end result one zero okay and
again what you can show for larger and
this algorithm finds a marked item out
of n with Big O square root of n okay so
here's the last slide which is another
famous quantum algorithm Shor's
algorithm is actually the crowning
achievement so far and what choice
algorithm does it finds the prime
factors in a composite integer and you
have maybe read in the press about it
this is important because if you can do
this well many cryptography codes
actually based on the fact that it's
hard to find the prime factors in a
large integer and the best known
classical algorithm if you have a number
n is actually exponential in Lock n
neurons this more complex expression and
Shor's algorithm does the same thing
getting rid of the exponential so it's
essentially an exponential speed-up over
what you can achieve classically and
rather than going against through a
lengthy how this works maybe let's
conclude with what's today believed it's
not proven but it's believed that this
is sort of how the complexity classes
relate you're probably familiar with the
class NP which is essentially the
complexity class of problems which I can
verify not solved but verify in
polynomial time and this class and P has
of course a subclass these are the
problems I can solve in polynomial time
and then there's easy nasty bitches the
np-complete problems these are sort of
the hardest problems in the space they
are essentially characterized by the
fact that any other problem in NP can be
met in polynomial time on to NP and then
this whole thing is embedded in P space
is a complexity class for all algorithms
that have polynomial space requirements
and then here's what we care for bqp
bounded error Quentin polynomial so
these guys and here's factorizing so
essentially this class him is probably
it's believed to be larger than P but it
doesn't necessarily cover NP and that's
also a lot of the controversy and some
of the misunderstandings so you cannot
say is that a quantum computer solves
np-complete problems and so this is the
overall lay of the land see summarizing
the computational gains you get from a
quantum computer over a classical
computer ok that was it for the first
session you might have seen I I realized
again in one hour cramming all this
material in this is tough to follow but
there's a lot of literature on quantum
computing you can see in the torque
announcements there's a list on fish you
can link to this and maybe I finished
with a shameless plug what we are going
to do next time the next time we will
show the image argue recognition
algorithms we have realized on an
adiabatic quantum computer and the main
topics will be D coherence theory this
essentially deals with how do
superposition States you have seen
superposition states were so crucial but
unfortunately they are fragile so
decoherence is essentially the process
of the superposition state breaking
apart so we need to understand this and
if you want to build on quantum
computers then you asked earlier we will
look at the adiabatic quantum computing
principle more then we will look at a
special or Hardware implementation of
this done by d-wave and actually next
week I will be joined by Jordi Rose who
is the CTO of d-wave and who has built
this first adiabatic quantum computing
chip and then we will show how we did
image matching using this chip and then
I want
to conclude with some implications it
has for machine learning and I want I
haven't solved it yet but I want to
entice you looking at some machine
learning problems that I think we should
map onto a quantum computer because
that's what you do Jane's for this field
