Jessica Tod Harper and I'm here to talk
about my recent book anterior exposure
I'm a photographer the book is a
collection of photographs and it
features portraits of families chiefly
my own family and so this talk is about
how I ended up with the present body of
work that I have today and how I started
using my family and other people's
families as well as inspiration for my
artwork I mean obviously we all
photograph our families and I take
snapshots of my kids and and my other
family members but I also use the camera
in a less conventional fashion and here
I'm starting with an image that I made
when I was about 17 years old this is a
family portrait with my father in the
center and it even includes a
self-portrait the the adolescent they
are fading into the window and the most
left side is me and and I always enjoyed
this picture because I think that's kind
of an appropriately self-conscious
stance for 17 year olds you can see I
had some younger cousins who really
didn't want to be part of the portrait
so this one here on the right hand side
is has his back to the camera because he
didn't want to be a part of it and my
family is staying very still it's a long
exposure this is black and white film
it's probably about two seconds long and
it's shot into the light so that's what
gives it this grainy kind of scratchy
feel and I like that in retrospect
because it says a lot about the the way
that memory works we remember some
details but not all of them and there
isn't a lot of specificity in terms of
the details of this picture but you have
a general sense to other things that I
like about this picture in retrospect
are the mirror behind us and also the
the photograph there in the upper corner
which
Frances another time completely from the
early 1900's so I photographed to my
family a lot when I was a teenager this
is my sister Becky who you'll see a lot
in years to come and my father
well my parents again with my younger
sister running off in the background and
again this is my my sister and our
cousin Sybil you might notice this
picture looks a little funny it's
photographed with infrared film infrared
photographs slightly below the surface
of the skin I remember two of my
teachers in high school when they
discovered this they commissioned me to
do a portrait of them they were in their
late 50s and they said you know slightly
below the skin that means no wrinkles
right so they had these really wacky
infrared portraits of themselves on
their mantle I went through a stage
where I was kind of addicted to it it's
insta cool right I mean it makes
everything look neat and different and
it's kind of hard to walk away from that
once you discover something that you
know you don't have to necessarily make
really great pictures it just makes them
really interesting for you one of my
main influences back again when I was in
high school is an artist called Sally
man maybe some of you might have heard
of any of you who were around in the 90s
I know this is a pretty young crowd
in the early 90s she became pretty
famous for a collection of work called
immediate family and in this she
photographed terror young children they
were often naked like her daughter Jesse
there in the foreground and they assumed
kind of adult personas so here then this
child is 6 years old but the way that
she's standing and her confrontation
with the viewer is a very adult presence
she has an ownership of the space that
has gives her a sense of authority even
though she's a small child and that's
something that I was really interested
in even if I wasn't very conscious of it
as a teenager this is a portrait I did
of my cousin at the same time if she's a
kid but she has this kind of authority
this sense of ownership of the space
another big influence was a photographer
called Julia Margaret Cameron for those
of you who aren't 25 this is always a
nice story of inspiration she was given
her first camera on her 51st birthday
and she's arguably the most famous
photographer of the 19th century she was
British and she had her servants pose
for her a lot she was part of the
aristocracy so they were just you know
they're as as subjects you know whether
they wanted to be or not but she had
some really great looking servants and
this is one of them and this this sense
of kind of otherworldly mythology that
she brought to her pictures was very
different for the time the camera in the
19th century was seen as this
interesting scientific discovery you
could document landscapes you could
document you could inventory your vase
collection and you could have like an
insta very small portable copy of that I
mean he or she was using photography to
try to make it look like art this looks
a lot like the pre-raphaelites paintings
of the day and this is a portrait that I
did of my sister now I mean I'm putting
these together 15 years later I don't
think that at the time I I know I was
thinking consciously about my influences
but I know that these things kind of sit
in your in your brain and they come out
when I went to college I continued to
photograph the people around me and they
weren't any longer my family it was the
people who lived in the dorms with me so
this is before a dance at various stages
of readiness as you can see these are
all freshmen a little nervous and maybe
a little grumpy about all having blind
dates for a dance this is a
self-portrait
with a college boyfriend and this is my
family again this was in the summertime
and in here you'll notice that some of
the figures are moving this is a very
long exposure I like to use natural
available light I don't use flash and so
most the time when you're indoors in
order to afford enough light you have to
keep the shutter open for a really long
time so people move and one of the
things that I like about that feature is
that the people who don't move become
all that much more important to the
composition so when the main important
person in this picture is my
Cybil who's there in the middle and so
the focus is her is even though she's
among this kind of public space with
other people moving around it's also a
private picture because it really
focuses on her and and her interior
world as you have you know life moving
about around her and I also one of the
things I really like about about
photographing people in their homes is
all the debris of domestic life and you
have kind of crumpled up napkins and the
flowers are falling and there's there's
petals and kind of mess on the table and
and then there's all that stuff in the
background to look at and and I guess
being kind of a naturally nosy curious
person I like the voyeuristic aspect of
those pictures this is in Arizona this
is a dude ranch where my family is
vacation for a long time and this family
here that's in the middle of the picture
also vacations there
she's a very powerful New York magazine
photo editor and this is an 11 second
long exposure so it tells you I didn't
tell her I was I was photographing her
so just the fact that she's in focus
just tells you how in her own mind she
is and she was completely still for 11
seconds while everyone else in this
dining room area was busy getting their
food and talking and moving and so I
really liked the sense of privacy that
this picture had even though it's in a
public space you're very focused on the
interior world of this individual when I
went to graduate school I started
working with my grandparents a lot all
four grandparents were in Rochester New
York and that's where I chose to go to
RIT for my graduate work and my
grandmother at the time had severe
Alzheimer's and she was losing her sense
of identity and who I was sometimes but
she was very often reminded of of who
she was and who her family members were
by context so being at home with things
that she remembered if she touched
things and handled things and that would
kind of help her to to get a handle on
on present reality and I started making
these pictures with
her and me together so this is that's
the two of us in that mirror and then
it's we're surrounded by all these
photographs from the past this is my
grandfather's dressing table mirror so
my grandmother is is in the mirror as
this old woman but she's also there as a
12 year old girl and as a new
grandmother holding me when I was a baby
as a bride and so there are these
different aspects of these different
phases of our life
this picture was actually used to
illustrate a story in Newsweek about
Alzheimer's this is another portrait
from that time my grandfather on the
other side now I know you guys having
this reputation for being really techie
I and I know I'm an artist and this is
an artist talk but I'm gonna try to
explain all the techie stuff that I can
cram in here so I'm gonna show you the
first picture I ever made a digital
compilation from and this was in during
this time when I'm working with my
grandmother so I made this portrait of
her this is film is photographed with a
Hasselblad and then I took this picture
of her her mother's childhood home and I
and I put her in it I mean I know this
isn't you know beautiful it's not in my
book but this just is an example of the
first thing I did and so I cloned the
the nightgown so that it went down
longer and then I inserted my sister in
the background there under the tree and
she acts as this kind of witness to this
event that's happening and the way that
my grandmother is is kind of off kilter
she doesn't look naturally in that
position I mean a it's because of my
poor Photoshop technique but be it also
goes along with this theme of her not
being kind of being haunted by memories
not at home in in her world and and then
having this third-person kind of looking
at us adds to a it adds a layer of
self-consciousness to the whole
experience the the fact that we're
looking at this is being witnessed by
somebody who's looking at us I'm not the
first one to use this technique in the
19th century this is a painter called
man
and he would use this this witness
character sometimes in his paintings so
here you have this portrait of this
young man in the front he's the best lit
tease and mostly the center of the
composition so it would seem that he was
the central character of this image but
the servant in the background is looking
at us and so it adds this layer of
self-consciousness to us looking at the
picture and it's this very provocative
interesting compositional tool this is
another image I made of my grandmother
who's off on the side there and having
her blurry and off to the side is
significant because she is so frail with
with her mind and her mother is is
depicted above her in the painting and
then her granddaughter my cousin is next
to her they all have the same name
I liked this picture but I found I liked
this one better my sister again is
acting as this kind of witness character
she's watching the relationship that's
happening between this this triangle
composition of these three women named
Sybil I like I like the juxtaposition
also of having my blurry grandmother
this very young but but dead
great-grandmother there and then this
very alive and focused younger version
the youngest Sybil in this composition
my sister kind of often me mmm is put in
this role in in compositions of my
family this is my grunt grandmother on
the other side and she's with her
daughter and then her granddaughter my
sister and having her bracketed on both
sides by these two generations that are
younger than her is also visually
reinforced by the way that my sister's
body see is visually connected to the
body of my grandmother and then you go
up her shoulder and across her across
where her neck is and then you follow
her arm to the other side and it's
connected to the chair on which my aunt
is sitting so even though these women
are very much in their individual spaces
they're also visually connected and that
references the
the blood connection to this picture is
of my aunt and uncle it's just from last
year but my sister you'll see is peeking
out from behind the flowers there so
there are four people there four
characters in this picture then the
principal actors are my aunt and uncle
but there's the dog this a French
Bulldog gremlin-looking thing there
that's the black thing on my uncle's lap
and then my sister is kind of watching
you from the flowers so it's just a it's
a bit of a surprise and a lot of times
in my pictures the title is very
important because you don't necessarily
know what you're looking at until you
read the title this is another early
experiment with digital manipulation
this is the original picture if my
sister is about 18 years old here and my
father's doing some work of some sort
and she's kind of curled up there in
front of him and I I was thinking at the
time about the the story of Pygmalion so
this is a nineteenth-century painting
that shows the the story it's an artist
who falls in love with his sculpture and
the sculpture turns comes into life it
becomes real becomes a real woman this
is another creation story the one that
you might be more familiar with it's God
creating Eve out of Adam's rib and so
this this scene you see a lot i canta
graphically throughout the history of
art this nude woman kind of emerging
fully born as this adult from a
reclining figure so I took this other
picture of my sister
infrared again because I still hadn't
gotten rid of that addiction at that
point this is black and white infrared
and I added color to it and and changed
the the color balance and I put the
shadow in in the background and so I had
this this kind of metaphorical picture
of it's kind of a coming-of-age portrait
this you know woman being fully you know
emerging fully grown
from a reclining figure so it's a little
bit about her being on the cusp of
childhood I'm kind of nestled in the
parental embrace but also you know being
on the cusp of adulthood too so but you
know it's funny when you take these
pictures to critics you have all these
ideas and intentions and that's great
but and people see what they will and as
an artist you really have to let go of
your pictures and let people see what
they will but I remember a couple
critics looking at this and portfolio
reviews and saying oh this is an
analysis about her weight problems right
you know cuz she's on a scale I hadn't
even thought of that I mean it was just
completely incidental yeah so you never
know what people are gonna see another
one of my heroes this is Yann Van Eyck
he's that paint chair in the 16th
century Northern Renaissance so it it's
interesting you look at the Renaissance
in the north it's very different from
say the Italian Renaissance and they
really painted action we had blood we
had gore where there's wonderful
biblical stories and historical myths
there there's a lot going on and in the
North there they're painting these
portraits of very stern looking people
kind of turned to the side using natural
light and interiors and and there's
really nothing going on except what's
going on inside these are kind of more
psychological interior studies and I was
an art history major as an undergrad and
these northern European painters became
a really big influence um
this is another painter sofonisba
anguissola as her her name will betray
she is Italian but she paints in this
style and and you'll see also that again
you have this kind of physical reserve
the way the body is turned slightly away
from the viewer and even the child here
it has that same physical presence
another painter you might recognize
Vermeer made these wonderful domestic
portraits again we're not talking about
mythology or important historical events
he just made pictures of people in their
homes and he often had these these
curtains they are off to the side so you
have all that much more of a sense that
you're walking into a private moment
you're being a voyeur
and then you know you have all the
details of their life there in the
background so you can go and think about
their painting and and the piano there
and you know what their life might be
like this this is a photograph of mine
and these are our family and friends who
are just trying on dresses but again
that that the way that the body is kind
of slightly turned away from the viewer
you have a sense of of privacy being
conveyed there and again in this picture
this was at a cocktail party and um
Pittsburgh and I knew the host but I
didn't know this woman until that night
she was the host girlfriend but the Sun
was coming down through the window like
that and she had Ted that great dress on
and I just knew I had to photograph her
and my friend Patti who was there in on
the left hand side is about eight months
pregnant and so she's there on one side
and then on the other side is the host
of the party he's exiting the picture
he's going downstairs on the right and I
always thought this this picture was
interesting in retrospect because the
next morning the host broke up with his
girlfriend so there's you know there's a
the Sun is setting in this portrait and
it's also setting on their relationship
although I didn't know it at the time
but I found that to be kind of an
interesting addition to this very kind
of private psychological portrait of
this woman this is a Hans Holbein the
younger another painter from Northern
Renaissance and you see he's got that
kind of slightly turned away body
language but you see all this stuff he
has in the background there's just
there's so much stuff to look at all
these little things and that was really
important to Northern Renaissance
painters because those things acted they
were just as important as the primary
figure because they they buttressed the
element of the portrait and so I really
love it when stuff is around for my
pictures this is right before my parents
are leaving for a trip and
you know have their clothes all around
their packing and my sister is working
on a scarf that she's knitting for her
boyfriend and I I love the the backlit
nature the way the lights coming in I
like the mirror I like to use mirrors I
didn't know it at the time but now I
look back and I see that there are
mirrors and so many of my pictures I can
tell I I like it I can admit that now
and one of the things I like about the
mirrors is I think that they act as
metaphors for other spaces that you
can't see they're there along with
windows and they're they're spaces that
that reference realms of our existence
that aren't necessarily there in the
physical world and I think a lot of the
pictures that I'm trying to make are
very psychological they're very much
focused on the interior world of the
mind that's the title of the book
interior exposure this is another
portrait of my sister and my mother
taking in the living room and I did a
few things here digitally this is the
final image and you can see I took out
the white paint there on the the left
side just because visually it wasn't
very additive and then on the coffee
table I just brought in a little more of
the information from another negative so
that you could see more of the stuff
there when the principle action of this
picture is this portrait of this mother
and bracing her daughter and you know
the hand is moving because she's kind of
just absent mindedly stroking your hair
while she does this crossword puzzle but
I like that you can see the remote
control and these magazines on the
coffee table and this picture was taken
in January 2002 that New Yorker cover on
the coffee table is the one that was
printed right after September 11th it's
black so there are kind of subtle
references to things that are not safe
but yet she's in this kind of safe
embrace parental embrace there's a
nativity scene there on the right and a
star these are other signs of hope or
comfort but juxtapose where those are
this creepy doll of my grandmother's who
he was there and and my great great
great aunt Chiana who who looks creepy
and she couldn't help it she didn't have
any teeth when this was painted but but
the portrait is nonetheless enough to
know it's it's not necessarily
comforting it's a little strange-looking
so I liked that combination of things
that are comforting and and also
slightly pretentious this is another
family portrait from just a couple years
ago it's Christmas Eve dinner and one of
the things I like visually about this in
addition to all the visual cacophony
with their Christmas cards and the table
full of plates and cutlery is my
father's arm there you'll see that
gesture is repeated by my mother at the
end of the table and it's also repeated
by that relative and the painting way
back in the other room so you have this
connection that stretches across
generations even between the living and
the dead
which is something that we often think
about and during holidays the people who
are no longer with us just to give you a
sense of what light can do this is the
same space but it's it's lit very
differently this is at dusk the last
picture was an 8 second long exposure
lit entirely by the chandelier and
candle light so it's very orange very
yellow in this picture my sister is
walking around in a wedding dress at
night because this wedding dress she
bought for about 2 dollars and 50 cents
when she was in third grade from these
nuns who were raising money for the
school and and so you know she insisted
that she had to have this dress she
would be married in it one day so she
found it in the back of her closet and
she tried it on to see if it fit her
adult body and so she's walking around
and and I I loved the juxtaposition of
her in this wedding dress in this very
old-fashioned environment
my mother was an antique dealer for
years so there's lots of antiques in the
house and then also in my husband who
left his pants and his belt draped over
the dining room chair there and there's
that plastic bag in the foreground and
then there's a little post-it note stuck
to the antique clock so you have these
influences of modern life and modern
informality
at the same time that you have these
very traditional formal references this
is the same room that's my sister again
in front of that painting this is lit
entirely by daylight though and you can
see that the color and the feeling is is
different also having my sister there in
front of the painting the way that it is
although they don't those two women
don't really resemble each other it's an
implied connection people often say they
look like each other but I think it's
just that the pose is such that you are
kind of forced to to make that
connection also it's a self-portrait and
I'm sitting on my husband's lap they're
right behind that Easter tree which is
in the center of the table and this is
kind of a sub series but sometimes has
been shown separately in galleries and
museums of just this marriage story
these portraits of me and my husband
this is one of the first ones from that
series it's called self-portrait with
Christopher and my future in-laws and as
with a lot of my pictures I have the
camera on a tripod I'm using natural
light it's a pretty long exposure and
it's with a self timer so I just set the
camera up and I walked into the picture
I didn't tell anyone what to do I did it
once and and it worked out my in-laws
who I think are trying to be very good
so they're sitting very very still come
across as being you know really severe
right and and and what's and I'm just
kind of standing there frozen and so the
picture works because it's about my
feelings my self-conscious feelings
about entering into a new family and
will I make a good wife and what does
this mean and and and the only person
who's relaxed is my husband you know a
body which is very relaxed and you can
see in the mirror there his face he's
smiling he's confident he's okay but the
rest of us just look like a mess and
this is not it's not a document I'm not
a documentary photographer but it's a
portrait of what I was feeling like at
the time and my in-laws are so
supportive of this they've been to
countless openings where this picture is
is shown and
no they endure all kinds of
interpretations as people decide to tell
them what they think of this picture and
what they look like and what it means
and they've been very good about it
and this is another picture from that
series so it's a self-portrait um you
know my husband's kind of a secondary
character there but I the context of the
other things in the living room there
are other kind of icons of femininity
you have the Virgin Mary there on the
bookshelf there's a Frida Kahlo
self-portrait also on the bookcase and
then you know there's me and I just was
trying to kind of figure out what it
meant to be a wife and you know to be
married and and what that was going to
to do to to me and these portrait these
pictures also when they're shown there
are 32 by 40 inches so you really can go
in and you can see these details pretty
easily this is another picture from that
sub series again I set up the the camera
on a automatic timer and I just walked
into the picture I didn't give
instruction to anyone my grandfather is
kind of deaf so he didn't I mean he was
really natural he didn't really even
know I was taking the picture and and my
husband just kind of you know did what
he did
so there's this this juxtaposition of
these two primary relationships here
right there's the marital relationship
in the back and then there's also the
very important relationship of my
grandfather with his Pekinese who's in
the corner there and he's feeding him a
piece of bacon so there's a they you
know he's very focused on my grandfather
it's very intense relationship again you
know weird interpretations I remember
showing my portfolio to this one curator
and after I was finished he said well
and I just I think there's too much
violence in your work I don't think we
can show it because it's too violent and
okay people have objections to my
pictures but violence isn't one that I'd
ever heard before and I said what do you
mean by that and and he flipped back to
this image and he said look at the way
that man is holding that spoon he's
going to stab that woman so again
interesting little tidbits this is
another self-portrait with my husband
and this was chosen for the cover of the
book by the publishers and there's all
this tension there there's obviously in
a sense of intimacy between these two
figures but you don't know if
you know if they're about to fight or if
they are you know actually you know just
very intensely involved and there are
those wonderful knives in the background
and so but yet they're kind of you know
sharing this piece of fruit and so you
know of course publisher has always want
the sexiest picture that they can find I
mean and there's nothing that
provocative in my portfolio but this is
what they chose is the the one to get
people's attention the most
and again this picture was just set up
on a tripod and I walked in often I take
these pictures where I set them up on a
tripod walk in and they look stupid and
they don't work at all but but sometimes
they do and try not to repeat it too
much because then the subject start to
get self-conscious and you lose the
veracity and though I'm not a
photojournalist and these are not
documentary I want them to preserve some
truths of everyday living so you can't
pester your subjects too much otherwise
it doesn't work any more they look more
like victims than characters so I'm also
in the book I include portraits of other
couples this is a friend from college
he's eight-and-a-half months pregnant
and this is in Manhattan so in Manhattan
apartments often everything takes place
in one room because that's all there is
to the apartment and so my friend is
changing after a baby shower and her
husband is practicing the cello and so I
caught this look of the way that you
know he looked at her it's this
wonderful combination of awe and fear
and love it's their first child so in
the way that she just so physically
dominates the space I mean she's just
her body is huge in this picture and
he's you know kind of underneath you
know crushed by her her presence so this
is kind of a little bit of a study of
what it might feel like to be a
potential parent and you know the
unknown that's ahead and I have to say I
have really in addition to having
cooperative family I have very
cooperative friends and my friend
actually
Alette let me have this picture of her
blown up 32 by 40 for all of Manhattan
to see earlier this spring so she's
she's a good friend this is another
pairing this was actually an accident
it's two pieces of film I'm not sure
what happened but some
accidents are very happy and this is the
way it came out on the contact sheet and
I really liked it there's my mother is
kind of walking in on that side and then
this isn't another country but you know
for all intents and purposes it's in the
same picture here of this woman in the
rocking chair with just a man's legs
there and so it's it's kind of a
mysterious image and and you have this
you know woman who's kind of walking in
peering in so I I just I liked that and
it's kind of neat this is another couple
they live in Germany and one of the
things that I like about this again is
all that domestic litter in between them
you have the car keys and the remote
controls and the newspapers and and in
between them all those portraits of
their children which connect them both
in their life of course in real life but
also visually here you have that line of
pictures which connects him to her and
their body language again you don't a
reviewer actually wrote about this image
I thought he said it really well that
you don't know whether they're about to
fight or fall in love all over again and
you're trying to photograph a marital
relationship it's a very complex thing
we might go to a studio and and have a
very smiley nice happy picture that we
send out say Adam Christmas cards it's
that kind of your public presentation of
what your your marital relationship is
like but am anyone who's married knows
that that you know the intensity of the
intimacy is of every day of life are
very it's a very complex thing so I try
to make these pictures also have you
know many different layers that describe
those different aspects of their
relationship this is a another
relationship as my cousin and her
boyfriend they're in the middle with her
mother and the foreground
I guess appropriately enough for the
Saudi and she's engrossed in her
computer and one of the things I like
about this picture is that all the
triangles you have this triangle of her
arm and the foreground it's echoed by my
cousin's arm there and then the portrait
in the background the figures also has
this triangle with the arm going down to
the the chair that she's leaning on
and and so you have this kind of
connectivity between these these
individuals who aren't relating to each
other at all in this picture they're
very much in their isolated spaces but
visually it there's illustrated a
connection and and I love you know the
sense of ownership kind of and the way
that we'll the boyfriend is is has his
hand on top of my cousin's abdomen look
he has this very intense kind of private
feelings there which are also going on
in addition and separate to the
relationship that this main protagonist
my cousin has to the viewer to the
camera and she's looking at me and we
have this own thing going on but he has
his own thing going on and and my aunt
also has her own thing going on and
that's often the way that we relate to
each other even when we're all together
we all have our own individual agendas
and ideas that are preoccupying us this
is another pairing of my my aunt and my
sister this is before getting ready for
Thanksgiving this is a friend from
college who's a resident in the ER at
Johns Hopkins and so she's very
exhausted looking and she has a baby
here this is one of the few pictures
where I used strobe lighting it was
raining outside I didn't have any
natural light to work with so I used
artificial light and it was wonderful
because the flash so startled the baby
that he really paid attention he is this
wonderful intense gaze which normally
doesn't happen with small children
they're just crawling all over the place
but I I counted graphically to that pose
he just looks like a little baby Jesus
there's that that ugly French Bulldog
again of my uncle's with with my cousin
and this was the afternoon after my
grandmother's memorial service and my
cousin's walking around and my
grandmother's old nightgown and then she
picks up this dog and I hi I like misses
one of the few pictures that's taken
outdoors but there's still a sense of
intimacy nevertheless I like the way
that the beam is kind of coming out of
her head there it's probably one of the
elementary things that you're told not
to do if you're taking pictures of your
family but here what it does is it kind
of anchors her visually it makes her all
that much more firm and
within this composition this is an
example of a kind of completely
constructed picture I I saw this room
with all the light in it I liked it and
I went and got my sister and brought her
up there so she wasn't just reclining
here I was reading A Tale of Two Cities
which is on the bed but and I also I put
a pillow under her hips there so that
her the shape of her body would all that
much more echo the shape of the mountain
range behind her and there was a red and
black plaid blanket in the bottom corner
but as you can imagine that didn't add
very much visually so I got rid of that
again this is not something I thought of
at the time but later when I was
preparing this talk I thought of this
postcard that I had in my college dorm
room for four years of Modigliani and I
can't imagine that that wasn't somewhere
in my head when I came up with that
composition of my sister Gustav Lachey's
is another artist that has a very hippie
women who are very kind of strong and
grounded in their space and it's one of
the things that I really like going back
to that picture of Sally man two
photographs her children you know the
children are very have a sense of
ownership in the composition and here my
sister the way that her body is posed
she has very much a sense of authority
with the viewer and you know my husband
and my mom have their own thing going on
here but she's very focused on us and
one of the things I also like about this
is you may have noticed there are a lot
of portraits of ancestors in the
pictures and here she's blocking out the
ancestor totally so it's kind of it
shows the kind of the confidence and the
energy of the present living generation
and that's that much more important than
the dead people that you eclipsed and
just to remind you there's that Sally
man image again of her daughter Jesse
this is another artist who is a strong
influence my mother used to bring me and
my sister to museums when we were little
to entertain us on rainy Saturdays and
we'd have to sit there and copy
paintings and and although I found it
was kind of annoying at first I grew to
really love this if she first gave us
crayons and then she would give us
charcoal and then when we were old
enough we got pastels and we'd sit there
in copy paintings and and I copied a lot
of Impressionists in particular John
Singer Sargent here this is a portrait
he did of a mother and her two daughters
and one of the things I really loved
about his compositions as you see I mean
the portrait is of the mother and two
daughters right so why didn't he chop
off the picture like halfway down why is
there all that other space there on the
top you see other paintings of other
people they are kind of in the darkness
and other suggestions of the background
but he included so much of that and I
think part of what makes this this
composition so strong is the way that
these these people have a relationship
to their space and in kind of ownership
of the space that they inhabit and
particularly painting women like that at
the time was sometimes unusual and in my
compositions I can see that there's an
influence there it's a little more
sketch together and half hazard and here
the dog walks walked through the
composition in the middle of the picture
but it ended up working there's this
connection between my husband's hand
which is about to touch the dog it
echoes the hand that my sister had just
kind of reached up to stretch and so
there's a relationship between these two
figures even though they're they're not
physically connected this is another
image of my sister with my mother and
again there's this strong relationship
between them and the space that they
inhabit it was wonderful luck to get
those two red chairs it just happened to
be matching the red shirt of my mother
but you see they they combine they work
together to kind of embrace the the blue
of the couch and my sister and the
foreground my mother is always saying I
really I try to not digitally change as
much as possible and kind of the more I
work actually the more I shoot just
straight photographs but my my relatives
naturally have complaints you know why
can't I make them look you know thinner
or younger or whatever get rid of their
wrinkles and and and here in this
picture my mother is
always lamented that I didn't get rid of
the tops of her knee-high stockings
which are kind of peeking out there from
her hem but I like that kind of stuff I
I like the the realness of life and I
try I mean unless someone has an
enormous debt and on their face which is
gonna distract from the rest of the
composition I try not to make little
cosmetic Corrections like that this is
another paint here from the 19th century
Cecilia beaux I'm just curious how many
of you have heard of Mary Cassatt three
okay how many of you heard of Cecilia
beaux nobody when I give talks at
museums or more artistic places most
people have heard of Mary Cassatt you
probably would recognize her picture she
does a lot of pictures of children and
mothers
it was interesting though as Mary
Cassatt has a letter that she wrote to
an artist friend Russia laments that she
would never eclipse the shadow of
Cecilia bow everybody pays attention to
Cecilia bow and nobody knows who she is
and and it's it's very interesting
because now America saw it's very
well-known and nobody's heard of Cecilia
beaux ever but I happened to have seen
an exhibit of hers when I was in college
and one of the things I really love
about this painter is the way that her
subjects hands are used and third she
the subject is very absent-minded but
the hands are very alive the way that
the bottom hand is kind of interacting
with the ribbon there on her lap and
then the top hand is interacting with
this cat this is a self-portrait by
Albrecht Durer who is a German painter
in the early part of the 16th century a
friend of Martin Luther and and this
picture was a look caused a little bit
of a stir
I'm just curious who does it look like
it to you yeah yeah everyone gets that
priced right I mean even today even then
and back then it's not so much like the
wiggly long hair would do it because
everybody had long hair right it's still
there's a sense of of being kind of in
the world but also having being outside
of the world being somewhere else this
divinity which is somehow portrayed and
he was brilliant to be able to make this
you know perhaps a little egocentric to
make it into a self-portrait but he was
a good painter and I really like I like
that in pictures and I try to be able to
convey the sense of
being in a space but also being sim but
somewhere else too and this woman is a
physicist she's working in Switzerland
now in CERN that particle smashing place
I don't really understand what she does
so I can't really explain it but I know
she's working with with with particle
physics and kind of the origin of the
universe is what she's preoccupied with
but I and hear her way that her head is
kind of vanishing into the background it
shows that she's she's interested in in
the heavens both in particle physics and
also because of her religious
sensibilities she's a Christian she's
also interested in the heavens in a
spiritual sense and in the bookshelf
there there's a novel by Virginia Woolf
called the the voyage out which I think
is is nice having that there in the
composition and although she's her head
is kind of vanishing outdoors she's also
connected to this beast looking thing
again is my very innocuous Standard
Poodle but here because of the long
exposure you kind of see his fangs and
and his teeth and so he's he's very
worldly whereas you know she is very
ethereal he's she's also anchored to the
world this this picture appears on the
back of my book it's a picture of my
grandfather and and my sister and and I
was interested in my grandfather just
passed away a week and a half ago and
one of the things I was interested in
doing was was showing what that those
last months of life are like and he took
a lot of naps and during the end of his
life and and so here he is he's taking
the snap and my sister kind of curls up
next to him and he reaches over his hand
and is resting it there on her hip and
this very kind of intimate warm enclosed
space but the window there and none of
this is altered but the window there
also it looks like it's it's the way the
trees are lined it's like a passage to
somewhere else and so I think of this as
he's there in the world with my sister
in this particular space but in his mind
and he he could be thinking about past
his past moments in his life or what
lies beyond life - this is a picture
with my husband which it was a
a bit of an experiment because I've
posed him in a very feminine way you
know it's a kind of odalisque pose that
on his side you know with his his hand
up there on on the side of his head and
and yet he says very masculine hairy
figure so it's that juxtaposition of
this kind of feminine pose but a very
masculine body and and also I didn't
light him so you can see just enough to
know he's there but you can't see
everything and and so this picture
although he dominates the the space
physically it's also if you follow the
lines of his body and then and then her
gaze going out the window it's also
referencing psychologically you know
where they they might be elsewhere this
is a portrait of a friend that same very
tired looking surgical I mean ER
resident and this is when she was eight
months pregnant and her husband was
living in a city two hours away at that
time so she has this this otherworldly
sense in this portrait the her gaze
being out and also the light playing on
the wall is kind of it's it's symbolic
of her mind as being elsewhere and
having a lot on her mind and this is the
same woman with her child when he's
about two years old and it's nice here
with children the way that they're so
animated
it makes her static nature all that much
more strong because he's moving around
so much this is the last picture in the
book this is a woman a German woman with
her three children it's called Judith
and her children and and having that
baby this intense look and he's kind of
wondering what I'm doing it was for me
just a little bit of a reference of
what's to come because the book came out
this year and also arriving this year
was a pair of twins which I gave birth
to earlier this year so I have had the
sense at the time and it's proven true
so far that children will figure more
and more into the work one thing I
wanted to add separately for you just
because of because your Google I
recently did this series for Newsweek
about women and leadership and the
there are a couple of the portraits
there but the one that that I wanted to
point out to you is that sheryl sandberg
there on the left hand side and one of
the things that the editors really
wanted to do using me was to photograph
these women not necessarily in their
business spaces but in their their
private spaces and their domestic spaces
and so I went to their homes and
photographed them there so and Sheryl
was and she was you know very nice and
very welcoming and very busy and so I
went there at like 7:30 in the morning
and she was already on her laptop
you know tapping away captive and so
that's what she's doing here on this on
this chair with the early morning light
coming through the window and she looked
up for just one moment and that was
ended up being my favorite picture and
it's the one that they published too
because I is this kind of sense of you
know what what's going on in her mind
they're the grand things that she thinks
of and I wanted that I thought that was
more interesting than necessarily just
showing her tapping away at her computer
and that's rosario Dawson next to her
that's it
I'd be happy to answer any questions
it's a good question the question is how
did I manage to train my family to be so
inoculated against my presence I started
early I guess you know I've been
photographing them since I was a
teenager and they know that the vast
majority of pictures I take never turn
into anything so eventually they stopped
caring and they're very supportive of
the arts so I think they understand that
artists have been using their family
forever and that these aren't
necessarily pictures of them as much as
they're being used as characters in
these compositions I make and I think I
think ultimately it's a I have to credit
them with a certain generosity with and
trust with letting them letting me
letting me just use use them and use
their homes as backdrops and and other
people to that appear in this book who
aren't related to me they're very
they're very trusting and I'm very
grateful for them
almost like taking on the moment but
what percentage everybody say running
out of us it was
a thoroughly excellent question the
question is to what extent am i aware of
various symbolism in the composition
when I'm making the picture or do I
always see it after the fact and he
added that that seems very difficult to
go around thinking about
Icona graph I kind of graphic references
and symbols while you're trying to make
a picture and I couldn't agree more
I think I try to work as I have
mentioned earlier I try to work fairly
quickly and I try not to be too much of
a pest those are kind of the two rules
because when I break those rules it not
only do i annoy the people around me who
I have no emotional investment with if
they want to keep on being my models but
I also don't make good pictures if they
get too irritated so I think a lot of
this stuff that's going on this use of
symbolism you know the interesting props
it's mostly subconscious I don't
necessarily think about it very much
beforehand like that picture with the
novel the voyage out on the Shelf I
didn't see at the time but I saw it
afterward and I thought that was neat so
I think the more that you do this too
the more intuitive it becomes it's kind
of like speaking the language when you
talk you don't necessarily think about
all your grammatical constructions or
how intelligent it might sound or how
stupid it might sound you just kind of
say it and and I think with with
photographs too I just kind of stumble
along and and of course I only show you
the good ones
the question is do I use natural light
exclusively for the most part yes I try
to but when I'm you know being hired by
magazines for example you can't make the
weather cooperate and so I try to
schedule times which are at the
beginning or the end of the day but I
also bring an assistant with a whole
bunch of lights and we recreate it if we
can't make it happen naturally and there
are a few pictures that I showed you
from the book where I do use strobe
lighting if it's just a very dark space
but it's so laborious to set up the
lighting and and to have it there that
you it's harder to get that sense of
naturalness do I always have the camera
ready for picture taking I wish there's
so many times when I don't and you know
it by the time I get my film loaded and
my tripod ready people have totally
moved on and they're not interested and
I'm sitting for whatever I thought was
cool particularly now because I have 10
month old twins and they never stay
still and it's becoming a real challenge
i I'm having to work in a new way I try
to have the cameras set up more and then
I keep them behind little plastic fences
so they can't get to them but no I mean
if I worked more with a 35-millimeter
camera maybe with a like something
that's a little more handheld and
portable but I work with a tripod and a
medium format camera and and there's a
cost there it's slow
what technological improvements have
there been in the last 10 years that
have really helped me as I mentioned I
got my masters at RIT and one of the
reasons I chose that is because for
photography there's nowhere else that
has better equipment they have
everything and they have support staff
to help you and it's all cutting edge
and when I was there I mean this is
cutting edge technology this is what the
best that was available but I was still
working with these 202 and 300 Meg files
these pictures that I show you because
they're so large and there are many
layers and they're 32 by 40 and their
final output and I'm really concerned of
quality in detail and so I used to work
there late at night I would get like
three computers at a time I would sign
out and I would you know open one file
and then I'd you know open one file on
the second computer and open another
file on the third computer and then I'd
have my book with me because I'd have to
wait about five minutes for them to open
and I would use you know separate
machines because the computer couldn't
possibly handle three files at once that
I was working on and I mean it didn't
know any better so I guess you just put
up with it I would bring a novel with me
and it was just long it's so much faster
now it's so much easier and the scanners
have gotten much cheaper too and when I
was in grad school I was able to use
really nice scanners there but now it's
affordable for me to scan at home and
and make good scans too so I think
that's that's probably been the biggest
change I still don't have a digital
there there are digital cameras which
are good enough to mimic film medium
format photography but they're you know
twenty thousand dollars at least and I
don't own one of those so that's what
I'm waiting for next is a digital camera
that has the same quality as film
anything else yes
the question is what percentage of
photos are taken candidly and how many
are constructed I constructed more early
on because I kind of wanted to see if I
could and I idly combined negatives more
than two now I I tried I've moved back
more to straight-shooting kind of an
old-fashioned way of approaching it
again because of those things that I've
been mentioning that your subjects get
impatient with you I I try not to
construct too much and now with children
on the scene that just isn't time to
construct anything so but because the
children can't you know they're like
pets kind of you can't tell them to be
still you can't tell them to look a
certain way I do find that I've going
back to blending negatives because often
they look best in one image whereas the
adults are cooperating you know in all
the images so I I can piece them
together that way
yes yes right right
the question is since I shoot film and I
use these really long exposures how do I
know that they've come out or is it just
like rolling the dice I have to say when
I get to commercial jobs I always bring
a digital camera and I test it because
then I can see and they're paying me but
I still use really long exposures
because I try to use the natural light
film has this wonderful ability to to
still register information with really
long exposures it's it's very flexible
it's a wonderful range in terms of for
light and shadow registry but the answer
is often I don't get it
although I've gotten I mean I'm pretty
good at just judging what the when you
take a picture you have to take a light
reading you have to measure the light
and then have your camera match those
numbers and so but your as with all
things it's helpful to have a brain to
to override what the you know the camera
the measurements are the best they do
the best they can but they don't really
see the picture like you do so just with
years of experience I've just gotten a
lot better but I've made a lot of bad
pictures
said it so you've been a very friendly
audience thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
