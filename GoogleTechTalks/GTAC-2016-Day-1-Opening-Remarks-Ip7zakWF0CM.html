right
glad you could all make it here this
year in Sunnyvale California I'm your
host for the next two days my name is
Matt Lowry and I work in the Boulder
Colorado Google office on Google now if
anybody's used or heard of that product
but there was a short list of candidates
for who was going to be host this year
there was Billy Bush Ryan lucky you know
somehow I got the pick so you'll be
stuck with me for the next few days so
yeah let's go over what's going to
happen during the conference just as a
reminder we are live streaming right now
and we are recording everything that's
going on in this room so if you don't
want to be recorded now is your chance
to get up and run out screaming out of
the room don't be afraid if you you feel
the need and we will yes so ten years
we've been doing this conference
the first conference we put on was
actually called the London test
automation conference which was held in
London back in 2006 it was put on by a
group of 20% volunteers within Google
they decided let's have a conference and
got together and organized it and made a
call for entries in one blog post on the
Google testing blog and that's how this
all came about and today it's still run
by 20% volunteers within Google most of
them are here so if you see one giving a
handshake or a hug or or saying
congratulations but that's one of the
nice things about working at Google is
we have the 20% program which doesn't
have to mean just building the next
Gmail or next product we can spend 20%
time on helping the engineering
community so we choose to spend our time
advancing different ideas in the test
engineering community community so
here's a list of some of the places
we've been at we skipped 2012 as you'll
notice but we we are on track so we've
been around the world and we like to
make this conference inclusive of
everybody around the world and that's
why we try to spread around locations
we've been in the u.s. a while so might
be nice to get out of the US some time
but we'll see we'll see
no spoilers alright so conference badges
you've all got one if you're wearing a
green badge you are an attendee and
we're glad to have you here all of these
speakers will be wearing blue badges
and you'll see the organizers will be in
the yellow lanyards for their badge
here's their and here it is spelled out
but that's a way to designate anyone you
want to talk to so if you do have any
questions about where to go what what to
do you know how do I find the bathroom
any any simple questions like that you
can easily find organizers in our yellow
land lanyards the code of conduct we
employ a code calm conduct for this
conference if you haven't read it yet it
basically says don't act like Donald
Trump that is that's good advice
even beyond this concert conference so
please adhere to that it's something we
take seriously about we want to make
everybody feel comfortable and welcome
here all right lunch I know the other
important topic that's not everybody's
mind lunch you will be able to enjoy in
our many Google cafes so you'll be able
to eat just like all the other Googlers
here it will be a little hectic today I
can imagine what we'll need to do is
organize outside the conference room
here and we'll have Google volunteers
that will be able to escort you over to
a particular cafe and bad you into where
you'll be able to get in line order
whatever you like Google pays for
everything it's one of the great perks
we have here and you get to enjoy it
today as well so today will be probably
a little chaotic getting that all that
organized but tomorrow we'll have a down
pat you'll be able to go to any cafe and
you'll be totally over the fascination
of it just like every other google who
works here now but if some of your
options we have here in this building
there's a cafe on the corner
Polly titled cornerstone that's kind of
idea of what they serve up that one is
easy to get to so I imagine we'll have a
volunteer just at the door badging
badging you and letting you get access
in there we also have Fresh Market which
is in building TC 1 which is that way
I still haven't memorized all the
building numbers yet but we'll have
someone going there if you're interested
in what they have to offer they have a
fantastic salad bar there so if you love
salad that's something to behold
and then in the building this way tc4 is
where we have the most options we have
the burger bar or you can order up a
burger but as you can probably assume
every most every Googler always goes
there and they line is the biggest at
that one so there is a couple other
options in that building as well so take
a look you know well the volunteers will
be able to tell you what you what you
can find in each cafe as well when they
take you there and if you do have any
dietary restrictions please don't
hesitate to tell any organizer and we
can we're equipped to solve the problem
there's one thing we don't like at
Google and that's for anyone to go
hungry one of our missions and tonight
for dinner what's happening we'll be out
out outside I know one of these
directions but we'll be having carnival
games going on so it'll be a fun event
after the after the full day of talks
today you'll be able to go out talk to
your fellow conference attendee about
what you just saw and heard today and
enjoy some carnival games that we have
that we'll be setting up during the day
so that'll be fun all right so for
questions during the day during any talk
we have an online slide question online
question a generating thing so you can
on your mobile device or on your laptop
from the comfort of your chair if you
have a question about any of the talks
you see today you can enter a question
at this URL it's going to go to a Q&amp;amp;A
app called sly do so you need to enter
in hashtag GTECH 2016 to go to the list
of talks where you can enter questions
and I think I have some screenshots here
here is if you have your barcode reader
ready you can get the app or you can do
it directly in the slide yo app or you
can do it on our G tach web page as well
and I think we have some bar codes
around the room as well where it'll take
you right to that but if you search the
either app store it'll take you right to
that and this is what it looks like so
when you first go to enter in GTECH 2016
you'll be taken to the list of
presentations you can ask questions on
and once you choose one you can go in
and type your question at the end of
each talk I'll go through the top voted
questions you can upload downvote
questions on there as well so if you
feel if you don't feel like getting up
you can do that we will have a mic if
you want to ask something in room in
person will have a mic as well that will
pass around it's very important to get
your question on the mic so real-time
transcription can transcribe it and so
that the live stream can also hear it so
you need to wait to wait for the mic if
you want to ask in the room oh and one
thing I want to point out that was very
tricky do not click the back button on
that slide on the right once you get to
the question do not press the back
button because that'll take you out of
the app what you have to do is click on
that
that toggle on the top to get back to
questions that gets me every time so I
wanted to save you some frustration ah
hashtags if you are feeling social and
who isn't I use the hashtag tooth out
2016 on your Pinterest board on your
telegram chats whatever whatever the
kids are doing these days let's hear
from you hear how the conference is
going let the world know what's what
exciting things are happening here and
we'd love to see your photos as well we
have a shared photo album in Google
photos so any happy happy moments that
you'd like to share with everybody else
from the conference be sure to add to
our shirt album all right so a little
bit about Sunnyvale where are we what is
this place
well Sunnyvale started out as fruit
orchards then it was defense now it's
buildings and that's pretty much
Sunnyvale but oh what buildings there
are here plots of your Silicon Valley
favorites
Yahoo Lockheed Martin here AMD a lot of
big names so sightseeing involves in
this area just involves looking at all
the big graphics posted on the sides of
buildings but what about our campus here
so the Google Sunnyvale campus
surprisingly I could not find much
information about if only there was
someone who could organize the world's
information and make it universally
accessible but what I did find is that
this campus was built in Silicon Valley
for Silicon Valley companies Google
least all of it in 2011 and we moved in
in 2013 it's a big 25 acre campus and we
currently house 3500 Googlers here but
not
in any projects that you would be
interested in knowing about so we we and
that's not fair we have a lot of people
operations here all the people doing
recruiting are based out of here we have
marketing here legal teams here so very
important work going here I don't mean
to to dismiss all the things that going
here but for a test conference not much
to show here so we actually we usually
give tours of Google buildings for every
GTECH this year because of all the legal
teams here we're not able to actually
give tours within buildings but the
grounds are actually outside the
buildings are probably more interesting
anyway you you could feel free to walk
around play some beach volleyball if you
brought if you brought your swim trunks
you're free to do that or check out the
basketball or bocce ball courts I here
are some of the amenities that I could
find about this campus we have a entire
building dedicated to a fitness center
building five I believe the beach
volleyball court badminton court so a
lot of ways to enjoy the sunny
California weather outside and that's
the that's all I really have them this
campus so I hope you enjoy your time
here and that's all of my bad jokes for
right now as well so we are about to get
into the actual conference does
everybody ready everybody excited that's
good me too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
