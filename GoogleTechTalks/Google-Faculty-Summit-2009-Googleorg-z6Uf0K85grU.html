NOT a computer scientist my backgrounds
in public policy and communications my
background is in working in the federal
government I've also lived and worked in
India where Iran help to run a large
public health program and I did a little
bit of work in academia at Harvard where
I got my master's in public policy and
then spent eight years at the bill and
melinda gates foundation before coming
here to google so um when I came here to
Google I was attracted by maybe
something a little different than the
normal engineer here I was attracted to
something that I had read that the
founders had said in their founding
letter that they had an intention to be
a different kind of company and part of
what they meant by that was that they
were going to devote significant
resources in fact one percent of
Google's yearly profit one percent of
its equity towards philanthropy or
towards innovating for good and they
even said that they hoped and aspired
that someday that effort of Google would
actually eclipse the impact of the
company itself so that's a pretty
audacious goal and the motivations
behind it were very attractive to me so
that's what brought me here so I work
with Google org which is the strategic
philanthropy part of google but
philanthropy is woven throughout the
fabric here at Google and there's a lot
of different activities going on besides
just google.org itself in general what
we focus on are the themes here and
these are some of the things I
understand are being highlighted at your
conference working on issues like clean
energy working on using technology to
help bring more access to information
making government more accountable
making government more interactive and
available to citizens working
specifically around global health issues
and poverty issues how can we use mobile
technologies to ensure that we're not
only helping businesses and improve
their efficiency but to help consumers
to help regular people as well
so google.org itself when I first came
and we first started Google said okay
we're going to take an approach where
we're going to try all the keys on
keyboard that was the phrase we're going
to do some grants to nonprofits like
this the reefs maybe along the lines of
the research grants we're going to
partner with some people and give
resources we're also going to invest in
companies because we believe that
sometimes the private sector is really
the answer and that there are
entrepreneurs and small companies that
we want to back so we're going to invest
we're also going to use Google's
engineers and we're going to build
software and develop projects ourselves
and we're going to do this advocacy
thing which means that we're going to
use the name of Google the brand of
Google the political muscle of Google
inside DC and other capitals to push
public policies so we went down that
path for a couple of years and then we
sort of pulled back and did a review and
what we learned is that the grants that
we gave we invested we made about a
hundred million dollars in grants and
investments we looked at that we are
very proud of what we did we had
supported a lot of really good partners
but we realized you know we weren't
really hitting on what we Google could
do uniquely a lot of the grants that we
were giving the things that we were
doing were things that other people
could do so we've really refocused more
recently and Megan Smith has come over
she's our VP of new business development
she's an engineer she's come over to
help us to focus even more tightly on
what are the engineering projects that
we can do and we're keeping the advocacy
focus because we understand that it's
not enough sometimes to have a
technology solution you need to make
sure that that solution has the
ecosystem the enabling environment
around it with correct public policies
and raising of awareness that sort of
thing to make it work so that's our
focus now as I said there's you know
doing good and using technology to do
good is just part of the normal day for
a lot of engineers here there there are
so many projects going on if you go back
I don't even know about where engineers
small group of engineers are looking at
their product looking at their
technology and saying you know we're
focusing on on this for this purpose but
gosh if we did this or tweaked it this
way i bet we could help in this and what
i love about google is that there's just
a spirit of openness about that and
there's so much encouragement for
individuals and their twenty percent
time
or in other methods to just follow
follow those paths so you see a lot of
good coming out of that setup as well so
today in my talk what I'm going to do is
just quickly run through at a high level
some of the engineering projects that
we're working on and a lot of these
projects will have the technical leads
coming and speaking later this afternoon
and tomorrow so if you have technical
questions on they might be the most
appropriate to answer that but I can
give it a try as well on my colleague
Christians going to come up and do some
demo of Google Earth and how we're using
geospatial data especially data mix
geospatial did mixed with other data for
impact and then I'm going to give a
sneak preview of a couple of things sort
of confidentially that we're thinking
about doing haven't been green-lighted
we're not talking about them externally
yet but thought we'd preview them for
this audience because there might be
potential for partnerships with you all
all right so just quickly wanted to add
that some of you are associated with
nonprofits and one of the pieces of
philanthropy of people I did want to
point out if you're not aware of it is
this site that helps extend the reach of
Google products to nonprofits for
example our Google Grants program gives
over half a billion has given over half
a billion dollars in free ads to
nonprofits so that's a good thing to be
aware of okay so I'm going to start with
google powermeter this is a gadget
that's available on computers that gives
you your real time energy data so we
have this rolled out now and a few
pilots we've got nine partnerships with
utilities in the u.s. India Canada think
that's it and Germany and Germany so as
you can tell here from this simple
screenshot and it's actually the
products actually I think improved since
we grab this it basically will just show
a consumer the spikes around their
energy use and so you can discern the
energy use of your dryer compared to say
your TV and understand relatively how
much energy you're using so why are we
interested in doing something like this
well research shows
just by making consumers aware of their
energy use they will automatically
reduce their energy use by ten percent
so that's significant if half of the
households in the united states drop
their usage ten percent that's the
equivalent of taking eight million cars
off the road so this is scalable the
other important thing about this as you
know as I was driving in this morning
and listening to NPR they were saying
there's a new study out that even in
progressive California when you ask
people what are their their top
priorities in the environment climate
change and worries about climate change
are decreasing and even in California
where number three were behind drought
and forest fires so we really believe
that it's not enough to just create
technology create tools create
information for people who are self
motivated to do something about the
environment we need to create things
that work with mass hundreds of millions
of consumers and give them a self
interest in the action so something like
this a tool like power meter will not
only reduce energy but it'll also help
consumers save money which is important
so we're we have a small group of
engineers who are working on this there
are a lot of other of these kinds of
devices being developed right now we
think that's great we're just hoping to
push innovation across the field we hope
our particular product is successful but
this is an example where more
importantly than our particular product
we really want to see innovation and
progress in this field so this is an
example where we have policy partnering
with our engineering to further our
impact because having a solution a
device like this requires a whole
infrastructure so you may have heard
about smart grid smart meters this is
very exciting we have a window of
opportunity right now because in the
last stimulus bill passed the Obama
administration put in money almost four
billion dollars for the smart grid
concept and so this is going to allow
the deployment of more smart meters and
a smart meters is necessary in order for
an in-home device like this one or our
competitors to work so we have this
wonderful window of opportunity where we
have significant funding
and we're putting together the what we
call the energy internet or the smart
grid now the interesting thing is is you
know I just got a flyer from PG&amp;amp;E and my
house the other day and they said hey
you congratulations we just installed a
smart meter I never would have known
right the only way I would have known is
maybe I didn't see Molly made meter
coming by to read my meter um but they
mentioned that they never once mentioned
in this brochure that oh by the way by
having a smart meter in place if we PG&amp;amp;E
we're going to partner with someone you
could get your real time energy
information so we need to ensure that
this the system that's being set up has
a consumer focus that this marker that's
being deployed and the smart meter
partnerships that are being built are
built on a and open system which with
shared protocols open protocols so that
we can have interoperability and we need
to make sure that there's a consumer
focus there and so that's that's what my
team is working on we're doing Matt by
lobbying on the hill we have an energy
expert Dan Reicher who was on the short
list for Secretary of Energy he's on the
hill quite often speaks quite a bit
about this we do a lot of media
interviews because we want to raise
awareness around both the potential but
as well as some of the obstacles that
are in the path so that's power meter so
re less than C um you know here at
Google we we use energy as in the course
of business and we're doing everything
we can we take that energy use we take
our carbon footprint very seriously so
we're doing everything we can to build
the most efficient data centers we think
we do have the most efficient data
centers in the world bill while who's
going to speak here later will be
available to talk about what we're doing
there we're sharing best practices as
well on our data centers but we still
use a significant amount of energy and
the fact of the matter is google uses
the same energy mix as the rest of
America and we don't like our options we
don't like the fact that there isn't
utility scale renewable energy available
that's cost-competitive with coal we
want that we know others want that same
point about power meter when you do
something that's going to work in the
marketplace that will work with can
Zoomers you don't have to worry about
people paying a premium for renewable
energy we want renewable energy
available that's cheaper than coal the
sorry lesson see so as we examine this
area and looked at what we Google could
do in sort of a unique way a couple
things came up our engineers said that
there were three technologies that we
think have the most promise to reach the
renewable energy cheaper than coal
threshold so for us it's concentrated
solar thermal enhanced geothermal
systems and high altitude wind so to
promote these technologies we've taken a
three-prong approach one we've invested
in companies so we invested 45 million
dollars in new companies and solar
thermal BrightSource you might have
heard of them I solar on EGS Potter
drilling that's looking at new drills
that can get the bits down and in high
altitude wind a local company Makani
power so we made these investments in
small startups and and companies that we
felt were on the right path that but
needed more money um but this was an
area where Larry Page in particular was
very involved and said you know it's not
enough to just fund others and other
ideas that are out there we really think
that this is something that Google might
be able to do with engineers who knew
who knew so we actually now have a small
team of engineers in-house who are
working on renewable energy so they're
looking um particularly around these
these types of energy for ways that we
could help design better on create
software that would fill some of the
strategic gaps and we're not talking too
much right now about the specific areas
we're looking at probably in the next
quarter or so will come out a little bit
more about that not exactly sure right
now you know it does this mean that
Google's going to actually you know
build on power plants and deploy this
kind of renewable energy you know maybe
or maybe we're going to do a shared
licensing approach or you know who knows
but this is a case where we wanted to do
some of that engineering look at what we
could do in-house as well so um you know
I'm optimist
that are our group of Engineers is going
to make some progress and and share
results but the fact of the matter is it
just can't be Google and it just can't
be a few guys down the street and it
just can't be you know but what he's
doing we need hundreds and thousands of
people around the world globally working
on re lesson see so that's where policy
comes in um you know candidate Obama
talked about a renewable energy fund of
a hundred and fifty billion dollars over
ten years and we know that candidates
always tend to talk a little bit bigger
and then you come down to reality and we
have this minor global meltdown and
stimulus bill that's that's taken a lot
of funding but we believe actually
that's the order of funding that we're
going to need and not only but smart
funding to the correct technologies
backing good players who are
incentivized to share information and
results and data to get to where we need
to be now so the good news is that the
stimulus did contain about 2.5 billion
dollars in new funding for rd and that's
significant but it's not near where we
need to be and more importantly what
we're looking at from the policy angle
is that you just can't have these years
where you have a flood of money and then
you have a trough and there's just no
stability there's no ability to to
predict stable funding flows so we're
working with a lot of others in
coalition to lobby for stable funding
for incentives for mandates if that
makes sense we're looking at things like
renewable portfolio standards at the
utility level that require certain
amounts of renewable electricity mix in
utilities we're also looking at issues
gating issues like transmission that's
an example where Google might be helpful
on something like the transmission issue
is by billing we've built earth layers
where we show ecologically sensitive
areas where it would not be good to run
transmission lines and we've looked at
promising areas for renewable energy
whether it's solar thermal or EGS or or
PV and built these maps and layers to
help
people to design citing that makes sense
on both from wildlife and from a
renewable energy perspective again in
the energy area are recharged at program
we really felt we started this a couple
years ago really felt that plug-in
electric hybrid cars we're not getting
the attention that they deserved it was
sort of scene like this idea that was
many years out now you're all nodding
will of course we know about this it
seems plausible yeah Honda's going to
come out with one couple years ago that
wasn't so sure so we thought okay this
is a place where we might be able to
have a catalytic impact and one area
where we could do that is we notice that
you know there's a lot of people out
there activists promoting plugins
talking about you know my car got 100
miles per gallon that sort of thing but
we hadn't really seen good data
available comparing what a plug-in might
receive versus of their cars so we did
it we we purchased eight Toyota Priuses
we converted them ourselves with a high
motion kit so we have these plug-in cars
there they're branded recharge it you
might see them plugged in under our
solar car ports we make these available
to Googlers so if Googlers use our
shuttles or ourselves they can take
these cars out during the day if they
need to run errands but we also ran a
driving experiment where we looked at we
compared real-life driving with
professional drivers on several
different courses to say what you know
what are you going to get so we got 93
miles per gallon on our plugins and you
know these are not optimized right these
are just conversion kits so these are
not even the best of what realistically
what plug-in cars could get and then we
compared that to a regular prius which
was about 43 on toyota corolla was about
30 ford expedition was about 14 so even
just publicizing that sort of data just
very basic data was helpful to inform
the discussion we have Larry Sergey and
Eric who all care very passionately
about these issues who incorporate these
kind of facts and their speeches and
that really helped garner some attention
we're also now we have just
small group of engineers looking at
smart charging and immune response to
see what might be possible and our cars
are eight are now receiving a signal
from the grid operator on when to charge
and how much so this is a look at what
might be done in the future with plugins
so I'm going to switch gears now and
talk about something we're doing on the
health side um how many of you have ever
heard of flu trends or played around
with flu trends yeah a few of you became
a lot more popular swine flu so the idea
with flu trends is that our engineers
discovered that you know a lot of people
use Google to search for more health
information and that we can correlate
aggregated search queries with truth
data like data from the CDC on actual
flu incidents and we can build models
that helped predict and even detect
real-time or within a day on flu
activity so we built a model for the
u.s. that we launched and the
information is available at a state
level as well and what we found is that
on our our daily publication our daily
updates on flu tracked very closely our
correlation was above point 9 with CDC
data now CDC Center for Disease Control
they collect their data by you know
you're feeling sick maybe you go to the
doctor you present with flu-like illness
they'll record that if you're really
sick they'll take a culture and run it
and that takes several days and then
they'll get those results back they take
all of that data they send it off to a
centralized bureaucracy that then
gathers all of that and publishes it
well that usually takes about a week or
two but what we found is our data which
was highly correlated with theirs is
available daily or even sooner when
necessary so Jeremy Ginsberg who led the
engineering team did a great job with
that we published it we were very happy
about that we were looking at
potentially Europe maybe Australia for
the Sun
in hemisphere flu epidemic and then we
get a call from Mexican health officials
and the CDC saying you know so what are
you seeing in Mexico we were like well
actually we don't have a system built
for Mexico we're not seeing anything
really how long would it take you to
build a system for Mexico huh so our
engineering team very quickly I'm using
the same sort of system put together a
model for Mexico now the problem with
Mexico is that we don't have the truth
data the way that we have in the US with
the CDC the very reliable historian Oh
10 years of historical flu data so um
they were a little unsure of the model
because of that and then and then also
as word starts trickling out you start
you start to see variation between what
are people just searching because
they've heard about flu or because
they're actually experiencing illness
but what we did see is that we were able
to detect before widespread news
coverage had picked it up when it was
still just a bit of a buzz in the health
community and an unusual uptick in flu
activity in Mexico outside the standard
sort of flu season so we should we told
the the health officials look our this
very provisional we don't know it's not
robust we haven't validated it but you
know let us share it with you real-time
just just to kind of help and this was
really helpful in the early days because
they didn't know the denominator they
knew a lot of people were becoming sick
and dying but they didn't know how very
alone it was because they didn't really
have a good baseline or a good feeling
for how many people were experiencing
flu so we're continuing to work on our
model will be launching internationally
in other countries as well but this is
an example when i said earlier on where
we were trying to figure out well what
can we do and what can we contribute
that's unique to google i think this is
a good example so I'm going to pause for
just a minute um and shift gears and
invite my colleague Christian to come up
and give a demo of Google Earth to
demonstrate how it's being used today
for impact and then I'll very quickly
give a preview of a couple new ideas
that we have in the hopper
that we might be doing my name is
christian Adams I work with Google org
as well as with the Google Earth
outreach team MJS and mapping
specialists help nonprofits and all
sorts of organizations to use Google
Earth and Google Maps and display their
data in our online mapping tools so real
quick tour here the first thing that
most people do when they fire up google
earth actually let me let me ask for
who's actually used google earth
probably most people in the room who's
actually created a layer for google
earth like put some data on there and to
visualize okay bunch of great great
hopefully you can see that there's some
really cool ways you can visualize data
here and see if there's some something
that you might want to visualize in your
your own work so the first thing most
people do is fly into their home we'll
go check out the Googleplex real quick
you can see it's all three dimensions in
Google Earth we have our 3d buildings
there you have to fly into san francisco
while we're here as well because this is
just too cool but let's get on to some
examples of how this is used for public
benefits one of the most the better
known examples that you may have seen
before is the crisis in Darfur layer
that was created by the u.s. Holocaust
Memorial Museum this was actually
updated this week with the latest data
of villages that have been burned
destroyed or damaged in the Darfur
region of Sudan and it's a pretty
incredible layer it shows how when you
put data in contexts and show it with
all the background data that we have our
imagery and and other data it really
brings your cause or your message to
life this is a village that you can see
is burned to the ground in Darfur and
there are thousands of them and this
layer was one of several things that
helped bring attention to this issue
you can see these are just a collection
of points pretty easy to create and you
can put all sorts of information in here
including for these organizations very
important have links back to their
website to get people to to see their
other contents and take action or do
what what they want them to do on their
website let's show an example of another
kind of information you can put on here
with when you have time based in
information this is actually an example
of the previous flu epidemic that made
international news the the bird flu and
I can play this with our our time slider
here we can see it's 2004 the circles
are animal cases the triangles or human
cases can see it's spreading into Europe
continue playing through there spreading
across Central Asia into Europe and West
Africa so again a cool visualization of
some data that was put together by in
this case Declan Butler he he put this
all together and each one of those
points has some info about the case and
and where where the data came from this
layer is jacqueline mentioned were
working to promote enhanced geothermal
energy and we created a data layer
ourselves at google.org that shows the
enhanced geothermal or EGS as we like to
call it potential across the u.s. now
here's a what we call an image overlay
this is the temperature at seven and a
half kilometers down takes about 150 to
200 degrees Celsius minimum to have
their efficient heat extraction for
energy production we have layers to
different depths here I don't have time
to go
the mall he was four and a half
kilometers not quite as hot but you can
still see the hot spot at Yellowstone up
here and then we can put placemarks in
each states where we had state-by-state
data on the resources in that state
compared to their current generating
capacity it's pretty impressive numbers
there these are charts produced by our
chart API and we can also do some cool
3d visualization of this with whatever
parameters you want in this case it's
the geothermal resource in that state
and wanted to show off a couple of the
neat things that we've done more
recently with Google Earth we earlier
this year we launched ocean in Google
Earth and you can see we have some very
high-resolution bathymetry data in
Monterey Bay we wait for a second
hopefully the waves that start moving
there we go we can see the ocean surface
here and we can dive underneath and
actually explore the symmetry let me fly
back out here for a moment and encourage
you to check out in the layers panel
here these are all the built in layers
that we have in Google Earth the global
awareness layers are things that we work
on with the the Earth outreach team
these are organizations who have created
really interesting content for
environmental and humanitarian and other
things like that um there's also the
ocean layer turn that one on lots of
things under there you can explore root
a victim surcharge on three years so you
very easy to embed a YouTube video in
Google Earth balloons just HTML content
in each of those balloons hopefully you
all being computer science experts can
develop more cool ways of developing
content for for Google Earth and what
was the last thing I wanted to show here
is the other neat new feature in google
earth I'm going to start by flying in
here to a little place called Cape
Canaveral and then
going to switch over to moon give it a
second this is the launch pad of the for
the Apollo program or what one of the
launch pads for the Apollo program give
this moments come on so I'll say we we
have the oceans are built right into
Google Earth we now have underwater
bathymetry in underwater terrain we also
have Mars and Google Earth you can go
and explore Mars because we have a lot
of great data there we have skies so you
can look out put all your star and sky
data in and if moon will come up I may
just have to skip that one okay probably
I haven't had this problem before but um
now we're all subject to bugs I guess so
yeah Jacqueline I'll give it back to you
dope wait wait wait wait there we go I
threatened it with not showing and here
it comes there we go we can go and
explore all sorts of cool stuff in here
like all the human artifacts all the
spacecraft and other things that are
scattered all over the moon and where is
it our historical maps and turn on these
geological charts that were used for
planning some of the Apollo missions
they're pretty amazing to look at this
is this is essentially what they used to
plan the Apollo missions these these
charts new USGS we can also go in and
fly into the individual Apollo mission
landing sites this is the last one in
Apollo 17 actually let me fly to Apollo
11 which is the first one and we can see
these maps and you can see the lander
there and I think we have a youtube
video once again
so lots of things to explore in there
we're using this with a lot of
organizations to do some really great
advocacy and promotion work for
nonprofits and hopefully you can use the
power of what you do to create some
really awesome visualizations as well so
i'm just gonna highlight a couple areas
where that we're thinking about working
so these aren't things that are green
lighted the area's we're thinking about
working on so obviously one thing that
we're thinking about is how can google
be helpful in disaster response you know
hurricanes cyclones that sort of thing
and in the past what we do we've done
such as when cyclone nargis hit meeting
Myanmar and killed as you remember about
140,000 people immediately make
available imagery and data that helps
the red here is the hardest hit zones
but you also you know seeing a crisis
response situation that's that speed is
very important getting all the
information available in one central
place is important you know groups like
the Red Cross want to be able to get up
and say look we have shelter here or
here the roads that are down or here
bridges that are up here are hospitals
people on the ground want to upload
videos you know we want to have access
to all sorts of different information
feeds and types you know we want news we
want blogs we want sourced data like
from epi net but we also want
crowdsourcing we want information from
crowds so this is an area that Google's
exploring to see how might we be helpful
in creating this kind of a platform
where we have both the imagery as well
as the the associated data and
communication tools another area we're
looking at is in Christians world and
his team's really looking at this which
is how can we use some of the remote
sensing data that has very rich data
associated with each pixel and how can
we look at changes over time monitoring
those changes over time to detect things
like deforestation so this simple photo
shows
in Google Earth using the historical
function you can look back at 1975 at
this area and the Brazilian rain forest
and then you can look 25 years later and
see what's happened to it so this is
just you know one example imagine if you
could do this with a huge huge data
sources run algorithms against it hosted
in the cloud the reason why this is
important for something like
deforestation is that you know we're
coming up on the post Kyoto global
negotiations on in Copenhagen and
there's a real effort afoot to make
forests worth more whole than dead you
know right now there's just the perverse
incentives that people can go in and do
logging and make money but there's no
there's no market now that captures all
the positive externalities associated
with rain forest not only in its linked
to climate changed we estimate that
deforestation is responsible for about
twenty percent of human-caused emissions
but you know the the Amazon is also the
lungs of the world provides twenty
percent of the of the oxygen
biodiversity the livelihoods associated
so how do you create a marketplace well
you can if you can effectively automate
the monitoring of force of deforestation
and then provides incentives for local
groups to keep force whole so this is
another area that we're looking at so
with that we'll wrap up but I think we
might have just a couple minutes to take
any questions thank you
any questions for Christian or myself
yeah so do you have any method of
validating all this data before you put
it on like how do you know this is yeah
yeah we know you mean in Google Earth
hey google else yeah yeah okay um so we
provides some data here let me switch
back to earth and the the data in the
layers panel are things you start with
imagery so that's satellite imagery that
we buy from commercial companies we have
things like roads and borders and those
things and we have a team of people that
make check pretty carefully that that's
high quality data some of what we buy
from other sources but a lot of the data
in Google Earth is we want to encourage
everybody to create data and put their
own own layers on our tools and that
it's just like a web page you have to do
your own due diligence and see who
created it who created that layer we you
don't need our approval to to to
visualize your data on Google Earth but
the the layers that you highlight in the
awareness here are more curated and so
we write for example the layers in the
global away in the global awareness
folder here these are all from reputable
organizations that we've worked with but
they're all still labeled from those
organizations so it's it's it's their
data like Wikipedia um not for not for
these layers some of the individual
layers do have that kind of thing like
we have a youtube layer in here and we
actually have a Wikipedia layer if you
open up the geographic web and that uses
some of that user-generated confirmation
of the quality of the data so there's
it's interesting because there's a
dynamic right between validating and
speed so we saw with h1n1 people were
doing the same thing that Declan Butler
who's a reporter at nature had done in
publishing these layers very quickly and
there soon emerged this sort of global
spat about the
validity of some of the data and so then
you did see this sort of Wikipedia crowd
editing sourcing working with one
another to validate and then they did
create sort of these hybrid models where
you know you have to know someone to get
in to update it and yet still opened
semi-open to to balance the speed on the
validation point I wanted to point out
with flu trends that the US data was
validated against five years of
historical data it was just with Mexico
in the interest of time and because we
didn't have the truth data that we went
ahead and published with lots of caveats
to say this may be helpful but it's not
validated anything else yeah so I was
interested that some of the projects
that you've undertaken really seemed to
play to Google strengths like the flu
trends the ability to gather tremendous
amounts of data and analyze it and
others just seemed to sort of reflect in
interest that's not a priori tied to
google like hybrid cars or a green
energy generation is there a how do you
decide what you know which of the many
good works fit within your portfolio and
just to throw out one that I didn't care
about given Google's ability to move
information and such has there been any
thought to contributing to the
dissemination of information to you know
in regimes where such dissemination is
limited the way we saw sort of Twitter
being used in Iran recently I'm that
just as an example of one that really
does need to play To Your Strengths but
that I didn't see this cost yeah so it's
a really good question i mean the truth
is that we focused mostly we have a
series of filters that we use right as
we consider what we could do so one of
the filters is a big bad enough problem
is it going to affect not in tens of
hundreds of but millions of people on is
there a unique role for google is
there's something that we can do where
we have a real comparative advantage is
it something that our that our
engineering teams themselves could do
that or build on existing systems is it
something scalable and platform we don't
really do a lot of one-off proprietary
stuff we want to build platforms that
enable others to do
so we have a series of filters like that
that help us get to it on as far as
energy I think it's both because we are
a large and growing user of energy
ourselves and that our founders as well
as our CEO care passionately and believe
deeply in climate change and that we
don't we want to be a part of the
solution and not part of the problem so
that sort of drives our unique
perspective there you know as far as how
can our tools be used to help dissidents
to help access to information and in
repressive countries this is something
that is very very close to the heart of
Google we take content and free
expression very seriously we have a lot
of teams at Google I don't know if Chris
Bowen is still here but we have teams
outside of org that are looking at
government accountability and sharing of
information in the Iran example that you
just mentioned you know YouTube was very
helpful in terms of getting the smuggled
tapes out and published right away and
then made available to the world just
one thing on our end we also relaunched
far Farsi and Persian that same week no
in like with many games but a week after
when we were thinking about it but we
hadn't felt the quality was quite as
good as our other translations because
there's a dearth of parallel text
between the Persian language or Farsi
and English so we had trouble perfecting
it but we got it out anyway because of
exactly what you were thinking so I
think we're out of time maybe we should
just take one more question before we
guys let you eat or maybe we'll just let
you eat all right we vote for let you
eat okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
