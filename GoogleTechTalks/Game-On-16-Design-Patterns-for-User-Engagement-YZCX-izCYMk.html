it's my pleasure to introduce nadiad
arachova in case you're not familiar
with Nadia's work she's probably in
addition to her day job as a user
experience designer on local search he's
probably our number one expert on
gamification and adding game of game
mechanics into software development when
I had the pleasure to meet her a year
ago I was recruiting for what we call
eventually called the game design
advisory board which was a group of
people who had actually worked in the
industry to give advice to mostly
internal teams and projects and little
skunk works projects eventually we've
got some external clients as well
including Google News adwords and
youtube and that a lot of that is due to
nadia's existing long list of clients so
hopefully she'll give us this slide deck
and take lots of notes because she's one
of the best in the business thank you
hello thank you for coming um we're
going to talk today about how to design
for user engagement and this talk is a
redo of at Agra they gave at south by
southwest of this March here's the clue
about how you should listen to this talk
we're going to talk about a lot of
design patterns a lot of solutions and
you should be listening for the one
solution that's applicable for your work
if you find one solution that you can go
back to your desk and apply to your work
so that users are more engaged you have
one you have been successful that's what
you should do listening for one design
pattern so all right you already know
about me from Matt's introduction I work
is a senior game mechanic and user
experience designer here google and my
background is in game design i designed
for kids at leapfrog and for all ages
for mobile mobile games for backbone
I've done projects with MIT and I first
started working on game mechanics at
razorfish which is a digital agency well
since it's a fun topic I want to start
with a fun yusuke a surpri we're going
to visit the site called i can has
cheezburger calm is that familiar
alright so this cat and dog are together
in the cat says i love my blanket and
then this cat says I'm up here at the
same time every day I think I'm in a rut
and this one says sanity runs from my
family and then just as I saw three of
those I got a pop of this says I have
found the cheeseburger collectible it's
called charts and they say log in to
claim your collectible don't have an
account join today so I go there I said
of my account I create my first law you
know how to do that before but they've
made it easy and as soon as I submit my
low I get the trophy they say I made the
funny and I can go see my badge so I I
go see my badge and I see that I have
made one of five different things that I
could be doing and if I keep going I
could eventually get a BA in virology I
also see that there's other people
who've won this bad recently so see like
a whole slew of people that I don't know
that you've been going through the CMOS
process as i have and i see that i have
trophies and collectibles and gifts a
whole tally board so that's very
interesting what has happened here is
the dis company i can has cheezburger
which is already super engaging it's one
of the most popular sites on the web
he's teamed up with big Dorner to
introduce game mechanics into their site
and to reward the lawyer users the
result is the registrations has
increased by two hundred percent
immediately after the launch of the
trophies and they have rewarded 63
million user actions which were
previously done by the users without any
feedback and they have given away 1.5
million trophies in the first four four
months in other words they have engaged
the users so what has happened here as
well is that there's been a whole new
language developed that didn't exist on
the web about five years ago with the
trophies with the burgers for rating we
have voting we have sharing we have
papas all of these kind of game
mechanics that we used to see more in
games and not so much in web
applications are now a new language that
exists from the
and this is what we're going to tease
apart today we're going to see how we
can apply this tour to a work in making
applications so let's take a moment an
overview what's happening with game
mechanics right now game mechanics the
design patterns that promote play and
play like engagement there's many
definitions in the industry that's mine
it works for me design patterns are
repeatable solutions to design problems
so when you put them together you kind
of have lego blocks you have one block
and another block and then you make
something unique so this is how you
should be using design patterns by
picking the ones that are applicable for
you and that's all your problem and
putting them together in novel ways and
remember you're listening for the one
game mechanic that will be useful for
your project or maybe more there's a lot
of companies that they using game
mechanics for the work meant for square
rocket recyclebank epic win tour awards
nike+ there's even a company that's
creating game mechanics into
toothbrushes so that you can be more
motivated to brush your teeth everything
is getting gamified there's a lot of
thinkers that are writing about this
field there's people who look at it from
the perspective of marketing and they
say they hit the marketing of the new
generation it's a lot more fun it's it's
a new version of loyalty points these
people i J Jane McGonigal better looking
from the perspective of using games to
make life better in general and her book
realities broken is very interesting
read on how to do that this obviously
people who are looking at from the game
design perspective and trying to expand
the field and a lot of writers you know
such as the one who created the WebP
reputation systems all look already
looking into how exactly to apply to
building social engagement there's even
a conference about gamification which is
called the gamification summit and they
say that gamification is the new black a
little bit of research most people use
game mechanics to promote user
engagement they can also be used for
brand loyalty brand awareness these are
the made the major goals in most
companies that they're using game
mechanics right now are in the stage of
education the Lord
about it and they're going to dip their
toes in the water there's fewer
relatively that they're completed but
we're going to see more and more of that
coming the spending the project is
spending on game mechanics is also
expected to increase which is going to
be about the third of the social media
marketing overall it's a big number with
all of this attention to game kind some
people say there's game mechanics
fatigue these things are going to work
for the first three months and that
they're not going to be engaging and I'm
going to see it everywhere and then it's
not going to be fun anymore so what I
say to this is this is powerful stuff it
goes beyond budgets and in n simple kind
of reward systems it can be it can
really tap into profound ways in which
people think in which to get motivated
to do stuff so the field is growing and
we only becoming more aware of the power
in the ways that we can apply these
designs in your designs are growing and
again it's so much more than points and
badges which the first thing that people
try when they start implementing game
mechanics so let's look into some design
patterns I'm going to look at 16 overall
I created these when I was consulting
with my clients I realized that I always
kind of run my mind through all the
options okay they have a problem and I'm
trying to solve their problem to
increase user engagement what kind of my
tools so created to box of these design
patterns that i always think through and
i have us you know spread this in three
separate aspects of the user journey and
the three separate things that we always
want people to do we want people to come
and try our application we want them to
bring their friends and then we want
them to come back simple as that so
we're going to look at these three
categories and how game mechanics work
in these categories so the first
category is come and try it looking you
know like you're very inviting
application and it's easy for the users
to understand what the rules are what
they're supposed to do where they're
supposed to click first so the patterns
that you can discuss our visual
storytelling visual cues tutorials
responsive objects reward schedule and
disincentives so one of my favorites and
the simplest ring too
use is visual storytelling when you play
a game they're trying to have as little
tags there to introduce you to the rules
as possible you watch other players you
look at like I quantified journeys you
look at cartoons anything in order to
make it easier for you to grab the rules
so for example a Japanese game that I
like called Rob rabbits is using cartoon
style introduction to every little
minigame that they let you play so they
let you know what this is going to be
about you generally saving a girl here
and trying to win her affection so do
using these colorful cartoons to let you
know these are the rules this is what
you're going to be doing so when you
look at visual storytelling in websites
you see that it can also be applied
groupon is letting me know that you have
three things that you do you get it you
shared you enjoy it and it looks like a
pretty picture and perhaps even better
it's like the four steps that there is
place that explains it car I mean
Zipcars were like a new a new thing
people didn't know how they work when
you turn it into icons when you break
the user journey into something that's
visual it's so much faster for somebody
to get it then you really want that you
want people to grok what your
application is about at the first class
within the first second another thing
that you can do in order to now that
you've gotten their attention you
explain what you are pissed about you
can use visual cues to direct the first
click that you're going to get with so
many options in so many places to click
users so sometimes lost and they leave
your site you don't want a short visit
so how games do it is they very awful
have this big kind of giant yellow
blinking arrows that they click here and
then they walk you through our serious
steps that you're supposed to do in
order to understand what the application
is about this is from city of immortals
well Facebook created a click here
moment when they were introduced in
places on mobile they darken the entire
screen and just left a little kind of
spotlight over the one application they
were trying to promote the new
application for places there is no
choice you have to click there they
really got your attention you may not
always be able to get this working on a
desktop you can't always dark inventors
but you can use like a brighter color
you know in order to direct attention to
things like did you know so the entire
Pandora application is blue but for the
did you know like let me tell you about
this feature of the UCL oh it's a little
more you know visible and people can get
a clue about what they're supposed to be
looking at well directing the tension
cannot happen in very structured form is
what I call tutorial on Rails a tutorial
on Rails is basically like getting your
to commit like five six seven steps the
direct that are required and you're
supposed to be driving through them as
if you are in a little choo-choo train
so you can get from the point where
don't know anything about an application
to the point where you kind of get it so
zynga is a fantastic example of the use
of tutorials they have studied every
step they studied what works in all
Jinian avatar do not need an avatar how
much text should be on the screen so
they have perfected what the tutorial
entails so that you're not lost when you
when you're looking at their games
tutorials an onboarding on Rails exists
in many applications so ribbon here is
for example game the teaches your dog
Microsoft Word it breaks down all the
different things you're supposed to know
about word from the simple to the deep
into a game getglue is also interesting
because before they let you explore the
application at all they make your eight
ten movies that that you know of and
this is how you learning about what
you're going to be doing later which is
after you get into get glue and to
create a taste profile you have a whole
lot of choice on the screen you couldn't
actually see what the application is but
you are doing the action that's going to
be core to you success in the in India
cloth droids another interesting pattern
is the idea of responsive objects so in
games everything is trying to create a
big bang for your buck every touch is
supposed to be a surprise for example in
this little game when you touch the
screen the Sun this does the Sun you
know the Sun rises so you've caused
literally with one-touch you've gone
from day two from
today it's a big kind of bang for your
buck and game designers always thinking
how can we apply assets we will get
their attention explosions flowers fart
sound effects whatever is going to work
to get you your such attention whatever
is going to give them options and make
everything in this world respond to them
and make them curious to explore so you
know you may you may have simple and
more complicated ways to do that it's
interesting that the web has moved from
like a series of like pages that are all
about text and maybe a couple of buttons
to up space we have really interactive
objects and examples of interactive
objects are for example the login boxes
into meant you enter your email and they
say okay that box is listening to me
it's not only telling me when I'm wrong
it's kind of giving a thumbs up for the
second step so I know that I'm one step
closer to to login anything you know
where my money is responsive objects are
also the tweets by default you only see
one one link into a tweet and as soon as
you hover over it you have so many more
options now you can visit the users
profile you can favor this retweet the
Train reply this object responded to you
it looked simple and then it opened up a
fan of effects that you could be using
another design pattern for initial user
engagement is the deal of reward
structure well silly voice really fun
because there's always these coins and
stars that you can connect the screen is
blinky and big they are rewarding you
for every single action and there is a
popular same from Sid Meier who is the
game designer of civilization who says
that you cannot over reward the player
in the first 10 minutes you cannot make
it to fun cannot make it too simple you
cannot make it to rewarding in the
beginning so think about it it's not
going to be the way we engage the users
when they come back but in the beginning
you really want to remove all obstacles
that you can and be as like welcoming
and rewarding as you can so
there are some applications that they're
really good about making you feel good
right away from from the get-go shopkick
gives you six sixty kickbox just because
you signed in and Foursquare gives you a
newbie badge just because you know you
created your first chicken that's great
like it's not a big deal but they make
you feel good and they also introduce
you together there'll be more bad just
later I am view gives you points for
trying new things on your avatar which
is crucial in looking going in the world
the hairs like all these chat systems
and where you avatar really matters so
again like the over rewarding is good
for beginners but you actually want to
challenge the experts so you you have
some badges in fourth quarter the easy
to achieve and some that are really hard
and incidentally a lot of people are
asking like oh was it so clever that
foursquare didn't tell you how you
achieve the missions and so he had to go
on the web and like you know Google how
you like and walk the social ID badge
actually it wasn't by design they just
didn't have enough time to implement
like the tips how how you unlock the
badges but it turned into a kind of a
puzzle hunt cuz people were then trying
to like get these badges that they're
hard to get in writing blogs about them
and so they create additional engagement
just by this kind of fun process of
discovery another example of challenging
the experts is the achievements in
plants vs zombies how many of you have
unlocked the multiculturalist badge in
plants vs zombies one I you have to tell
me how you do it because like I played
the game so many times to unlock that
one like last achievement and I couldn't
but that made me much more interested
because there was something hard there
that they're dangling in front of me and
how many of you play plants vs zombies
okay when I need you need to try the
multicultural is bad let it go if you
manage okay so this is about the rewards
but how do we what do you do with these
incentives because games you have
disincentives for sure right like you
can die you won't even pack ok let's
disinfect um you can use them there's
there's interesting things to do stick
is an application that helps you achieve
your goals by
signing up for negative rewards so you
say like if I don't lose weight I'm
gonna have to contribute money to the
abortion clinic of America or I have to
contribute to gun control or something
that we kind of make it fun you know
it's not what you want to have happen if
a disincentive of sorts but they've
turned it around I'm glad you guys like
that um grockle is one of my favorite
startups applying game mechanics and
they're really cool because they're
actually tracking every step of the way
they have like a super PhD quantitative
wizard who is helping them analyzed all
their ib tests and how users are
behaving so one thing that they learn is
that negative points like Crockett is a
site where you do test prep like tofu
SATA else at all these things really
aren't fun but they create a community
to make it more more interesting so
first they started by giving users
negative points if they get the answer
wrong but then they found that if you do
an a/b test with people who are getting
minus points versus does it or not those
are getting the minus points are not
sticking around so much they feel like
maybe they've been punished if you like
maybe it's too hard so they're not
sticking around so they they went from
minus minus half a point to minus the
quarter of a point like we're using the
disincentive and still compared to those
people who aren't getting negative words
they were still like not getting the
users as engaged as they would be
without negative points so that's
something that they're considering going
away with those users weren't ready for
that maybe at a more advanced level but
like as soon as those starting the
application you don't really work for
them so in summary how do you say to you
users come and try it you can try a
bunch of patterns you can try visual
storytelling or chooses icons cartoons
visual visual kind of storytelling
visual cues which kind of points them
here click here you can use tutorials
responsive objects a good reward
schedule that really is like ramped up
in the beginning at harder afterwards
and then you can apply this incentives
careful the next subject is how you
create something in here in the social
how do you tell users to bring your
friends
we're going to review a few of the many
options we're going to look at what it
means to have a gated trial to our gifts
opportunities for social feedback a
reputation system sharing milestones and
my favorite which is mischief a gala
trial is kind of like in dodgeball where
you need to form a team before you can
even access the game you probably
remember these facebook applications
that require you to send the email to 10
of your plan of your facebook friends
before you can even get into the
application well it's a bad user
experience but it's actually a fantastic
way for them to become viral and it's
actually there's the statistic that kind
of the industry has agreed upon is that
if users have five friends like first I
heard this one koala I've heard this
from the facebook news feed if the users
have five friends they're much more
likely to become return users and the
way we interpret that finding is that
users are getting first of all their
friends are explaining what the game is
they would explain goal a much better
than any kind of like an attempt that we
can do as designers and the friends are
helping them the bucket so if something
is not working your friends will be a
technical support and also you friends
create the content and the real reason
to come back so having Kevin like a
community to begin with it's very
important it creates engagement this is
part of the reason why a lot of startups
are using facebook connect so that
you're coming with your community as
soon as you stand through the door and
it's interesting because this first kind
of initial few moments are so important
to get right that in a redesign Twitter
increased the number of screens that
they got into application only to make
sure that people are following more
people on Twitter so they wanted to
introduce you to more forward to more
people to follow more people who are
creating content from the get-go and
that was more important than the
friction that's introduced by having my
many screens these are some of the
objects that a dr design and books and
themes that they suggest for you to
follow another interesting pattern is
the idea of social feedback so social
feedback is like the quick kind of
interactions that users can do
to play with each other so for example I
play Silvio and my friend John places
you in London we're not playing it at
the same time we're playing
asynchronously John pushes the button
and he helps me out and then when i
login i see that he's helped me in and i
push another button and they help him
out so this kind of like a social
cooperation he's been reduced to verbs
into buttons that the users can push to
interact with each other and feel the
real the real emotions that you do get
your friend help you how do you do this
in a social application my favorite is
the thank you button so add Vark which
is one of the companies the google
acquired here's the thank you button
built into the interaction between users
the it's a site where you ask questions
and people people answer them for you
and so to complete the conversation to
be polite but also to reengage the
person who answered your question you
push thank you they get an email and
they say somebody somebody really like
you're somebody really like to reply
that feels good it's very quick I didn't
have to type in anything the thank you
button is becoming more popular because
I saw after advert I saw who are using
it in their reply so it's one of the
options you can go a step further than
just a simple button and do like a
selection of buttons for structuring the
feedback and then some space to write
which is what Yelp does for the users so
the reason why this is powerful is that
as you know like a lot of social boards
like they can be a source of mischief
people can be saying bad things but if
you say like this is the compliment
button and then you're giving them like
10 versions of what they could say in
terms of compliments you're directing
their thoughts so much towards the
positive behavior that I do believe that
it they're more likely to be
complimentary and nice and polite you've
kind of set the stage for that and
you've also given them a lot of options
kind of helping them along what they
could be doing another way to give
social feedback but in the public way is
through the voting and the liking
mechanisms so a vote and like is not
something that you just give to one
person in something to say to the entire
community so now your friends are paying
attention to that post that you voted
for
reputation um is what happens when you
get the points and the behaviors create
created from all the social feedback
that you've created and all the users
generate generated content you can help
you can treat the reputation in
different ways you can keep it to
yourself so you're scoring your users
but you're not telling them and this
helps you know who are you most engaged
users if you had a promotional campaign
and you couldn't give it to everyone you
should be giving it to you most engaged
users so it's important to know that's
how you can use reputation without
telling them or you can tell users you
have a high reputation and then they'll
be you have a different standing in the
community so reputation simple you know
in in silver you have like different
stats that you're achieving that's
visible to everyone and in the real
world or in the world of ebay for
example you have a top rated seller and
so much safer bet to buy something from
that seller as opposed somebody who
doesn't have it one-up me is a forum
that uses like that you have a top voter
that's also something that's used in the
other side so as soon as somebody gets a
lot of points that you calculate behind
the screen for their votes you give them
a top voter batch which is displayed for
everyone and also gives more weight to
their vote so that becomes a way for
them to kind of really weigh in their
opinion sharing achievements is another
way that you can engage users socially
so xbox live it's a great example of how
you share your achievements it's a
community around you gaming stuff coming
if you play the xbox so sharing
achievements I'm sure you know like that
happens on Twitter when foursquare badge
is getting log you probably remember
when your friends were playing Farmview
in the beginning and all of you feed in
facebook was getting spammed it's kind
of like a double-edged sword because you
learn about this this thing that your
friends are doing but you know that game
the application can also burn out the
channel and so eventually the game stuff
was banished to its own channel so that
it's not polluting your screen it's
always kind of tricky because maybe only
five percent of the users will use the
sharing and only like five percent of
the friends who come
so is that good enough for the
ninety-five percent who got spammed I
mean a lot of companies are saying yes
to that but this kind of like a decision
of that you have to do verse spamming
versus getting more users and we got to
my favorite part which is mischief so I
don't know if you remember but on April
first you could TP the farm of one
different in fact no easy to achieve I
don't know if any of a new friend tpg
but um it was the fun way to direct the
negative energy that inevitably arises
when you have a community so mischief is
like really well used in chatroulette
how many of you know how they make money
you do that's it so just released video
site we get matched at random with
somebody who's going to be a chat buddy
there's a mr. there you know some people
not as appropriate as they should be and
if you get flag multiple times you get
redirected to a porn site and they
basically you know collect the change
kiss you have left and so in summary we
talked about a few things you can get
the trial for your users and require for
them to form a team to start you can
allow ways to create social feedback
which are really powerful mechanisms by
simplifying it to simplifying the user
interaction between two users to a verb
and making a button out of it or
creating multiple choices like in the up
complement system creating reputations
that you share and not share with your
users sharing milestones and then
mischief alright so the last portion of
the talk is about how you create return
engagement and sometimes that can be
very difficult and sometimes you know
sites launch and then they don't see the
users come back only you know five
percent of the users come back like is
this good enough is not good enough well
regardless of how you feel about you
return numbers you always know that you
want to increase them so we're going to
talk about some ways to do that so we're
going to talk about advanced user pass
content and locks quest q
time pressure and scar see advance pass
a somewhat like you have on a mountain
we have the same mountain but people
with different skills are sharing it
have the black diamonds and then you
have the bunny slope the experience is
very different so when you're designing
an application you kind of need to think
about it like that what are the
different kind of user behaviors and
types of users that they have and how do
you create a different experience for
them based on how different their
behaviors so yelp has a good example of
a different user roles like if you're
just a regular user of help which is
probably the majority you're mostly
spending time at the search results page
so that pages of is optimized for that
kind of consumption if you're in the
elite squad there's a portion of the
site that you care more about which
involves your profile it involves you
know the community events that are
happening around at the communication
that you have around that so you have
two different experiences of the side
and you're not necessarily spending time
at the same side so it's optimized
differently for those two different
types of users another example of
advanced you know use the passes the
idea that you can achieve something if
you keep going so in the beginning
you're going to be engaged and getting
badges on foursquare and if you keep
going you eventually become the mayor so
there's something that's dangled in
front of you I had an interesting case
where I really wanted to become the
mayor of my favorite brunch place in noe
valley and it turned out that the
waitress is the mayor it was really hard
to be her but I kept going I spent a lot
of money and a lot of my friends to come
to this brunch place and eventually a
bit the waitress and everybody in the
restaurant knew it so this advanced user
pass option that they created for me
worked out would worked out for the
restaurant we worked out for me because
I got something out of a chink mayorship
so content and logs is another design
pattern to engage for forgetting users
to come back how many of you play Angry
Birds yes all right the rest of you
should give because I'm sure you heard
about it we start and you know unlock
some levels but as soon as you're not
level you know one and two even start
playing you see that there's like a
gazillion
more levels to unlock more screens that
they're coming with more content so you
know that what you playing now is just
the tip of the iceberg there's a lot
more coming for you but you can't
actually see what these levels are so
you need to keep like you know even if
you're really good player you have to
play throughout the beginning levels to
get to the in you know to the harder
level so content and locks in this case
work so this is a a model that's going
to be showing a different dress every
day of the month and so they start with
day one she's wearing this dress and
then they have her silhouette cut out
for day two day three day four that
letting you know there's more coming
she's going to show you more dresses but
it's not obvious you know what it look
like so you better come back tomorrow
quest Q is very interesting and in games
it's used to queue up optional things
that you could do to make your game
experience more fun so for example i
really like zombie farms it's a natural
if you finish plants vs zombies don't be
farm is really fun after they let you
know that if you plant you know you can
complete the mission by planting a
special kind of zombie vice you know
collecting a special kind of gift by
raising a special kind of species and so
they've killed them on the left side
side with the application is the bunch
of things that you could be doing don't
have to we're not going to stop your
gameplay for that but it's a fun font in
that you could try so quest cues a lot
of people talk about the progress meter
in linking but what's even more
interesting is how they turn it into a
quest Q so you have to add a position
add your education at the picture all
these kind of things that they really
need to get you to do in order for the
site work and like working on a resume
it's not fun so if you can like break it
into quest cues that makes it more
powerful you can use the same idea in
your application if there's many steps
these users should be doing or could be
doing you can suggest them like that i
also like epic one is kind of like a
time management device well you're the
ones taking your own quest cuse you're
choosing what you want to engage in so
for example when i was working on my
lecture i created a quest queue for me
to basically analyze the wall cat which
we started with and i said it's going to
be 200 points and it's going to be your
feet of social and then like i completed
it and then I checked it off my list so
I
setting my own quest cues and that was
an interesting way from each engage with
with my time management and speaking of
time time pressure is like probably one
of the oldest game mechanics that
anybody has tried so you know the chest
can become a lot more fun and an expert
player with added you know time time
pressure he has a whole set of different
set of constraints with the auto-ship
super engaging so time pressure is fun
to try like on so excited like super the
so I'm sure you guys know about super
right like you have time pressure to bid
on objects be a dollar and you can get a
dewy vuitton bag or bring a laptop ebay
also has time pressure because you're
doing you know like a public auction and
there's only one sec unless we better be
bidding now I'm sure there's at least a
few of you have been there you know late
at night waiting for your auction 22
coming off so that you can be doing
you're getting your rewards ask our city
is another one of those kind of older
but also super interesting game
mechanics and it can be used when you
have a whole bunch of options if you
make some of them rare like for example
in in the in the zinc game they have a
lot of fishes that you can be engaging
but they say they make some of them VIP
and maybe they even have a tier system
where you know there's three types of
VIP fishes one two and three in the
series super hard to get and so you're
going to add some people that will be
playing really hard to get that object
which is really scarce because it says
something about them that they have
achieved this and that they have the
pride in their community of having done
this scarce object so favorite examples
of the use of scarcely is the
million-dollar home page which is a
student in Britain wanted to raise a
million dollars great idea he wanted for
the for his education and he created the
website with a million pixels and sold
each of them for a dollar so company
could pay a dollar put their logo on he
made the million dollars how about scar
see is also used to know in light ways
or what light way
application in hot pot which is a google
social rating site so we were we were
finding the team a hot pot but finding
that five stars really doesn't get you
like the best distribution always a lot
of places end up again he read about
four stars and then you can't really
distinguish and compare them so we added
the six star the best ever and you only
get 10 best Evers which means you have
to like think about this your rating
over time you know I've used up my best
ever on this place but I have this new
favorite and then you have to switch
tomorrow and for your friends the best
ever is a great signal that you really
really are recommending this place so it
played the valuable role in the
community by the fact that it's cars in
summary we reviewed 5 in for getting
users to come back thinking about
different paths for the beginners and
advanced users and however else you can
segment your user behavior creating
content and locks so they don't know
there's more to do over time creating
quest cues to suggest ways in which they
could be engaging with your application
and time pressure and scarcity which are
tried and true not appropriate
everywhere but again you listening for
the one that can be helping you did you
find one that could be helping your
designs I take these houses and yes and
if you have more questions you can talk
to me after so the beauty of game
mechanics is that they're measurable
behaviors that's part of the reason why
I'm in this game because it's really fun
to have a hypothesis and then test it
out with users do an a/b test collect
the data if you haven't if this is the
first time you doing an a/b test you can
be collecting the data without the game
mechanic that you're doing then launch
the game mechanic to a part of the
population and see what happens and it's
amazing to see return on kind of like
your design hypothesis you can make it
better so good news it's measurable it
you have to be prepared to measure any
trait because it's not always going to
get the behaviors that you are expecting
for again like rocket when they had the
negative points they thought that going
to make it more fun and retain the users
but it was doing the opposite so you
have to be prepared if you're measuring
something you also have to iterate and
then
that each each pattern in each stage of
the user engagement his unique metrics
that can be applied to it one site and
one company the taking is great for
metrics and I really enjoy talking to
them because they they have a dashboard
of metrics for game mechanics a sponge
ball I don't know if you've recently
been to the lecture the day that they
gave a go-go but um they're basically
creating a dashboard behind the game
mechanics that they are playing for
their customers so in this view you're
tracking the total number of users the
new users and the active users in the
next view using the top game mechanics
that we're introducing the side like
winning a trophy sending our daily bonus
to your friends watching a video
whatever they were tracking is
introduced this behavior and then you
think is it going up or is it going down
and in the case of sweet going down
these things that you can do about it so
for example bunch ball was working on
the virtual housewife throw down which
like a side supporting Bravo of a famous
TV show so they're seeing that users are
really not giving gifts to each other
because they could see it on the
dashboard and that was important for
them to reengage the community so they
create a pop-up that said Oh remember
that you can give gifts to your friends
and then this or the behavior went up
it's very rewarding it gives you a sense
of control and if you gives you a sense
you can achieve the things that you've
set out to do with your users so in
summary game mechanics are so much more
than points and badges they're growing
list of patterns the industry is getting
creative and we all make it more of them
we all adding to them as we're
experimenting and measuring and
iterating these are the ones that I
frequently think about that you probably
discovering your own and you can you
know always you know as you as you
discovering things think about what are
you trying to solve I try to create an
issue engagement to bring friends or to
get users to come back because then you
know what you're going to be tracking
and at the end I want to thank the
companies that let me interview them in
order to prepare for the stock I talked
to startups like rocket and gowalla club
site which is
a TV show the cuse game mechanics wanna
pee I'm to research branch ball victors
