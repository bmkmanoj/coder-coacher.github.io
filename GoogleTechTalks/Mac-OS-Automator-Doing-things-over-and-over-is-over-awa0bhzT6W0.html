he's the product manager for AppleScript
and Automator over at Apple I've been
asked to remind you that if you have any
questions that involve Google
confidential information they should be
weighted you should wait with them until
after the videotaping and stopped
because we might be doing stuff with a
video later all right
also wait till I get my pen and paper
outside write everything down like we
could actually use it anyway you know
it's like talking another language you
guys are over here oh no no no we'd be
able to poke the ogre water-cooler put
the two together and beat why live they
don't know what it is so I just started
off my talk doing impressions that's
great okay I'm gonna go from there
I'm Sal Sequoia and I'm the Apple script
and Automator product manager for Apple
Computer for the last nine years nine
years for Apple script Automator z' is
new it just came out in our last oh s
release which is called tiger and it's
one of the many features including
dashboard and spotlight and a lot of the
hundred and fifty new features that were
in tiger one of which is Automator and
my bag my area of expertise deals with
automation and automation is the
lifeblood of any small business or
anybody trying to get out from
underneath a barrage of work and things
to do and it's an incredibly powerful
tool because what it does is it lets you
program without having to know any
programming
it's basically drag-and-drop answer a
question or two and in no time you're
automating the kind of things you want
to do with the computer and automate or
scope covers just about everything that
you can do with the OS from getting very
SQL to getting very photograph or even
movie oriented or podcast oriented or
webpage or HTML or you know whatever
kind of data you're dealing with
Automator is really good at passing
information between the various parts of
a workflow so I guess the best way to
show Automator is just to show it so
what I'm going to do today
with the giant cursor is
just give you an overview of what
Automator is some of the kind of things
it does I'm going to open up some
projects we're actually gonna look at
the code I'll show you where you can go
to get code samples and do your own
Automator actions today and just answer
some questions so anybody have any
questions before we begin
yes in the front okay so I'm gonna start
with something simple no matter where I
talk and no matter who I talk to what
level of geekdom they're in it's always
good to just start with a basic example
to get the concept across of what
Automator is so I'm going to start with
something simple and then we're gonna
get more complex so on my desktop here
now you know why I have the giant cursor
it's really easy to see isn't it so I
have a folder of some image files now
these files are typical of the kind of
files that you get off of your digital
camera right they have these names that
only the camera understands I don't know
what 200 95 207 is but somehow that's
related to the vacation I took down in
Aruba now what I want to do is I just
like to rename some files simple a
simple task to do right renaming files
well those Mac users of you how do you
rename a file in Mac OS 10 you click on
it okay so you select it you don't click
it twice you select it once and then you
wait a second then you click it again
then a name becomes selected you select
the part of the name that you want to
change you type that part and then you
either click someplace else or hit a
return key that's the way you rename a
file well that's fine if you only
renaming five or six files but what
happens if you have to rename 200 files
300 files 400 files 500 files what do
you do open up the terminal and you
start going good but if you don't know
shell or whatever language you're trying
to type into the terminal you're pretty
much up against the wall and even then
there are easier ways than going into
the turn
and let me show you one I'm just going
to select these images by drawing a
rectangle around them click on one with
the ctrl key down or right-click and
you'll notice that there is a menu now
in the contextual menu find a contextual
menu call create workflow under
Automator I'm going to select that and
what will happen is this little guy ogle
Boeing Boeing Boeing and jump up and
down
that's Auto the Automator and this is
automate ur this is the interface for
Automator this is a workflow window and
let me describe a little bit about what
the user interface is and how it works
and I'll show you how the workflow is
created on the left hand side you'll
notice that at the top there's a
blinking cursor with a magnifying glass
that's the search field so I can type in
any phrase or any term like renaming or
photo or catalog or something related to
what I'm trying to automate and actions
related to that will appear on the list
this left hand list is a library of all
the different automatable applications
on your computer and when you click one
for example if I click the finder here
the actions related to that application
appear in the actions list next to it
when you select an action information
about that action appears down here in
this description field it tells you what
the action does what kind of data it
accepts and what kind of data it
provides and over here on the right hand
side is the workflow area with Automator
you create these workflows that contain
actions and each action relates to a
step in your workflow or part of what
you do now since we started automated by
selecting things in the finder the first
action that was added to our workflow is
something called get specified finder
items those are the ones I had selected
and this action just contains a list of
all of the files that I have selected
it's job is just the past that
information on to the next action in my
workflow that's all it does so what I
want to do is I want to rename so I'm
gonna search for a renaming action by
just placing my cursor there and typing
the word rename and the action that is
in the finder group of actions that
relates to renaming things is called
rename finder items it says this action
changes the name of the finder items
passed into it well that sounds exactly
like what I want to use so I'm going to
click on that item in the list and just
drag it over here to the bottom of the
workflow you'll notice that the cursor
changes to the green ball with the plus
meaning I'm about to add something to
the workflow and I let go well one of
the interesting things about Automator
is that it has a lot of intelligence
built into the background of how this
application works so its senses that
you're about to perform an action on
these files it's a permanent action
you're going to change their names and
it said hey I see that you're about to
change the names of these files would
you like me to copy them first and then
you could work on the duplicates instead
and if I chose yes or add it will add a
copy action after the first action that
copies the files makes a duplicate of
them and then I can rename them if I
don't want to do that step I can remove
the action just by placing the cursor
over here and clicking that little box
so here's my workflow I'm going to take
these items and then I'm going to
perform a renaming process on them now I
can choose to do a variety of renaming
operations this action view which is
this little rectangle of interface here
each action has its own view and this
action view has a different set of
options that you can do for renaming
because you know there's a lot of
different ways you can rename things for
example you can add a date or time you
can add some text the name you can
change the case of it you can make it
sequential you can find and change text
inside of that file name as well
what I'm looking for is something
sequential I'd like each file to be
named vacation or one vacation 0:02 that
kind of a thing so I'm going to check
make sequential and you'll notice that
the UI here changes so that it reveals
all the operations for making sequential
names I'm going to have a base name and
it's going to be called vacation and
you'll notice that as I type this
information into the action view that
over here you can see the example of how
it's going to look and I can choose to
place the number before the name or
after the name I can start the numbers
at a certain digit I can separate the
number by a period a dash a space an
underscore or nothing I could just have
it run right into it I'm going to use a
dash and I want to make all the numbers
three digits long
so it's vacation - oo one vacation - oh
oh - and that's it that's my whole
process right there so what I'm gonna do
is try to move this so that we can see
here I'm gonna make a little copy of
this go back okay so I'm gonna run this
workflow and you'll see when I run it
that all the names of the files were
automatically changed simple process
right we've created a workflow that took
those files and then renamed them now
that's a lot to go through if you just
want to rename some files can we take
this workflow and make it generic so
that I can use it at anytime I want on
any set of files well yeah you can by
default every Automator workflow can
accept input from some kind of a source
whether it's the finder whether it's an
application and it can take that
material or information it's passed to
it and work on it so since I'm not
always going to be renaming you the same
set of files here what I'm going to do
is just delete that action and keep this
one now I don't always want to rename my
files vague
I'm gonna place the word untitled in
there just to remind myself and then I'm
gonna click this options triangle here
to disclose this option show show action
when run now what this will let me do is
when I save this workflow and run it it
will show me that little bit of UI for
that action so that I could enter the
name that I want to use for that
particular set of files so now I'm going
to save the workflow go up to the file
menu and choose save as plug-in now one
of the interesting and powerful things
about Automator is that you can save it
so that your work clothes appear at your
point of need where you actually need
them and one of the spots that we're
looking at is the finder on my desktop I
want to say this is a plug-in for the
finder I could save it as a folder
action so that when files were dropped
into a folder the workflow would run on
those files I could save it as an iCal
alarm so that it runs at a certain time
I could save it as an image capture
process so that when I plug in camera in
that workflow automatically runs on the
images that get downloaded from the
camera I could save it as a print
workflow so that from the print dialog
of any application on Mac OS 10 I can
execute that workflow on the printed
material and I can say but also it's a
process if it runs from the global
script menu that you see up on the top
right of our menu bar for this case I'm
going to choose the finder I want to
have it be a Finder contextual menu I'm
going to choose rename finder items as
its name save it and now quit Automator
so if i want to rename some files now i
just select them hold down the ctrl key
or right-click and now you see that
there's my workflow process right here
on the contextual menu i choose rename
finder items and you see up here on the
menu bar there's a spinning cursor here
saying it's telling me which work which
item is running in my workflow and here
is that UI that i just was working with
and i can change the name to Yosemite
and now go continue so what I've done is
very quickly and easily created a tool
that I can use anytime I want now to
rename files on my desktop and I can
take this workflow that I've created and
share it with anybody else who's using
Mac OS 10 tiger because they have
Automator too and that means that they
can take advantage of this so I can
create workflows that my staff can use
to make their life easier to make their
work faster more consistent and more
accurate
that's the advantages of having
automation a simple example but it kind
of gives you the idea doesn't mmm
interesting semi mm-hmm
okay let's look at another example
involving websites because I hear you
guys do a lot of stuff with HTML and
websites and cool stuff so I'm gonna
launch Safari here now we've all seen
these kind of websites right we're you
know Joe Schmoe puts his family photos
up I do it too we all do it
hey everybody does you post it and
there's thumbnails and if you click one
of the thumbnails you get the pictures
you know the larger size you get the
little picture of the larger size who's
carried eat at Disneyland that's or
eating chocolate so these are very nice
photos and I'd like to add these photos
to my iPhoto collection on my computer
well how do you do that well I click
each one I get the big one and then I
drag it to the desktop and then I click
the next one and I grab the big one and
drag it to the desktop then I get them
all together and then I import them into
iPhoto is there an easier way to do this
of course like I said before Automator
handles a lot of different kinds of data
in this particular instance we're going
to use Automator to create a workflow
that automates the process of retrieving
large images from link thumbnails
a webpage download some imports them
into my iPhoto collection after making a
particular album for them as well so
since I'm going to be using Safari here
I'm gonna click my Safari category and
one of the actions that is available at
the top is called gets current webpage
from Safari it says this action gets the
URL of the web page that's displayed in
the front Safari window okay that's
pretty cool I can dig that and you'll
notice that it's up near the top and
that it has a grey bar next to it that's
a relevancy ranking Automator examines
what you're doing in your workflow and
tries to guess with the next set of
actions you would be using our and puts
them near the top so that if you have a
lot of actions there you don't have to
go searching for it and it senses that
while you're starting a new workflow so
one of the actions that starts a
workflow is something like that so I'm
gonna get the URL of that page that I'm
looking at now I want to get the image
URLs from that web page so I add that
and you see it has as a parameter of do
you want the images that are on that
page or linked from that page well I
want I don't want the thumbnails I want
the big images so I'm going to choose
link from those pages then I'm going to
download those images to my pictures
folder then I'm going to click my iPhoto
category over here and choose import
photos into iPhoto I'm going to make a
new album called CariDee and I can
delete the source images after importing
them because iPhoto makes a copy
automatically so there's my workflow get
the current webpage from Safari find
those linked images download them to my
computer and then put them into iPhoto
for me so I'll click run and you can see
that right next on the left side of the
action is a little spinning wheel
telling you that it's the action that's
being used right now it also shows at
the bottom of the window and that's
creating the new thing and importing it
into iPhoto automatically so there's my
new album of
all the images from that webpage
golfclap semi-interesting okay now again
can I'd like I did before can I take
this workflow and make it a tool that I
can use any time I hit a webpage like
that that's has photos that I want to
keep well yeah you can let's take a look
at what it takes to make that particular
workflow generic so I'm gonna go back to
Automator
well okay I'll use the current web page
that makes sense yep and I'm gonna find
the the linked images I can download
them the only thing that I really need
is every time I make them import into
iPhoto I don't want the same album I
want to see that little bit of Automator
UI when the workflow runs I'm going to
change the name here to untitled to
remind myself that and then go to the
options and choose show action when run
and now we're going to go back to save
as plug-in and this time I'm going to
save it as a plug into the script menu
and call it import linked images choose
save and quit Automator so the next time
I'm on a web page let's go over here and
choose like Sam and Emma
it isn't this is the most darling shot
in that cute they had there have one
here where they're at t that's good and
they have this Sam so these are some
great shots I want to add these into my
collection right so I go up to my script
menu and choose hey import linked images
so I run that and it brings up the UI
I'm going to call this Sam and Emma
so now using Automator I've created a
simple menu item a simple tool that can
be accessed from a menu so whenever I go
to a webpage as images I like I just run
this thing and it sucks them down and
puts them into my iPhoto collection in
an album that I name on the fly pretty
cool huh
Sam I interesting okay now let's take a
look at the family relative version of
this how many of you are the support
center for your immediate and
non-immediate family come on right we
all know it we love our relatives we
love our parents we love our our in-laws
we love our brothers and sisters but we
all know that we are we're like no no no
Cheryl no you don't click on that one no
okay okay no that's not the window click
on the desk no okay wait wait wait stop
don't click anything else right so is
there a way we could take like a
workflow like this if I have some photos
that I want to share with some family
members I can't count on them having the
wherewithal to go to the right page and
run this workflow I need to make
something that's even more I'm not going
to say bulletproof there's a better term
you know what I was going to say but I'm
gonna say bulletproof thing because I'm
politician that's the truth so let's see
army hero I'm gonna run a little script
an Apple script here to clean up a thing
okay so let's say that I have some
photos here of my niece Trina's wedding
right and I want to share these photos
so I want to make something that I can
send an email to all the relatives that
they just click this thing and it
automatically goes and gets the photos
and it puts them on their computer for
them automatically so how do I do that
well
it's kind of similar to what I did with
Automator before let's take a look at it
so this time I'm gonna go to my Safari
category because using Safari here and
I'm gonna choose get specified URLs this
action passes the specified URLs to the
next action okay I'll add that by
default it has a 1 URL and they're all
ready for Apple so I can remove that by
selecting and click - I don't know why
that got put in there but somebody
thought it was marketing but so now if I
want to add a URL to this I can drag and
drop them in from the finder I can do
whatever I want but I'm going to choose
this button here get current Sox Safari
page and it adds that URL into this
action so the result of this action will
just be that URL to that page now we
already know what the next action is
going to be and it's going to be get
image URLs get the ones that are linked
then I'm going to choose the download
I'll have them go into their pictures
folder and then I'm going to have a new
import photos I have it make an album
called Tom and Trina wedding and then
delete the source images so there's the
workflow that I'm going to give them go
to this URL get the image URLs off of
that page download those images import
those photos into iPhoto now instead of
saving as a plug-in this time I'm going
to choose save as and choose to save it
as an application let's put it on the
desktop and I'll call it get Tom and
Trina's photos and I'll quit
so now on my desktop I have this little
guy standing on home plate that's Otto
standing on home plate so I send this
little applet to the relative and an
email saying hey double-click this thing
and when they do it starts running goes
and gets the images it's downloading the
URLs makes the thing automatically puts
it in
voila instant happiness you are the good
son you are the good son-in-law you are
the perfect one you have one so there
you go so what we've seen is that
Automator can deal with a variety of
data it can deal with files it can deal
with URLs it can be saved in a variety
of formats it can be saved as a plugin
to the finder it can be saved as a
script menu item
it can even be saved as a self-running
droplet or applet or application like we
just did here so let's take a look at
another way that Automator can be used
and a little bit more geeky err fashion
any questions about this so far yes in
the back ah well that's their problem
that you have to get them on Macs yes
would it work with Firefox yes see in
that particular workflow it didn't
actually use the browser for anything it
just you passed it a URL and right the
question is she's asking what can I do
this with another browser sir besides
Safari not if you using the get current
webpage but if you're getting get
specified URL then you can pass in any
URL you want and then you get the
ability to have this automatic download
process the code that's used in these
Automator actions we'll be getting into
just a moment but basically that was
using core image io routines inside the
OS to do a curl command to the web page
to scan it and then it used pearl
departs it and then it passed it on to
another process for downloading so the
nice thing is that you don't have to
think about any of that do you all
you're doing is thinking about what are
the steps I want to accomplish and then
you're making this workflow yes over
there I'm sorry
can i comment on the security
implications of sending a self-running
application to somebody in an email yes
it's a very dangerous thing you don't
want your relative just doing that with
anybody but you if it's you if I'm
sending my father-in-law and the email
and I called him up on the phone and
said Harry run this thing he's gonna be
ok with it
what'd I tell you Illya the people that
I work with is is if you don't know who
it came from
never run it yes is there a way to look
in the application and see what it's
going to do before you run it if it's
not safe this is run only you can
actually drag the application back on to
Automator and it will open up the
workflow and show you what it's going to
do so you can go back that way another
question there was one over here yes ok
I'm missing a term in go-stop meaning
right yes yes yes so you can chain we're
close together if that's what the
question is or you can insert things
into workflows yes you can do that
there's actually an action called run
workflow it just appears as a name in
the list or you can just take the entire
action code and it will just insert
those actions into the workflow so we
have work clothes and when we tests that
are like a hundred actions long you know
just to make sure that it can handle
that kind of thing so since we're
getting a little bit geeky err let's
take a look a scenario of I want to find
all the images of a certain directory
that have a certain property to them I
want to make an archive of them in atom
into an email and I'm going to use a
different approach than I have used
before with Automator
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to use the finder to identify
the folder so I'm going to select the
pictures folder and to watch us I drag
this what do you call that that's a an
alias thing it's a thing drag that into
the workflow and you see it
automatically picks it up as the
pictures folder and it creates that same
get specified Finder action items thing
it's going to pass on a reference to the
pictures folder to the next action but
for this action instead of using a
regular spotlight command or a finder
command for finding I'm going to run a
shell script that I'm going to write
myself right now you'll notice that if I
click the Automator category there's a
set of actions here like run Apple
script 1 web service a run shell script
and you can customize and make your own
actions on the fly if there is an in
action for what you want to do and you
know how to write a little bit of shell
code you can write a series of shell
actions together and just have them
linked together and act just like a
pipeline and pass it on so you can just
choose a variety of different shells to
talk to you can do bash C SAH tcsh Perl
Python so I'm just going to use bash and
I'm gonna have passed the input into as
arguments and get rid of the thing there
and I'm going to have it do a fine
command catching the variable that gets
passed through and use name and the name
will be small red and then put a
wild-card in there because I know it's a
jpg so find all the JPEGs that begin
with that in their name and then pass
that on so I've just created an action
myself you do a fine using the this
shells fine command now let's just look
at the results of that I'm going to
choose this view results action and add
that to the list as well and all this
will do is show the results of the last
action so when I run this workflow you
can see that what it did is it found all
the pictures that match a certain
parameter and passes those on to the
next action as
a POSIX list of POSIX paths right so the
next action I want is to create an
archive well I'll just do a quick search
here for archive and create archive
they'll create a zip archive on the
desktop and then the next thing I want
to do is do a male-male let's see new
mail message and I'll just have it add
to a mail message brand new mail message
so there it is search the pictures
folder using a shell command to do this
create an archive I on a desktop and
then add it to a new email there you go
so you can use other languages besides
just you know Apple script or or
whatever the the action happens to be
written in you can use shell Perl Python
Java Objective C C C++ whatever you want
whatever language is supported by the
operating system you can use when you
create your actions or you can use these
on-the-fly actions of run web service
run shell script that kind of thing is
that interesting ah I see some wheels
turning now that it's going to be you're
gonna go back to the office and start
writing these little workflows and shell
stuff going on my favorite shell stuff
okay let's take a look at another
example of the power of Automator and
what it can do like I said
Automator can handle a variety of data
we've seen it handle text we've seen it
handle pictures it can handle a large
variety of data types and information
and what I'm going to do next is I'm
actually going to do some automated
database publishing with Automator a
database and a layout program like
InDesign or I'm just going to use our
pages program from Apple does it make
any difference what program you use the
principle is the same here of what I'm
doing and let's make this fit in the
window here so that you all can see what
we're doing and let's have it fit with
so here's a page layout
I want to create a product catalog and
it's gonna be an image and below it it's
going to be a description of the product
right it's going to have its price its
SKU number all that kind of name all
that kind of stuff so I want to easily
create a product catalog using the
information that's contained in this
FileMaker Pro database now Automator has
built-in support for SQL so if you want
to use an SQL thing and Mac OS 10 has
SQL Lite built into the core of the OS
so you can do that if you want to - I'm
just doing the FileMaker thing cuz it's
real easy to use here that's an example
but I don't want you to think that this
is by any means limited to just
FileMaker Pro so I'm going to open up
Automator and I'm going to select my
FileMaker Pro category here and the
first I'm going to do is choose it to go
to a layout and then I want to show all
records and then I'm going to sort them
by sort them by name and then after I've
done that I'm going to go down to pages
and I want to have it get the
information from using the SKU number as
the identifier and have it retrieve the
text that's in the summary field apply a
style sheet to it let's see have it
apply that style sheet to it and then do
the same thing for pictures use the SKU
numbers my identifier click product
image and then have it scale the images
scale to fill okay so I'm applying some
processes on the data up here I'm going
to a certain layout I'm sorting the
records I'm showing all records and I'm
sorting them and then I'm going to build
the document so I just click run and you
can see that it will go through and it's
taking the text and formatting the text
into the tagged containers and then it's
going to do the same for pictures
so in seconds it just did this whole
thing for me automatically now what did
I gain out of this I get speed I get
accuracy I get consistency that could be
an 80 page catalog and I don't care I'm
gonna go eat a doughnut while this is
doing that right because it's an
automated process of grabbing the data
now here's the $50,000 question how did
automate or no to put the pig image
right there
okay I'm testing Google guys now come on
I asked the same question at Apple and I
asked the same question of Microsoft so
I know who answers faster how high it's
all the hippy food see Tumelo here's the
way that it's done this there's two ways
that you do database publishing I don't
care what the system is I don't care how
much money it costs these are the two
principles of database publishing they
remain constant there's two ways to do
it
one is page geometry generation the
other is tagged container publishing and
that's the two ways you do automated
database publishing this particularly
instance is an example of tagged
container now what is tagged container
well each one of these little boxes can
be considered a container right this
contains a picture this contains text
somehow this container has been tagged
so that this container knows which bit
of information in the database relates
to it and the way that you do that is
I'm going to select this container right
here and in my script menu up here
there's something that is called name
page item and when I do you'll see that
that page item has already been assigned
a name 3 3 0 4 5 - well what does that
relate to that relates to a product over
here that has a SKU number of 3 3 0 4 5
- so you use the SKU number as the
unique identifier
for tad container publishing you are
required to have a unique identifier it
could be a social security number an
employee number a SKU number and address
something that's unique
you take that identifier and when you to
open up your layout you quickly tag the
various containers with the numbers so
you open up a template tag which
container goes where save it and close
it then an automated process comes back
and then fills it so when that automated
workflow was running the code inside the
Automator action would ask pages give me
a list of every container you have that
has a name ok then it goes to the first
one container 3 3 5 4 0 ok go to the
database do you have a record that has a
SKU number 3 3 1 6 3 yes it's right here
great container here's your new stuff
put it in there oh by the way I'm gonna
format your first paragraph with this
style sheet and the next style sheet the
next style sheet in the next style sheet
and it does all the formatting and it
gets the picture it takes the picture
scale said the fit takes the largest
percentage and then applies it to the
other side and centers it and that's the
way that you do automated center
publishing the other possible way one
side the other possible way of doing
database publishing is can is container
generation or geometry generation where
the database will actually make the
container as it needs it and that's a
little bit more complex because the
database has to contain the code the
pore geometry generation on the page but
those are the two principles and the
nice thing about tag container is once
it's done you can delete that
information go back to it and put in the
new information this have you ever seen
a car trader in 7-eleven those little
things car trader they done like this a
real estate publication new homes in
America and that's how these are done
TVGuide all of the tables and TV Guide
and that's how this is done and it's all
done using this type of technology and
it's really done on Macs using
AppleScript it's the driving language ok
your question over here
I'm sorry could you use Automator to put
in the skew sure I mean you could figure
out whatever formula you want you know
based upon sales of a product gets the
top-left corner and then it figures out
the position for everybody else based on
their sales goes through and generates
that too that's why the print industry
figured out a long time ago that they
couldn't hire enough people to do all
the work they needed so in the 90s print
publication automated using these kind
of techniques and that's how they were
able to expand and grow
you cannot scale unless you automate
there's no way to add more people
because all you're doing is adding more
possible mistakes and more costs if you
want to scale you automate and if you
want to automate using Automator is this
getting interesting at all hmm
he's making me think wait a minute okay
one last example I was going to show
deals with podcasts cuz I figured you
know something about podcasting what can
they do and here's a little scenario so
I just have some text I have this action
that I wrote by the way I'm gonna share
with you all of the actions that you
just saw today I'll tell you in just a
minute and I want it call it famous yes
this action does nothing but pass on the
text of a famous speech or document you
know that's what all it is if I ever
want the Gettysburg Address I run this
action and it produces text so if I want
a new text document over here I would
just go like text edit new text edit
document and then run this and I'd have
the Gettysburg Address show up in a new
text edit document right but I want to
convert this to audio so what I'm going
to do is click on the system down here
and choose text to audio file I'm gonna
pick a voice
isn't it nice to have a computer that
will talk to you isn't it nice to have a
computer that will talk to you I try to
get isn't it nice to have a computer
that will talk to you that's not a bad
voice it's from caps Trull caps trill
makes voices and phenomenal they have
this English news announcer voice that
is like the BBC it's killer so I'm gonna
have this thing down here called
Gettysburg and that's going to produce
an A iff high-quality file that then I
want to pass on to QuickTime to compress
into an MPEG audio format that will be
something like in a mono range about 48
megahertz here let's say 48 something
about 48 mono 44.1 yeah that's good I
use the same destination as the source
file delete the source file when it's
done and then I'm going to have it open
up in the QuickTime Player but if I want
to make a podcast I can just add this
thing called create podcast feed fill
out all the information and it will take
that audio file and generate the
matching XML that goes with it and then
you post both of those files on your
server and you have an instant podcast
but for our purposes here I just want to
open it up and play it it's going to go
back to the finder choose open finder
items and open that up with the
QuickTime Player where's a cute cube Q P
Q okay give me the text of the
Gettysburg Address render it as an audio
file then compress it and using MPEG AAC
and then open it up and there we go
that's exporting it doing the
compression
and here it is four score and seven
years ago our fathers brought forth on
this continent a new nation conceived in
Liberty and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal now we
are engaged in a great so it's not the
same as if Leo Laporte sitting there
talking into it's a snowball microphone
right but if you just have some text
content that you would like to be able
to podcast wow that's a great workflow
to have isn't it so like I said
Automator can handle a variety of data
it can handle textual data picture data
audio data video data doesn't make any
difference and it handles the whole skin
a range of stuff on the operating system
now let's take a look at what it takes
to make an Automator action interested
okay I'm going to go to the developer
folder because I've installed the
developer tools and open up Xcode now
Xcode is the application that we use to
create projects on Mac OS 10 and if you
choose the file menu and you choose new
project you'll see right at the top that
you can create an action you can create
an apple script based action a cocoa
based action or a shell script based
action so you can create a shell action
for yourself brand new that contains UI
and buttons and everything linked to
your shell code or you can use cocoa and
cab it linked to your cocoa code or your
C code or your Java code or whatever
else you want to put in there and then
you can add do the same with an Apple
script action so that it links to code
as well and then you can include other
code sources in with the Apple script so
it's just not Apple script it can also
contain some objective-c for example so
once you open up a thing it will ask you
to name it and this is what the project
looks like on the left hand side are all
of your
you get a Maine dot AppleScript you get
resources with a nib and the nib is your
UI so let me open up an existing project
here that I have and I downloaded this
from the site I'm going to turn you on
to in just a second and let's go action
projects and this one's called download
NOAA weather satellite and this action
does one thing it goes and gets an image
from a weather satellite up at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and then downloads the
image that you pick of a satellite photo
and I'll show you the action here as it
run so I'm gonna go get weather okay
here it is download u.s. weather East
Coast let's try west west Continental
let's get the infrared download it to
the desktop and then tell the finder to
open it up in preview ok and run so
there's the latest weather photo let's
take a look at the code that makes that
happen so go back over here first of all
let's look at the UI I'm gonna double
click this nib here and it opens up
interface builder which is the program
on the Mac let's see open interface
palette was not found' try to load
anyway sorry about that
great ok well that one's not gonna work
ok I'm missing some pallet that it used
let's try another one instead let's look
at my famous speeches and documents so
let's just take a look at that one real
quick
and let's open up the nib and here's the
view here is the action view itself and
this is the menu and if we go command 4
over here
command 1 and bring up the window let's
show tools show inspector and the
inspector palettes off-screen because I
opened over here it is so when you place
an item when you create a new project
you get this new type of view and the
views resizable you can size it to what
you want and if you want to add a button
or something on to the view you just
literally drag it on to there like that
if I wanted to add a button and then you
can set the properties of that
particular button like if I want it to
be a small button right or I can size it
to be a certain size I can change its
title to reset or something like that
and then under your parameters our class
over here you create a variable it might
be reset is the name of my variable and
then I can assign that through it what
it's called the cocoa binding so I go
over here and I'd say the target of that
is going to be this particular variable
when that button gets clicked and now
that's made the connection that connects
back into the code in my project but
over here in this particular project I
have a very simple main script and this
particular scripts written in Apple
script and all this does is when the
action is run it finds the particular
file that was chosen inside the action
bundle and then opens it up reads it and
passes on the code to the next action in
the list it also has another script over
here that is used for controlling that
particular pop-up and you'll notice that
in Apple script you can use this thing
called call method where I can call in
methods from other languages to have
them do things
what this does is it just gets a list of
the files that are within the action
bundle all the speeches and then
populates the menu for me automatically
let's take a look at another project
here
don't save let's take a look something a
little bit more complexity to it and
let's see create dated folder save the
image attachments get special folder
there's an interesting one I just did on
the Mac there's these things called
special folders which are like 40 or 50
different designated folders and you can
use them as jumping-off points and this
is the UI for that so I want the user to
be able to enter a POSIX path in this
text field well i bind that that the
text field to a parameter that i create
by clicking over here and i bind it to
one of these parameters here called
folder subfolder path select the text
field from your inspector choose
bindings and you can see that i've
already bound it here to this thing
called value
now when the workflow is run that value
is passed into the handler over here in
your main script and then i parse that
value out here called subfolder path of
parameters and then based upon what the
user has put in there i perform a
particular operation and then pass it on
basically what this does is it uses a
shell command Apple script using a make
der shell command with administrator
privileges to create a folder hierarchy
it's hard to show a lot of this but let
me show you where to go as soon as I
answer this question on where you can go
and learn how to do all this yourself
yes
yes I cannot share that oh yeah it has
nothing to do with programming and I
can't share the actual numbers but I can
tell you it's considerable the number of
people that are using Automator now no
they don't actually write anything they
just use it and if what they do is if
you're looking for a particular action
you're going to go to a site like this
which is Automator us and this website
contains an overview of Automator you
take the tour it will explain the
interface about Automator step by step
explain what the what each step is what
how the interface works what it does
there's example tutorials over here like
the one I showed you about how to rename
finder items right but I mean the people
that are using Automator are variety
people we have people that are doing you
know gene splicing with Automator we
have people that are doing image
manipulation with automated we have
consumers that are just doing things
like downloading web page images it
depends on what you need from the
Automator can be as flexible as you like
and if you click the Downloads button
here on Automator us there's a lot of
actions there that you can download and
install there's developer resources if
you're interested in writing actions and
I figured that since I was at Google I
could talk about this this is not
something I normally talk about and
there's also a resource button here that
takes you to a list of resources about
Automator example applications like
bare-bones BBEdit they ship with
Automator actions action collections for
photoshop for PowerPoint for office for
Adobe Creative Suite training and
articles books podcasts videos there's a
lot of different resources out there
this also Automator world
and there's Automator actions calm and
there's about three or four other all
based automated sites so if you're
interested in learning going beyond just
basically using Automator and actually
writing these things yourself take a
look at that yes
yes it's not built in that's not a
particular action that's built maybe you
can maybe you can filter by let's see
let's go over here and look in our
iPhoto group and get selected items and
then filter iPhoto items we don't want
albums we want photos photos whose now
there's nothing for rating there needs
to be one for rating so rating is a
scriptable do what you would do is you
would write a simple one-line Apple
script yourself that would go sort those
images that are passed to it by rating
and then pass all the ones that are five
starts on to the next action so that's a
case where there is no shipping action
that does that but you could write that
yourself by either doing one of two
things you could go to the Automator
category and choose run Apple script and
then put in your own little bit of Apple
scripting in there to talk to iPhoto or
you could actually just open up Xcode
and create a new project and create your
own action that you can share with other
people
Apple scripts an entire week long
discussion itself but here's a quick tip
every application carries with it an
entire dictionary of all the things that
it understands if you take the iPhoto
application and you drag it on to the
script editor icon it will open up its
dictionary and it has every term in
every class and every object that it
understands is in this dictionary and
that'll give you a quick idea so if I
look under here under rating see enough
I can't find anything under rating
Echidna what they would call it let's
see album photo
photo has a property of comment daytime
high image nope doesn't have a rating
thing so I guess you might not be able
to you might have to use the aperture
for that aperture which is our
professional image collection
manipulation program and it ships with
Automator actions and you can search by
rating or that one any other questions
so just a quick overview go to Automator
dot us if you're interested in expanding
and writing your own set of actions
grading your own web service actions
writing your own shell actions writing
your own Apple script actions and using
this technology I thank you thank you so
