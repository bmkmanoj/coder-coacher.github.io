the 28th photo tech lecture and we're
happy to have you vish dine muller back
for his third lecture in the series on
some very interesting high dynamic range
work take it away here yeah thank you
very much I do introduction limit later
just to understand a year ago I you know
I thought the HDR okay and I thought
what why to bother and today I'm quite
excited about it but sometimes from
different reasons that many people think
because in the end I only care about
images and that's what i want to start
today with a slideshow of image which
are done all the way i discuss things
and I want to end with pictures so that
it reminds us that it's about
photography
none
none
so all of these images have one thing in
common or most of them they were all
taking a very strong sunlight this is
normally the light where we left the
cameras in the bags in the past so
that's how it's related to what we are
talking today so first a little bit
about what is the problem about dynamic
range contrast classic solution to the
problem because the problem is there
forever so there are solutions in the
past about merging exposures tone
mapping and actually the key is what I
call today high speed HDR and
mix-and-match we see and then we have
some time for questions answers I hope
we get quite a bit of time this is a
it's very important to understand this
is a photographer's perspective I can
tell you if you want to be very
technical you would have probably to do
the rest of your life enough work to
solve all the problems and there's a lot
of work done very much in the academic
area and it has still to go into the
real world of photographers I don't
really use techniques which may be there
in five years that's not really
something I'm interested in today that I
HDR is there today and that's that's a
good thing the just elated introduction
I'm the editor and owner of Outback
photo com it's pretty large website on
fine art digital photography I do that
now for over seven years and it's about
workflow it's about cameras it's about
printing it's about yeah it's actually
everything from shoot to a final print
out there we start now in October with a
serious or I hope it ends up to be a
series of workshops where we teach in
hands-on using the techniques at the
outline today so making use of hg are in
the real world
and not just in fantasy but with the
goal to get fine art prints so it is not
just to have a wonderful small.jpg on
the internet the problem you know it's
very clear that the tonal range at the
scene and the tonal range that normal
output media can handle are very
different I I don't know the exact
numbers but I think a normal sunlit
scene outside can outside can easily get
up to one to ten thousand or more in
dynamic range and the ratio of the
darkest and the brightest point where
you can see detail and of course this is
a very old problem the one of the major
solution of photographers was not
photographing at that slight so it's
it's it's a very good solution because
why would you photograph something you
cannot capture we get to that so its of
course not unique to photographers so
painters have to deal with it also that
they try to do something like you know
they are also avoided to have clipping
clipping for them would be that the
canvas would be just white you know they
normally paint on something yeah and the
brightest thing they can actually yeah
good the brighter thing they can do is
actually getting the whitest white they
can paint the photographer can get
normally the whitest white is what the
paperwhite is cannot go beyond that so
it except of some very graphic paintings
you don't see many paintings which have
a lot of canvas just there it makes
sense but you know and the same is true
for photography most photos won't work
if you see let's say seventy percent the
paperwhite and the rest is some sort of
other shades if I had this discussion
the past of course you can do that if
you have a strong message in the rest
that it's not the normal thing one
common problem
is you know you run out of dynamic range
in the shades yeah the shades are both
areas actually highlights and shadows
are the key points the mid-tones tell
the the content and the shadows and the
highlight gives the finesse so if the
shadows are bad too bright to dark too
muddy to whatever you lose the image
it's actually the in my opinion the
easier part in some way because you can
solve it by saying okay I don't show
that detail and make it just play the
highlights is not so easy because when
the highlights don't show detail they
just look blotchy it's as I say you have
paper white ink because you have a
certain range you can put onto paper if
you put a lot of of that dynamic range
into the mid-tones you have nothing left
for the highlights and nothing left for
the shadows and this is for photographer
it means you you have to experiment a
lot to find your solution so dynamic
range the ratio of darkest and brightest
element that can be shown in an image
show means it has detail it said
outdoors it can be very high but indoors
with an open window it can be even way
beyond that yeah so that you want to
show the inner of the room and show the
scene outside the window by the way
artistically I haven't seen many
compelling images to do that yeah so it
is a different thing to get that you can
do that and make an image which yeah
either the inner is not meaningful or
the outer is not meaningful you have to
have both very meaningful the other end
is kind of the opposite is the low
contrast which is also challenging but
it's obviously not a high dynamic range
challenge
so in principle you have what is seen
referred that is what is there that is
the contrast range it there and that is
the conference range you have to manage
whatever you do and then think of you
want to print and I come from the
perspective that everything I want to do
has to be printable it's very different
when you just want to have a nice look
on your monitor and there's even special
monitors where you can see 12 11 to
30,000 dynamic range on the monitor but
still you can't do it on paper and I
don't see any way this will change so if
dynamic range a1 2 250 is actually quite
high for a paper so you have to match
what is there to the paper an upfront
the one solution they are this is not a
solution is to clip the data when you
capture them because again if you get
them to the printing you can cap can
decide where they have paper wide or a
Noghri grey on that because there's no
data you don't know what's in there so
there's no detail so there are a lot of
factors like smoothness like brilliant
you can so but that's then a matter of
taste but still the problem is as old as
photography how do i get a scene I like
mapped to the output medium I like and
as I say if you look at matt paper they
may have one to 60 that immigration is
holly existing
so very important that you understand
that detail is shown by contrast if you
don't see something in contrast to
something else it may be there but you
don't see it so your eyes look for
contrast and the classic ways you know
the old curves and level stuff is global
contrast global contrast is very
difficult because you know if you if you
add contrast to something you have to
take it away on something else because
there's so much contrast you have and
you cannot enhance it that's where local
contrast plays a big role which is you
and I get to that with a sample chart to
illustrate that local contrast is a very
powerful way to still give contrast
without having running out of contrasts
in terms of the global way to think of
it but then there's obviously if you
want to have things smooth that's just
the opposite to contrast so you want a
gradient yeah and if you have to cater
with bows both in color contrast is
probably used by by painters probably
also by photographers but you are very
much depending on the scene whether it
has the color contrast unless you change
the color ethically nothing wrong with
it but so it's not it not that much
usable in photography working with color
contrast because the painter events the
color he decides what it is so he can
make colors which have actually in the
tonal range very little contrast a good
contrast in terms of the colors so the
two columns of dots have a pairs of
equal values so this is as bright as
this that we both know we all know that
this one looks much brighter so what the
ideas it worked complete different it
doesn't look all
what is the RGB well you or whatever the
brightness value of something that looks
where is it contained so you you need
much less difference in brightness in
the dark area for for bright pixels then
in the highlight where you need strong
differences to just to see them and this
is important that more and more new
techniques improve local contrast it
there's also limit to it if it has to
look what when I discuss it later a
little bit what is called natural this
is actually I assume over the next 10
years this term will change because i
think it's it starts with wrong premises
what is natural so the goal is to map
the whole white outside scene 12 30
thousand let's say 2 1 2 250 and global
contrast is not the solution is one part
of it but local contrast is the other
part of the solution and way more
powerful yeah so it is more it adapts to
this way you see ya it is just and you
know also this technique is not very new
it's done by dodge and burn or all that
right I get to that crowing soon yeah
okay I had that in a previous talk here
but i think is very important in the
photographer in photo editing we are
very often talk about shadows and it has
actually very little to do with what we
call the shadow the shadow is not lit by
the primary light sauce it is
lit by a secondary light sauce it is
kind of darker but this image and that's
why I like it shows that the numbers
here are in bright sunlight they are not
in the shadows but still darker than the
real shadows which are in here yeah so I
still wait for tools which can
distinguish them because you don't want
to brighten the black letters they are
that black that you may want to bribe
the shadows yeah I don't think anything
today can distinguish that yeah in
global contrast not at all yeah it can't
even find out what it is yeah because it
just treats every pixel the same
wherever that it is so it just doesn't
help with the whole day I see ya it is a
very good force method if you look yeah
okay classic solutions are to control
the light fill light we over the last
couple of years we've always got out at
overcast that limits the dynamic range
so you could photograph you wait for the
gold light so that is not so harsh but
on the other side you have power shadow
so it's it you know or you in the in the
past they use graduated gray filters but
you know not all transitions between
bright areas and dark areas are straight
and it's kind of a hassle to do that the
other is and very classic technique is
which actually deals with the local
contrast is to use dodge and burn to
docking areas and brighton aires in a
photo just for the purpose of its visual
appearance that dodge and burn is a lot
of work nothing wrong with that
something is a lot of work that today we
have some Agra's which do a good job
they don't replace dodge and burn that
but they instead of doing it on hot in
hundred cases you may not may know
in two cases because these local
contracts and hatches they they help to
do by algorithms what you want okay so
now the first thing is how do we capture
a wider dynamic range of course it's
pretty easy the ideal solution is we
would have cameras which would do it
this is just not the case except of very
special cameras so if you have a very if
you are very lucky you may get a dynamic
range of 12 thousand in your camera and
they get better because you know there
is very often the discussion and you oh
yeah this camera that noise level and
this is this and that and then other
people say why bother about the noise
because i only use iso 200 but actually
the noise is a limiting factor to the
dynamic range which a camera can capture
that's all about it what is the darkest
detailed can capture where the signal is
still positive compared to the noise
yeah so which means if we have high ISO
cameras with very little noise this
means we have a higher dynamic range
even if you only photograph iso 100 yeah
and it said if you open up shadows your
ISO 100 shot will soon show the noise of
an ISO 800 shot because you you dig more
and more in the deep shadows black and
white negative film I think some say it
kept it about 12 f-stops the digital
cameras are a 210
if there are some special cameras one is
a spheric mmhg are they claim 26 f soft
but it's a very special camera up here
for the 360 degree panorama so it's it's
nothing really all of interest forward
for assets photographers it I never
looked into that what what do you mean
what contrast can even use what yes
what's the dynamic range with the pool
and the vision you get go see a nice
player regardless of this quintessence
again yeah but I think we are way before
the limp that the lens is a limiting on
that side it's limiting on other sites
you will see that and on artifacts yeah
but in I'm not running to that but yeah
let's take for an eye I don't know but I
don't think it's it's the moment the
limiting factor so the solution is to
have multiple exposures and there are
different techniques most of them are
based that you shoot on a tripod it has
to be a good tripod it has to be stable
and all that you have to use all the
techniques to avoid as much camera shake
as possible that you would be surprised
how much in normal SLR shakes without
the mirror going up just by the shutter
yeah and you use camera bracketing very
often in two easy steps you can do 357
or whatever and this is actually the
essence of the problematic is the all
moving objects our problem first of all
the camera movement itself but that's
less of a problem then objects in the
sea and whatever you look there's a lot
of movement in our world yeah flags are
one it's kind of interesting you know
you try to photograph the building and
everything is wonderful stable but then
there's a flag
so you you get got what is called
ghosting anyway yeah food photography
often talk about good and bad light it's
actually they don't really talk about
the light they talk about the capability
to make photos at this light so there's
nothing really wrong with sunlight
sunlight is very good light but if it's
too strong and the contrast so strong
you just can't capture it so that's
annoying that not because the light is
bad no because your technologies to
capture at that light are not up to it
so you and this is what we now for
probably three months we change we
photograph at light where we didn't
photograph before and I talked about
that in the end a little bit more detail
so let's assume there would be no
problem and everything would be perfect
with HG are merging would be trivial
movements no issue and everything yeah
we would live in a wonderful world
because we would capture all that light
and then we would kind of remap it with
some fancy algorithms to a printable
range and in this way we can actually
really find the light which exists and I
think the movie industry does it for
quite a while they shoot what is called
day for night they should a day in shy
and change the light characteristics so
that it looks like as if it was shot by
at night in the past it was done with
filters and special lenses today it's
done digitally in the post-processing
yeah and it's I think they are sometimes
very good so that you don't see it so in
some way if you would have just think of
a camera which doesn't really exist that
would capture all the characteristics of
the light and the scene you could then
have software which would say okay what
if it's 7pm what if it's for
pm yeah what if the Sun comes from a
different direction you know all that
yeah sounds fiction but in the movie
industry they get to a certain point but
in photography you know the in some way
we are also a little bit more demanding
because you see the pictures steady
there you see it here you see all the
artifacts all the artificial results of
it when you look at it in the movie it
it fades by yeah so it's not and also of
course in the movie industry it's a lot
of research down there but I think they
do some good job and I think we in some
way we can learn from the movie people
the way that they distinguish between
what is the like when they shoot and
what can they do with the shot with
short footage in post-processing to
create light they want and there's
nothing in my opinion wrong with it it's
just that they define the mood they want
and when they manage to do it at that
point or later if the result is good
doesn't matter if the thing is the main
reason that they do that is economics
because let's assume they have a movie
which has many scenes which should be
all shot at 5pm this would mean they
would shoot at 5pm every day and the
weather is not cooperating all that but
the reality they shoot at 12 what should
look like 5pm because the story bought
doesn't tell oh we didn't have time at
12 at 5pm let's put the scene at 12pm
you know that doesn't really make sense
for for a storyboard and I think we can
learn a lot from from that thinking and
we have now to explore what what is
possible in the the digital photography
arena yeah I want to cover that because
it's kind of interesting and on the
internet there are is
flickr HDR images and people say all
they are not real and you know and you
know in some cases i may agree but the
interesting thing is people judge images
by looking at other photos to tell these
photos are not real I tell you what
photos are very little real we are just
used to it because we know the whole
world just from photos we don't know the
world we know photos of the world so
this is a reality now so we never think
in Venice oh how does it look to our
eyes but of course we know the emotions
and we can say does this photo return
spot the emotion and that's what we
should judge the final photo air so what
is real is defined by a very unreal
standard which is photos first of all
it's 2d 2d is not really real is it I
don't think so and if we look different
it seems we zoom into things and see
things so a we should be careful with
saying just oh this is unreal and my
photo is really real I tell you your
photos very unlikely real there's no
real photo that's just the point so you
may not like what that's okay so try to
create the photos you like and don't let
that limit by oh it just photos look
that way yeah so you guys get sometimes
very cereal hdr photos which i think are
very real because they transport a mood
yeah it's more like painting
so merging these poses a sound so easy
and obvious okay but there are more
reasons that it fails than anything else
it's always if you cut something into
paths put it together yeah try to cut a
leg into three parts and put it together
it's it's not really trivial and that's
with everything you you cut putting
together is hard in photographs it would
be very easy is really nothing moves
first of all the camera moves but this
can be done with sophistic sophisticated
alignment technique techniques you know
you you can move this way this way you
can rotate you can move this way so
there's a lot of movement Ervil
fortunately I think a lot of research
was done in in the context of stitching
because they have the same problem they
put things together not on top of each
other but the side of each other and
poly on top so the other thing is moving
object which is called ghosting which
means ghosting because if you just put
them on top of each other you have ghost
images of the objects on top of each
other but there are clearly benefits if
everything works you get lower noise
because with the overexposed shot you
actually photograph for the shadows and
in the underexposed shots you photograph
further highlights so you preserve
highlights you get lower noise and that
can be a very good reason to use it I
use only raw but for HDR jpg may work
because you don't run into the typical
jpg done in the range limitation because
you have the highlight data again from
the underexposed shot and the shadow
data from the 0 exposure
many things move and you know the more I
probably shot about thousand triplet
shots thousand shots time three over the
last three months and it's it's
surprising what what moves people have
kind of obvious animals you know you
look at your mirjam and say oh there's
dust on the sensor no it's a bird
because it's if it's flying fast it's on
three shots at different yeah areas and
especially you know in the sky it's not
really a problem but once it's on top of
a structure there you have to be careful
to get rid of it foliage moves off cross
anyway flags i remember mentioned that
clouds are kind of an interesting
exception because they are kind of
organic so you you don't know how they
look before and after because they just
merged somehow they can be actually nice
what is a little bit more tricky and I'm
not still clear how much I can do it can
look interesting and I mentioned camera
go just briefly merging exposes you have
three exposures you run a software like
Photoshop or photomatix where you open
the files and the software does an
automatic if you want alignment and you
get an HDR file which has the dynamic
range capturing all all three or five or
whatever images then you have really
really ugly file the problem is if the
file is not really ugly it is just that
your monitor cannot show it because a
normal monitor let's assume you have one
to five hundred dynamic range cannot
show the full range you captured yeah
and you can do tricks to make a little
bit more suitable for your monitor
there's still a lot to learn on color
management but actually you are not
really interested in this again these
I'm not interested in the HR files the
3d people are only interested in the hg
alpha or mainly interested in it but I'm
not interested in I just use it to toe
map it down it's just my
I have captured the material I have the
dynamic range of all which was in that
see if I had enough shots to capture it
so the key thing is to do what is called
tone mapping some also i think technique
very often called operators and here we
will see many many techniques over the
next year's already in the academic
world is flooded with it but flooded can
also mean you have an address mad bitch
is wonderful if you have the patience
wait a day for a single image to be
processed so as always in digital
photography in workflow you have
wonderful algorithms but they have to
brought be brought to kind of a
real-time metaphor where you can
actually see what you do yeah
interactive programs really stop if
after every step do you have to wait a
minute that's not what I would call
interactive actually five seconds look
for long
if you know I live with it anytime as
long as I don't know there's something
which does it faster yeah of course yeah
hey I'm in the moment my workflow was
much faster than now I am kind of in the
stone ages of HDR workflow which is
tedious compared to the old work though
but I do it for the purpose yeah but I
promise you in three years that will be
faster so a this is an incentive to make
it faster yeah and if if you would have
gotten at that time a developer and
solution which would do it in third of
the time this would be hit in the market
I tell you yeah yeah but it didn't
happen you know but then you could also
say why don't we all use our class glass
plates you know you know do everything
yourself so you know speed is it speed
matters yeah speed matters in the terms
of I don't say if you have you have
faster get better result I didn't say
that yeah but you can you have more room
to experiment you can do five
experiments instead of one and this can
be beneficial
in this respect photography will leave
painting in the dust maybe I don't know
and so a tone mapping there are some
nice 20 members out there but I think we
will we will see a lot improvement there
if there's one which is important the
photomatix detail enhancer is it is what
I is local contrast enhancement so local
contrast is kind of pulling out details
as i said if you have a local contrast
you see a detail it's kind of like
sharpening it's not quite like
sharpening it's a little bit more on a
coarser level of detail it is not the
fine edge detail holy that there's an
interesting algorithm implemented in
photoshop cs2 and ca3 if I find a little
bit too tedious but because I have to
manipulate these curves and get lucky
yet sometimes I don't know but it's kind
of interesting you know if you would
have asked me a year ago Oh what about
noise and what about chromatic
aberrations and I would say yeah I don't
have really problem with chromatic
aberrations I don't have really problem
with noise now I have problems chromatic
aberration chromatic aberration is
lenses are not made perfect so if more
to the corners the three red green and
blue focus at different places so you
get these purple and green teams and
seams and some are blue and yellow you
can be very ugly because you overexposed
shots use you you faucet so you get it
more into your face now so if you have
chromatic aberration on your lenses and
believe me there are not many without it
you will see it now it's amplified into
your face so that's why raw converters
like Camera Raw so important to
have features to remove chromatic
aberrations because you don't want that
before it get merged into HDR otherwise
you see it into your face and also you
sometimes see the wide halos around
things because you know these these
algorithms looking for local contrast
they look or what is the surrounding and
that sometimes defined by a certain
radius or so and there they are little
bit off ghosting I don't want to get
into that because I don't think there's
a tool which does it really for what I
would like to have yeah I mentioned that
before the whole HDR and tone mapping is
very good in terms of noise because
let's assume you have a minus 2 EV 0 + +
2 EV you get the shadows of the plus EV
you get it 2 f-stops better than the
normal shot in 4f stops better than the
underexposed shot so you can really see
it so that's one of my main reasons to
use HDR is that if I photograph dark
windows I want to see a little bit
inside into the windows I would like to
get as low noise as possible and even
iso 200 on a very good camera you see it
this kind kind of was an incidental
experiment you know I I shot handheld
from a cliff an automated high-speed
bracket and the left image shows how the
images are on top of each other and I
planned it a little bit through so it's
very blurred but it was the wind was so
strong that I couldn't even handheld it
okay someone can say use a tripod ever
heard of tripods and wind that is also
you know you can't take a studio tripod
kind of 50 pound or so maybe it would
not shake but so tribo wouldn't have
helped it's kind of interesting yeah
would not have helped at all
but then was alignment I got that pretty
much in alignment yeah so but this was
interesting and that's why I show this
is kind of the worst scenario you know I
this was really the the main problem was
that my hands pushed into my eyes and
everything so was really on a cliff at
Devonport in front it was really you
know where you could hardly hold the
camera you know in the alignment in cs2
cs3 is pretty good which did the other
thing there so what I call high-speed
hgr is actually using cameras which have
a high frame rate so I'm not a sports
photographer so normally i don't care
about speed but it's clear it's clear
that if you if you shoot three frames
fast less can move in between the frames
including yourself if you shouldn't
slower work outside i had i shot birds
sitting on something and you know birds
are normally not really that said even
if they are sitting and it was quite
well in focused so not not really
blurred if you would do that from a
tripod and have 10 second sequence of
your shots you can be sure the bird
would have moved and i just brought the
camera for the purpose this is a slow
sequence about three frames per second
just to get an idea that's slow and it's
still not sounds good three frames per
second so and you know the what I like
about this is this is a consumer-grade
camera 30 hundred dollars yeah this is
now a little bit higher yeah and that
makes a big difference so now I I shoot
these sequences and I have a camera
which does 10 frames per second this is
six and a half but at six and half is
way good I would say yeah so this got me
thinking that isn't it interesting to
try handheld
yeah because it gives me the chance that
things in the scenes don't move yeah of
course I have to have shorts other
shutter speeds so it's nothing for night
photography or overcast or you know it
tends to be bright light and that's what
we did recently a lot so this way you
you have very little camera movement and
in the scene everything which moves slow
its kind of in focus and said I did
about thousand triple shots over the
last three months and we are not really
prolific photographers so we have
photograph either we on a trip or what
you call walk portfolios in San
Francisco where we just observe and the
interesting thing is it change the
photography at all because I don't even
look really what images I got because I
shoot three frames so I when I get to
that I'm kind of sure I got some where
the exposure I want so what I do is I
I'm more we are more like curious
children looking for things to capture
its it the the process is completely
deferred to home yeah because of these
three exposures
it's at the moment it is very often
minus 1 plus 1 or minus 1 and their
third plus two and a third and 0 now I
take a correct one Lisak I oh yeah yeah
no this is a this this series sequences
was to third it's kind of also then with
an exposure compensation this is because
i use on that camera highlight priority
where you can where you and expose
implicitly yeah it's a little bit more
if i want to tell so much about
highlight recovery it's kind of
interesting that the raw file actually
hold more data on the highlight then
very often you see at zero EV exposure
it's beyond what we talk today but i
learned that it's not making up these
data these are datas which are really
there in the file yeah so which means
for example with the the the with some
cameras you have more dynamic range in
the file then you see immediately and
the s5 is really quite something give
you an example how you know on the left
is the 0 EV shot this one and this is a
minus 3 EV correction you know you you
would say couldn't you learn to get
better exposure okay but I tell you to
my excuse I was photographing manually
those r annual exposure settings ducks
in a window in Chinatown and then I felt
that some dust was in the air I had no
clue what it is I turned around and
found that the feathers of these chicken
we're flying in the air yeah and I
photographed in strong sunlight yeah but
what I want to show is not to encourage
to use it but I could nearly recover
everything on that shot and that's
amazing it's that the fuji s 5 so that's
there's no other camera which can do
that this is another example where you
you the dark areas are
the normal ones you know the bright are
the normal ones the dark are the
recovered ones which show what what you
can do to get capture the dynamic range
you know you have the dark shadow on the
one side and the bride of the other
which was also overexposed okay the last
topic I want to talk is what I call
exposure makes a match so I kind of
combine or we kind of combine a classic
old technique which is bracketing with
HDR in some way we capture three frames
that doesn't mean we use all three
frames that we can so we are kind of h
er ready so this is an example bracket
yeah you see if it's how it was recorded
and I showed the histogram so that you
get an idea what the exposure situation
was in these shots and it's kind of
interesting then you know think we
didn't get to the answer of that
question so i can ask that before i show
the solution I actually can recover the
brightest shot so so which means I would
have all the deets data I wanted in the
brightest shot best shadows and all
highlights what could be a reason that
this shot would still be not the good
one
no no no no because the shadows are from
the brightest shot so you you cannot get
better you cannot get better shadows
than from then from the brightest shot
that's not possible ya know you've been
the combining but but let okay but leave
that out for a moment but it's not the
key I think the key is ok I give the
answer the problem is this is the
longest exposure and it has if if you
run out of it the most camera shake so
this is actually motion blur in this
image yeah because the unexposed has the
least motion blur because it tends to
shorter shutter speed the middle one has
half or less than half the shutter speed
in the third has the longest or no it
doubles the shutter shutter speed yeah
so that the main problem is actually
motion blur and I find that very often
if I because you know we switch scenes
and you if you photograph into a darker
area you have that all the time I made
here a little diagram where would I go
to the the down part where I wrote down
what are the things to consider if you
shoot but let me go to that first of all
you look at the overexposed shot can you
recover it can you do highlight recovery
and get everything from it in a good way
highlight recovery can also introduce a
divot if no you go to the next shot
because it means this shot doesn't help
you alone is their motion blur you have
to go to be anyway because this is not a
usable shot for anything you do because
it has motion blur the same you are
going now for the shot be for the middle
exposure and if it can be recovered you
could think of doing merging
B and C or also a in the case it doesn't
have most motion blur that's what i call
mix and match you can look at all these
exposures and you know that you get that
pretty fast and one of course important
thing is are there moving objects if
they are moving objects you have to sell
it with one of these exposures and the
worst is if you cannot use B which i
rarely found in the moment I could use
most of the time exposure being and sea
has incredible noise then you are in
trouble yeah so that's what i call mix
and match yeah so that you can you have
the material to do either HDR if you
want and can or you have three very good
exposures to choose from our and to
choose the best one
a little bit outlook which is kind of
the interesting side effect of shooting
these records can be all i would say
will be that he couldn't cannot only use
these shots for hg are you could use
them for improving resolution there's a
technique called super resolution where
you shoot multiple images you combine
them for a higher resolution image so in
this case it's actually mandatory that
you have some movement if let's assume
you which really shoot the perfect
constant shot it would work because you
know it wouldn't get more information
from it and i have seen images where you
really see more but unfortunately i saw
also way more chromatic aberrations yeah
and the the tool I have at the moment
which is called photo acute so it's
working that in the moment it works only
from raw which sounds good but because
they don't remove for most lenses the
proper chromatic aberrations it is not
usable in many cases they will do TIFF
loop version soon and I want to look
again so the nice thing is you you can
at some point even use these brackets to
get a 20 megapixel resolution out of a
10 megapixel camera and that's not
fiction that's real yeah it's not it is
just a grizzle
conclusions it's a useful technique
today I think there's a lot of work to
be done improve workflow better tone
mapping better lens correction that a
ghost removal higher dynamic range and
cameras and I recently stumbled about a
term called computational photography or
something like that at some point we are
kind of at the point where you don't
really take the photo you want to see
you t take data to make the photo you
want to see and this is just the
beginning I we wait for when you get rid
of lenses yeah actually there are
already techniques where you don't have
lenses yeah where you actually
photograph the things which are not
giving kind of a like a camera-ready
image it gives data which can manipulate
it to an image and someone told me you
know the difference between the human
eye and for example the eyes of flies
look at that the single cell of a fly
doesn't really get an image it gets
information to the brain to do something
with that information and we're at the
point where you capture at some point
data which will make up an image and I
think HDR is in some way near that it
just you know I don't want to miss that
I just find some final images and I I
was not prepared to run nearly out of
time
and all these images were done with this
camera on one walk it harsh sunlight
satellite
okay i have to say that they are we also
use i also use the style which is called
colorizing so it is not your average
color image it's kind of blend of black
and white and color I like that it's
actually you have the full color image
and it's just super imposing a
black-and-white layer which blends it so
open for questions I have a whole
section on my website on hgr there's
nothing like the best tool the merge to
HDR I very often use photoshop cs3 for
it that it has limitations where doesn't
just have artifacts which you don't want
and so I use mainly photomatix and
photoshop and photoshop doesn't have a
tone mapping algorithm I care about that
much but photomatix is pretty good and
it's not too expensive so a few
resources here and I bring up one is the
Giuliani at 360 pr.com / h PR for
dummies
as thing he calls HDR for dummies which
takes two bracketed shots and merge them
together in Photoshop with using the
hard light operators
which is pretty looks a lot high dynamic
range you just get it just it's lateish
you to open up the show yeah that is
blending it's kind of a tone mapping or
two tone remapping a pure one basically
gives you the most detail wherever it
works for two images but it's fast and
it works well as long as the HSN well
another one is that you mentioned that
some things move shadows actually move a
lot during especially at noon I've tried
doing some panorama that's where it may
take two minutes to go all the way
around when I come back beginning the
shadows and move several inches our
problems maybe dance or something like
that that kept you secret i detect I do
actually classic single is not stitching
yeah so stitching is a different world
and i'm not that much and i'm not into
360-degree whatsoever but there's more
an artistic personal preference so that
nothing wrong with it yeah what are the
things you mentioned was computational
photography there's been a course over
at siggraph of our month ago basically a
whole day course and the notes of that
are available from cigarette I have
access to them is also video of the
entire course we check mate
another resource is it online the video
I believe that they were planning on
making it online and available online to
cigarette members they have done that
last year I'm not you're going to be
doing this year visit on DVD or
something you can actually purchase it
from cigarette okay I think you can get
instagram website the other resources
that reinhard has a book on HDR imaging
in case anybody is interested in getting
it it has cd-rom in it with the source
code for a whole bunch of tone mapping
operators and you can test out several
dozen tone tone mapping up
see that technical papers presentations
are available on one off purchase and
you can buy just one
but it but again there that's the
difference I live today I want to make
photos today so I I'm not interested in
any source code of any for me personally
as a photography i want to get it ready
in Photoshop or in tools which are there
this iPad but he but I'm very happy that
many people work on it now yeah but i
want to encourage everyone doing nice
things and i can use them that's but my
technique works today that's the only
thing so how long do you take to
post-process your father's day delirious
light show that you showed us how much
more is compared to process in one photo
oh oh don't ask me if I posted recently
on my side which i call walk portfolios
and walk portfolio from walking street
in san francisco and area and san
francisco whatever and i write down how
many pictures i took how long the walk
took let's assume the walk takes 45 to
one hour i get about after six hours a
preliminary portfolio from it after post
processing so there's a lot of work for
example the last you saw were a walk on
Saturday in San Francisco I got the 40d
one day before this was a walk it was
about forty five to 10 minutes to one
hour and I probably worked for hours bad
I just processed the middle exposure and
i'm now in processing some real HD ours
from it so it is factor 10 longer but
the factor tim is mainly to the lack of
workflow support for it yeah it has
nothing to do inherently for example i
could probably outline that
software could do what I do manually
there's just no software which other for
example the software could tell me oh
this overexposed shot has motion blur
there's no problem for software to
detect it yeah if there are actually
interesting things which may evolve that
they may get the sharpness from the
unexposed shot it apply it to the OBEX
ball right you know the there are many
things to do then it could say say okay
we be merged the lower in the middle or
no it doesn't really work take this one
yeah let's assume it would do that and I
could say batch process yeah then I was
there so I wouldn't have to look but
they had so many factors we have to look
than the moment yeah so that's bad
things they did the disc manufactures
love it because I shoot more than ever I
have all I shoot now in two month what I
shot in a year yeah because it's time
three and it's not so easy to get rid of
shots because couldn't be this short be
interesting if you would do this yeah
which means sitting there yeah in the
moment the most effective workflow is
actually I sit in bridge have the three
images selected and just open Photoshop
merge to HDR from there but I could also
from bridge let's assume I find out all
damned chromatic aberrations I would
open all three shots in Camera Raw
correct chromatic aberration and then
then run merge to HDR so I'm yeah for
example Lightroom is wonderful but it
doesn't help me at all with it because I
couldn't select three image and drop it
somewhere and they would do something at
least not in the moment yeah so it's
it's a lot more work flow work but it's
it's I don't think I had that much fun
for a long time and for also for the
special reason we are not good in
getting up early so the morning the good
morning light is very often beyond us
but on the other side think of the
following you are and try to do san
francisco at good morning light theatre
houses you have just always shadow I
don't know whether this is ideal light
so for what we do the Sun is actually
good yeah you just have to it took
manage it it is kind of interesting that
I got before scenes in San Francisco I
have done many many many many times I
was never satisfied that I thought oh
looks nice there's a you know this
building in San Francisco where on one
side is a jazz mural and on the other
side is Chinatown theme themes mural and
it's always in Sun when I'm there and I
got no wonderful images of it and i love
it all done with the same technique so I
tried to get other people excited it
started with Miss using this high-speed
cameras not for action for stills yeah
but it makes it the big difference you
know because it's just you know pinging
it's there the three shots yeah a little
40d it's there yeah so but the
post-processing is you know I could have
five extra lives to just work and
post-processing so I which means my
backlog gets bigger it's just three
years so it's okay
