name is Chris DiBona I'm your open
source programs manager this is another
speaker in our long series of
distinguished amazing people and open
source software eben Mogollon I met
first I think it's around the DVD CCA
case when a fellow named John electro
Hanson published a little piece of code
and then another fellow took that piece
of code and printed it on his website
and was promptly I guess we're not
arrested earlier she arrested for them I
was wrong yes it was the morning after
you and I spent that day in court in san
jose that came with busted him in oil
yeah that's right so so we work on that
and i had the good fortune of seeing
sort of what happens in the courtroom
and realized that's not a place for me
as such we financially supportive and
whenever we can and and and his work
with the Free Software Foundation as
well as a software and freedom Austin or
which I'm sure he'll he'll mention in
passing in this discussion god I don't
know how much of a bow you want to give
for yourself I just I'd rather just let
you talk because you're you're better at
it than I am so everyone Evan welcome
well thank you i'm going to pretend them
that I don't need a biography and that
we can talk about the future instead of
the past which is what I'd like to do it
is a privilege and an honor for me I've
been waiting to come here sorry for
interrupting this is also being recorded
for the public so keep your questions
public friendly thanks
I can't promise to keep the talk public
friendly we'll see how the combination
works the I've been waiting to come here
for a long time and it's a great honor
for me to make a first visit here I have
been working with free software
programmers long enough to have spent
many years of my life responding to a
question that goes well free software
seems to be sort of good at imitating
important stuff done by other people
like Microsoft but it never really does
anything new does it and of course one
of the easiest ways of answering that
question after a certain moment was to
say well where did you ever see anything
like Google before that is to say in
coming here I am making a long-delayed
pilgrimage to one of the monuments of
the new a monument constructed out of
your ingenuity and materials which I've
seen shaped at the quarry over the years
the materials of free software which
make the scale on which we deliver
information and knowledge to one another
all the way around the world possible so
for me it's um a little breathtaking and
a little bit throat catching in the way
that any monument is and particularly
gratifying when I think about the world
from which I started doing the work as
you all started doing the work when all
of this would have been a dream that
would have been hard even to explain to
people who now use it everyday depend
upon it assume it's there and would in
fact no longer really know how to lead
their day-to-day lives without it
which means I suppose that I want to
offer myself as the friendly outside
observer a role in which i hope i may be
able to talk a little bit about the long
term curve of the ecological
relationship between google and the free
software environment in doing that I
want to talk in particular about the
ways in which we can study in the past
some of the ecological crises for
enterprises we may not be quite so fond
of but whose experience in dealing with
the free world sets some useful guides
to what may be the problems and the
challenges in future that we can avoid
now if you think about the poor devils
in redland and the difficulty that now
be sets them I think you can see it as a
form of fulfillment of the idea that you
have to catch problems while they're
young as a person whose job it was while
the problems of Microsoft were young
well to keep Microsoft from knowing how
to nip them in the bud from seeing the
free world for what it was when they
could have stopped it out easily I
suppose I have to say that a lot of my
work is a lawyer particularly in the
earlier days of the free software
movement was directed at camouflage or
at least at conflict avoidance if you
think about the state of affairs when I
first started working for Stallman in 94
and 95 and 96 if we had thrown our
weight around too aggressively in the
enforcement to freedom in the courts we
would have died young where would have
had our resources exhausted we would
have been bled to death by a party
infinitely larger and more resourced
than we and we would have lacked for
visible and recruitable allies because
at that stage parties had not yet
realized how important to the enterprise
of the future free software was going to
be
and the vendors had not understood what
it was that they had at stake in the
survival of this model of making
software it was in short our job to keep
Microsoft from understanding how deeply
the copyleft threatened their way of
thinking about software that it was
bringing about a fundamental change from
software as a product to software as a
public utility enabling services a
change that would require a rethinking
of the very business model upon which
they had based themselves a very
conception of what it was they did and
what they turned out the door at the end
of the day because in 95 mr. gates had
still not quite sustained the
Enlightenment concerning the existence
of the internet it was not entirely
surprising that he was late to the
Enlightenment concerning the copyleft
and its effect on the idea of software
as product by the time they had figured
out that the copyleft involved a
reconsideration of the balance between
software and service it was already
beginning to be too late to change and
now at a time in which the propositional
characteristic of what we do is fully
defined and perfectly understood it may
be that Microsoft no longer has time in
which to change this is an example of
how a failure to grasp what the other
fellow is thinking produces serious
distortions in the ability to realize
the full effect of one's own investments
had it been possible for Microsoft to
think more clearly about what the free
world was up to when the free world was
small I hesitate to imagine what
solutions might have been applied to the
problem but I think it is quite obvious
that the solutions applied in 1996 would
have been far more effective for
Microsoft than the solutions being
applied in 2007
this is of course a battle of light
against dark good against evil and has
nothing to do therefore with the
relations between the free world and goo
we are all creatures of light and I
wouldn't leave you to imagine that I'm
suggesting that there is some respect in
which we might ever discover that we are
separated by a line of moral judgment
but it is not only a line as definite as
the line between good and evil that
we're talking about even people who
promise never to do evil and mean it and
make good on it are still likely to have
their little diplomatic tips from time
to time and it is even possible that
such Tiff's if not addressed when they
are young could turn into challenges and
difficulties that are harder to resolve
later on I want them to talk a little
bit about where I think we might find
ourselves in need of a few drops of oil
now before we begin to find some metal
shavings in the bottom of the engine at
the end of the day before we begin to
run things a little past tolerances and
pressure starts to go up because I think
we ought as conservators which is what I
know I am in my business and I suspect
you know you are in yours as
conservators it is our responsibility to
address problems before they happen
rather than after the whole of my work
essentially concentrates on helping free
software makers and distributors to
prevent rather than to fix problems and
if I therefore sound like a party
calling out about some things that
haven't happened yet and aren't likely
to I hope you'll grant me the tendency
to understand that it's just the habit
of my job to look for the things over
the horizon before they become problems
in order to prevent them from growing
into the kinds of problems it is
expensive to fix with that in mind let
me offer a short compressed view of what
I think Google looks like now from the
non-google part of the free world
in the first place as I'm sure you
recognize too when you think about the
new investments in Hardware Google looks
like the first industrial strength part
of the 21st century economy moving to
cheap hydroelectric power the way 20th
century industrial corporations like
aluminum smelters moved to cheap
hydroelectric power in other words a
landscape altering presence in the free
world landscape altering at a level of
ecological significance which makes you
at once the largest and most complex
organism in the entire ecosystem
dependent as all organisms are on
surrounding parts of the natural
environment and it is the ecological
balance between the new largest and most
sophisticated and most capable organism
in the environment and the rest of the
environment which is the theme of my
analysis we may take for granted I think
between ourselves that the work of data
mining the work of understanding the
connections between data particles
traveling in a soup of optional delivery
people who decided to hand you stuff to
think about is honorable and important
work capable of improving human life in
every direction as well as making heaps
of money but precisely because it is
power because it makes money in vast
quantities because it consumes power in
vast quantities and because it depends
upon skilled brains and free software it
is an ecological intersection where the
trust of all parties must be carefully
maintained
the data upon which Google operates it
gains on an opt-in interface people
voluntarily bring information their
email their habits their search
information their desires their
geographic locations and all the rest
and they ask for that data to be
conserved for them reprocessed for them
re-- delivered to them in a variety of
powerful and useful ways allowing the
parties who undertake that effort also
to make inferences from that data for
their own profit this is a perfectly
respectable activity there isn't the
thing in the world wrong with it and it
is changing the face of human life but
it's important to recognize that it is
possible because the interface is an
opt-in interface because people have
voluntarily brought their data there
under terms which they either do or at
least can understand it would not be
right however to think of the software
the executable software taken in as
coming also across solely and opt-in
interface it comes in fact on an opt-out
interface if you think about it on the
other side from you you are the opt-in
parties you accept code under licenses
rather than taking in data under terms
of service of your own the consequence
is at least in theory that the license
is under which the code you take in
comes to you could establish limits or
bottlenecks or sources of limitation of
your use of it generally speaking of
course at the present time that isn't
true vast amounts of code are taken in
under license is so permissive as to
limit in no way what is done with them
and even the most complex of the
licenses under which code comes in at
the present time the copyleft licenses
GPL and it's near neighbours place no
substantial restrictions on any of the
activities within the ecological frame
that Google wishes to perform using that
code this is as it should be
and I want to emphasize that from my
point of view it is desirable that it is
so it is not however in the nature of
the universe that it is so it is in the
nature of the social compact which is
free software that this is so and in the
very same way that there are conceivable
structures of response to microsoft
embodied in the copyleft no you should
not treat software as a product which is
secret until purchased no you should not
treat knowledge about the operation of
computers as a product only the rich can
have and only in the quantity that they
can afford to consume no instead
software is a commons responsive only to
the need for the free movement of
information you can imagine at least in
theory changes in the inbound interface
for software which would play
significant challenges on the model of
we use free software plus open source
freely provided data to conduct data
mining for both public benefit and
private profit in particular if we want
to look for a tiny example of the
theoretical possibilities of difficulty
on the free software interface we can
look to the thing which has been called
in the past the affero GPL a non GPL
license a variant of GPL created with
the consent of but not the endorsement
of the Free Software Foundation in
connection with the affair Oh
organization a profit-making company
founded by henry poole poole as you may
recall if you've ever studied this
rather obscure corner of the free
software licensing world was interested
in creating a web application for the
assistance of money raising by nonprofit
organizations based around email
signatures which allowed parties working
at nonprofits to provide trace back
information to assist donors to support
their enterprise here click here on my
email cig and donate to my enterprise
with the intermediary keeping a tiny
transaction fee intended to provide for
making the surface self-financing pools
goal was to ensure that any parties
seeking to go into the affair Oh izing
way of life would be forced to return
their modifications to his web app to
commons even though they would not be
distributing copies of the code but only
performing services with it so the
result was a modification of GPL which
said in effect and it's not important
now what the precise words were what
they did if you perform services with
this code over a network and if I set
things up so you are compelled to
disclose your server side source code to
any interact II who cares to ask for it
you may not remove that feature from
this code downstream the effect of that
license was to attempt to create a
commons within the commons equally
self-protecting in the way that the GPL
copyleft commons is but upon a new kind
of opt-in interface for potential users
and deliverers of the apt an opt-in
interface which required the users of
the app to admit their responsibility to
return modifications to commons as those
who have watched the GPL 3 process at
all for any reason however obscure or
doubtful may have remembered back in the
beginning last January when we were
preparing to announce the first draft
there was a great deal of press
speculation that we meant to embed and a
pharaoh like term in the body of GPL 3
itself thus rendering all parties who
made use of the code for applications
delivery purposes to remote users
somehow responsible for the return of
mods to commons I won't be telling tales
out of school if I suggest that mr. de
Bona was an articulate and thoughtful
critic of any such scheme all the way
along and it won't be all that
mysterious to you why of course it
wasn't our intention to make that change
and we did not we have however tried to
consider over the course of the last
year ways that we might be compatible
with such decisions by future lies and
source a process of consider
raishin 2 in which mr. de Bona has been
an articulate and thoughtful constant
participant presumably on the theory
that even consideration of such an idea
was a little scary and he needed to keep
his friends very close and his potential
enemies even closer I think that was
extremely wise that is in fact of course
the proper Google response to such
intentions speaking as best I can on
behalf of the process if not the Free
Software Foundation I don't think that
that concern is presently necessarily
warranted that is to say I see no sign
in the near term of any desire to drive
the copyleft Commons in the direction of
restrictions upon use by service
providers but I want to stress that I am
speaking of the present and I want to
ask us to consider the question whether
the present is necessarily the future
and what we ought to do about the space
between when the Google calculator was
first rolled out some little while back
and everybody found that it was very
neat and went to it immediately to begin
work on seeing what it felt like to test
drive it a couple of thoughtful people
typed into the box some units
calculations which were known bugs in
the new units and magically to nobody's
great surprise it turned out that they
were also bugs in the Google calculator
this was nothing more than a trivia fact
at the time it was of course entirely
appropriate to embed GU new units in the
in the Google calculator nobody had the
slightest concern about it everybody
just thought it was a fun fact to know
and share and then it wasn't true
anymore and by god the bugs weren't
there anymore but there wasn't any patch
either and people thought to themselves
well is there really an enormous
business enterprise reason for not
returning that patch to ganute units and
getting rid of the bugs we all know were
there but nobody's had a chance to
squash or
and inclination to press on yet or maybe
of course they said you know they might
have rewritten the whole thing and
taking canoe units out and there's
nothing in there that has anything to do
with any code than anybody else is using
but we are a little doubtful I thought
to myself ah that's you know just Debbie
and legal beefing and I don't have a lot
of time for it in my ordinary life I try
to solve problems that i think are
either present or likely and this didn't
seem to me to be a problem this didn't
even seem to me to be a fun fact to know
and tell but I do think how to call your
attention to it for what it means as a
straw blowing in the wind I think it's
an indication of the direction of a
concern if I were to draw a curve of the
clients and non clients with whom I
interact on a daily basis drawing the
propensity to consider a pharaoh GPL an
important positive enhancement to the
copyleft system against age I think you
would find that concern for the affero
GPL is an improvement to GPL is
inversely proportional to age on almost
a straight-line basis and it is younger
hackers who I think of as the post
Stallman generation of copyleft
enthusiasts among whom the idea of the
affero GPL is a positive enhancement to
future copyleft licenses runs strong I
think it is desirable not to strengthen
that position any further and I think it
is rather simple to make it go away
altogether I think this brings us back
to the question of the difference
between the opt-in interface on which
open source data is delivered to google
and the opt-out interface upon which
free software is delivered it seems to
me from outside and I don't purport to
anything but an outsider's view of the
situation it seems to me from an
outsider's perspective that it is
entirely reasonable for Google to take
the view that all inferences based upon
date of all
entirely provided by outsiders may be
regarded as private property not for
public disclosure of any kind until such
time as there is a compelling business
reason to make a disclosure that is to
say across that interface on the
outbound side only disclosure that's
relevant is voluntary disclosure for
Google business purposes on the opposite
polarity interface however where
software comes in and particularly
software under copyleft licenses it
seems to me that the polarity of the
disclosure rule should also be similarly
modified that is to say we're we're
generally useful changes are made to
copy left it software the balance of
equities should shift in the direction
of public disclosure Andrey contribution
of those mods where there is no business
purpose no matter how little or large to
compel holding on let us imagine then
for a moment the difference between an
environment in which let's take it
straight to the midline fifty percent of
the visible modifications of free
software made by google or return to
commons and fifty percent are retained
as business value to us which we seek to
expand our right of private modification
to embrace even at the 50-50 line i
think it almost inevitable that the
enthusiasm for the application of the
affero GPL to the conduct of enterprises
such as Google would go to zero and
remain there permanently the reason is
quite simple the right of private
modification is a valuable right to all
hackers they recognize it they believe
in it they invoke it they make use of it
to bring hackers to the point of
believing that the right of private
modification should be interfered with
by copyleft licenses requires making
them believe there is a danger more
important than the preservation of their
own convenience and privacy and that's a
heavy lift under ordinary circumstances
anything other than the appearance of a
creation
of danger is unlikely to result in
moving the hacker community in general
towards rules requiring contribution
over and above the right of private
modification in other words in order to
bring about a situation in which
frictional heating began to occur in the
copyleft licensing system
disadvantageous to Google's business
model it would be necessary for hackers
in the outside world to believe that
Google posed a danger sufficiently large
to justify overriding the sacredness of
the right of private modification that's
not easy to do but on the other hand we
have some rich friends or should I call
them frenemies in the world whose
fundamental activity with respect to
what we both do consists of the creation
of fear uncertainty and doubt and
therefore we must ask ourselves whether
we share a vulnerability to an increase
of fear uncertainty and doubt possibly
directed at creating a frictional
distance between us which need not be
there and maybe we need to consider
diplomatic measures between ourselves as
natural allies to present to prevent
that friction from occurring to apply a
couple of drops of oil to that interface
before it begins to heat and metal
shavings begin to show up at the bottom
of the engine and noises are created
which alert some people to our North
that there is an opportunity for
disruption
I think that it is reasonable to expect
that with measures gradual and barely
noticeable not public in any significant
way and requiring no marketing or
advertising that we could move the level
of friction on this interface to zero
and keep it there indefinitely I don't
think that this is a difficult job I
don't think it's scary I don't think it
raises significant problems for anybody
it may be that I don't understand some
portion of the problems it would raise
in here but i have long experience in
discovering that there are ways of
resolving even problems which people
very knowledgeable and thoughtful about
free and open source software have in
their businesses that is after all the
place where i tend to work so i believe
that there are reasons for taking
another look at the question of
publication policy at the software
interface line for the purpose of
avoiding future difficulties of which
others might take skilful advantage to
both of our regrets i also think that
this has significant effects on another
second-order aspect of the ecological
relationship between google and the free
world because of course the free world
contributes to things to google of
extraordinary value one is executable
software and the other is you skilled
labor thoughtful skilled labor
well-trained carefully disciplined
skilled labor not disciplined at
behaving like drones in proprietary
software skilled at the processes of
agile creation and rapid adaptation and
evolutionary uphill movement which is
what the free software ethos is about is
also crucial to the ecological existence
of this grand organism and nobody
outside in the free world can be unaware
of the depth of Google's need for
skilled labor or the intensity of its
recruiting
there is an ecological balance issue in
this respect to which arises from the
balance of publication or non
publication of modifications to free
software as projects which are
themselves constantly in need of skilled
labor find that project members and
participants whom they value and care
about and need are recruited into an
organization where they tend to go radio
silent resistance to recruiting in those
organizations rises to this is also a
form of friction at an interface of
importance which is ecologically capable
of dissipation with a little bit of
additional social engineering we could
reduce the apparent friction on that
interface to hear it may be that my
gauges for measurement are in some ways
better adapted to the situation than
yours are as recruiters your tendency is
to see either a success in hiring
somebody you want or a failure to get
somebody yet that you will sooner or
later hope to be able to attract it is
among my client base and the circles in
which I travel where the ecological
question are we being unfairly treated
somehow in the recruiting activity of
our giant cousin comes to the fore and
it is to people like me who function as
counselors and advisors to those smaller
nonprofit makers and distributors that
questions come what can we do to protect
the integrity of our project team
against predatory recruiting a
conception which it is very much in your
interest never to cause hackers to frame
in their minds the phrase predatory
recruiting should not exist in the free
world it's not good for you if it does
and it's our shared goal to prevent it
from ever shaping itself in hacker minds
it's important at any rate therefore for
me as the friendly outsider to tell you
that we have a little work to do
I would strongly suggest in other words
that there are ways that interact too or
maybe even three of the ecological
aspects of your role as the grandest of
all organisms which tied back to the
traditions cultural understandings and
legal institutions of the free world it
is not unacceptable in any way for that
to be true you are the monument to the
new the ways in which the free world
begins to build for itself and with its
own skills brains software heart and
soul monuments of human industry that
could never have been achieved in the
old ways and it is true of course that
even for hackers changes sometimes
unwelcome I know that as well as anybody
else in the world right now because the
minute I began making GPL 3 with mr.
Stallman GPL two became perfect as you
notice people who had their doubts their
uncertainties their fears even sometimes
made query Allah statements to the press
and other websites about GPL to suddenly
discovered that they loved it like a
brother that there was nothing wrong
with it I have come to the conclusion
that the only way to complete GPL 3 with
total unanimity of love and endorsement
is to announce the beginning of GPL for
change is always hard there's no
question about it and there is therefore
also no question about the fact that
some portion of the friction I am
talking about is simply the result of
the free worlds own difficulty in
accepting change once upon a time there
was the free world and no Google now
there is the free world and Google and
even that in and of itself can be
sufficient to create resistance and to
that resistance there is nothing to be
done but wait be patient be friendly be
cooperative be who we all are and it
will ease as it will ease even about
such obviously frictional subjects as
GPL version 3 but it is not only simple
resistance to change there are genuine
questions of ecological balance genuine
questions of resource commitment and
allocation genuine questions about the
underlying principles of share and share
alike and they are real and they should
be faced really I shrink from saying
openly lest some background noise begin
to start somewhere in the conversation
so let us say we should face them freely
and understand by which we mean candidly
and with some sense of mutual trust and
mutual engagement this can be difficult
when you are powerful because there are
many people who interact with you who
have no power at all and they wonder
about the disparity let me offer from
the news of the last couple of weeks
another last example if you are a lawyer
who specializes in thinking about
government subpoenas to data miners for
information government could not get any
other way there was much to be pleased
with in recent announcements concerning
privacy protection here it is useful if
somebody sends you a subpoena and says
could we please have all searches
conducted from a certain IP address to
be able to say I'm sorry we don't have
searches from that IP address we have
searches from a cluster of up to 256
computers one of which might be that one
we can't make a meaningful return on the
subpoena and in that sense to a very
small number of lawyers of whom I guess
I'm one by you know right of having
trained the others or something um it
was a welcome announcement which was
greeted among almost all the people with
whom I spoke that week from 12 year olds
to the CEOs of major software companies
as a total joke and a complete disaster
the reason was simple and it's obvious
to use it's obvious to me and was
obvious to them there is of course no
difficulty about inferring the bottom
eight bits of the IP address in fact if
you deal routinely with customers whose
IP address is dynamically assigned by
their isp each time they make a
connection you have to infer the bottom
eight bits of their IP address in order
to maintain any stability of calculation
about who they are and once you begin
differentiating people inside a
household who use the same computer even
the bottom eight bits of the address are
no longer really important you're
inferring an additional phew phantom
bits at the bottom of the IP address
which generate information about the
specific user of a multi-user machine so
the tendency among the non lawyers in
the technically sophisticated community
with whom I spoke was to say Google has
just given us a gold brick all I've done
is tell us we're not going to keep
anymore the data that isn't reliable and
that we don't need any way and we're
going to go on doing exactly what we
used to do which is spying just as much
as we used to spy well I said you know
up to a point I can certainly understand
what you're saying but you might want to
consider the legal implications of what
they've done and understand those as
independently valuable to privacy but
delay readers talkers thinkers with whom
I spoke in the week of your announcement
pretty much waived all that away and I
understood why they did it and so do you
here was an instance where a little bit
more candor and a little bit more depth
of discussion would probably have been
extremely helpful not because there was
a bad story that really existed and
needed to be diffused but because it was
hard to get a good story out over the
technical insights of people who may not
have been
to go much further than what they
thought was a shrewd technical notion
that you were giving away ice in the
winter time this is a consequence of the
very nature of the ecological
relationship between the large and the
small and the concentrated and the
decentralized it's a consequence of the
existence of life as the grandest
organism one could think of it in terms
I suppose of a kind of social duty
noblesse oblige but I think in fact it's
more than that I think it's a law of
echo logical life I think it's a law of
what it means to exist in a world of
organisms of different sizes and powers
where you are yourself the largest the
grandest and the most capable it seems
to me then that what I'm asking because
it indeed of course I'm always asking
I'm a lawyer I can't go anywhere without
asking for something and Chris assumed I
was going to ask for money for the law
firm but the truth is the money for the
law firm is the least of it I think what
I'm asking for is a partner in the
discussion of the ecology I think what
I'm asking for is a way to raise
questions of the long-term ecology of
relation between the free world and
Google is an entity unique and special
and precious beyond words I think what
I'm looking for is a way to commence
dialogue not about what we have to do
today and not about what we have to do
tomorrow but how we begin to think long
about what it means that this is the
achievement you have built and what it
means about the relationship between you
as builders of this from inside and all
of those other parts of the free world
who both admire and sometimes fear what
you have made and I think I'm asking for
that in part out of my own particular
concern for the welfare of the people
who may not understand or be willing to
trust but i think i am also asking for
what i asked for in the knowledge that
there are those who will profit from our
divisions deeply truly now that they
realize them and dangerously
we are not yet at the point where we can
think of this as an ecology troubled
only by the problems of peace this is
also an ecology troubled by the problems
of war I hope to live long enough in the
work I do to see the end of that phase i
believe that it is possible to achieve
it we will I think be able in the end to
restructure the global IT industry so
that there is no party that denies the
value of Commons or the existence of a
reason for coexistence it will take work
it will take effort it will take money
it will take luck it's like any other
war you have to fight it until you win
if it's important enough to begin in the
first place but even if we had succeeded
now beyond our wildest dreams in
creating an age of peace in the global
IT industry even if we had succeeded in
embedding the idea of common so deeply
that there was no committed enemy to it
we would still face this problem of the
diplomatic relations between the large
fish and the small ones because I don't
want my clients to become Google don't
make the mistake of thinking that that's
because i don't like google it's because
my clients will always be the small fish
somebody's got to look after them you
can't afford excellent lawyers lots of
them I know just how many there are
because I work with just how many there
are my clients can't have any others
there aren't any others for them there
won't be in the near term any others by
which I don't mean that we can't train
200 lawyers for the small fish we can I
hope and we will and that's the
advertisement for the firm send money
make more lawyers for the small fish but
remember that at the end of the day
they're still going to be small compared
to you remember that at the end of the
day what you want is for their lawyers
to be diplomats in relation to you not
adversaries in relation to you not
contentious parties in relation to you
what you want is for those interfaces to
exist with the lowest possible friction
and the largest possible value exchange
I think we are a few small tweaks from
optimum at the moment and I hope that
the remarks that I am making here taken
in the right spirit on all sides will be
a way to begin the process of
administering those few mods that we
most gracious whether we must gravely
need I appreciate your thoughtfulness
you're pondering your energy the
engagement with which you face all the
problems that confront you in your
extraordinary communal life together and
I hope that there will be room for a
little consideration of this issue in
and among all the others thank you very
much
questions
Chris
let's asks for a comparison of IBM's
relationship to the free software
community with Google's relationship um
IBM's relationship to the free software
community possesses one advantage in the
sense that it does not require very much
to persuade IBM to release mods to
commons where those mods don't have an
overwhelmingly important relationship to
their business the set the idea of a
strong hardware and strong software
ecology outside IBM has become for IBM I
think a pretty strong spine in business
strategy planning over the long period
as far ahead as IBM is inclined to look
and there's a reason for this IBM now
operates in my judgment with a very
segmented market in mind in which by the
middle of the 21st century IBM's bread
is buttered almost entirely by the
thousand largest businesses on on all
the governments on earth and all
customers of a smaller size than that
are essentially not the guaranteed IBM
market and not where the money comes
from accordingly it becomes possible for
IBM to be exceedingly aggressive about
commoditizing everything except that
which can be sold at the highest
possible profit to those particular
customers this does not yet result in a
single undivided strategy on IBM's part
because IBM remains an extremely large
and diverse entity whose internal
decision-making processes must allow
product managers a significant degree of
autonomy and it is still not the IBM
policy to call in the product manager of
db2 and say we've thought it over up
here at the top of the tree we've taken
a vote and you're an open source project
now right
but notwithstanding that fundamental
internal dis imagine A&amp;amp;E which will
persist for decade you know I should
think at least it is still possible for
IBM to think fairly along the long term
curve about the difference between what
the world's largest customers need and
everybody else and to be ruthless about
cleaning out the understory by
commoditizing me everything else if you
consider only the flow of GCC patches
for example I think you'll see the
difference in numbers as a difference in
qualitative structure beyond that I
would make another claim I think which
is that the IBM point of view is in a
way based more strongly around on we
don't distribute anything point of view
even than the Google position yes from
the google position though we don't
distribute anything in the sense of
handing out software except software we
have decided to hand out is like the
other BM position that is to say across
the software distribution interface we
both keep volume very low and decide how
to coordinate risks appropriately but
the IBM non distribution policy is based
not around a set of concerns with
license terms but around a set of
concerns with business risks who will
sue for patent infringement and who
won't and those risks you must take you
cannot avoid them as they can as they
have been doing
one last thing that I think it would be
fair to call attention to though it's
extremely hard to discuss there is at
IBM a significant amount of secret
contribution to the commons the
contributions themselves are necessarily
secret but the comments rather deceptive
and so sometimes I find myself looking
at the pad stream to a product and I see
IBM submission which says mindless
neatness or just cleaning up here or
something like that and it isn't it's
Tooth Fairy behavior and it's designed
to invent around a patent it's a
comparatively open secret I believe I
don't think that there's anybody in the
industry who follows the game extremely
closely who doesn't notice it being
played but it's a deniable activity um
that's not an activity in which I think
there's any other party on earth really
well-crafted to engage and it's unique
my clients are often i think unaware of
the extent to which they are benefited
by that activity which is precisely the
intention of the active that's not a
part of what I'm here to talk about in
any way I need to recommend that conduct
nor it want at every time where I
mention it and I very rarely do to
indicate that I'm ungrateful for it i
think it's enormously important but i
think it has almost nothing to do with
what the rest of the world including you
might be about um there is one more
thing to say about this um a comparison
which I believe you may have intended
and which i think is just Microsoft has
on several occasions attempted to make
it appear that IBM was in effect
attempting to co-opt for its own
purposes the free world and that it
would leave the free world in the lurch
the following morning and not respect us
for a variety of reasons of course that
was not a bad campaign to try to run
like a number of Microsoft campaigns
against the free world it blew up on the
launch pad more often than it safely
gained any altitude but there is and
remains and always will remain a durable
component of the free world that takes
that possibility seriously and when i am
in summers or in armonk which I very
frequently am and when we talk about how
to think long about the relationship
between their world and my clients which
we often do we sometimes talk about that
and that's the last distinction
organization that cat kids brought me
back
you have to prove to the outside world
from here to the
style of the next perfect
and scientist cartons
very surprising to just not
right of divergence be a line and the
heart good guess get that
we can all agree with me now
we never had that situation but for
organizations that are that's what form
of contribution would you suggest I
think that the points are absolutely
fair one and I don't think that what I
ought to suggest is an alternate form of
contribution you and I both want to
demand and work for these reduction of
friction and the contribution processes
of important and significant projects it
is after all the case that my work is
the work of trying to make projects
operate with less friction if I see
projects that we help to counsel and
advice making it hard for people to give
code to them in ways that doesn't
improve the legal defensibility of the
product our general response is to say
gee once you let up a little bit on that
and concentrate a little more on this
over here which might be a little more
important to the acceptance of your
project in the long run in particular
one of the things which it seems to me
is of the greatest possible value is to
strengthen the best practices
understandings among projects out in the
free world about how they ought to
conduct their contribution laws what
they ought to do given their policies
about whether they do or don't take
copyright assignments how they judge
patches from a legal point of view and
so on but some portion of what you're
referring to is not invented here pneus
based on a kind of technical merit
competition proved to me that your patch
is really good and important and I
should accept something not invented
here and under circumstances where you
meet that kind of resistance I agree
with you that you have no echo logical
responsibility to contribute back
projects that don't make it easy to
contribute back or making it hard to
contribute back and where it's hard it's
sometimes too hard I would score that a
fair call but i would ask whether if you
consider the total possibilities across
that interface whether you really think
the sort of not invented here don't
bring us your patches we don't want to
hear about it unless you're a saint when
you really think that that accounts for
a numerically preponderant or
significant portion of the decision
about whether to rican tribute i would
be entirely satisfied with a policy that
says we try to contribute back unless
there is a compelling reading business
reason to hold on to the modifications
and if the project is pissy with us we
just score them down as hard people to
work with and we let it go with that
that seems to me entirely socially fair
nobody would suggest that you ought to
bear a heavier burden of get you're
getting your patches in than any other
hacker and nobody would suggest at least
I don't think it would be fair to
suggest that you ought to give up any
sooner than anybody else either we want
projects to work well if you can help me
persuade projects to work well you know
a Mac and I have spent some time making
sure the GCC patches get into GCC and
that's a client of mine which I have
some significant understanding of an
influence over and still it takes a
little bit of time to get patches into
GCC and particularly at the beginning of
the relationship I hope we straightened
that out now and the things are smoother
I think that in general do you ought to
expect of the free world that it does
what it can to reduce your friction and
therefore I think what you're really
saying and what I really here is
remember it's going to be a two-way
street and I say hallelujah yes
really both as a predator
Oh
you
no no I thought you were but I thought
you were hearing the irony in the way I
described it I I would say that the
fiction of light against dark is too
colorful to be true and I would say that
the fiction of don't do evil is too
colorful new true to what we ought to do
is but what we ought to do is recognize
we all live in the real world and
nobody's fairy tales are the lights we
actually drive by out there but fairy
tales are important and they have
functioning you have yours in the free
world has its and Microsoft has their
when I refer to them you can sort of
hear the scare quotes yes
my clients take on the google Summer of
Code program um I don't think that I
hear sort of overall opinion of one kind
or another I think what I hear is the
difference of opinions among people who
went to summer camp and those who didn't
than those who loved it and those who
thought the counselors were mean you
know that's that's that's sort of that
that's sort of that sort of news and
notes for me rather than a sign of any
long-term anything do the question of
whether the program itself is meaningful
and valuable to the free world I haven't
the slightest doubt the ability to take
advantage of hack attacks in order to
make fixed and serious progress on stuff
we all need is an enormous asset to the
community we all know that software is
not produced in a neat homogeneous flow
so many lines per hour so many days a
week so many weeks a year that's part of
what made the proprietary software
industry very bad at producing software
the ability to take advantage of
people's seasonal desire to get a heap
of worked on all at once and go away
again is a very powerful activity I know
that because I was like that once myself
when I worked as a developer of APL
interpreters at IBM as a kid in college
and in law school my tendency was to go
on vacation from whatever work I was
doing academically at the time go to the
Santa Teresa lab at the bottom of our
now endless valley and spend two or
three weeks hacking on the VSA PL
interpreter or APL to and you know i
could get a heap of work done in three
weeks it's would have been much harder
to get that work done in six or ten or
twelve weeks than it was to do it in
three I think the google summer of code
is in that sense and extraordinarily
shrewd and community valuable way of
taking
vantage of how code is really made I
think it's a monument of excellence in
how we can turn the market relations and
the free world relations to common
reinforcement and what the opinion is of
the particular will code for pizza
worker at any given moment seems to me
the least of the story yes yes we signal
to one another across an increasingly
wide gulf I have to say
Percy i have 0
Google is not necessarily related to
whether they back
versus the I've seen
scary is cetera this is a general
problem user
but the open source community has
particular amount of memory
should they decide for any of these
officers so I wonder to talk
my on invitation of course I'm delighted
to talk about it the question then
becomes are you not really also calling
attention to the problem of the
long-term ecological consequences of
general suspicion and how does that
ecological growth of general suspicion
affect your remarks about the relations
between Google in the free world and I'm
grateful to you for asking the question
because of course it gives me permission
to talk about the elephant in the parlor
and a slightly more a candid way than I
might if not invited one of the things
which we knew even before new profile
writers started to get to it is that the
state has fundamentally lost its
advantage in the collection and
dissemination of intelligence as writers
have begun to call attention to the ways
of the state organs of
intelligence-gathering have come to
depend increasingly on open source
intelligence and as they have called
increasing attention to the ways in
which younger more technically adaptive
people within the intelligence community
have recognized the low level of
technological sophistication in
government intelligence services it has
become passively clear to people that is
to say I mean that there is an
unarticulated understanding that in the
next generation in the 21st century the
most powerful organs of intelligence
collection and dissemination in the
world are not going to be governments
and moreover the government intelligence
collection and dissemination is going to
concentrate on the few traditional areas
in which government intelligence
gathering from satellites and by
electronic interceptions is effective
that is against military targets against
strategic assets and resources mostly
having to do
with the deployment of violence when it
comes to other aspects of traditional
intelligence gathering assessment of
economic activity and potency assessment
of trends in society and political ideas
the primary poem in the collection and
gathering and dissemination of
intelligence is going to be held by
private parties and for this purpose
private parties means you this is an
intrinsic and unquestionable element in
your relation to the outside world you
risk identification with the CIA of
imagination and what is done to reflect
that problem outward in a revised and
harmonized and humanized form is an
important part of your relations to the
public at large it is a crucial aspect
of the situation but what I would say
about it is that it risks the creation
of a supersaturated solution of distrust
in which seed crystals of particular
kinds may cause a sudden phase
transition in parts of the solution
which are nearest to your intake filters
and because I have pointed to the free
software flow critical to your
day-to-day economic and long-term
strategic welfare that is a particular
place in which a sudden phase transition
from a solution of miasma of uncertainty
or not clarity of trust might suddenly
give way to a desire to do something
that will stop the train and it is
particularly among hackers that a
decision to do something individual to
stop the train might arise it is
precisely the hackers who might first
think to themselves I can hack the
intelligence collection system of the
world on behalf of good to bring it down
to
real bottom of this story I had a client
once upon a time who was deeply
concerned with government surveillance
of private life and with the relation
between that and government war-making
and he decided to do something about it
he was called Phil Zimmerman and he
decided to hack the system you do not
want a simmerman deciding to hack your
system out of general distrust of the
relationship between civil open-source
intelligence-gathering and the fate of
power in the 21st century thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
