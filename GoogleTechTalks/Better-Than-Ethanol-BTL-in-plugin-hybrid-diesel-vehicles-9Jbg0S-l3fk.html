have Reid Bennett who's going to be
talking to us about biofuels and in
particular biodiesel one thing to note
is that this talk is going to be on
google video so if there's anything that
you're going to ask that might seem
proprietary in nature we ask that you
come up afterward and talk to read about
that stuff instead of in the regular
question answer period so I met a read I
guess about six months ago and been
talking to on and off about biodiesel
and I on the heels of the Vinod Khosla
talk who talked about ethanol etc I went
over to to see him and we start talking
about the differences between ethanol
and biodiesel and a lot of other things
and it seemed very appropriate for him
to come and maybe tell all of you about
it and keep the discussion going so
without further ado Reed Bennett thanks
everyone actually what bill failed to
say is he asked me a question then you
got a two-hour answer so I'll hopefully
be a lot faster than that so out of
curiosity how many people here were at
the Vinod Khosla and how many you asked
questions those are really good
questions and you made me nervous how
buddy how many people run biodiesel got
two three four great okay so as my wife
reminds me I'm too old to be a graduate
student at the use at UC Davis where I
am the biofuels graduate student we just
received 20 million dollars from Chevron
yesterday and I wish I could get all of
it but I'm sure they're going to be
others following us so after Google if
you want to get into it as a graduate
student I don't recommend it but you're
welcome to talk to me about and actually
I have cards up here and I don't you
know no question is too small it's a
great area and it's a lot of fun so my
outline I'd like to suggest a solution
so you know where I'm angling talk about
context give you a whirlwind tour of
transportation talk about diesel engines
which I have a Jones for a whirlwind
tour fuels submissions and why
transportation is
tissue talk about plug-in hybrids I
don't know if you saw the unauthorized
announcement of google.org saying
they're big into plug-in hybrids then
get into an area related which is after
I've force-fed you all this stuff talk
about business models my hypothesis that
technology is not the key its business
models talk about examples of new
paradigm business models and then give
you some thoughts for Googlers so
cutting to the chase I believe diesel
not gasoline engines this thing called
BTL or biomass to liquid or more
technically known gasification of
biomass and fisher truckloads liquids
and then finally plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles in any case plug-in hybrids I
believe are the eighty-five percent
solution and biofuels is the fifteen
percent solution if you add that
together you got a hundred percent right
so I won't go through all the risks and
context but the time is very ripe for
things to happen despite the demagoguery
fear apathy mendacity self-interest or
ignorance I'm probably part of that too
it's hard to ignore funding spigots are
open for alternatives and for the clever
I think there's a way to make a buck and
save the world so some disturbing facts
you've probably seen this famous thing
which is over the last you know twelve
hundred years carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere has been pretty stable and
then guess what happened once we
industrialize it's going off the roof
now cause and effect is you know the
Bush administration Mario review pause
in effect but it's interesting now I'm
sorry for this really kind of difficult
slide but I couldn't steal it from
anywhere else other than badly done but
this basically shows temperature
variations it's a standard deviation
against a mean and what you can see is
approximately every two hundred thousand
years or so or maybe I've got that wrong
you get dips and you get peaks and so
you know I as part of them I'll tell you
about myself as part of talking to the
people you know that don't believe in
global warming I say to them hey even if
you don't believe in it
we're in a warming trend and it's going
to hit you hard and as you remember
those hot days back there they tend to
make people vote differently scream
differently things like that so even if
you don't believe in global warming I
think it's going to warm up and people
are going to make the obvious choice of
or decision a wide so you can tell how I
mean you all know about Canadian oil
sands or tar sands as they're called in
some places they're actually technically
different but I won't get into it but
Canada is Saudi Arabia thank goodness
our friends there's a break even at
forty to fifty dollars a gallon and you
can't sequester sorry you're right
barrel thank you any please please jump
in this is a 2 a.m. so i'm not going to
get it all right and you can't sequester
at in vehicles and one of the things
that people don't understand is this
process itself uses a lot of water so
talk so you can see how bad it is for
canada in the sense that you know you
can't even take a clear picture anymore
on the right now actually that's just a
bet Brad screenshot so another kind of
issue that you know is probably
politically based or maybe self interest
based of us is what is the true cost of
petroleum and so the best I can see in
the literature and popular is if we
really paid for all the incorporated all
the externalities a petroleum we'd be
paying seven dollars and fifty cents to
fifteen dollars a gallon which sounds a
lot like what they're paying in Europe
at least on the downside of that and
unfortunately the statistics say people
don't change their driving patterns so
who was the one who said I'm a software
guy during the day and a would-be
economist at night does that person here
that asked that question of a note
basically there is ZERO demand
elasticity so that's not good you know
some people would look at this is
corporate average fuel economy standards
some people would look at this as
failure meaning we haven't regulated our
way into making cars more efficient for
the last 25 years well first of all cars
are incredibly more efficient it just
goes into running all the parasitic
loads meaning tape decks ice coolers
whatever else right
are incredibly efficient they're
incredibly cleaner just there's more
cars and there's more junk that we pluck
that we plug into our cars and so what
you can see is I think the positive
thing is regulation itself if we could
ever get it there you know it's very
powerful look what happened when you
regulate at least you know that 1982 and
prior so whirlwind tour transportation
it started at with your feet seven
million years ago as the humanoids got
going and it ended kind of the last
technological innovation was the diesel
vehicles with these legends itself being
invented in 1900 so a quick vehicle
comparison again as part of the drink
from the firehose a spark ignition
engine or a gasoline engine operates at
low compression versus a diesel engine
that the fuel self ignites at high
temperatures and the fuel itself if any
of you have taken the chemistry or
remember back to it it's shorter chain
carbon atoms verse at c-6 2c9 octane c8
you know remember your Latin c14 to see
18 for diesel fuels and as I'll show in
a slide that's what plant oils are
they're magically at that you know at
that applicable T so people say well the
diesel it's not fair there's more energy
in the in the diesel diesel so you
should discount for that and I say well
there's more diesel and you yeah that's
a bad thing that there's more energy in
it and then vehicle costs of course for
gasoline and diesel vs electric and then
hydrogen you know our significant you
know significantly different
infrastructure costs gasoline diesel no
difference and you know my dear friend
I'm sorry it's my whipping post other
than other than ethanol is like 200 to
400 billion dollars of infrastructure
that would need to make it happen so you
know range is the killer for electric
vehicles I don't know what Alec might
say about that and then miles per gallon
you know these are approximate X's on
either one but my short answer is you
know
diesels are you know you have that
efficiency gain of about thirty percent
so the compression ignition engine the
diesel engine was demonstrated by rudolf
diesel in the 1900s and it was run on
rancid peanut oil so unfortunately the
diesel engine to come to contain that
heat and to contain that compression had
to have a lot of metal around it so we
needed to wait for you know a hundred
years until hi hi tech metals could make
the engine actually lighter and so
there's thirty percent better fuel
economy which is nice high torque at low
speed which is you know I would argue or
I think the statistics show how people
by their vehicles as they want those
giddy up and go I guess you would call
it and then in 1930s the first
implementation of a diesel engine in a
in a vehicle was taking us a boat engine
and putting it into a big limousine that
could barely fit it and so today trucks
primarily use it because they need high
torque at low speed to get those big big
vehicles going so you know it's not
unrealistic to look to Europe and what
they're doing in diesels I mean there's
a huge penetration of light duty
vehicles in Europe up to seventy percent
and why because of fuel economy and
their concerns because they don't have
you know their own oil and on top of it
for performance reasons and then you
know just some more statistics of if you
wanted to look at CNG figures they're
just like a blip on the radar screen if
you're fans of that technology but
either way diesel is not something new
and it's not something crazy it's just
not over here and there's some reasons
in terms of you know California Air
Resources Board that blah blah blah can
get into that maybe in the question
section but you cannot buy a new
passenger diesel vehicle in the Unites
excuse me in California today it's got
to have 7,500 miles on it and there's a
whole secondary market of 777 T 501
miles of used vehicles so again you can
see in this example kind of an
apples-to-apples gasoline to point o
litre and addy
is a significant more torque and you
know accelerations the same and then
fuel economy you know it's nice to have
and then how many people there's my
second kind of series of questions who
was born prior to nineteen seventy six
and there's a room oh wow how come all
the adults showed up you remember the
old Diesel's they are dirty and slow
well they're not that anymore they're
absolute rocket ships people love them
and you know again I'd love to sell fuel
economy and make the world's you know
join hands and sing but this is kind of
how people in America buy cars so it's
not a bad thing so now let's talk about
a whirlwind tour of fuels it all started
with food and then it started with
fodder you know what fodder is it's the
stuff you feed animals then the battery
came along at least invented then food
for the bicycle and then rail you know
series of things oil Edison Electric
diesel engines starting on peanut oil
electric vehicles coal for the most part
gasoline vehicles gasoline diesel
vehicles diesel in the 1940s they
realized hey we could put a thing called
biodiesel which I'll talk about in a
second into it and overcome some of the
issues of just putting plain vegetable
straight and oil straight into it which
it works also as long as it's not cold
so the other thing too is this is
nothing new at least in terms of the
present circumstance about foreign
source of petroleum issues you know
1970s and 80s it was all about ethanol
and I would just suggest it's kind of it
all about ethanol again 1980s methanol
which had the disadvantage of being
highly toxic but you know that didn't
bother some people 1990s the 2000s you
know the gaseous vehicle if you want to
call it that alternative electricity
some people know a lot about that in
this group and then kind of what
hydrogen and you know this is my one
Jones's like you know what if my one
Jones is who's going to accept
responsibility for hydrogen
in that it's taken all the oxygen out of
kind of alternatives and boy it's a real
tough sell particularly if you buy my
logic that you know biofuels combined
with plug-in hybrids is you know the way
to go so this just simply to show kind
of see you know this is the chemical
formulation of these various sub
components of natural plant oils and you
can see see 16 c 18 c 18 you know that's
diesel fuel so it's pretty pretty and
these are just percentages of that and
then there's a million you know there's
kind of the resources the conversion
technologies the fuels that they can be
turned into and I would say a lot of
people miss the fact about what vehicle
you put it into and you need to go
forward and backward off of that
capabilities of the various vehicles by
these will itself is you know it's think
of the old-time soap making process if
you take plants or animals and you put
them with a catalyst and you add alcohol
you get biodiesel you know again you
gotta if you're going to use like
restaurant grease you might have to
screen out the burritos or something
like that so that's you know you
material on the thing here if you add
water you get soap so and you know
advantages in terms of energy balance
there's subsidies out there at least
through 2008 disadvantages is and I've
show this in a second there's
significant limitations in terms of
feedstock I mean it seems like seven
billion if you took all the malaysian
palm oil in the world and turned it into
biodiesel and nobody got the eat of the
people that are dependent on that then
there'd be seven billion gallons of
biodiesel unfortunately we use 40
billion for this country alone so you
know and on the top of the ethical
implications of using food for fuel and
here again is let's say you were
starting a business and biodiesel in
California you know the fifth largest
economy in the world depending on you
know whether the French are making
cheese that month or not and what you've
got is you don't have a lot that's
really available for biodiesel and so
much as I love it
and if you've got a local Chinese
restaurant willing to give it to you and
you know you wear eye protection like
your mom told you it's whenever you're
playing with lie or something like that
it's great but in terms of the future
it's really difficult because we use in
this state alone about 4 billion gallons
of the stuff diesel wise and about 40
billion and then the country so now
ethanol now it's without a without you
know kind of competition nothing's fun
so i would call I call ethanol Hydra the
hydrogen scam light it seems to make a
lot of sense but just fundamentally as
you put all the pieces together it makes
a lot of sense for certain people it's
you know easy in the sense that GM
doesn't have to do anything which is
always nice for them and other than put
a gas cap on or spend 200 bucks X or
something like that but ultimately what
you have is you have you have sugar
which is really easy to turn it into
ethanol because you just go through the
fermentation step or you have these
other complex sugars which include a
thing called Hemi cellulose which is
just a matrix loosely bound of sugars
cellulose a more intense matrix harder
to break up or lignin which is the best
you're going to burn it for processed
fuel or something like that so you need
to do hydrolysis which is acid heat and
or as an enzymatic treatment and yeah
what my argument of this talk is we can
have this the future is today or you can
bet on the future which you know that's
the inherent nature of this company here
but we need solutions fast and if you
take it all into account you know
enzymes that are compared espin that
haven't been invented yet that require
homogeneous feedstocks which is not the
case that's a big jump so that one of
the things I think we're talking about
is I call it um you know after my
inflammatory remark about ethanol or I
think another flama torium remark about
hydrogen the Brazil policy right just
because Brazil is on the equator has all
the sugar cane you could want does not
mean that is a that is a good reason to
think
ethanol for the United States somebody
in this room asked about kind of the
longitudinal issues of this is in the
Coast lecture the longitudinal issues
meaning how far from the equator and is
ethanol ripe for the United States you
know Brazil is the largest Matt land
mass in the world on the equator
unfortunately everybody wants to put
something there that you know if you're
going to display it you're not going to
put ethanol where you bro I mean where
you have cows or something like that
you're going to put it in rainforests if
it's not already converted to ethanol so
just you know you can go through these
issues yourself but be very careful when
you know they talk about selling you the
the Brooklyn Bridge or talking about
Brazil or you know that type of thing
it's a special case an entirely special
case that only works with Brazil or
maybe Malaysia or maybe Indonesia and
they just happen to be on the equator
which you know this biofuels is all
about taking Sun energy putting it into
a biological capture element and turning
it into fuel and so you just take it
with a grain of salt now what I'm
pushing here is this thing called
biomass to liquid and basically you take
everything you know so remember that
movie Soylent Green Soylent Green is
people you know and whatever my kids
bother me I say you could be biofuels
too if you don't behave the you take it
you heat it at one-third the oxygen for
a sufficient combustion and it turns
into a sin gas now for those of you will
not give up on hydrogen let me say this
is the precursor to hydrogen the
hydrogen economy we build this
infrastructure for for the creation of
biomass to liquid you know when all the
other issues are solved with hydrogen
vehicles particularly is what this is
all about this talk is all about we've
got hydrogen and CEO coming out as
syngas now there's a and I think the
node mentioned this there is a 1920s
1910 process called fischer-tropsch
which basically takes these separate
molecules or groups of molecules and
puts them over a cattle
and puts them back together into c18
diesel fuel or whatever carbon chain
length you want it just happens that the
diesel fuel is kind of the most
efficient way to put it together you
could make ethanol out of this but it's
a suboptimal optimize process and you
get what the yeah go ahead how many
tools to in these respects to get you
like those rules yeah well what you're
talking about is energy balance which is
like a gallon of you know gallon of
petrol in and how many how much energy
you get out you know again this is this
is all argument you know the arguments
are as an example ethanol is point 75
meaning negative if you add the fact
that you can feed cows or livestock you
know it goes above one and can go all
the way even the people that you know
you would think are the best of here is
1.6 off of corn and then biodiesel you
hear about 364 and then biomass the
liquids up in the you know five to 15
range so it's extremely efficient and
this is not me talking stuff so energy
balance is that that would say your
question I guess my question was like so
much energy are you spending in order to
make a true love right so yeah so let's
let's put it in terms of gallons of
gasoline right you pull up an excuse me
a petroleum product you put one gallon
of petroleum product in to get and you
get 10 gallons of petroleum product out
okay and call all that comes out of the
biomass that you've released very
efficiently you know the energy that's
inherent in the biometric I'm s normal
by cutting down trees or sugar cane
correct yeah so you know I mean the
point of this whole thing is if you have
to produce between a highly specific
process that hasn't been invented yet or
omnivorous process you know it net net
you go with the omnivorous process the
difficulty of this and the advantage of
this is that it's a it's a process that
you know deals with its it's an oil
company process this is where the oil
companies come in and say okay we got
all the money in the world we're forced
to do this or we want to do this
depending on how you look at it we're
not going to get involved in biodiesel
you know there's not enough feedstock to
even worry about it ethanol we're
worried about energy balances and stuff
like that you know where do we do what
we do best which is beat it with a
sledgehammer and I'm arguing and if our
good confirmation you know this is where
they want to go and I would argue you
know FYI please look at it between this
and using Coolidge of these stuff
ray well I mean again the original
fischer-tropsch process was a coal I
mean this was the 1920 then you know the
world war one Germans trying to find a
way to like get around the fact that
they're at war and it's tough to get
Romanian oil and world war two Germany
also and South Africa you know in the
apartheid region taking all their coal
resources and avoiding the apartheid
things this is a you know this is a prop
the fischer-tropsch process was invented
for coal and the issue of you know the
buy it you doing it with biomass instead
is a punk you know it hasn't been
completely invented there are
demonstration projects that are fairly
substantial vw's doing this in
combination with shell and everything
like that now the real issue is and this
is why transport this is kind of the
underlying thing in terms of global
warming is if you put if you put it's a
sequestration problem 600 million
vehicles out there all burning right and
if you had to put your money in
economies of scale scrubbing if you want
to call it that and you had a choice
between coal into vehicles made liquid
or biomass into vehicles biomass is co2
neutral right so as bad as it is burning
wood right you're actually on it's only
a neutral greenhouse gas issue now
particulate matters and health issues
and stuff like that that's that's you
know the other part of the equation so
it's about carbon neutrality that's what
biofuels is all about and guess what
what's our issue at least if you buy
kind of the summary slides right in the
beginning yeah
so you know here's a this make sure eyes
bug out but ultimately what it is is
starting with how much we use what's
that in barrels what's then gallons how
many BTUs is that what's the equivalent
of jewels who want a jewel ser you want
a jewel right and in terms of percentage
I mean basically of all the Sun that
falls on the United States including I
don't think this includes Alaska you'd
need seventeen percent of the you know
land mass to grow yourself at today's
efficiencies in terms of photosynthesis
you need seventeen percent of our land
mass right now seventeen percent of
arable land mass now in that case you
need forty five percent of arable land
mass that's I you know what are we going
to eat what's the world going to eat if
we do that now you know my kind of goal
you know just my kind of rule thumb goal
is we had twelve percent of our oil from
the Middle East it's getting worse but
let's try that as at first let's just
you know see if we can get out of the
Middle East I mean it's a you know
that's the it's a world market and you
know that's nice but it doesn't really
you know ultimately oil is oil is a
problem in many ways so this is just the
simple fact of if you talk about the
efficiencies of photosynthesis which on
a aggregate basis is extremely extremely
powerful but on our looking at it son
you know plants are only 30 point three
three percent efficient to convert son
into carbon right or you know energy and
so this whole thing is simply to say if
we were going to displace a hundred
percent today we'd need forty five
percent of arable land mass if we are
going to do twenty percent nine percent
if we were going to displace the Middle
East it be five percent and this is a
right in line with I do believe it with
vinod khosla in the sense that you know
I believe in technology it's going to
happen but this is meant a function of
what if you say somehow we need to get
twice as much energy out of those plants
well it can be a matter of crop choice
it can be a matter of you know
technology it can be a matter of diesel
engines versus gasoline engines all
those type of things
and let's just say having not we haven't
focused on it yet we focused on food we
haven't focused on energy crops and
stuff like that you know in the end of
the day to this split if we would get a
5 X improvement and it's not you know
some of its going to come from by
attacking some of its going to come from
choice of vehicles some of its going to
come from you know what kind of you know
energy balance we have on the production
process but one percent pretty yeah I
think we can do that I don't think
that's going to disadvantaged anybody
and that's just a chart of the very with
various ways to look at it this is the
you can only burn out co2 data plan
breathed in during its lifetime yeah
what I have the petroleum based
fertilizers needs to grow the Grouse
good question yeah well in terms of
pollution of like the Mississippi and
everything like that that's a you know
you need to factor that into the whole
thing we still need to still need music
Charlie made fertilizers to grow these
crops Mike Bondi's where I needed how to
use them and how does that affect your
equation in terms right well it does
called field the wheel or well to wheel
and stuff like that those energy
balances I believe our factor didn't
actually packing yet I believe does a
factor day not to go back we're going to
fertilize
right so that you can use this it's
okay well sure yeah yeah it reminds me
too i mean the questions are really good
here so i'm going to repeat them too
because that was one of the problems of
listening to the notes talk was oh gosh
what did they just ask so the whirlwind
tour of emissions is there's five
regulated emissions volatile organic
compounds which you know if no talked
about he talked about you know that's
the problem if you don't if you go less
than there you go between 'if I've and
II 85 you've got an increase in
volatiles carbon monoxide particulate
matter which is really the dangerous one
in terms of carcinogens sulfur oxides
cause acid rain all those type of things
biofuels there's none of that and
nitrogen oxides the difficulty of diesel
engines because they will burn at high
temperatures you take atmospheric
nitrogen and you combine it with
atmospheric oxygen and you get nitrogen
oxides so I need to talk about that in a
second and then finally greenhouse gases
which is you know follow the court
docket about you know and California Air
Resources Board in the battle to see if
greenhouse gases are just a you know
food for plants or you know a danger
that should be regulated and can be
regulated and then here's ultimately
this field to wheel emissions thing
that's you know kind of filling in the
blanks on other data that's already out
there you can see gasoline versus diesel
diesel is kind of the zero line or the
one line in this type of thing
greenhouse gases it increase
significantly less particulate matter
significant less knocks huge amount of
VOCs compared to diesel and carbon
monoxide huge amount the dangerous ones
the knocks I mean quite frank excuse me
particulate matter NOx and VOCs combined
to make smog they have a certain you
know problem there but you know you can
make I mean the argument is you can make
you can pump up your tires so you use
less gas you know efficiency would be
the greatest you can pass cafe standards
but really my argument here is
fundamentally it's the choice of
vehicles it's the choice
of what you use in the feedstocks for
and the conversion thing all these other
things i'm not actually more important
but this is this is kind of the policy /
you know follow the banner to change the
world for the better thing that you can
do on a macro level yeah one question
about Reticulans is that particular
count comparison with particulate
filters on you LSD or just our US visa
I'm fairly certain that they have better
particular scrubbers or vehicles running
ultra-low sulfur diesel right which
could significantly affect that right
yeah I mean the question was about the
various kind of bins that vehicles go
into the certain you know the certain
allowance and ultimately that it factors
interests a difficult the combination in
terms of are they meeting their
emissions control requirements and it's
a fleet average in terms of emissions
all that type of thing and in terms of
fuel economy but oh I'd like she's
available you can use a different demon
but great a piece of fuel right yeah so
some I mean one of the arguments are
using biofuels because there's no sulfur
in it you know sulfur runes catalyst so
you can actually put cat you can put
catalytic converters on diesel vehicles
for example you know it's I don't want
to get too far into it you asked very
good questions but ultimately yeah let
me leave it at that and if you want to
get deeper into that you know I'll be
able to not answer your question
transportation and emissions I kind of
went into this 600 million vehicles out
there all distributed emitter 'he's very
difficult to control more you know more
vehicles coming with China and India
coming along and you know again biofuels
are the greenhouse gas neutral you know
solution and biofuels for transport you
know kind of beat that in your the
challenges for diesel engines oxide and
not nitrogen already told you why diesel
engines have problems with Knox
particular matter and then ultimately
there are technologies today some would
say oh you know there's problems with
them but you know Mercedes which is not
a good example because there will be
them a very expensive vehicle but in
their example of you know coming through
with solutions first they've got the
parts particular matter is solved and in
terms of the nox reduction you use urea
and run it over a catalyst and you know
if you can accept
that you might run out of the catalyst
and thus be out of compliance which is
the enviro ziff I want to call them that
have a problem with that because it's
not a perfect solution but there is no
kind of major invention to get to the
point where diesel engines are in
compliance to gasoline engines my
underlying argument is I think the
paradigm for regulation is based on
spark-ignition engines so where it's
hard you know where it's hard for
gasoline engines to make the emissions
requirements it's easy in terms of
regulations and the where it's easy it's
hard and you know because they're just
different diesel engines and gasoline
engines you know Diesel's come along and
they say well we've got everything
solved except the NOx and it's a what do
you want to call it the sudden death
right it's not a holistic it's not a
holistic approach to regulation meaning
within the context of oh gosh 911 and oh
gosh terrorism fueled by oil and stuff
like that but they're actually getting
it in Sacramento it's amazing you know
you know I'm a graduate student have
been trying to figure out what my
dissertation topic is well the darn
things moving so fast I can't find a
topic because I you know eventually they
come to their senses before i can write
something and then finally why is
transportation so vulnerable i would
argue that transportation is you know
this the pinnacle of greenhouse gas
control i would also argue it's the
pinnacle of in terms of vulnerability in
terms of petroleum use and everything
like that as you can see electricity you
know there are three purses three
percent dependent on petroleum and put
and transportation is ninety-eight
percent whoops and as you can see you
know transportation is the bottleneck in
terms of kind of foreign source oil
that's dependence and again i would
argue greenhouse gases so uh the
conclusions implications are a kind of
sub sub conclusion biomass is a limited
and valuable resource transportations
the most vulnerable sector to petroleum
disruption biomass is best suited to
controlling emissions greenhouse gases
and vehicles BTL versus ethanol is ready
and cheapest today and tomorrow and
diesel engines are more efficient and
best suited for BTL so if you follow
that logic
that's what I'm trying to trying to say
here now talk about plug-in hybrids you
know just because of feedstock and land
use I think it's pretty widely
acknowledged that biofuels or the
fifteen percent solution so how are we
going to get to the point the other
eighty-five percent and plugins which
were very strong at at at UC Davis we
have the Godfather plug-in hybrids
professor Andy Frank you know they are
in my mind the other eighty-five percent
solution and the fact that google.org
you know I think gave the interview and
did this was an official announcement
the fact that they're looking there it's
really smart another example of Google
and the lead I've got to compliment you
so here's the fundamentals that make
plug-in hybrids in my mind so exciting
eighty percent of households drive less
than 60 miles in a day so if you can get
a car that will go 60 miles on battery
only you don't use any petroleum in that
day it's got huge mile per gallon if you
don't have the time to charge which is
the big Bugaboo one of the big Bugaboos
of electric vehicles it can be a vehicle
like any other it just works you don't
have that issue about I can't go you
know the one percent I want to go for
300 miles on a tank or whatever you know
it's there cold starts believe it or not
are all the emissions and vehicles
that's it you know if you can if you've
got to cold starts in a day and you
eliminate one of those huge reductions
in emissions and then the average
vehicle stays stationary 19 hours a day
so one could argue that plugging it in I
mean if anybody who's from the cold
environments where they had to plug in
their vehicle so you know the block
heater or something like that right pain
in the ass or that big a deal and now I
say what if it was 70 cents a gallon
versus three dollars a gallon right you
know it's not that hard to think that
people can do it and there's inductive
charging which is you know no problem
and so oops
seventy cents a gallon just this light
some peace of mind okay sorry 2am again
I mean not all of this was done at 2am
but the ones where I made the mistake
was done at 2am so here's that you know
here's the fundamental things that make
plug-in so powerful right if we could
get you know eighty percent of all
Americans drive less than 60 miles in
today pull it a big battery in there
downsize the electric you know the
engine upsides the electric she the
motor and boy you know there's the
eighty five percent or eighty percent
solution and all of a sudden you know
it's not Oh every solution will work you
know we need to fund everything we need
you know everything's good we all sing
Kumbaya no this is competitive right
there is a best solution I'm arguing
this is the best solution and all the
sudden biofuels with all their
advantages becomes the only solution
because we're going to need the fuel
right and and you put it into plugins so
the other thing about plugins why it's
only 70 cents a gallon equivalent is
it's you know the fact that we use all
our energy during the day and we don't
use any of it at night and the power
companies they're fixed costs that they
have to pay for whether it's producing
or not and so the the power companies
are getting very excited as opposed I
don't think they support the electric
vehicle that well or it was just a
different time and not that big a deal
or you know other issues were on their
mind you know this is where you can you
can peek smooth is what it's called now
you guys here at Google pay half on
usage and another half on your peak load
right so in theory if we could give
every view plug-in hybrid and plug it
out you know valet parking at google and
google pays for the differential of that
it's a plug-in hybrid versus an SUV or
whatever you drive hopefully not all of
a sudden you got a lot of power there I
don't know how many people are in this
whole entire complex five thousand
something like that and so I'll show you
in a second that's all
a lot of power and has a lot of value so
that's another of the fundamentals so
this is not that this is confidential
it's just kind of a joke on LA
Confidential probably a bad one but you
know the what these are the things that
I've learned in you know six months of
looking at this intensely about plugins
nickel metal hydrides are you know the
present best technology other than
lithium ions which this has a nasty
habit of going getting a catching on
fire right now which are great because
they're half the weight and twice the
you know all that you want in a battery
nickel metal hydrides last the entire
life of a vehicle 150,000 miles so
that's one of the big issues was did you
have to replace the battery that made
these non commercially acceptable cost
per kilowatt what's it cost to build the
nat gas electric plant 1500 bucks for
nat gas and 2500 for nukes right so a
hundred kilowatts let's say for a
vehicle right what does that in terms of
inherent value it's a huge amount which
i would suggest could subsidize Google
subsidizing that you know giving you a
plug-in hybrid that costs no more than
you know hybrid or even a conventional
vehicle that's a lot of value the you
know you take Intel which you know I've
had some discussions with and you take
their 6,000 employees and folsom
unfortunately that probably numbers less
as per the news and the you know the
news but that's the same as a 660
megawatt p Koror has an inherent value
nine hundred ninety million bucks so
these are things that change the
paradigms in terms of business models of
getting this to work the other thing is
I skip but grid the vehicle vehicle the
grid is all very exciting the other what
I love about grid to vehicle down here
is that what's the limitation of kind of
wind and solar it's intermittent right
or it only comes so if you have if
you're a power company and you say geez
everybody's bought batteries that are
connected into the grid I don't have to
pay for that fixed cost I just have to
pay the variable cost of paying you to
hook up so I can store some of my wind
energy I can store some of my solar
it's you know 600 million vehicles in
the world and you know how many 100 150
hundred and twenty-five million here the
big battery to get to the p6t or the
sixty mile range all of a sudden you'd
start combining these things it's not
just a matter of oh jeez all engines are
more expensive yeah well they pay back
and you know you get your resale value
back Oh plug-in hybrids boy that's
another ten thousand bucks well it's not
then compared to what you could would
pay to have that generation possibility
and it's nothing compared to this the
storage capability make somewhat
sensitive like this how we have so many
gasoline late appointments and those
diesel
well it's the question was why aren't
hybrids here today or why are hybrids
you know I would argue I would argue
that it's just a matter of evolution
that we've taken a detour into the
hydrogen Highway take that with a grain
of salt people that love hydrogen or
that or we went too soon to hydrogen as
another is a nice way to say it but
ultimately the evolution is hybrids are
you know and then the Japanese are very
incremental hybrids is the natural
evolution off of vehicles plug-in
hybrids I would argue are the natural
evolution off of hybrid vehicles so very
few will know deep in the basement
well where where are you talking and I
mean you know in diesels aren't here at
all in the entire United States despite
the fact that their overwhelming and I
in Europe yeah and the other thing
somebody said it was stupid and I
appreciate that comment there is a
problem I mean basically electric motors
and diesels have the same either
essentially high torque at low speed
right so they're not you know they're
not the ultimate combination what I'm
arguing in a holistic sense is okay you
sacrifice some by going to a diesel
engine you sacrifice some efficiencies
in part in terms of going to diesel
engine but holistically if you take all
the pieces together you know Diesel's
are best suited for biofuels which are
best suited for you know greenhouse gas
issues in combination so that's you know
where I going slightly out on a limb and
of course you'd want to see real numbers
and you know that's more than you're
wanting could have put out here it'd be
nice the
the diesel-electric hybrid actually
would work for any well because the
diesels have good torque at low rpm but
only when they're turbos are eligible
and it's the turbo lag that actually
makes them not such great performers so
the diesel electric combo would actually
be pretty good because it would be very
responsible hang any support as well no
the other thing too is that you know I
mean a more layman's approach to that
really perceptive thought is that look
diesels are faster off the line they're
not as fast at the test los super rocket
ship for you know very well-heeled
consumers but they're faster than
gasoline engines you know for the most
part and that's why the Germans and
everybody else are going crazy on them
so that's a you know more layman's
approach to yes diesels work you know I
sorry I probably cut too thin and night
for it for that cop from that subject
matter go ahead this is just bad
so as the Mercedes required working on
diesel
yes I mean it depends on what you know I
take this with a grain of salt what's
working on what's announced and what's
actual right you know in our
interactions with VW for example through
the University of essentially through me
I basically said hey you sell diesel
vehicles over here and nobody's bought
you know you want them into this market
you should do whatever you can do so you
know I guess what I'm saying what I'm
saying is the automobile companies are
incremental it's like anything else the
failings of Detroit is they have no plan
B you know I hope they change that they
don't have the money to change that type
of thing everybody's got somebody deep
in the bowels of their company working
on this is an expert on this whole thing
but to get from Ground Zero to actually
production-ready is a big jump and so
the short answer is yes people are
working on it but the the medium answer
is you know they're probably working on
hydrogen more than they're working on
this specific sub component and most of
them aren't going to start with diesel
hybrids I'm going you know the I'm
trying to give you a kind of medium to
long-term future approach to the whole
thing is that satisfactory answer do the
prison's been successful for several
years
we have kickass diesel engines
yeah well I mean again successful and
successful right 250,000 units in a 12
million market right and is it leveling
off is it continuing they don't plugins
don't pay back in their lifetime of
ownership so is it have we soaked up all
the green and viral people that you know
want to look cool the issues on the
issues on you know Civic the Honda
doesn't sell the Prius does some people
say it's just because one looks cool
versus the other I think those are bad
signs when you you know people aren't
buying for efficiency and type of thing
like that so go ahead
copal of the unity
the Astros
power over him yeah a lot of power in
this room and then finally I would argue
that plug-in hybrids are perfect for
Homeland Security and disaster response
you know if you ever look at the
marketing material for hydrogen vehicles
it's you can go to the beach and have a
rock concert burning man off of the
hydrogen right well you can do that with
diesel plus you know you can do it on
battery only with the plug-in hybrids
type of thing and you know one could
also argue that the homeland security
people or even the people in Iraq I mean
what's the pelayo people screaming and
yelling over there one of the arguments
is the power doesn't work they've got
plenty of oil they need generators we
either buy them generators or we combine
them in in a in a plug-in so again not
to belabor the point you've seen this as
a reiteration now actually how we doing
in terms of Edgehill five minutes in
terms of its 55 minutes or 45 minutes
okay good so business model politics not
technology is the key my quick story of
my grandfather he was a pharmacist for a
94 year ninety 90 years one day I look
over his shoulder and he's mixing up
this cream and I say hey Gramps what's
that and this is old-time pharmacy where
you'd custom order the thing and he says
oh it's a cream I said what's it for he
says oh it's for my customer he's got
genital herpes and I go wow that's
pretty bad is that just to soothe it or
something he goes no it cures it I go
wait him excuse me it cures that it's
incurable you guys know it's not
incurable I said I said that's a billion
dollar product right and he says no it's
not because you need an infrastructure
of compounding pharmacists this thing's
off the patent I got it out of the
library right and and it needs it's got
low shelf life he says that is not a
commercial product right in the same way
biofuels I would argue there are no I
mean this is a you know it's like hit it
with a sledgehammer is big business
right i would say for biofuels the
difficulty of it it's so exciting you
can make it in your bathtub and stuff
like that is for eighty percent of the
problem
there's no proprietary position and that
doesn't jive with business as it's done
today in the venture capital word and
everything like that so actually I love
to see google.org kind of bridging those
type of problems there's no it's not an
investment it's a business pricing a
petroleum is unfair as we know you know
pricing a petroleum is a boom-and-bust
cycle I think prices will go down
unfortunately and you know just like
ethanol died the first death without
subsidies alternatives have a problem or
fair pricing they have a problem and put
things like google.org is sorely needed
so here's a something i would suggest
for new paradigms for business models
you know I've already talked about the
grid to vehicle in vehicle to grid idea
to give you guys all plug-in hybrids at
the cost of a regular vehicle because
Google makes money and changes the world
for the better my other idea is how does
car how do cars go into production for
the automobile companies well a rough
way to say it is you got to have 100
prototypes that are ready to the point
where they drive a hundred thousand
miles and don't break down so I have
called this the automotive user that
usability and new technology test
program which is we get 100 prototypes
we drive them around the headquarters of
Detroit of the major auto companies we
test them head-to-head with the you know
they're just retrofits so they're not
that fancy the retrofits of their
original vehicles and Google on its
website you know on its homepage or you
know pretty close to it anybody remember
Quokka com these are the guys you know
one person back there these are the guys
that would do the world class athlete
biometrics that's what I'd love to see a
Google right biometrics meaning miles
per gallon savings all the type of
things that really people make decisions
on whether cars work or not did they
break down did they not break down all
that kind of stuff so you know first you
want to ask nicely but second of all
maybe the taunt program aptly named can
solve that in terms of X PRIZE has an
automotive prize and then I've got some
ideas in terms of aggregating restaurant
grease and you know doing what's called
train
oriented development so these are all
things that you know what's the
technology here I would argue it's not
there's not a lot of technology here's
an example of kind of the oil field in
davis where we come from there's a
hundred and eight restaurant 69 of which
produce restaurant grease and so you
know again as I said biodiesel there's
not not enough but there's some and you
know billion dollar billion gallons of
displacement is better than nothing
especially when the emissions go down
and then you know kind of the unjust
like with plug-in hybrids where you sit
here and say what's the value of you
know 16 kilowatts and a vehicle times
twenty-five hundred dollars you know the
this is the inherent value and plugins
what's the value of renewable resources
and I would argue you can value that
against what's the value of reserves for
an oil company and if its domestic
feedstocks then it's you know there's no
risk to it and this is just a diagram of
how people say what are the risks and
you can put a number to that so here's
some thoughts for Google Googlers right
my son thinks I'm a rock star that I'm
coming here so you know with that spirit
you know you guys can change the world
and are already changing it thank you
for your products they're unbelievable
and keep it up right so you know again
don't be scared understanding the simple
and ubiquitous mechanical technologies
right vehicles fuels distribution and
infrastructure I would argue this is my
Jones obviously somebody needs to be
held accountable for hydrogen you know
and we should not be led into our next
phase of you know the future by the
people that you know we're pushing
hydrogen because it's just so some
fundamental issues that should have
caught people should have caught history
and fundamentals are important not all
alternatives are created equal you know
there's this kind of kumbaya mentality
of el alternatives are good no there's
better alternatives and others and I'd
be you know glad to go head-to-head and
you know change the world for the better
and get resources to the best follow the
money when it comes to stories and
credible
you know understand that the calling for
perfection is the enemy of the good
you've probably heard that before and
you know even questioned the good guys
because the adversarial system yeah
makes for extremism and makes us go for
sub optimal decisions you know no
there's everybody could win in fear if
hydrogen would work but what you know
does it is that the solution and I think
you know my background them in as long
in the tooth grad student is your hair
does advantages of being in the 40s when
you're in grad school there's
disadvantages consultant to a number of
companies in this area 10 years in
venture capital-backed life sciences
Europe finance and operations and kind
of five years USMC infantry officer and
that's how I got into this a mere four
years ago and I've you know not not
taken my education and monetized as
n'est pas ssible because I was sitting
on 101 and my gas-guzzling SUV looking
at you know the waist listening to the
war news in those days you know there
weren't as many dead americans and dead
iraqis at the point and my buddy pulls
up in a VW turbo diesel wagon running on
use cooking grease biodiesel and that's
who I am here today for better for worse
and so if you have some time for
questions I appreciate it I'll try to
relay them some of the questions are so
good I you know it's tough to even
translate them and please go to the
microphone
are there any of these you said the
biomass stuff you can do actually in
your bathtub is there something that you
know if I wanted to go out and start a
cult in some in in the middle of the
Midwest or something is there something
that I could actually afford that would
produce this stuff yeah yes I mean the
first issue is there is there enough of
it so what you want is like China you
know the Chinese restaurants central
where there's nobody going to the
Chinese restaurants and you know there's
an issue of there's not enough of it but
you can make this in your bathtub of
course you know i'm going to be put on
record there's liabilities and dangers
and the whole thing but you know go to
google.com and search on search on
making this there's plenty of people out
there selling kits there's plenty of
user groups that are real friendly and
trying to help you out there's people
that are producing biodiesel already you
know they just don't send less than 300
gallons so kind of organizing to be part
of those groups is the way to get at
that type of stuff and you know if you
want to save the fuel taxes and you've
got a friend who's got a Chinese
restaurant I don't know if it works you
know often wherever your survivalist
community but yeah I mean this is you
know this is 1900 zero technology for TS
technology is nothing new is this the
best of the is this better than is it
easier than ethanol and easier than the
other alternatives well again you know
the note said it's just fermentation
right so if you you know I brew brew
beer i brewed beer you know if you want
to ferment uh you know that you got to
decide you could just go to costco i
hear it's really cheap to buy just
soybean oil and you can put it right in
your diesel assuming the temperatures
right right I think fermentations more
difficult than this but you know it's
really not significant difference
started to answer one of my questions
which is so there's sort of two ways
people use biodiesel one is to use
biodiesel that's actually been I don't
know what
term is but the live process where it's
been turned into actual diesel fuel and
the other is just to use the fuel oil
that's filtered and I've seen examples
where people have additional equipment
that preheats heats the oil is do you
think that that's a viable alternative
or is that too expensive in terms of the
equipment did you have you know I mean
for the people that plug-in or lived up
in Wisconsin or something like that it's
a block heater and a fuel line heater
right you know so if you don't if you if
you don't want to have a block if you
want to run straight vegetable oil and
you don't want to add the extra expense
of a second tank or the block heater I
mean our stuff like that I mean it's
really a function of your own economics
of do you want to spend two thousand
dollars for this or two thousand dollars
for that I guess get the follow-up
question is is there any environmental
issues with the the process of turning
the vegetable oils into diesel fuel in
terms of like what happens to the lie
when you wash it away yeah well I mean
as a catalyst the definition of catalyst
is you recover them but are your process
is so good that you're going to get the
call us are there volatiles right I mean
it's a material in the greater scheme of
things because but yeah these are quote
unquote unregulated emitter of emissions
and yeah if you're I mean you're really
into it which is really fun you're
what's your footprint on the planet
saving the world while you're you know
creating were submissions and if you
just went and fueled up at the gas
station type of thing I mean yeah you
can get you can get into all those and
it will make your head spin um I was
hoping to find out more selfishly about
the straight vegetable oil option
because I have access to it pretty
easily being a chef and I've enjoyed so
partially because of a chef partially
because I'm interested I'm really
interested in the bio diesel option and
i know that i could get free you know
free fuel that I've just puts
my tank and I know I don't have time to
plan my bathtub and make it legal so I
just wondering what you I was hoping to
find out more about what I have to do to
get a car that will run on straight bed
at the vegetable oil and what are the
relative benefits or is there anything
anything known about you know how well
the car will hold up over time and
things like that yeah Wow good questions
um I mean first of all don't turn around
so they won't get you on tape this young
ladies in a catering for Google outfit
so I'm wondering where she could get the
free vegetable oil from Oh use vegetable
oil okay a huge vegetable oil I mean
it's about it's all about temperature
right if you're in Arizona you can again
you know sue me and I'm on tape right if
you're in Arizona it all works right
it's all a function of temperature
this is this is like in terms of in
terms of the all you know it's really
kind of I mean this is what do you want
to call home brewing right you can make
your own beer you can make your own
vodka you can make your own house you
get you know everything's possible right
you can get everything's possible kind
of and it depends on what you want to do
and how much effort you want to put into
it is it cheaper you know the short
answer is no I don't think it's going to
end up cheaper it's the same thing as
hybrid vehicles right they don't pay off
in the seven years but that you know
does it is it does it empower you can
you realize that you know all the
society as we have today is doesn't have
to be that way you know you it's great
stuff and I'd encourage you to try it
and you know also that's a political
movement of people that just won't buy
the system as it is because you see
where what's possible and what isn't
that's a macro answer to a good question
go ahead yes this broke into money
housewife once all early numbers have
are basically taking all the cool breeze
burning it you come in you say oh this
is a great thing to perm vegetable oil
except you know there's nothing left I
mean there's has anybody done any
calculations on how much supply there is
and yeah there's 750 million gallons if
we got every restaurant in the country
which would supply how many curves yeah
we use and we use 40 billion gallons a
year of diesel fuel in the United States
most a lot of that goes to shipping in
this rainy day that uses camo the most
of these the reason we don't see a whole
lot of one of the reasons we don't see a
lot of Jesus cars it's because most of
it is youtuber cross-continental
shipping drugs instead of either
slightly slightly market rail systems
and it's the fact that the country is
physically so big it takes a lot more
fuel to get stuff from place to place
yeah well the 30 billion number right
that's every everything in there and
there's very few diesel passion or
vehicles and why because you can't sell
them in California and that's the
biggest part of the market and all the
things that come to it but we use a lot
of diesel fuel we use a lot of gasoline
and you know again that's not the you
know the long terms its supply
constrained in terms of kind of the
technologically easiest approach not the
cheapest approach but the technolon you
know technology technological easiest
possible us
correct and that's also a function of
you no compassion donation
competitiveness and all that kind of
stuff so what the build plugin and it is
a Fremont Toyota GM plant I think right
and there's nothing else in California
