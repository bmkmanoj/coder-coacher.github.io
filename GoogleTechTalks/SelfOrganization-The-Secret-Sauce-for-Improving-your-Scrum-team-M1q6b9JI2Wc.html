you
all right good evening everyone if
you're ready to take your seats or even
if you're not we can get started my name
is Adam we'll Dave ski I'm a software
engineer here at Google and we'd like to
welcome you all to Google and I'm here
to introduce our guest dr. Jeff
Sutherland the co-inventor of scrum and
he has promised me that he is going to
explain the connection between the video
and scrum so without further ado here he
is the connection of the video is really
that it's a single guy that goes out and
does a motion and then pretty soon there
are other people that want to do it with
them and pretty soon people are piling
on to do it and then it's happening in
every country in the world and that's
kind of the way scrum is the other thing
that is interesting is that what we're
learning is that agile is more of an
emotion and an emotion and an emotion
and a body language than it is an
intellectual understanding of how to
manage projects and what I want to talk
about tonight Google asked for give us a
presentation that's not just another
scrum presentation okay so I'm going to
give you a presentation about how people
go through the motion of building
high-performance teams and some of the
underlying deep reasoning behind why why
it works as well as it does I think so
many of you know me
this year I'm spending a week a month
working with a venture capital company
openview Venture Partners and I work
with their portfolio companies are about
20 of them now and
I coach not only them but I find that as
I'm in the companies I'm often working
with sales and with a marketing scrum
and the CEO wants to run this company by
scrum and so I spent half of my time
outside of development and our
partnership our venture our investors
they run their own scrum to do their
investors so they're sitting on the
boards of these companies and they're
holding the senior managable accountable
for implementing scrum and they want to
know how many impediments did you guys
remove since the last board meeting for
the development team and I as a result I
wound up getting these calls from the
CEO or sometimes the CTO before the
board meeting they're saying Jeff is a
board meeting next week and and we need
to demonstrate some process improvement
what are we going to tell the board
about how we're implementing scrum not
only in software but some of our best
scrum teams right now are actually in
marketing they they're out there they're
they're more aggressive they're more
enthusiastic they're having more fun and
they really do do an interesting scrum
so scrum is designed for high-performing
teams from the beginning and the
performance of teams depending on pens
on them working together on their own
and self-organizing to improve their
performance and one of the one of the
keys to getting well-organized teams is
to let them organize themselves in the
best possible way which is kind of
fundamental to the way Google operates
to do it really well though we find that
it's a discipline and a learning so I
want to talk about three things that I
think are becoming interesting
phenomenon going on in the scrum
community the first is shock therapy you
know it's something that they probably
not sure they want to do it here at
Google but we'll talk about how that's a
way to kind of snap people out of the
waterfall thing you know it's like when
you when you've been kind of dancing the
wrong way for so long it really requires
a shock to your system to move into a
new way of
of thinking and moving the second thing
I'd like to talk about is the choice
uncertainty principle a really
interesting phenomenon I call it the
cosmic stopping problem these things are
really interesting to me and part of the
theory that underlying skrub makes it
work so well comes out of the complex
adaptive systems literature and so I'm
going to talk about that and also about
punctuated equilibrium because the way
biological systems evolved had a lot to
do with how scrum evolved I always need
to start by talking about scrum but
because a lot of people are doing scrum
but you know they left out a few things
I was talking about the today about the
early days in computing you know we used
to have the first computer I worked on
had this kind of magnetic drum and used
to have to feed at this paper tape it
was called the bootstrap and you'd feed
it into the system and Gogi and then all
of a sudden all the lights would come
out it's like magic and we're talking
about how there's still a boots sector
on your disk on your laptop and that
bootstrap is still there and if if that
boot sector is disturbed in any way
guess what the lights don't come on in
your laptop so scrum itself was designed
as a bootstrap a set of simple rules
which if a team actually put into
process and did in the right way it
would bootstrap them up into a
high-performing team but what you find
is a lot of companies will let's take
the bootstrap you know pointy-head says
we're going to try agile programming and
what it means is no more planning no
more documentation just start writing
code and complaining okay so he said you
know we're not going to use hey this
paper tape we don't need that he throws
that in the wastebasket he's looking at
the computer wait for the lights to come
on they're not going to come on it's
scrum but it sucks okay there's a lot of
people
doing that if you lasted the audience
here so we one of the interesting things
we've been talking about and I mentioned
last time was the Nokia test and bass
mode at Nokia Siemens Networks came up
with a simple checklist because he had
hundreds of teams doing scrum he wanted
to have the the smallest possible set of
questions to see you know are they
really doing scrum are they really doing
agile iterative development or not so he
would ask them you know are your are
your iterations time-boxed can you
deliver working software that's tested
not just not just a unit tested but
fully tested at the feature level at the
end of the iteration and because nokia
have this tradition of having 300 page
specs required before they can start
anything did you start the sprint with
an agile specification just enough to
get going it turns out only about half
of the scrum teams all over the world
can actually meet this test working
tested software at the end of it
iteration and then a few questions about
the scrum organization do you have a
product owner does a product owner have
a verdict backlogged is it prioritized
by business value is it estimated by the
team does the team have a burndown chart
do they know their velocity velocity is
the unit of production and is anyone
disrupting the team during the middle of
a sprint that's the one that hangs up a
lot of teams and when you put all this
together it turns out only about 10% of
the scrum teams worldwide can actually
pass this test okay so we have a lot of
work to do I'm going to talk to you
about what you can do about this and one
of the interesting questions for
companies that can get 5 to 10 times
normal performance one of the really
interesting questions is emerging is can
you monetize that let's say you're a
consultancy and you're out there and you
can actually execute agile teams and
deliver five times as much software in
the same time as the waterfall team down
the street can deliver
can you make five times as much money
now it's a business issue if you can't
your business model is broken now it's
all about straightening out the product
owner the management team like what are
they thinking that they're not making
more money if they deliver five times as
much stuff okay so what you see is some
companies like I was CTO a patient
keeper for eight years just left there
in June last year they quadrupled their
revenue it was all driven by scrum and I
have other companies that I work with
and do that some of them are up 300%
pretty good scrum maybe double revenue
but a lot of companies are doing scrum
but and what they're getting is you know
zero to thirty five percent although
some financial groups think thirty five
percent is pretty good I mean that can
be you know a few extra million dollars
but I would never have implemented scrum
for thirty five percent okay it was all
about 500 to a thousand percent
now the venture group as I mentioned in
practices scrum the partners have their
own scrum so I coached them as well and
and they invest only in agile projects
only in companies that going to do scrum
and they ensure the team's implement
best practices and drive it from the
board level and as a result we're seeing
many of our companies they don't just
adopt scrum and development the CEOs are
using it the marketing teams are using
it sales team and so forth it's been
really surprising to be how much
adoption we're seeing at other parts of
the company right now
now the investors want to know what's
the secret sauce because you know we
make a bet somebody bet on Google and
you know one out of a hundred of their
investments does what Google does if
they're lucky well what if they could
double that return what if they could
get two out of a hundred all there - all
of a sudden they're twice as productive
as the next venture of capital
so they want to implement scrum in every
company and all they want is twice as
many to go into a hyper productive state
where they take over their market so
what's the secret to doing that that's
what they want to know well the first
step is the dokey attest the second step
is that management needs to get totally
involved these to understand the
velocity two teams need to remove
impediments third the basic XP
engineering practices need to be
implemented some kind of test verse
development continuous integration of
mandatory and only then does the really
fun stuff start and that's what I'm
going to talk about tonight is the fun
stuff so when I talk about a high
productive state I mean at least Toyota
level performance Toyota has
consistently performed at four hundred
percent of the productivity of their
competitors worldwide twelve times the
quality so it used to take two years for
a company to achieve like 240 percent
improvement
two companies ago idx which is now GE
Healthcare was able to do that prima
Primavera software project management
company was another example of that
there are several others but now we're
actually seeing a 300 percent
improvement in velocity in three
Sprint's if you're doing two-week
Sprint's at six weeks and we're seeing
in some companies the ability of a good
agile coach to consistently do that and
I want to talk about one of them tonight
which is in a very interesting company
where he does one-week sprints and in
three weeks he boots them consistently
into this state here's some actually
historical data you know Mike cone in
his user stories book has a scrum this
was a six person scrum co-located that
re-implemented a waterfall
implementation the waterfall was
producing two function points for devel
per month function points were in a
national standard and that's what the
Windows Vista team did to a month but
the six-person team was almost 10 times
that and then this team was a us-russian
team half in the United States happen
Russia fully distributed outsourced team
they got almost as much velocity as six
people co-located in one room and if you
compare them to one of the latest
companies I'm working with Z BIA they do
all their development now jointly with
India every team is half dutch half
Indian they get the same level of
velocity this is the Netherlands railway
project all the scheduling and signage
for the entire railway system of the
Netherlands and they have half a dozen
waterfall vendors are the same project
and they consistently are running at
five times the velocity of the waterfall
teams so all the waterfall teams in this
project are doing two or three function
points per month and ZB is cranking
along at five with fully distributed
outsource teams so that's the kind of
performance we need here's a company
accident services they sent me their
last couple of dozen c-sharp projects
and you can see none of them were less
than seventeen function points for
develop and month the whole company has
gone into a hyper productive state so
this is the first company where
everybody's gone there now how can an
agile coach achieve let's say you go
into a regular company you know here we
are in New York go down to the bank they
just get average developers you're an
agile coach how are you going to take
them there on a consistent basis
management doesn't understand agile
they're not fully committed
well we I've seen I'm seeing now
multiple success points where they're
implementing an approach I call shock
therapy you know if you go down to the
street to the bank here you're going to
need shock therapy to get those guys
going
just not going to happen with simple
persuasion and one of the interesting
examples in my space I'm going to spend
most by talking about that but I've seen
it in J way and Sweden on their
consulting projects and very interesting
is pivotal labs in San Francisco these
guys were on a Total Immersion XP
environment so somebody starts up a
company in the valley often the VCS will
point them at pivotal they'll send their
team to pivotal for three months and
when they walk in there it's just like
walking into a martial arts dojo
welcome to pivotal here you do it our
way
leave your way at the door for three
months you're going to be totally
immersed in pair programming test-driven
development continuous integration
there'll be no deviations it will be
every day all day all the time and three
months from now we're just going to let
you go out on your own and you can do
whatever you want
by then you'll know the motion it'll be
in your body as well in your head
they've done 40 startups this way
already it's working pretty well so this
shock therapy martial arts is a good
analogy is similar to patterning
patterning the mind and the body so that
you know what to do you know in the dojo
when somebody comes at you and Agito you
know how to parry the blow flip them
throw them on the back twist their arm
and then they can't move and if they
come the other way it's the same thing
it's always a similar motion you learn
that motion you do it over and over and
over again until you don't even think it
just happens okay so it's only when you
understand the basics and can execute
the basics with mastery that you can get
creative most companies they want to be
creative upfront you know a lot of our
companies when we go into them they say
well we have our own own homegrown agile
process what do you think of a venture
capitalist would say to that
call us back when you're running the
glow it's like if you're if you're
building or your own homegrown database
in the C language like my last company
did the venture capitalist came in and
took one look at that and said are you
kidding call us back when you're running
on oracle we call the back three months
later and they gave us sixty million
dollars it makes a lot of difference
whether you're doing the full thing
industry standard or whether you hack
something up you know the point of view
of my venture group they look at a
homegrown implementation they'll say
it's going to take them ten years to get
where this guy I'm going to talk about
can get in three weeks why would we
invest in that it doesn't make any sense
whatsoever so I love my space because
you know it used to be three guys in a
garage now it's like four or five
hundred developers and they still think
they're in a garage it's totally
disorganized it's completely chaotic in
many respects but and they've grown into
a billion dollar company I don't know
what the revenue this year is did
anybody know about a third of the
company is is traditional waterfall not
very well-organized waterfall another
third of the company is scrum but they
have they have scrum teams but they have
project managers and a lot of the
project managers don't like scrum
they're actually trying to stamp it out
because it kind of interferes with their
power base but a third of the company
runs pretty good scrum and Scott Downey
is the agile coach there and he will
take an average team at myspace three
sprints their 240 percent of the average
velocity of a myspace team and he can do
that again and again and again and again
so I'm going to show them how he does it
you can give it a try see if it works
for you
so here's Scott's description of how it
works you know scum scrum provides a lot
of options in fact he thinks it provides
the people with too many options as a
result they really don't know quite what
to do
they start out so it occurred to him one
day that you know scrum teams are like
customers to the scrum master so as an
agile coach if I'm going to come into a
scrum master I ought to give them what
they need you know they don't know how
to set up their planning meeting so
we'll we'll show them how to do it and
we'll get them going and so when scrums
when scott start joins a team as a scrum
master and he usually has four or five
teams he's working with simultaneously
and he spins them up and then he moves
on to the next group he sets up a few
rules and here are the rules they do it
my way
until they've demonstrated 240 percent
improvement of their current velocity
they have completed three successful
sprints together at that velocity and
they have a good business to change any
good business reason to change any of
the rules I set up and the rules are
basically everyone on the team has to
attend scrum training and we're going to
do sprints at a one-week long I'm not
going to wait three months to figure out
if you know which end is up we're going
to figure that out in three weeks and he
says often they say well we can't do
anything in a week and he says answer is
well that means you can do four
nothing's in a month I'd rather find out
you can do nothing in a week so it's
going to be a week that's just the way
it is okay it's my dojo and that's the
way it works here
so he's been able to coax every team
into week-long sprints and in general
even when people meet his basic criteria
they typically do not change the rules
they see that it works and they keep
them the second
important thing that he really sets in
place is a strong definition of done its
feature complete its code complete there
are no known defects its approved by the
product order testing has been done
sufficiently so that its production
ready it's ready to ship to the
production team that boots it live at
MySpace and there are no exceptions to
this the only story point that counts at
the end of a spread is that one you know
sometimes they roll their eyes over this
and sometimes it takes three weeks to
get them to really working on the
estimation process they use planning
poco how many people don't know what
planning poker is in here everybody
knows the planning poker is or you're
not maybe one person doesn't it's a way
of estimating using relative sizing
which is much faster and much more
accurate than a typical try to measure
in hours and he does really fun things
like when it really works he buys at
them like a sheep and they buy back
there's a story behind Bob we won't go
into that tonight
Annie uses physical information
radiators the scrum board is the major
radiator I should have put a scrum board
picture in here but many of you know
what a scrum board looks like it's
basically a wall with post-it notes all
over it laying out the backlog the tasks
that are going to be done and as people
work on those tasks they move them
across the board and when he starts off
he says I I move their task for them let
me start haha well within a couple of
weeks they start moving themselves and
they're starting to work together and
self organize and as soon as they start
doing that then I is the scrum master
can start stepping back and here's some
of the things he runs into you know they
complain that scrum is having a meeting
every day that's more meetings than I
used to have there you're disrupting my
day I can't get my work done
and so what he does is he does only one
state daily stand-up meeting 15 minutes
and four sprint planning everything is
at Sprint explaining I think he's got
Sprint review everything is packaged
into a four hour time frame so the only
meetings they have is that for our thing
and a fifteen minute meeting a day
within a few weeks the team's collapsed
at four hours to a couple of hours and
about eight Sprint's together now
they're 90 minutes or less in order to
set up the sprint he goes through a
planning session it's part of it as the
sprint review is packaged into it so the
team shows the product owner what
they've done they go through a
retrospective so they look at how they
can improve then they go through the
product backlog and discuss what they
can take into the next sprint now Scott
is really good it's insisting that users
that use a stories product backlog is
ready coming into the spread and he
removes the things from the product
backlog they're not ready good teams do
not take any product backlog that's not
ready that mean it's fully specified to
the needs of the developers it's
estimated before it even comes into that
sprint planning meeting the developers
can estimate it and they think they can
do it in that sprint and if it doesn't
meet that criteria it's like get it off
the board product order to come back
when you're ready so Scott just does
that for the team since he's the
designated agile coach for the entire
company the product owners can't do
anything but you know complain about it
that's just the way it is it Scott's in
Scotts dojo so once they get all the
estimates and negotiating with a product
owner done off they go and they have
this they commit at the end of that
planning meeting Scott makes it really
clear what that commitments means you
know he even reads it out to them here's
you know sly
so like there in court you know here are
the things that the commitment means we
have a backlog we have a sprint backlog
we have estimates it's time to sign up I
want to know from every member of the
team are you ready to go or not now and
the team's start working they must do
things in priority order they must work
down that backlog from the top they must
complete that stop top story as fast as
possible and test it right away there's
no jumping around in that backlog
there's no doing nine or ten things at
once it's the team focusing on getting
that top thing gun and tested then the
next thing done intestine the next thing
done and tested he has a lot of standard
layouts for planning user stories he
completely offloads all management of
data and tooling he does it all himself
does it mess up the team's head with all
that stuff their job is to just turn
those stories out he only does this all
with a friendly smile you know he's kind
of a big like kind of a happy guy so it
kind of gets all the team like working
with us even though he doesn't give them
any options it will do it his way and
it's rocky in the start and he says they
hate him for at least two weeks because
they have to do this
way that they not used to doing it but
he says after a couple of weeks the team
starts to function and then he can start
to back off and become more of a
facilitator that we typically want the
scrum master to be but the team knows
the motion by that now the key
for this success that he has with this
is that he has the scrum master owns the
impediment list for the team and he
finds the biggest nastiest problem that
that team has for getting stuff done and
he makes that go away like immediately
like in a day or two by the time they
start so the team sees a functional
scrum master their problems are like
going away a big huge problem takes a
day or two regular problems take an hour
so he's mashing down those impediments
for them just like a good rugby player
so he makes the world a better place for
the team and second they know he's not
the permanent scrum master he's just
there to kind of get them started so
they're willing to put up with him for a
few weeks and so he doesn't care that
they're all mad at him all he cares is
that they meet their objectives and then
he's going to back off and allows them
to be stronger about you know we have
enough scott daily scrum meeting you're
all going to stand up that's just the
way it is it's God's dojo everybody
stands up the scrum meeting he usually
moves
to another team in six to twelve weeks
by that time they are in the average
around five hundred percent it's got a
bit 5x which is where you want to be is
anybody there in the room okay so
everybody has everybody's got something
to try when you go home if you're a
scrum master see if you can replicate
Scott's motion and it's got his
philosophic about it you know he's a
little bit Socratic you know when things
are like really screwed up with a scrum
meeting he just sits there and says you
know you guys notice anything wrong with
this picture and after a while the team
will start giving them the right answers
and the team starts to actually correct
each other when that dynamic starts to
go that's when it's starting to work
there's a great book called the five
dysfunctions of a team at the edge of
2008 conference the guys that do the
Kelley Blue Book that have the car
prices on the net have a team have to
outsource teams they're the prop they're
the coaches and the product owners and
they coach a team in China and a team in
India and the cultures are very
different in China and India so they use
that five dysfunctions of a team to work
the teams and the first thing on the
list is trust and openness and both of
those cultures the team members tend to
sit there until the leader or the senior
person who is always seen your bison our
seniority tell somebody what to do so
they have to really work at getting
these people to open up now the sign
that people open up is that they're
actually being honest with one another
and when they're honest with one another
that generates conflict they start fight
happen energy is unleashed and out of
that creative conflict if it's if it's
facilitated well comes an agreement and
how to work together and it's only when
that agreement comes out of that
conflict that people are ready to commit
and it's only when they commit they get
results so it was a fascinating
presentation about how they worked it's
a little different in India that it is
in China and they have to work through
that process of trying to get people to
behave like a team they have to
understand the basics of democracy
meritocracy honesty truth transparency
just because this guy has been here 10
years it doesn't mean that he gives the
orders
everything here is based on people
producing those that give the most they
are the ones that are the best people
and the ones that you should follow
that's a big change for some cultures
they call him the scrum whisperer
I think he sits there in the team
meeting he just whispers in their ear
let go in a hyper productive state he's
real proud of his team that got 16 50 16
times that's good it's rare to see a
team that goes 16 times although I've
had some you know the original scrum
design for the really high teams was 15
to 20 forget five to ten I'm kind of
backed off because 15 to 20 is hard but
it is possible he notices that teams
that use this QuickStart approach hit
their velocity elbow that that upswing
and velocity it pulls it way in a much
shorter timeframe and that allows the
product owners to get better data faster
the team's know their velocity their
velocities are improving the product
owners can then map out a road map
in the product backlog and it just works
a lot better than having them argue
where the scrum board should be and
wasted you know a few weeks messing
around not getting anything done but
it's a big culture shock he doesn't get
a lot of lunch invitations but the the
VP of engineering says they only hate me
for two or three weeks then they kind of
ignore me for a few weeks but he says
then when the VP of Engineering tries to
take him away from the team they start
screaming about it because Scott is
making life better for them he's
eliminating all their impediments he's
not allowing the product owners to mess
around
they must have backlog that's ready and
you know he keeps everything in order
buddies always changing is always
evolving now I thought about this and I
wondered you know could you add anybody
actually do this at Google I don't know
how many people for our work here at
Google here do you think you could ever
kickstart a team like this a goo or is
it such or is this kind of so alien to
the Google culture that it just would
never happen
a couple months ago you're going to give
it a try
now interestly enough if you think about
why does Scott's bootstrap work you
start to get into some deep theory that
lies behind scrum and one of the
interesting concepts that was written up
recently in a computer Matt I think it
was February this year maybe with some
veterans November last year in computer
magazine there was an article written on
what I call the cosmic stopping problem
because in the early days of computers
they used to just kind of crash randomly
and so they said well it must be cosmic
rays you know hitting the memory of the
computer and flipping a bit and then
BOOM you know but
they notice that never occurred when
interrupts weren't turned on and it also
is a big problem because the machines
would lock up and lots of work was lost
and you know computations were slow then
so you may have been running quick quite
a while and then boom it locks up he
lose all that work so they did some
analysis and they found that it had to
do with the flip flops in the system
that was supposed to be in a zero of one
state and the voltage that was moving
them between that state was sampled at
the clock cycle and if the clock cycle
went to sample the voltage and it was in
an intermediate state then you could get
a random flip so it had nothing to do
with cosmic rays at all it was basic to
the way computers work now at less than
200 megahertz you never have this thing
happened but it's 300 megahertz it would
disrupt the computer every two weeks and
at 400 megahertz there was a problem
every three minutes okay so now it's
getting pretty serious so they learn
that they had to stop the computer from
doing anything
if the flip-flop voltage was in - it was
an indeterminate state now the
interesting thing about this problem is
that it's a cosmic problem you go out on
the sidewalk out front of the building
and you're going to run into the problem
as soon as you start hitting a bunch of
pedestrians you start walking - all of a
sudden you don't know which way to turn
if there's any indeterminacy estate you
have to stop long enough for the two of
you to side or you crash right so this
problem has nothing to do with computers
it has to do with the way reality works
at every level of the universe the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle is an
example of it you know you can know a
particles position but if you do you
can't know its velocity you can know its
velocity but you can't know its location
this phenomenon is a manifestation of
the same problem so if you're running a
good scrum like stop the Scot is and you
see a piece of backlog that's not ready
boom stop get it out of here we're not
going to move on that you know it's your
you act just like they did when they
stopped the CPU from functioning if the
flip flops in an intermediate state it's
not because it's nice to do it's not
because it's a it's some idea that
somebody thought up is it it's the
cosmic stopping problem okay this is
cosmic you have to do it you minimize
work in progress if people start to
creep up and work in progress you stop
that that's going to cause crashes of
the development system you can't allow
it and if it's not done at the end of
the Sprint you don't allow that out of
the spread it's kicked right back into
the product backlog it doesn't count
stop even trying to get anything through
the end of the spread you have to be
rigorous about that just like the
computer is rigorous or you crash and
the faster you go the more you're going
to crash okay so this is a cosmic thing
this is not about being mean this is
about being right okay even at Google
this works always all the time in every
case everywhere at every level even in
Google it's cosmic now
if you get really good at forceful
stopping then you can get evolution of
systems working in a way that we see in
nature some years ago the the
evolutionary biologists noticed that
systems did not change kind of you know
all the time they stayed very stable and
then it then you know might be a million
years this this snail just crawled along
and then boom it popped and all of a
sudden it's a tadpole or something
everybody said well what happened now it
wasn't until Danny Hillis at Thinking
Machines in Cambridge modeled this on
the connection machine does anybody
remember the connection machine it was
one of the first supercomputers and the
guys at Harvard Jay Gould who actually
came one of the guys that came up with
punctuated equilibrium an evolutionary
theory guy at Harvard said hey can you
model biological evolution on on the
supercomputer and tell me what happens
so Danny you know worked up a program
and started modeling it and he said it's
fascinating he says you know this this
thing we simulated at a bunch of
different organ systems and they were
all kind of mutating and you know
evolving in time as the computers going
and but the system behavior doesn't
change and only when about six different
organ systems all positioned themselves
in exactly the right place did the
squirrel start to fly and before that it
was just a regular squirrel for a
million years of simulated evolution
until bang one day it flew but during
that million years every system was
subtly changing until they got just
exactly in the right position okay now
where the stopping problem comes in a
devolution is that you know sometimes if
the squirrel didn't fly you got eaten
okay so the evolutionary stopping
problem if evolution is really
challenging and if it's really brutal
and if termination is immediate precedes
faster okay
now the same thing occurs in software
particularly if you have a good
component model you know you're working
away and you're making changes
components of the system particularly if
you're a platform technology as much as
much of Google stuff is changing this
piece over here that piece over here god
you're trying to get you know chrome to
work and I don't know how long you guys
have been working on that but probably a
long time before you booted it up on the
web recently but all of a sudden one day
enough pieces come together that boom
Chrome appears and everybody says what
the hell did that come from and what
does it mean there's kind of this
philosophical discussion about the
meaning love life or in chrome on the
web right now so the jump is often fast
and surprising and to execute this on a
team the team has to avoid many
behaviors and they have to perform a few
behaviors really well it's more
dependent on not doing on stopping than
it is on starting
scrum team we had this component model
we had this concept of an ensemble and
I'm Sol was a set of objects that had an
API that had a behavior a fully-formed
feature and it was features within
features all the way down and when the
first scrum team went to do a sprint
task they did better than just taking
the task at the top of the board the
whole team said if we do a task any task
on the board which task would we do that
would make a feature appear to the
end-user the fastest and the whole team
would discuss that before they would
take a task and then the next person was
going to take a task would have to take
it and it's three weeks after they
started that the team blew into a high
productive state and they said it's
because like punctuated equilibrium all
of a sudden we came in one day and we
said okay we're going to do this
three-month or three-day task but now we
see that the components have evolved
over here to the state that we could do
it in one hour let's do it over here so
if all your three days staff start
collapsing into one hour your sprint
backlog is like one of these chocolate
cakes you bake when all of a sudden it
implodes has anybody ever seen one of
those things you just got to put enough
chocolate in there okay you get this
imploding chocolate cake and you thought
it was going to take you four weeks but
now you're done in a week and everybody
says what happened it's like the cake
you look in the oven what happened
it's so fast and so surprising so it's
because the team looked at that task as
a disrupter to an evolving system they
knew that changing this would have a
ripple effect and they wanted the
ripples to produce appearance of a new
feature as fast as possible
and every decision about what to do was
based on that I've been trying to get
another team to do that for 15 years and
I haven't found one yet for some reason
the concept is beyond most software
developers but Google asks for not your
usual scrum presentation so maybe
there's some people at Google will try
out so hyper productivity at the end of
the day it's based on complex adaptive
systems theory in order to do it really
well you need an architectural metaphor
that allows rapid refactoring so you can
get these ripple effects that go through
the system you need to make the changes
to the components in the right order to
maximize the spirit appearance of new
features you didn't know this was going
to be architecture did you but you know
we say architecture emerges in agile it
does but they have the environment in
which it can emerge fast and they're
totally focused on making it emerge in
one of the right ways as fast as
possible so you need to solve the cosmic
staffing problem by not working on
requirements are not ready avoiding work
that is not done minimizing working
progress avoiding obstacles through
self-organization and the list is
endless of the things you should not do
and the reason that scrum boots are
Scott boots the guys at myspace up in
three weeks is that he enforces them not
doing what they shouldn't be doing which
is totally different than what most
people think self-organization is the
team chooses their own work and they do
whatever they want and there's no
management interference it's true that
there's no management interference but
there's reality interference the cosmos
dictates the team need
listen to God talk and follow the
commandments and only then will they
become a super performing team so Google
you asked for it you got it let's see if
you can do something with it comments
questions thoughts objections yeah one
of the I mean obviously my sponsor yeah
the question is at myspace are they
doing both operational support and new
feature production at the same time
obviously in some parts of the company
they definitely are doing that but of
the teams that Scott is working with he
tries to pull that all into one team you
know we'd like to think there is no
maintenance of support this only cope
that needs to be changed
because we need a new feature or a
feature there is not quite done yet
so he tries to focus all of that into
the team and its biggest block is they
still have to go through a deployment
group to get it live on the web they are
stopping progress big time and he's
trying to crack through that so the team
can actually fully deploy as well as
build and support everything I have a
question but first I want to let you all
know we're recording the talk and video
conferencing so if you use the
microphone to ask your questions it'll
work better my question is will the next
version of the scrum book recommend
one-week sprints
you know in scrum we've always
recommended Sprint's be four weeks or
less and can sway ver is still
recommending four weeks and most of the
scrum that patient keeper my former
company did were four weeks grumps
although we would do them three to one
week if the customer need demanded it
and but those of her teams that actually
deploy to production now we do have some
web teams deploying put production every
week and even AT&amp;amp;T in the earlier days
of AT&amp;amp;T they had a code base of a
hundred million lines of code they would
deploy to production every week they
would do an upgrade in 42 countries so
it shows that it doesn't matter how big
or complex your project is you can do
weekly sprints now I would say on the
average Spencer definitely tend to
getting shorter there I would say
probably at least half maybe more than
half of the Sprint's in the world today
tend to be two weeks or three weeks at
the most
so in general people of finding those
better now the reason that we shortened
Sprint's initially were really two one
was the team couldn't get stuff done in
a month so again counter-intuitively
everything in agile is counterintuitive
if they can't do it in a month shorten
it to two weeks and then they actually
can do it better and the reason is it's
a smaller piece of work to get their
heads around and what Scott is doing
obviously MySpace is shortening it to
week and they he feels that it all works
better as well at a week now that's a
long-winded non answer to your question
I don't know but I can guarantee us less
than four weeks and I can guarantee
we're not going to say it shouldn't be a
week I'm talking to NPR and the radio
business they really need daily Sprint's
because you know all things considered
the planning starts in less than a day
it's on the air when it's done it's gone
it's a whole new release every day
so a lot of it depends on your business
the capabilities of your team the forces
affecting what you're doing the Sprint's
are definitely getting shorter I can I
can tell you that thanks up Jeff so if
we go with shorter sprint right would we
spend more time on planning that if you
go with spore week sprint in other words
if you spend four hours and you go
deficient in your planning per four
weeks that's not much time wasted if you
spend even one three two hours for week
you're spending more time on your team
so my team consistently complains that
even for our time for planning and with
respective is too much okay and that's
four per month right so I guess it
depends on the nature of business but
the recommendation I've always made is
that if you you know if it's a month or
maybe four hours if it's two weeks it
should be two hours and if it's one week
it should be one hour now Scott gets it
down to an hour and a half but he's
doing the sprint review and the sprint
planning and an hour and a half I can
tell you at patient keeper they've
reduced that to zero so that's a long
discussion about all that you've got to
be really good the quality has to be
really high you have to be really
efficient and the planning has to be
continuous so everything's always ready
and you don't have to sit down and
figure it out so all right over here
next hi um I was little can you go into
a little about reality interference
versus like how do you get to that
process where you know what how do you
know what is what one should change how
is how is it natural or organic er well
there's a tremendous amount of
literature on complex adaptive systems
and
there's this basic understanding and
definitions about what they are first of
all there's self-organizing systems
we're talking today about Auto
autopoietic systems we have a Brazilian
that knows some of the people that
invented you here the guy with son that
knows some of the inventors of the
concept in Brazil it's as much as the
Silla Safa concept as it is a reality
concept an autopoietic system is a
self-organizing system that boots up the
most interesting one is your toilet you
flush it and all of a sudden you get
this whirlpool it boots up into a stable
state and it stays there as long as
there's energy flow so what we're trying
to do with scrum is probably a bad
example flushing your toilet but that's
the most poetic metaphor you know
another one probably another bad example
is the hurricane that almost missed New
Orleans you know that thing starts to
whirl up and as long as this energy that
thing is in an autocratic state its
self-organizing self-sustaining and so
you want to boot up the self-organizing
system now another important
characteristic of it is there is no
central point of control in one of these
self-organizing systems so that's the
reason you know we say the managers need
to back off and what they think well I'm
not managing anymore because I'm not
micromanaging but what we really mean is
you need to back off and then use very
subtle influence get the hurricane to
start Kennish waver was called the
hurricane at primavera because every
time he visited once a month and every
time he went in there it was like a
hurricane went through the place
everything was changed subtle maybe not
so subtle control sometimes and there
there's several other systems behavior
emerges in a self-organized system a
great example last time was here I think
I talked about the robe
I Robot okay and the Roomba they're
vacuums the robot you lay down the room
or you turn it on it has no idea we're
in a conference room
it just goes were Bow Wow here were bum
Oh herb boom oh and you know in about
five minutes it knows this whole room is
and that's the way the scrum team should
be go now whoa it's the wrong thing go
now now whoops not that either whoo and
pretty soon the team is navigating
around all the obstacles into what the
customer wants and they look like
they're going at Lightspeed because
they've figured out how to run around
all the obstacles so all these things
come out of understanding complex
systems and so that means if if you're a
manager or a leader in an agile
organization you know you don't want to
mess with that don't go to the Roomba
kick it now you completely disrupted its
memory it doesn't know where it is do
you know that I have recently I had this
one study on my web about how commanding
12 management makes you stupid
now there are three studies recently if
you have command and control management
on the average you lose five to ten IQ
points because they went around kicking
the robot and CeMAT rat you know making
its memory all screwy it can't think is
that enough examples study complex
adaptive system that's what it's all
about yeah so I I actually have a
question going back to some of the
metrics that you brought up earlier in
the talk and the notion of a function
point which seems like this great unit
but you know if you're actually on the
team and you're doing these estimates
and particularly if you haven't been on
a scrum team originally and so you don't
have necessarily function points before
this
I'm team started how do you actually
arrive at a metric that's solid and
gives you a basis for comparison like
that well first of all I want to say
function points are an international
standard that has a specific way of
calculating them that are typically not
used on agile teams because it's
complicated and needs some expertise the
virtue of it is that it's comparable
across teams and across technologies and
across companies so for research you
know we use it for agile teams you
recommend story points these are not
comparable across teams and it's a
relative unit of measure and really what
you want is kind of a stable story a
kind of thing a team does a lot and you
give it some value a one or two you know
this thing typically takes us half a day
to do and it's a 1 so anything we see we
ask okay is this twice as big as that or
five times as big as that and so then
you you build up estimates based on a
stable reference and then the question
is every Sprint how many of those pieces
can you crank through your system so
that's very easy for a jaltest ado
usually in three sprints they can kind
of settle that down so they have a
stable velocity thanks hi Jeff lean has
like you mentioned shock therapy before
lean has this idea of they have a
regular production line they'll come in
and bring some sensei in and totally
reorganize the production line and it's
a big mess for people who are used to
working on it and then from there that
same team continues to improve it from
there
going forward would you care to compare
that to what you're talking about with
shock therapy maybe there's yeah I think
that's a great example of how Toyota
does shock therapy again it's like the
dojo you bring the sin Z in he whacks
everybody side of the head puts
everything in a different arrangement
and what he's done is that he's tried to
rearrange the system so that auto
police's will be more probable and then
he tells the people to improve the
system so they start flowing energy into
it again it's all about complex adaptive
systems and
I learned in the 4i performing team that
there are some different stages that the
team can go through like norming forming
performing is that part of scrum XP
framework or not
well it's something that we talk about a
lot in the scrum training I mean it's
not formally a part of the framework but
it comes out of this there psychological
research and it applies to any team it
doesn't matter with a scrum or it's an
emergency response team in Bangladesh
when teams get together they have to you
know first thing they do is kind of
start jockeying for position or arguing
about what they should do and they have
to do that long enough so that they
establish norms of behavior and it's
only when they agree on how they're
going to work together that they can
start actually getting stuff done well
so yeah every team goes through that
process it with these high-performing
teams we're talking about their way
beyond that they they they know how to
work together and they're spinning up in
this kind of autopoietic loop because
people are responding fast and almost
unconsciously to what to do next and
then they go faster than they expected
and it surprises them yeah yeah but it
may happen also that after a certain
time they get in this i performing stage
now a new element happened a new hire
for example getting a team so sometimes
they have to go back in the previous
stage to get back on I performing right
right now this gets into another deep
and controversial concept and it has to
do with this concept that this guy named
I think it was Sheldon Drake or
Sheldrake I think his name called
morphogenetic fields and his argument is
that it's when people do things in a
certain way and that becomes so strong
in the culture when people come into
that field they start patterning into
that culture and
patient keeper they say it's amazing as
a company that never knew anything but
scrum and they say they get a new person
in on Monday and by thirsty it's like
he's done it all its life there's
something about the field there it's so
engrained that people boot up like
immediately but you're right if it's a
new team and you don't have the benefit
of that culture that's surrounding then
the team almost has to relearn a little
bit when they get a new person the team
is kicked back into a different state
but the culture is so strong it doesn't
matter to the team when someone comes in
they're in that state consistently then
that person will merge quickly into it
it's fascinating it's like entrainment
is actually a lot of a lot of
psychological literature biofeedback
literature on entrainment how your brain
becomes entrained all this stuff is
relevant yeah what suggestions do you
have for introducing agile or scrum to a
team when it's not mandated by
management well I think that a team
needs to be interested in trying
something new
I think MOX drybeck did a very good job
at Google with the AdWords team he
thought that you know he he couldn't
just the culture did not allow him to
demand any kind of organization so he
started by asking him okay what's your
biggest problem and and they said well
we're having a problem that we're
stepping on one another you know where
our code is conflicting in the codebase
people are working on the same thing
without knowing it and we find out later
it's been duplicate work and so Mark
said well you know this is this thing
that this agile thing called a daily
meeting you know people just get
together for a couple minutes kind of
check in make sure that doesn't happen
you want to try it then the team said
well yeah let's try it now mark was
pretty smart guy and he knew that that
wouldn't fix the problem
it would just surface nine more problems
and so you know after a week of that he
said okay now it's your biggest problem
and they said well we are avoiding
duplicate work
we are there are less complex in the
cotton kaya base but we're still having
a hell of a time meeting our dates and
we're getting a lot of kickback you know
it doesn't matter for a lot of Google
products but AdWords run all the ads we
have a million partners running our ads
and they complain when we don't meet you
know our projected dates and so Mark
said well there's this thing called a
release burn down chart he didn't even
talk about a scrap a release burn down
chart why don't we try that and so they
got that up and then they were watching
they were tracking it was looking
perfect and they got right towards the
end of the release and all of a sudden
flatlined
they blew to another release and the
engineers said what happened and Mark
said well you know this is this thing
called work-in-progress
let's look at our burn down and see what
percent of the tasks we're done over 80%
when it flatlined and what a percent of
the stories were closed less than 20
percent you see on all this work in
progress it all had to close at the end
of the Sprint that doesn't happen you
can't do that you're you're confronting
reality again okay so then the team
needed to learn about work in progress
so step by step it took him six months
and then he had pretty much the complete
bootstrap of scrum and things are
running pretty well he said hey guess
what we're doing scrub you didn't even
know it that was a good implementation I
wonder if you could talk some more about
the development of the architecture
because I'm wondering if really you need
to have some senior people who have
already seen architectures that work and
don't work before you start so are you
making that as an assumption that's a
good point you know I asked Jim Cole
peon who was at Bell Labs for many years
and one of the architects there I asked
him a while back you know the architects
are always complaining that they need to
spend time before the development teams
can start sprinting so I want to know
how much time you think the architects
need before the sprint starts and he
said three days I said well what if they
say they see need six weeks he says
they're bad architects hmm and now
recently he's come around he said Jeff
don't tell in three days come getting
beat up all over the world tell him one
week and he says and tell them that
these guys should have done this three
times before and it shouldn't take them
more than a week otherwise you've got
inexperienced people that don't know
what they're doing and it would be a
really bad thing to start anything with
people who don't know what they're doing
it doesn't make any sense well I'm I'm
especially thinking about for training
newbies like right now in a school
environment and maybe I could train some
of my fellow students and I would not
necessarily guarantee that we have that
much architecture experience so well you
know interesting enough scrum has been
designed really for just typical average
team members and if you apply the rules
it will boot up it just will go slower
if people don't have experience right my
wife is using it in she's a Unitarian
Universalist minister and she's on her
fourth church of implementing scrum and
it is really an interesting experience
to try to get all those people working
together but it works just as well in a
church it's just a little more chaotic
what's that yeah the question is does
that mean good sermons more than once a
week
no she's still doing a good sermon once
a week and what it really means is she
gets the whole staff and she's just left
a church in Wilmington she was there
temporarily is now back in the Boston
area where we live and she had about
eight full-time staff when she got there
she had to kind of reboot rehire
everybody and she told him we're doing
scrum and so she gets all eight of them
in front of the scrum what every morning
and they're sort of like who what does
that scrum board me she said well we as
a product here's a list of things that
are most important to us in the order I
think we should be doing them do you
agree and then they just talked about
and then finally they they all kind of
agree together with the priorities are
and then they talk about what tasks do
we need to do to get make these things
happen people are putting stuff up and
pretty soon they know what tasks are and
then it's in the front office so any
member of the congregation comes walking
in and they look at the product back and
they start arguing about the ordering
and what is this that pretty soon
everybody's just about what is this
thing you know nobody knows but all of a
sudden people's minds are entrained on a
prioritization and everybody starts to
know what's going on and everybody feels
they're moving in the same motion what
these information radiators can do you
don't even have to understand it you
just have to walk up to it and ask the
question what is this so a quick
question about the shock therapy if
you're trying to employ shock therapy
because you don't have a j'l practices
going on and you're missing things like
continuous integration you're missing
things like test-driven development is
there some way to bootstrap that or
while you're doing the shock therapy or
does it come out of the shock therapy
scrum was designed to boot up in two
days and then build an impediment list
and on that impediment miss might be
lack of continuous integration lack of
testimon development there's some
controversy about test-driven
development the major thing you need is
to think tests first you know there's a
lot of companies that are doing pretty
well at having the acceptance test
clearly specified the test case is all
written before they implement and then
they do traditional QA immediately after
implementation it's not quite
test-driven development where you write
the test code before you do the test but
it actually works almost as well but so
you can do that without having your test
driven development booted up continuous
integration I've never seen a team that
can perform with it well without it so
that needs to wind up very high
on scrum masters impediment list and it
needs to be a real priority to get that
fixed we can groom in getting that
before you even start shock therapy or
do you think you can do it at the same
time you know again it depends on your
capability I mean I wouldn't try shock
therapy unless you thought you knew what
you were doing and we're a good agile
coach you know if you don't know karate
you don't walk into the dojo and say
come on I'm going to show you how to do
this you're liable to get clobbered no
you know what you're doing then you'd
apply the shock you spoke a lot about
improvements in percentages how did you
measure the improvements in percentages
well in the vise case the my case space
they measure everything in story points
and they can they have a lot of
historical data from the waterfall teams
what people have been doing so they get
a team coming in and Scott can measure
in story points you know in one week he
knows what they are and he wants them to
triple that in three weeks and he also
knows what all the waterfall teams are
doing to I mean they can tell you know
how many features they pump out I mean
they're doing similar things all over
the country a company so everybody has a
pretty good idea of how people are doing
yeah you're right good Y velocity you
can't compare story points across teams
you can compare the loss of you three
but you can look at velocity increase
within a team yeah yes you compare a
team's by velocity increase yeah yeah
but the velocity is really important the
venture capitalist actually told me why
velocity was so important I spent 15
minutes with them and the most junior
guy on the team is a former senior VP of
Oracle sales worldwide he's a new guy
the next most junior guy is
ran Microsoft consulting worldwide for
15 years and then it goes on up from
there I had 15 minutes with those guys
and one of them said it's all about the
velocity and I said well why is that I
never heard anybody say that before he
said well we sit on the board we come in
you know the marketing guys give us this
Gantt chart it says when the release
date is then the financial guys tell us
what kind of money is going to flow from
that release date and we look at that
chart and we know it's complete nonsense
but he says we're sitting there we don't
know the right question to ask but he
says what I see now is that the product
guys don't know the velocity of the team
therefore the release dates are complete
fabrications we got to go see if they we
got to figure out how to get these
people to know the velocity of the teams
so we know how quickly they can burn
down the product backlog to deliver the
release so from their point of view it's
all about the product owners release is
what the velocity is all about yeah hi
the numbers that you gave before the
team's which were working together in a
typical environment when they are
interacting with each other but in
today's environment where you have lot
of outsourcing but these numbers still
be true because your teams are totally
distributed there is no person
interaction and what would be your
recommendations for these teams
especially these ok we go back to the
data these are both this is US and
Russia outsourcing this is Netherlands
and India outsourcing they get the same
results now they do they're outsourcing
in a very special way
ZV and particularly as productized this
they start a team in the amsterdam area
they bring for Indians too AM stamp to
work with it for Dutch guys they
establish a local velocity a high
productive local velocity then they send
half of the team back to India and they
make sure that the velocity doesn't
change so they've distributed the
velocity the way they do that as they
make the environments the same
everywhere and it's one team and they
work as one team they know what their
velocity is locally and they make sure
it's the same distributed if it slows
down the immediately intervene it's you
know it's shock therapy right away for
them if anything hiccups know that
that's the way to do it you're
mentioning that your colleagues your VC
colleagues only look at the velocity in
schweiber and beetle they talk about a
velocity signature because the velocity
changes over over the course of a sprint
and you can read a lot about the team
because of that you looked at they look
at the overall velocity segments how do
they deal with that yeah back when that
book was written which was some time ago
now they were talking about the slope of
the burndown chart being the velocity
which in some sense it is right now we
typically frame velocity as the number
of story points deliver at the end of
the spread now there is a signature on
that sprint backlog for teams that
patient keeper goes up at the beginning
of the Sprint it's almost like jumping
off a high dive it's up at the beginning
of sprint then it goes down and when it
goes down you can even watch that team
they're running at a hundred percent
load every developer is getting one full
day's ideal day of work every day so as
they're cranking up it's almost like
they're taking your breath and then and
then they get towards the end and they
they coast they coast in it was like a
surfer coasting into the shore so
there's this heartbeat of velocity it
starts pumping like a heart that's
another thing you've got to get your
scrums to pump like a heart
it's another self-organizing system get
the heartbeat it goes could jump good
chunk chunk and it's almost again it's
part of that entrainment process and
that's part of that signature just like
your heart has a slightly different
signature than my heart get the same
thing with a team
hi Jeff I get teams that get their
velocity going up the guard up 30% 50%
they go okay we're done we out we've
finished we fixed our impediments and I
try to say them well until you're going
twice as fast three times maybe even
four times as fast you're not done
finding impediments and removing them
did I hear you say tonight that until
they're really going 15 to 20 times
faster than original velocity they're
not really done finish fixing all their
betterments well I mean the issue here
is is what Toyota calls Kaizen mind at
Toyota there's never a shortage of
impediments it doesn't matter how fast
you're going you know I mean it's like
just because you broke the world's
record and at the Olympics swimming the
breaststroke does that means that's as
fast as you can go know you can always
go faster and so that must mean there's
an impediment slowing you down
what is it the impediments just get more
subtle as the team's here you know when
you start off they're you know they're
knocking you on the head every day so
these times these companies have become
comfortable they're not getting whacked
in the head every day with an impediment
so well we're just going to lie back and
sit in the Sun that's what they're doing
that's not the way you win the Olympics
every day you're trying to go faster so
the problem is one of urgency that book
you showed me today on urgency that the
change the guide is the leader in change
process at Harvard is beginning to think
that lack of a sense of urgency is why
70% of the companies fail to introduce
change processes JOHN CARTER yeah JOHN
CARTER so you know these guys can coast
along the Sun until something bad
happens and then they'll get whacked out
of their inner tube and be floundering
you know
ah here here hi so I work for a company
that's been doing waterfall for a long
time we're about to face a big shock
therapy which is fun we'll be fine
I have a question about metrics of
comparing waterfall to scrum right so
when you talk about that percent
velocity increase I assume that you're
talking about maybe from the initial
scrums right because certainly we don't
i can't measure velocity in the
waterfall I can measure lines of code I
could measure revenue I could measure a
number of defects also put interesting
metrics but what's a good metric besides
this function point that we could just
sort of take a baseline look at things
before we hit the shock well I mean
that's one of the interesting
characteristics about waterfall you
can't measure anything important until
it's too late well we well I mean I
actually do see revenue we do see lines
of code we have interesting interrupts
maybe not the best way to measure things
but we do have some measurements now you
know not to be too mean about the
waterfall because I some of the
companies I work with have been the best
waterfall players in the business and
but there are companies that because
they're so good at waterfall they can
execute almost perfectly they're always
trying to get better and so now they
want to see if scrum will actually make
them better but there was an interesting
example of a company where the
management actually wanted to go to
scrum and they had about 100 developers
and the developers did not want to do it
they were very comfortable Waterfall
worked pretty well for them and they
were saying no and the management was
pretty convinced that they get higher
velocity and they said so well we would
like to try and experiment let's
continue with the waterfall for one
month but in contrast to what we usually
do we'll actually measure what happens
and then the next the next month we'll
do a completely new scrum and we'll
measure what happens in you know the
first month of scrum what do you think
happened they doubled productivity
yeah I'm just wondering lately new scrum
sure I'm just trying to figure out how
to do like impedance matching between
yeah measurements I'm trying to figure
out what's a good now there I've done a
lot of work since I work with capers
Jones for many years and the you can
backtrack from lines of code to function
points it's not a great measure but it's
you know in in terms of 10x it's it's
it'll demonstrate 10x to you so you can
look at the code base and you know run
one of these code analyzers and even on
a waterfall team you can show write
increase in the code base and you can do
the same thing in scrum sure now so that
will give you some rough measures know
as soon as you start doing that you
actually want to incent people a little
differently a patient keeper I gave him
a credit the same credit for removing
the line of code is adding line I tried
it different ways to see what and gave
him the right incentive
I wanted to give them two points
removing a line and one point for adding
but I found that that incented them to
do too much refactoring tended to get
them stuck I backed off to one to one
that seems about right
is that right you've tested this out 1.6
1.6 1.6 for a removal this is another
example of no code is the best code yeah
so this one point six to one for
removing code what company is that that
you know HP is figure that out yeah
so HP has figured out the cost/benefit
plays up okay
I think there is also also a type of
measurement that your just the numbers
when you see the team members you know
being much more dynamic being much more
business savvy having some shake hands
with the business people so that's also
a huge measurement and yes this light
this cosmic is changing a lot so of
course we don't see tipo de velocity are
important but when the old world changed
that's very rewarding yeah see that's a
very good point that you can see the
dynamic and the team my wife's Church in
Wilmington the chairman of the board was
a senior manager at DuPont she had
thousands of people working for her and
she was very skeptic about scrum she
said to our lane well you know you could
do what you want you're the minister but
I don't think scrum is going to do
anything for the church but after a
month or two of scrum she K she walked
in the office one day and she said I
still don't think you get any more
productivity on these people but I can
tell you I've been in this church 40
years the first time we've had a happy
staff in this church they're having fun
it's worth it for that so there are
other more subtle indicators of progress
