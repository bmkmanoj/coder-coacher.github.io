be mostly on the whiteboard so forgive
me if my back is turned
interrupt me for questions at any time
please the more the merrier the question
means you don't understand something but
it also means that you still care so
it's good and this talk is going out on
YouTube so hold the confidential
questions until the end ok differential
synchronization the purpose of it is if
we have multiple users all looking and
all editing the same document let's say
document says cat and we've got three
users one two and three if we have
real-time synchronization then if user
one adds and s2 caps user two changes
this to my cats then the S gets pushed
across to here my goes back it is merged
and the S goes over here and the my
comes down and so everybody is always
looking at close to the same text now
there's always going to be some latency
so note so two people may have different
things on screen at any given time I
mean the speed of light is going to
dictate that there's at the very minimum
going to be some difference but the idea
is that it should very quickly resolve
itself now this diagram clearly screams
out peer to peer unfortunately a peer to
peer doesn't work on the internet very
well unless you've either got everybody
in a local environment or you've got
everybody highly motivated I'll let you
figure out what highly-motivated is
since that's not what we are interested
in we want
regular users be able to use this across
the Internet we're not exploring
peer-to-peer so this is the first fork
the first path not taken where maybe
peer-to-peer is the right solution for
some sort of synchronization but not for
ours so this is not what this talk is
going to be about so this brings us down
to client-server unsurprisingly so if we
have a server here server is going to
have its own copy of the text and
connections now this actually simplifies
things significantly from an algorithmic
point of view because if we can get a
magical synchronization system to go to
happen between one client and the
server's text then we're done because if
this user adds the s a change has been
made to this document the
synchronization will move the change
over and make a change to this document
therefore this document has changed and
therefore it should propagate some more
so all you have to do is figure out how
to do this portion and the rest of the
network will take care of itself
the only caveat is that when a change
happens it must not be mirrored
backwards or else you get into this
wonderful state of I add an S s o s it's
been added s s and as a developer I
cannot tell you how many times I have
turned on the system and it immediately
fills up with the first keystroke those
are always fun so let's go down to just
looking at how to synchronize between a
client and a server the simplest way as
a chair here
looks like I sides this room about right
the simplest way to do synchronization
is simply to watch the keystrokes so if
the client is not client if the client
types an S you're going to have an event
on key press event and so you can detect
the ASCII code of the character you can
look at where the cursor is you can get
all the information you need about what
has just changed in this documentary and
you can then send across a message
saying we are adding an S to position 3
or something like that and this over
adds it and likewise if the server
change is something we just send send
back a message about that quite
straightforward really easy to set up
the problem with this is it's divergent
if there's a problem it will never
recover from that problem and let me
give you an example a few years ago I
was planning a computer game it was a
multiplayer version of asteroids
something like that so you got your
little ship and an asteroid here so what
I did is I shot the asteroid asteroid
blew up fragments went all over the
place killed my opponent and I won on
his computer
I shot but because of some error
somewhere I missed the asteroid it
didn't blow up he turned around shot me
he won and it shows where if you are
depending on capturing every single
event if you miss something you will
never recover from that and you get into
a state where these two users are now
talking are now editing completely
different documents to each other you
get a butterfly effect so what we what
we really need is something that's
convergent getting back to more regular
text editors
these problems can occur quite
frequently if you've got you can capture
the keyboard but what about copy and
paste what about selecting some text and
dragging it
what about yondu stack what about auto
correction
what about spellcheck what about drop
packets there's just so many ways that
you can lose the plot there are a couple
of editors that use event passing or
edit that I think use event passing one
of them is subethaedit very successful
very good editor for the Macintosh of
course that's how they managed to get it
to work as far as I know because the Mac
API is much cleaner than say Windows
win32 in my case I'm giving the worst
situation because I'm trying to get this
to work on a web browser and so trying
to capture every single event sometimes
there are just no events being fired
when it change happens so event passing
is great if you can nail it down but I'm
going to assume that you count always
nail it down another one I think is
what's called the ether pad it looks
like it's using event passing and the
way you can tell is just by entering
some text and just abusing it a little
bit shaking it copy paste delete just
mangling it a bit and soon enough you'll
find that the other party is now looking
at something different and it will never
resolve itself so it's a good solution
but it's not very robust okay so we are
all computer programmers we know exactly
how to do rebus robusta as organization
systems we've all used them in source
code control so we've got our client a
base version version one I'll call it
and server
and then we've got her magical three-way
merge and that hope puts version two so
we start off with Cat Cat Cat client
adds an S server adds my these three get
funneled down freeway merge produces
version two of this document which
hopefully is my cats and then this gets
sent back to become the new server
version and the new client version
thousands of people use this every day
for code reviews and other stuff very
robust very good system problem is it's
not real time and that is a problem
because if you look at what happens if
you're typing here and then it does a
synchronization if you type a single
letter while this synchronization is in
flight suddenly you can no longer use
the output if you've added an
exclamation mark while this is in flight
what does the client do with this my
cats it can't do anything with it so it
has to throw this away and synchronize
again later based off of version one the
result of that is that as long as you're
typing you are not getting any new
feedback back from the server because
anything that you get is going to be
obsolete this only works if you are an
environment where either the network and
the diff speed is lightning fast and you
can afford to actually block the user or
if the user is willing to stop let the
thing synchronize and then continue but
that's not real time and exhibit an
analogy of this would
be driving if you had a car rare you
could either drive or you could look for
the windshield but not both you could
drive for a little bit
stop look ahead and then start driving
some more and that you can imagine what
the highways would be like if everybody
was like that so this doesn't this works
well if you're only synchronizing once
every 30 seconds or something and if you
see a product that synchronizes once
every 30 seconds or so chances are this
is what it's using but we want something
that updates live every couple of
seconds without needing to wait for the
chickens to stop moving before we can
count them so let's see how we can build
an asynchronous system and this is where
the differencing comes in
yeah
I'm leaving a gap it's a harbinger for
things to come
okay so we need a dip that produces some
edits
goes over to the patch it's off screen
but that's okay it's the same thing just
mirror it up see if I can that up a
little bit there we go
all right let's see how this system
works this is simple differential
synchronization it won't actually work
in the real world but we'll see why a
woman Cat Cat right the client types an
S we then take we don't even attempt to
capture the difference or capture the on
key events instead if we take the
clients live copy and the shadow which
is the previous version take a
difference between them and that yields
and edit so our edit is adding an S we
then take that take a copy of the
service text which by the way has
changed let's say the server has added
some text so we take these two texts do
a fuzzy patch because this does not
necessarily match identically do our
best effort and patch that back to s
when we took our diff we also copy
across what had changed so now the
common shadow says cats and on the
return cycle of the difference we now
take the difference between the server
and the shadow
and so clearly what's changed is we've
added my and then we copy this across my
and then patch my into the client it's
simple it works it's pretty reliable too
this is a best-effort patch if it had
failed let's take a look at what it
would have happened if the s could not
have been patched in so let's assume
that this patch or the edits collided
with each other and we couldn't patch
this so we try to put an s in we can't
figure it out because this has changed
too much that's okay
so this patch fails the server then does
a sync between between the common shadow
and the server and that will returns
adding my and subtracting s so my comes
in s goes away and we're still in sync
so no matter no matter what you do to
this system it's always going to come
back and sync if there's if there's a
memory flip and you end up with
something extra here it's no problem
it'll just it will propagate through you
may not get what you want on the other
side and there may be no wind situations
but you will always end up synchronizing
to a consistent state doing this
the cat become the kids become something
else okay so while this edit is in
flight this completely changes okay so
this now becomes a dog
neither of these work neither these fit
that's what you're assuming so the patch
fails we then do a diff between here and
here and the edits become remove my cats
my cat and add dog and that's what we do
so some somebody's going to win how you
resolve differences is really a function
of what you want to do when collisions
happen
you can try best effort you can pop up a
dialog you can guess you can throw it on
the floor you can give preference to one
side together it doesn't really matter I
don't really care about that but whether
you win or lose it's always going to be
consistent state and that's that's
really what's critical okay there's a
problem with this
I dropped a packet mm-hmm I see
one common shadow ah yes
okay let's address that then correct
that's why I said it's not going to work
so that's right this is this works great
if you're synchronizing between two
documents on the same computer that's
useful okay
now you're going to start to see why I
left some of space open the worrisome is
it's still going to be some space over
all right now we have a client shadow
and a server set shuttle and we have to
add another patch algorithm and patch
here and cross copy across every one so
we've taken that comma shadow and we
split it across so now we can put a
dividing line of our network here let's
bring us back into a consistent state
cat cat
okay so same as before we add an S take
the difference it's plus s we copy this
difference across we now take that plus
s and patch it to different places now
these look similar but they're actually
different this patch should patch
identically and this can be and should
be really really fragile because this
text must be exactly what this one wants
so this is a really easy patch to make
and there should also be a checksum to
make sure that this really was what we
thought it was as we could have just
encode a checksum or length check or
whatever then we do our fuzzy patch on
here meanwhile this has changed we then
do our diff plus my add lie here tap
that across yep does this involve some
sort of notion of time though because
presumably the s was typed at the same
time as my and packet could be going out
please a good question I was actually
going to hit that one right at the end
as being one of the limitations that
would show that this could not work on
Mars and question is what happens if
these packets are going simultaneously
the problem is that I yes you cannot
have more than one packet running at the
same time the idea and what I'm working
on is client-server so this is a web
browser that's a server and so you would
never have more than one packet
circulating at any given time that's an
excellent point and that's one of the
limitations of this of this algorithm
you can't have more than one packet in
route at any given time you can on a
later version on the next version of
this you'll see that but you expire the
previous one so if you send out a packet
and you wait it never arrives and then
you send out another one you can say
that one ignore if you get it eventually
so out of order stuff so that that will
cover yes this does
to single-cycle good point okay so this
works really well the only flaw is what
happens if we lose a packet so let's
come back to base state I don't have a
cat by the way right client adds an S we
get a plus s s in this packet for saying
add an S goes across the network and
then dies server never gets in we then
sit here for 30 seconds or whatever the
timeout is and then we try again this
time we've added say my so my goes
across we patch my in oh and and
immediately we fail actually we don't
need to get to the patching we just fail
out right because this was cats the
shadow here is cat we can't recover from
this we're now in a state where the
shadows are out of sync we don't know
who changed
did we lose a packet here or did we lose
a packet here it's there's no way to
recover from this state short of
somebody saying okay forget what you
know here's a new copy
let's resync ourselves and what I've
decided is that a good plan is if
there's a disagreement with a certain
between the client and the shadow and
there's more than one client that is
there a the client and the server and
there's more than one client then the
server should win because if you imagine
a network with a server and a whole
bunch of clients just because this guy
has got a bad connection should not mean
that everybody else should suffer
and so in this case we would see a
mismatch and then the server would say
okay whatever you've got
erase it will reset the cat and start
again the problem
ideally this would only happen once once
in a while to a couple of seconds worth
of data so that would be no big deal the
problem is that we've just waited for 30
seconds for a timeout to happen so
potentially that's a lot of work that
just vanished when we resync so that's
why this system doesn't work perfectly
if you're on a reliable network then you
can use this so we get to the last
version which offers and guaranteed
synchronization this gets interesting
so this is our backup shadow again our
division is here so we are still divided
and we have potential
and it's now becomes a stack of edits
which is retained and had a favorite bit
version numbers can never keep these
straight so this one's got an M n + + +
+ M
right now you know why I'm giving this
Tech Talk because when I throw this on
the board people scream but you can see
where we're getting about how we're
getting here and this actually solves
all the problems with synchronization
because in in a sense it actually
re-implement tcp/ip in JavaScript or
whatever we're running it so let's take
this first bin let's do a simple
synchronization first ad Katz
oh we are starting off these version
numbers there's N and sm n is the
clients version number M is the server's
version number so these are all starting
at 0 so we take a difference shadows
initially empty at thank you you would
have paid for that one lately later
right we take the difference and that's
still plus s and we record along with
that difference what version on the
client side this was based off of so
this is version zero and then we copy
this across in so doing we increment the
clients version the one and the client
is done so the client sends this across
its plus s based off of version zero and
the last version of M I got was zero so
that's zero here server gets this and it
checks ok for this edit n is 0 and the 0
M 0 M 0 good we match no prob
here so we can now patch this on to the
shadow that becomes an S and then when
we update n - one good and then we do
the same thing over here we just apply
the patch yes are you straight forwards
and then we could do the same thing in
Reverse no problem here
no juice M change M changes up here in
the reverse because we updated n at this
point and would urge it would change on
the other side when the change
originates from the server that's right
yes ah the M to the right of the edits
that is stored by the server this is
this one here this is an acknowledgement
that the client is essentially is
telling the server the last version
which I got from you was M of 0 does
illusion of it yes that's right that's
right
so every individual edit will have a
base version of from the clients point
of view but it will also have a total
acknowledgement of what was the last
version I got from the server and
usually outside the box because that's
good question well it's actually not
part of an edit it's really just this
could actually be sent on the wire
without any edits I don't have any edits
to tell tell you about but I got it the
last thing you said yeah exactly and
then the server would know that the
client knows where the server is which
is important okay let's do the same
thing in Reverse but let's lose a packet
so this server has typed in my ok let's
do the difference here that's plus my
and that's based off of server version 0
and our n acknowledgement we are
acknowledging that we got version 1 from
the client so our n becomes 1 ok
now we have some housekeeping to do here
we need to update this to one add my am
i losing a step here yes
just when we did this patch after we did
this patch we were supposed to have
copied over there shadow to a backup so
that goes that goes here that actually
doesn't turn out to be important at this
time yeah where's the backup retained
this would just be a another copy of the
full document so this is on the server
again represent yes so there's our
dividing line here this is server side
backup this is the client-side backup
each one yeah that's right the backup
gets updated when this patch is done and
so after we update this shadow we then
but does the Ambler should the other
ecosystem of the show no because it was
taken before we started this round but
this backup was taken as a snapshot down
here when M was still 0 in fact that's
the purpose we now have a 1 and a 0 here
we want them to be different okay so
we're now telling the client I got your
version 1 I want you to add my to
version 0 that would have been great it
would fit in just perfectly
unfortunately this client never got it
because it got lost in the network
client sits there for 30 seconds
eventually gets bored and sends another
packet
and let's say the client added an
exclamation mark so we just run through
the same thing again this goes up we're
adding an exclamation mark to version
one and the last thing I got from you
was from the server was a zero because
we never got the previous version so
this goes up to two and we still haven't
gotten anything in this side so back up
shadows never updated yes it is because
this is now a stack we never got any
confirmation yeah if we got a
confirmation that yes I got your version
one then with the coop come down here
and delete anything that's old but we
haven't gotten anything so we'll send it
all again and that goes through and now
we've got an issue okay
first if we look at is client zero
server zero fail so now we do have a we
do have a server version zero in the
backup so that's what this backup is for
the client is still basing it off of
version zero therefore we cannot do our
patches off of version one so what we
have to do is invoke a rollback from the
backup because clearly we lost out and
so now the shadow becomes cats server
version zero ok so now let's try this
again client version zero server version
zero client version one oh well that
means that we've already got this so we
don't need to we can just throw this one
on the floor because we've already seen
the plus s there it is so we can ignore
that yeah I got that
if the server wanted to it could not
figure out my previous reply must have
gotten lost
so now we need look at the next one okay
client version one yes okay this matches
and so now we can put an exclamation
mark in here and here and then we do our
difficut and we send it back when we did
a rollback from the back up we also have
to clear our edit stack okay so let's
try this again
wait a minute the backup - yes thank you
I always forget this that's why I like
using computers because they don't
forget these things
umm right so we did the patch we update
the backup and and becomes - thank you
very much okay so let's successfully
send this across again our diff is add
my everything else matches the last
version we got from the client was - oh
my was based off of version zero um and
now we update that to one copy that over
good
and of course if we lose this again we
just keep on going we just this stack of
edits just keeps on getting longer and
longer and longer until eventually
something main manages to make it
through but let's put the system out of
its misery
and let it pack it arrived okay
so n is too good M is no actually that's
correct because this is updated after
after we do the diff first we do the
diff then we copy it across an updated
you can do it as before as long as
you're consistent it doesn't read it
better but this is base this is a diff
based off of a version zero now you
could decide that this is a diff that
results in version one it's semantics it
doesn't matter which way you do it okay
so then we do our patch my we update
this to one my and then we update our
client shadow two to my exclamation mark
and because we've got an acknowledgment
of two we can now look down at our edit
stack and say okay this all of these
were received so we can wipe this in and
we're back in business so it doesn't
matter where you lose data the system
will remember what's required rollback
if needed and keep on going and always
maintained consistency the final detail
is we saw a rollback from the back up to
the shadow no matter what you do to the
system you will never ever see a
rollback from this back up to the client
shadow which is odd because this system
is totally beautifully symmetric and
there's a reason for that
anybody see the reason why you would
never have a rollback from this
direction
issue is yes that's right
the client-server connection here is
inherently asymmetrical because the
server can never reach out and touch the
client hey I've got an update
it's always the web browser the client
it has to connect to the server so this
client could be sending and sending and
sending and sending until it eventually
gets a response the server can never
send unless it has just immediately
gotten a response so if you've got an
asymmetrical connection like a web
browser then you don't need a
client-side backup and this simplifies
it you can just remove this completely
if on the other hand you're running this
on a peer-to-peer system or
server-to-server or something which is
more equitable and either side can tap
on the other shoulder then you'll need
this backup you'll need it if you don't
want a to loss when a packet is dropped
and you have to resynchronize in which
case somebody's loses big time soon the
two user will come the separate i/o area
right now they were happy no that's ok
if you are diff if it's is actually a
question of how good your patch is and
to a certain extent how good your diff
is in terms of resolving these
differences if one of these differences
collide so badly you cannot patch it in
then it just gets dipped every will get
patched into the shadow but the server
won't have it in its main text and it'll
just get dipped out and delete it from
the client so you type something and
it'll get rolled back immediately or as
soon as that one completes or you'll get
a collision notice or you can deal with
it however you want
yes let me show you what that looks like
I think we're done with this
we're done okay good
server client let's figure out of a
backup shadows we don't need the client
shadow server shadow there is one
synchronization loop and then if we've
got another client client shadow server
shadow there's another synchronization
lip and so on you can have as many as
you want now this poses a slight problem
because now the server doesn't just know
the text it also knows the shadow
forever particular client which
immediately calls up the question of
does that mean that every user is now
tied to a particular server and that's a
problem if you've got data centers with
thousands of computers and you need to
reallocate them and that sort of thing
yes and no there are two ways around it
and probably the simplest approach is to
have our cloud of clients hit a router
which firms it off to any available load
balance server but all the servers are
backed by a central database so all of
these shadows and the text would reside
in the database and whichever server
requires it can use it that's the
conventional approach that's what mob
right uses in App Engine which is
currently out there pretty conventional
it's simple it works there's another
approach which is more intriguing I
don't know if it's just practical but it
looks cool
let's say this server is at capacity
let's add another server server to and
it's got its own clients we can set up a
server shadow here and a server shadow
here and have them synchronized between
each other works fine same protocol this
person makes a change it arrives here
this now this copy now has a change
compared to this shadow so it gets sent
and it was a change compared to that set
shadow so it gets sent and so on
you could chain this as much as you want
so this this is truly expandable in the
previous example I had a common database
well the common database could get
overloaded this can't get overloaded
ever so this is a neat system the
problem is you cannot easily drop a
server so if you've got a long chain of
servers and you'd find you don't need
this one anymore and you've still got
some client who's been here for a long
time you can't get rid of this server
because they're serving particular
shadow the other problem is that latency
increases so if I'm syncing once every
say five seconds here once every five
seconds here it takes a maximum of 10
seconds to go between this client and
this client we would take a maximum of
15 seconds to make this route so if
you're going to use this you probably
want a tree approach so that you've got
the minimum number of jumps anyway I
don't I've never built this but hey Jake
work those parallels and work on any
individual server does the server have
to process essentially round-robin
between all the clients at serving
because that shared document that is
holding right right and so you
definitely want to have locking so that
if two edits are coming in
simultaneously and you would want to
lock this document now you can do it
many ways from saying okay I'm just
going to handle this request now I'm
just going to handle that request the
Python and implementation of mob right
which I've written actually locks these
resources just as needed so there's a
couple of very brief points where I need
to take a just a quick copy of this to
make an update or and then I release it
again so when you're going through the
algorithm and it takes a little bit of
thought to think do I need to hang along
to this lock or can I let it go and let
somebody else change it and it turns out
that the it's very brief the biggest
pain point is computing add if not
making a patch patching is fairly easy
it's take this text put it here there's
a little bit of fuzziness that makes it
interesting but calculating a diff is an
O n squared operation where n is the
length of the diff so that can get kind
of painful but you don't need to lock it
for that I just need to take a quick
copy of it and then I can diff to my
heart's content on that copy and I don't
need to block anybody else okay
the last thing I wanted to look at is
timing how often do you synchronize we
really want to synchronize as often as
possible because that gives you a
real-time update you can see people
typing as they as they type but what
about latency well it turns out because
diff is om squared where n is the length
of the Edit if you can get your disk
frequent enough that they're happening
one edit apart where an edit can
actually just be an insertion of an
arbitrary length it doesn't have to be
character by character then it becomes
all 101 scales really
you will so that's uh yep
that's my strategy too if as the load
gets greater as the user starts doing
more don't back off actually step
forwards and synchronize eating more
frequently because you will end up doing
less also if you've got that edit stack
down there it means that you're
decoupling the differencing algorithm
from the network algorithm so you can go
and DIF it a couple of times a second if
you want and just add those differences
to the stack and then transmit the stack
once every two seconds or whatever your
network decides it wants to do and that
means that you are spending less time
doing differencing even though you're
doing it more often and from the
system's point of view it just thinks is
getting massive packet loss but it's
handling it just fine
so that's one approach and and yeah my
limitations I had one was you can only
have one packet in flight at once as
you've mentioned earlier so that means
that if you are on Mars and your servers
on earth I hate it when that happens the
lag time is just nasty and there's
nothing you can do about speed of light
but ideally what you want to be able to
do is send a packet every minute or so
even though you haven't gotten anything
back from Earth and this system does not
support that so if you've got massive
latency you'll have some more work to do
and the other thing which this doesn't
handle well is attribution to particular
users so if we look at this from the
point of view of three clients if these
two clients both make a change those
changes get integrated here and then we
do a diff between the sum of these two
clients and our shadow and what we get
is a diff that comes through that
contains both of the merge
and there's no easy way the way there
would be for a three-way merge to figure
out who typed what who's responsible for
what it can be done I thought about it a
little bit but it's not inherent in the
system so attributions an open question
yeah sorry don't know but if you wanted
if you see this document you want to say
who typed this word well you don't
really know because what you got from
the server was this big blob so there
are some strategies to sort this out but
I haven't worked them out completely I
mean usually 99% of the time you're only
going to get one change at a time in
which case you can say oh yeah I got
that from over there but it's in
complicated merges where it gets gray
who typed one yep change the format to
store the attribution and then edit that
gets sent over is I added the letter S
right essentially put adding metadata to
every letter yep that's one of that's
that is an approach I don't I've been
looking for another approach because
that adds an awful lot of extra data for
something that's fringe but yes if you
are that paranoid you can do it if
you're paranoid enough to do that then
do that that will work perfectly
just adding metadata every character who
who created this and you could also add
when and where and whatever else the
other fun thing is that this
synchronization system works for any
Content we've used plaintext well we've
used my cats but this as long as you've
got a diff algorithm and a fuzzy patch
algorithm this algorithm will work for
anything whether it's plain text rich
text vectors bitmaps whatever
and you just have to create appropriate
patch and diff algorithms I'm only
really familiar with the plaintext
versions of those because I've developed
some but I know people who are working
on tree based ones which would allow you
to do rich text missing something
because like for every dip that you're
applying you have the exact that's right
and I only need to store two copies the
current one and the backup I don't need
a full backup because once I heard an
acknowledgement I'm good but what I
wonder is why why the why do these to be
a fuzzy patch I don't need the fuzzy
patch when updating the shadow that
patch can be brittle in fact it should
be brittle the fuzzy patch is required
when updating the live text on either
the client or the server because that
text may have changed legitimately
without there being any problems
simultaneous edits so that bit does have
to be fuzzy or should be if it's not
then everything's going to be a
collision which may be an option as well
depending on your circumstances but yeah
that other one can be fragile so I'll
just leave by adding the webpage where
you can get all the details on this is
it started before I got to Google so
it's on my personal account it's a deal
you'll duck Fraser name / writing / sink
and that's got everything we talked
about here a little bit more a little
bit different and it's also got links to
an operating version of this mob right
which is going to be it's currently in
version 2 version 3 is going out
tomorrow that includes the guaranteed
synchronization thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
