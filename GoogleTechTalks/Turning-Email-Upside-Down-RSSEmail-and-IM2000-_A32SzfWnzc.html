be joined today by a long Julian hate
and they are going to be discussing
across turning email upside down RSS
email and IM two thousand and bang
actually is the founder of p.o.box calm
and Jelena's the founder of spam cop net
so should be a very interesting and
engaging presentation and alternate over
these jobs thanks so thanks for coming
this is my first time at Google and it's
a real treat to be here thank you very
much so this this project is really just
a hobby project between Julian and me it
doesn't really have a name and it's a
kind of an idea that's been fluttering
up for a long time so people could call
I'm 2000 I've been calling RSS email you
could call it hypertext mail transport
protocol that's what Nathan Chang called
it an article on circle idea I'll go
call the HTM p and we kind of came up
with the name stub mail after a while or
stub email so it's me and drilling we're
going to talk about this Julian founded
spam cop how long ago chillin was that
898 all right so you guys heard spam
cough right yes good and i founded PO
box calm give Ofcom back in 95 and was
recently I've been working on a project
called xpf which top and breaks extended
by Microsoft so the basic idea here is
all right let's start with the idea that
we've got this one thing email smtp push
and then we could flip around and say
instead of doing push email that's
trying to pull in it and there's kind of
a long tradition of doing pull
technologies now the web the right is
basically pulled it all the stuffing
website and pull it out RSS does that
too and the way I see it
basically an unsubscribe problem right
if you go back about 10 years to the
early days of spam feels like stop
spamming me right please unsubscribe me
from your mailing list and today we
don't really talk about that early but
the idea is to live right and we don't
we don't see this problem on the web
with blogs right you never complain I
subscribe to this blog and it keeps
sending me stuff I don't want and I
can't do anything about it right and
just unsubscribe you never say it going
to this website I can't stop so if you
think about email the way down this work
it's like I have to send a message to
you to say please stop sending me stuff
and that's completely backwards it just
doesn't make any sense so I think we
should put the power back in the hands
of user and I just say well you know i'm
going to keep track of who i want to get
mail from now this is an idea that's
been around about 10 years now and ever
since then everyone has been saying no
it's not going to work it's impossible
but I know the way you Julian and I saw
it was this just gives us an opportunity
to do science all right in science says
let's come up with a hypothesis and
disprove it and so the hypothesis here
is you know let's let's just build it
and try to make it work between the two
of us and if anybody else wants to come
in and join the join the party than
their welcome and if it turns out that
it does not in fact work then that's
fine and so just scoping the project the
goal is really really small this is just
a hobby project between Julian and
myself and anybody else wants to join
and the objective is that we should be
able to email each other without
worrying that the mail got blocked by a
spam filter so maybe I want to send
Julian a message that says hey check out
this email it's a really clever spam or
it's a really clever fish or hey Julian
have you thought about getting some
viagra right I don't want that message
to be blocked and today we have to worry
about that we're not trying to change
the world we're not trying to tell
everyone okay let's let's discontinue
email let's do a big transition strategy
I've tried to do that
with email and while it has worked to
some extent it is a much bigger job than
we can do part-time so we're not trying
to do that we're not trying to get
everybody in the world to stop using
email and start using this so not the
goal if spam couldn't kill email we
can't kill email right so but let me
talk you through for anybody here who's
you know sort of not that familiar with
smtp this is how the mail stream works
so you've got the user sends mail it
typically goes up to their sender isp
your little MTA and the sender isp dumps
it over to the receiver is be over the
net we're at some point it gets pulled
down by the receiver now if the receiver
is not around suppose they're sitting in
a technical presentation not online then
the message just sort of sits on the
receiver eyes p until the guy shows up
and if he doesn't show up then it just
sort of piles up and all the spam sits
on the server spinning until he does
show up and then he's like oh my god all
the spam just came down my my connection
and so the poor end user you know he's
like well I don't like getting all this
spam I don't like getting all this stuff
it's too much so what are the end users
do they're like all right I'm just not
going to bother with email in fact I
don't care about downloading my spam if
I don't care about this entire smtp
infrastructure anymore all I want is
just talk to my friends and so they're
like just IM me right a lot of people
are doing this nowadays if you look at
what the young people are doing the
teenagers they're all using IM they're
all using sort of closed myspace type
systems email is not really part of the
picture for them about the problem with
IM is that if you're both you know if
you're not both online at the same time
then you've got this disconnection
problem and so you still need some kind
of asynchronous mode where something
that's always connected to the net is is
able to offer these messages for you so
um this i'm using this term very loosely
sender is p it's just something that's
always online
that the messages can sit on even when
the sender and the receiver are not
there right so the simple model here is
the sender sends a message it goes up to
the sender is P and it gets pulled down
directly by the receiver so it's very
simple you know instead of popping your
mail from your isp why not go pop the
mail from their ISP and 10 years ago
when I m2000 came around the big
paradigm was all right email has to be
storing forward we've got all these
different hops and email has to be
forwarded from one hop to another 10
years down the road everybody's used the
idea of just doing our assess just doing
sort of the web they use the idea of i'm
going to upload stuff to my server and
then if anybody's interested they will
go pull it down so if the receiver goes
away if the receivers not pulling down
male the male will just end up sitting
on the senders server and I'd much
rather have it piling up on the senders
server then at the receivers server
right for a long time I've been working
on anti spam the last 34 years now a lot
of people have been saying in the
anti-spam community we could solve spam
if only we could shift the cost to the
sender right and there's been a lot of
ideas that have been proposed for this
so like a postage people like let's
let's charge a milli cent per message
and all of these schemes sound good
until you actually think about how it
roll out right because a thousandth of a
cent isn't that much here and you're
like all right well I could send a
couple thousand emails and it would only
still be pennies but you go to Africa
you don't want to charge Africans lot of
money to send mail to the US right so
Microsoft had this idea let's make the
sender burn lots of CPU so we slowed
them down but the problem is with
zombies right the zombies have more cpu
than anybody else so i think the
solution is actually really simple i
think we can shift the burden to the
center if we just look at it in terms of
disk in the modern paradigm with smtp
the receiver stores a message the
receiver has to have lots of spinning
disk and it's very expensive for CRSP to
store
email and spam now what happens is the
email gets downloaded the spam stays on
the server right and I spent some time
at earthlink and earthlink was not happy
about this with the sender storing the
message spam becomes the problem of the
sender which is where it belongs right
so I think if we want to shift the cost
to the sender looking at who has to
maintain the disk is a really good way
to do it so I'm going to talk a little
bit about kind of the specifics here the
receiver has to maintain an address book
and in the same way that you maintain a
subscription list for your RSS feeds you
maintain an address book for who you
want to get mail from and if there are
three people in your address book to
there are three people sending mail to
three different sender eyes peas you
have to pull down mail from each one of
them and you might think that this is
kind of a problem because okay so he
sends me mail it sits on his server I
don't get the mail till I go out there
and I pull it down it's an efficient
right and also what if he sends me mail
once and then six months go by right I
don't have to keep pulling but it seems
that in a world of blogs and RSS people
are like well we don't really see this
as a problem we just do it right and
even if it's a waste of bandwidth we're
wasting bandwidth makes sort of the
Greybeard IETF crowd upset but doesn't
really make anybody else upset because
bandwidth is cheap so
politics so in in a simple case I said
all right well maybe we can address that
problem by adding these little stubs
right these little UDP notifications so
that when i send Julian a message it
actually sits on my server waiting for
him to come pick it up but at the same
time I send this tiny little UDP packet
that says I just sent you mail come and
get it and what the packet looks like is
just a real simple mail from me mail to
you and here's the URL where you can go
download the rest of the message and
everybody sends these little stubs they
end up being stored by the receiver is P
so there is some discs but I'd much
rather have these little structured
stubs right in a database then these
arbitrarily large messages taking up
disk so it's easier to manage these
little DB things and even if the stubs
don't get sent right it is still the
receivers responsibility to go out and
pull so even if all these UDP things
fail that's okay Larry the receiver goes
to their rrsp and says all right who has
sent me mail downloads basically your
list of dirty senders right it's a dirty
list and then he goes out and pulls the
original well and I think that is enough
of an answer to say if we bring in these
little UDP stubs then the inefficiency
of polling becomes not that bad right
and what does that leave that leaves the
first contact problem so what happens if
these guys over here are not yet in the
address book this is a question that
everybody always asked me so the answer
is that's not really our problem we can
say you know but let's go back to the
idea of like the opposite of every great
idea right today if I give you a
business card what that means is here's
my email address please mail me maybe
tomorrow what that means is here's my
email address let me mail you right so
you go back and you type it into your
address book just like you would but
instead of you being able to mail them
it just means that they can mail
you may be we can say all right let's
use these little UDP stubs to notify
that there's this new guy out there and
he wants to send me mail and if they
just keep sending you these stubs at
some point i might go download the
message but this this means that they're
kind of policy change right it means the
receivers have to respect stub
notifications and it changes the design
a little bit and it brings back the spam
problem so it's kind of a kind of an
issue at that point I think we can still
bring in reputation solutions we can say
let's figure out what people think about
these centers and if they're a good
center then we'll read the mail and if
they're not a good center then we don't
and that Saul's sort of the United
Airlines problem right like I sign up
with the United Airlines and they send
me mileageplus notifications and at no
point did I ever go in and put in United
Airlines into my address book but I
still want to get these notifications
because there are generally recognized
okay group of people and I think
reputation systems can help say well
these are the fortune 1000 if they send
you mail it's probably not spam and so
on so you know we're going back to say
it's not our problem we will use some
kind of out of band mechanism to
introduce new senders to the address
book we can say oh maybe one of those
out-of-band mechanisms is email right I
mean email is still there we can still
mail you once you're in the address book
the MUA can do all kinds of really smart
things to say right now that I've gotten
this first message from you I can
subsequently keep pulling you and you
know I've never heard of this objection
to other things like I am yes you got a
question yes obviously
it was also nice ever
the reason the reason I chose give you
feel is because yeah I think about now
I'm service attacks you I think
throughout average right as far as we're
going to try and send your lots of MIT
and if we reduced it to the point of
thats its members are going to send us
unsolicited stuff I'll rather the UDP or
TCP because there's going to be a lot of
people have their light of these
implementations if this thing takes off
and it's a lot easier to write a UDP
server that is resistant to flooding
then try to TCP server that's resistant
to flooding that's my period you so
instead of moving this little blue ball
it instead of saying a2dp maybe we could
say it's some kind of HTTP request so
it's gcp maybe could submit something
XML things and here's the Senators in
small UDP things
the semantic is basically the same so in
IM we've got the idea of here's my buddy
list if you're not in my buddy list i'm
probably not going to accept messages
from you and I haven't heard anyone
complain well you know as an open source
author I get lots of unsolicited IM
contacts from outside and i need to read
those it's just a different set of
expectations email is what i like to
call the medium of least reserved right
you can always expect to send somebody
an email you can't always expect that
they'll read it but that's the way it is
now did you have a question it yeah
anytime you see
choose the opportunities
go to this URL which is not you have to
type really tightly you have to say the
address book is the authoritative source
of Senator alcopops URLs and if somebody
sends me URL that claims to be from the
center but isn't really that Center I
have to discard that but yeah when we
get into the address book googled it
home let's go back to the goal right the
goal here is for Julian and then to its
email each other so some of these issues
don't really apply to the goal if we can
get around them so doing that maybe you
want to talk through a little bit of
what we've done or yeah if so I guess is
every x contact problem I mean I could
talk a bit crunchy got to Mike and take
a couple of questions and myself I'm
join me up on the podium take a question
well we'll go over let's talk about like
the benefits pros the cons the
architecture and then we'll get into the
implementation okay your question yes
so the
I'm thinking
this is a good point stammers are
actually more agile than regular email
sites because they can dynamically
generate messages so if you're getting
real email from someone if you issue a
400 error code and say come back again
that real sender has to then school that
miss it on this a spammer is basically
running all of us out of this huge mail
merge template or I can get yourself a
database that's in all this guy second
email deceptive but they've got one
message that they're trying to send a
lot in my model I'm assuming that trying
to shift the cost of disk to the sender
i am assuming that even if you're a
spammer you've got to have some disks
somewhere that's permanently connected
right and maintaining that site even if
it's not economically costly it'll be
it'll be a way we can track you down
right so it's aundi is what hobbies do
zombies will say instead of getting our
own spam IP server with IP address let's
send mail through the ISP in the ISP at
that point has a place where they can
say okay let's do zombie negation if
they're sending this fires they're
sending this fan we know this customer
is infected we can deal with that
yeah I protect this idea of trying to
layer on a first contact solution you
have to be introduced or somehow you
have to out of band get this person's
thing like instead of you giving me your
email address we give each other or
email addresses once we send each other
email then we're introduced and we can
communicate the United Airlines example
is good too I would say the way you do
that is you when you sign up for the
mileage plus program you click on a link
which brings that that the address into
your into your address book and you know
the first contact problem is it's
similar to email you you know you have
to have some way to to initially do it
out of band even now it's like you click
on an email address on a website to get
to somebody or you know how does anybody
get there you kind of layer on things at
that point
a lot of unsolicited
asian especially salted
it is a problem I mean it's a loss of
functionality but it's an intentional
cutting off of a cancer we threw the way
where the way we broke it down right as
we said there's stuff that we're trying
to solve and then there's stuff that's
not our problem and we intentionally
said that is out of scope to support
that is for you day in the world
for the implementation actually had done
for this Melanie just a dress that white
the network issues just a dress that
point I think I would be much happier in
a world without spam with all the
network load that we've imposed then a
world with spam with all the network
load that that imposes because that is P
is doing almost smtp set sessions from
all the spammers so it's not just pop a
lot of users a lot of connections there
are a lot of us is unique connections at
high speed as being spammed I mean
there's you often run into denial
service just about every home pc is as
all people at some common
but each zombie is doing exponentially
more
person zombies maintain thousands of
simultaneous connections continuum
point four hours day so they load their
imposing on the infrastructure is much
higher than alleged user who checks one
pop server once every five minutes you
know assam bees doing thousands of
actions
you can also great limit each URL right
if I was a nice D equis I don't want
people pulling for email stored on my
server more than once every five
Carol I'll go through through this and
will help show how we tried to address
some of these issues with the protocol
as well
lost my presenter
we're just
and slide show
ok
so I've been talking with mang about
this and at some point I sort of
gathered a bunch of the ideas that I
thought were practical and feasible and
decided to just render them and
implement a solution under my
implementation I really was interested
in having security the major part of it
and so I made it as a shell around gpg
where all the messages are signed and
encrypted by default and the gpg key
ring serves as the address book /
whitelist i also wanted it to be easy
for somebody to get started with so my
implementation is also an smtp proxy so
it can be used with any mail reader and
it fetches into a mail queue again to
provide compatibility with all the
existing software obviously spam free as
may already talked about there's no
unsolicited contact
and so this is a network model that I
ran with it can change obviously but
here we have the sender server which is
just an Apache server running a CGI
again ease of adoption that CGI then
spawns a demon which will listen for
polling and the polling is done in the
in UDP but they don't have a UDP
notification in this implementation
instead the recipient continually pulls
all their centers so they're blasting
out a bunch of UDP packets for everybody
in their address book every whatever
five minutes they expect to receive back
a packet if they don't then they fall
back on a heavyweight polling where they
actually do an HTTP request that's
signed and that's how they get their
mail
these are the three parts the SMTP to
stub is a gateway between SMTP and
pushing the mail via HTTP on to the
sender mail server HTTP to mbox is the
recipient side pull all the people in
the whitelist pull down any mail that
exists post manager is the cgi that does
both sides of the sender server
mailstore basically an outline of the
UDP protocol there's a cookie that is
established when the heavyweight polling
occurs which is signed so that you know
you're you know which recipient and
Senator you're talking about basically
how you tie in the encryption cookies
hard to guess the server seats see is a
request it doesn't understand it just
doesn't respond if it sees one where
there's no one in the address or there's
there's no associated authentication
with the cookie it responds saying
you're going to have to do a heavyweight
poll
basically talking about the pgp
encryption happens on the local machine
so its end-to-end secure man the middle
can maybe cause someone to pull when
they don't have to or see who is sending
mail to who but the messages themselves
are are encrypted talked a little bit
about how you can defend this against
the denial of service by trying to
correlate between the UDP and the TCP
this is one of the things I think about
having dealt with a lot of dip denial of
service attacks before so I tried to
avoid them avoid some of the things I've
seen go wrong with smtp with this you
know it should allow people to
completely ignore the UDP packets if
they want to and force the client to do
a little extra work to do an HTTP signed
do you have mail for me
and this is a alternative to the default
installation which I would envision
being on the person's local pc instead
you can imagine having this installed on
a land sir and the people using it
aren't even aware that they are using it
this just takes over for your regular
smtp server and your regular pop server
by running a nun centralized place so
that for instance you could monitor
everybody's email or whatever
and there's all sorts of few future
ideas about extensions that you could do
first contact things like the the stub
notifications if you want it you can
turn that sort of thing on but then
you're back in the world of spam and
right now the implementation assumes
that your local machine is secure in a
future implementation you'd like to see
the entire local mail school and all the
mailboxes and all the keyring encrypted
right and right now the implementation
is limited it has a few inefficiencies
that you can easily see where there
would be room to improve for instance if
you're having hotmail and yahoo talking
to each other you want yahoo to be able
to say do you have mail from any of
these people to any of these people
rather than saying for each of these
people do you have mail from this guy to
that guy from this guy to that guy etc
so there's various room the various
places where you could improve the
protocol as is that's it
ok
and all that software is written you can
go to stub mail com download it and
start to to use it it it ties into the
gpg if you haven't used g QP g before or
if it was installing it will create a
key ring for you it'll create a key pair
for you so it really tries to make
adoption easy it will if you want to
integrate it into your existing email
structure when you send a message to
this system it'll check to see if the
recipient is compliant if not it'll fall
back on regular email to send the
message and you know hacks are welcome
if if you download it and you want to
add any of this stuff or whatever your
pet feature is go for it it's all open
source killing the projector here
so okay let me point one thing out
though which is that a lot of these
extensions like the whole idea of doing
UDP of doing crypto all of these
extensions are peripheral to the core
concept which is that the sender has to
store the mail and the receiver pulls it
down you can layer all kinds of
enhancements on top of that but if you
don't like them there's different ways
to do them you have a come in yeah I'm a
little confused about the economic
argument so currently the idea is that
the spammers have the bandwidth already
and this flag atop storage on top of
that so what are the numbers how much is
the family's favorite currently paves
expand people and how much more money
will this impose on this number I always
thought district really she just is
really cheap unless you are my birthday
little bit more money what we're trying
to do is cut the receiver is P how to
write instead of storing mail this is a
story mail here which is one centralized
point if you have a million users you
have a million mailboxes million units
if we move the mail from here to here
then it becomes possible when you
actually learn download the mail gets
downloaded straight to the client and
there's a million hard drives out there
each client has their own so the
economic argument isn't quite so much
that all right let's try and make it
expensive and painful for the spammers
as much as it is let's just trying to
make it less painful for receivers the
staffers are paying us our money in
traditional scenarios but most of the
time we're actually sending email for
selfies is that right Jim
for the record this is G
actually as a call for
here's a page
please turn us down
that case
Esther Esther to make you able to the NT
do you think we're all isps had identity
server been out certain of value-added
pay us money and we'll give you access
to a new server maybe 20 years down the
road if everybody is doing this or I am
or something like that an email account
is an add-on to an ISP account where the
ISP is really back to just maintaining a
network not all these add-on services
and maybe you saved five bucks a month
it is one of the big cost set centers
for isp is not not so much in the
infrastructure itself but in the people
to manage it and take the complaints and
try to build the filters and to topple
thing up so use your counselor all their
mail on their home PC
in this model it's either on the sender
server or lyrics to access anything you
can still win from a webmail no no I
would suggest that if you're going to
have that kind of synchronization
situation with multiple endpoints that
each one of these endpoints should
maintain a copy of the mailbox and it
could just go and pull that message down
each time right it's kind of like I no
way to the center getting bit only when
the receiver says some there's a
separate API professional message desa
or this is the center says so you know
the center's like that's been on now
about q400 days I'm going to get rid of
it despite the fact receiver isn't okay
one of the benefits one of the benefits
is that the center knows when the
message has been retrieved you know yeah
so you've created another tier email you
know so now I'll have a set of email
which I'm pretty confident to span free
and I want to live in a number of people
who arrived in that channel do any
provision for putting somewhere back
into the generic on 17 smtp email i
reach with a secure channel with you but
i don't like reading out your mailing
list essentially so much stuff whatever
go back into the power button that's a
good question i don't think there is i
mean it's it's pretty much domain by
domain names of course this protocol
then centers are going to assume that
person will fetch from them yes Irina
just came to take their beer and your
smtp presume presumably they would be
sending you two copies right the sender
won't know if those just starting to go
home I love with receiver smtp server we
talked to the juubi the origins I've not
talked to DJ trick talking like this
actually has
first found a good one so I want to send
a large file to hold a joke this is a
really good way to do it
I can see that if you want to talk about
viagra this is a good way to do it right
we have to actually alter all
at something and saying whether so
there's a large message sitting on the
server
so you could send a stop not as unity as
a PCP but for for the email message
we were a little bit worried we did that
they might not get true right that's
another thing as the reliability more
and more now people are complaining like
I didn't get your email or they send an
email they follow up with a phone call
like go get your make sure you got that
message for me and like things are
falling on the floor more and more use
smtp really does prevent spam assassin
like you know who only knows that may be
a way to revolve
only be I didn't get your mail problem
if I'm the receiver I can just sit there
and keep banging on my refresh button
right and i can say with confidence i'm
looking at everything that's did your
outbox for me and you haven't sent me
I'm much more confident
so that's one of the benefits you can
send a to dig video if you want you
upload the video and if they pull it
down they pull it down if they don't
they don't so each attachment could be a
separate file upload your vehicle web
server now in the URL right absolutely
Anson you all right you said absolutely
yes it's pretty much good stuff I look
familiar with Dijonnaise original
proposal but I'm curious how your
presentation
differs from the control
suggest he has no implementation yeah
I'm not that familiar with it was just
an idea folks cause I don't want you to
suggest it with you you take that idea
and
yeah I mean his core theory was center
stores I'm not sure exactly how he
proposed to implement that I doubt it
was by pulling with you again yeah if if
you look at his website his website
basically says well here's the basic
idea and there are a whole bunch of
questions that Sonya leads to and you
know for example how do you do polling
how do you do encryption how do you do
this how you do that and we have
answered those questions basically by
saying all right the core idea is to do
and she can be getting and we're going
to have encryption and everything on top
of that idea you know how you answer all
of these additional peripheral questions
you can answer them in different ways
you can say all right fine let's use PGP
for the address book that's one thing
that we're doing but you don't have to
use PGP fluid recipe you can use some
other kind of address book if you want
you can do all kinds of you can you can
answer all these questions in different
ways you can say let's do introduction
by going to science fiction cons and
doing PG PG signing I thought it would
be fun to do a cell phone bluetooth that
right p extreme but you don't have to do
it that way you can do it any way you
like so i ended up building this huge
list of different extensions and
enhancements that are completely
optional that different people can
imprint and implement in different ways
but if none of them are there you can
still get the core functionality
so I don't know if that quite answer the
question but this is sort of it
approaches the philosophy
one of the reasons to go to Arizona the
core is just to make sure you're getting
the message was from who you think you
are
do the key exchange in the secure way
the whole thing is you know we're
yeah we felt it was it was high time to
get real pki into the system and we just
want to have to do pki as a as a patch
run to be in on the ground floor and and
you don't have to have a password or
anything sorts solves a lot of the other
communication problems that just become
not I issues once all the messages are
encrypted if I guess the message ID
message that you have downloaded
starfish
any other comments questions so you can
also just open gmail accounts in each
other
is it
yes we're seeing this movement back to
clothes systems right this is why
myspace is very popular I want to talk
to anybody who's 15 years old you got to
get a myspace account and other
solutions like this have been try but
they're all closed and I think that's
one of the reasons they haven't kicked
it off because with this one you can
talk to somebody in Africa or a
different domain or whatever without
being beholden to one provider of
Technology one post etc yeah the moment
you move a problem of gmail the moment
you move from closed systems to open
systems and the moment you have
Federation you will have spam if it's
push if it's pull then you have a
fighting chance yeah so you can
implementation art anyone using it these
are they still to be exchanged email the
first time
last night we had those a little bit of
a background right so this is the goal
remember we can email each other and
it's done because we're starting april
we handle hackathon we got to get every
set all right guys you guys have been
like talking about this sometime i
actually wrote a PhD thesis on the idea
was cool email item if you actually
implemented wrote a thesis on it so we
said let's do it we did it we built it
and yesterday we had the first
interoperable exchange of email thank
you for providing a forcing function but
it works it's and we would love to
expand the circle that the software is
on the website you can download it and
now once we get key it's kind of like
how gmail is invite only right the
correction don't rate I'll have to email
us for MLS here your address what one
simplification on this that's not
entirely security key exchange happens
automatically it was just a simple email
address so he gives me his email address
I get it in my email address as soon as
send mail to him stub mail automatically
asks his demand server where's your key
server asks the key server what's his
tea brings it into the local key key
ring and then encrypts mail to him and
so on well that's that's one
implementation that's the current but
that's the kind of thing appreciation
there are lots of ways to do this here's
an alternative right here's my pgp key
ring here is my key and you'll notice in
the comment field in this little uid
here I've got a URL right so I've got my
name I've got my email address and I've
got my outbox URL and you can go
retrieve your mail from that autopsy RL
without talking to the man sir without
talking to a cheese and we're that's one
of the things we're going to implement
RSM right so if you want to change your
isp all you have to do is go edit your
key ring and dump it out and then
suddenly people are looking for your
mail somewhere else securely without any
issue
