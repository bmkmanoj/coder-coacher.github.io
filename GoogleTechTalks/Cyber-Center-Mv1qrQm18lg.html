government he's a professor at purdue
university he was my PhD advisor while i
was there and aside from being a
professor he he consulted for many
industrial companies like HP like the
cordilla technologies and we're honored
to have him here for this speech so
hello so just to to start things off
some people ask me about the what is the
cyber center involves and so on and so
forth so there are actually two parts to
this organization at Purdue there is a
deployment part of the organization
which is called I tab information
technology at Purdue and and that
organization is about 300 people and
then we've got the cyber center which is
an umbrella organization for all the IT
related research which is I mean
obviously you could you could tell that
it's it's fairly large and and we'll
talk about specific projects and some of
these projects could be as small as 10
people and some of these project
projects are as many as 40 or 50 people
that do the IT side of things so I'm
going to kick things off by showing you
a very quick video that introduces the
cyber center and what I do there
scientists to explore a world of endless
possibility to experiment theory and
computation
powering their research with innovative
solutions and computing resources is the
job of the cyber Center at Purdue
University building cyber communities is
the goal of the cyber Center in order to
build these communities the center uses
hub technologies high-end computing data
visualization and analytic networking
and security and learning and engagement
the network for computational
nanotechnology and their cyber community
nanoha provides the model for building
communities in other scientific areas
like biology and environmental science
the ever-increasing demand for computing
resources are vigorously supported by
produced powerful computing resources
and dynamic collaborations among them
are grid computing resources such as the
National Science Foundation Terra grid
produce visualization and analytics
center and the National Lab derail the
envisioned Center for data for
sexualisation and the many centers and
programs based in produce Discovery Park
which continue to develop the underlying
infrastructure necessary to support and
accelerate the changing nature of
discovery the cyber center at Purdue is
breaking down the computational walls
powering research and discovery and
endless possibility so this very last
the very last graphic that you saw with
the different centers these are the 10
centers at Discovery Park and as intent
intentionally and as you saw in the Indy
in the in the graphic the cyber center
is in the middle in fact we see
ourselves partnering with all the 10
other all the nine other discovery park
centers at Purdue University and they
vary from as far things as manufacturing
life sciences and and so on and so forth
so let me tell you what I what I mean by
cyber infrastructure in here we're
talking about the whole gamut of
infrastructure starting with the people
the organizations and the environments
that support them including all hardware
applications databases and so on and so
forth and and and and and the mission of
the cyber center is to is to engage in
basic cyber infrastructure researches
which is what i mentioned happens in
Discovery Park in the cyber center and
developing new cyber infrastructure
infrastructure tools and techniques and
also to deploy the results to real
communities and this last point here of
deployment actually happens between the
cyber center and I tab that I mentioned
at the introduction so to start things
off I want to first talk about the the
major motivation behind all this in
Discovery Park we've got all of these
different scientists in different
communities producing data and needing
resources so we see sort of that there
is a tipping point in this
infrastructure in the sense that massive
data is getting generated at the
periphery of the
of the web of the internet and and and
we need novel systems architectures in
order to deal with all of these data
that that's getting generated I'll give
you an example we've also we have all of
these sort of driving engines &amp;amp; driving
technologies and and and one that i want
to emphasize here is the communication
bandwidth that is doubling in fact
faster than the speed by which data
storage and retrieval and memory and so
on and so forth is doubling at and and
this is really allowing us to to let
scientists collaborate and work together
though they are despaired but they work
together as if they are all in the same
institution so the theme of this talk is
that big science is enabled true cyber
infrastructure or in fact how cyber
infrastructure inba empowers signs and
so just to give you a just to give you
an idea one of the experiments that
happens in physics generates as much
data as the equivalent to 100 million
phone calls going on concurrently now
obviously I mean I think this is silly
because when you start when you stop
trying when you stop but knowing how to
measure data in terms of exabytes and so
on and so forth you start to to
represent them in terms of these other
abstract ways but just to give you an
idea of how much data that's getting
produced and and it's it's an amazing
amount of data that's getting produced
not only that not only the volume of
data but also the data types that that
are produced that being produced by
scientists are are very very varied and
varied
from what traditionally database systems
and computer science has dealt with so
there's a tremendous amount of data
that's being captured and that people
want to get access to and people want to
share and store and retrieve and so on
and so forth not only that but and I'll
show you later on some specific examples
but the types of queries that that
scientists are interested in are not
like what you and I are interested in or
capable of sailing they're not
interested or capable of stating sequel
queries but they'll be able to say to
specify big domain high level queries
such as how does a protein fold or what
happens to space time when two black
holes collide and so on and so forth so
we're talking about the need for systems
that are that we the physical world that
perhaps also not necessarily query the
data but also query actual physical
objects that are accessible through
sensors or through RFIDs the very very
semantic intensive discovery and that
are interactive and perceptual a lot of
the day a lot of the systems and the
applications that that that our projects
deal with want to ask what if scenarios
what if this happens what if I do this
what happens to the plant the the metal
levels in this particular plant and so
on and so forth so we won't also want to
deal with fuzzy inaccurate and
incomplete data and we want to deal with
huge amounts of penny scale systems
provenance and reliability and security
and so on and so forth so I want to deal
with everything in a nutshell so let me
just take you here for perhaps a minute
or 90 second overview of some of the
activities in the cyber center so in the
cyber Center we emphasize four major
areas and that is high performance
computing networking grid and middleware
and data analytics and visualization and
these areas are so these are areas of
strength that we have at Purdue and
there are centers and their centers of
gravity for each one of these areas and
an obviously security virtualization and
provisioning and management of the cyber
infrastructure happens across all of
these all of these layers and then we
have on the other hand we have the
application areas and and these are the
nine centers the environment center
healthcare engineering energy Homeland
Security life sciences manufacturing
nanotechnology and so on and so forth
and and and what we do is with master
projects across these application areas
and the and the enabling technologies or
what we call the trust areas so this
happens within discovery park and we
collaborate with the with the existing
centers we collaborate with the
deployment unit and the idea is that we
push technologies out through creating
new products and and so on and so forth
so there's actually a an area at Purdue
that does commercialization and startups
and and and so on and so forth so
obviously my own area is in databases
and so I will emphasize one aspect of
this on on trying to develop so our
initial thing is to try to take
advantage of data analytics and
visualization and in fact this week
there is a consortium meeting at
Stanford which we are part of
funded by the Department of Homeland
Security and on data analytics and
visualization we have four there are
four regional centers for their
analytics and visualization around the
country and and one of the original
centers here is here at Stanford so one
of these one of these areas that I
mentioned is high performance computing
and our goal is to what we're doing is
working on novel parallel architectures
and associated compilers and system
software and of course we have a
scientific computing a program working
on numerical analysts and so on working
on parallel numerical algorithms and and
this is done through the computing
research institute then we have a
middleware and grids computing group and
and this is done through the NCN which I
will I will highlight later on and and
of course we have the security and
privacy a group that's leveraging the
strengths that we have through serious
and the multidisciplinary approach to
security that security privacy network
security and so on and so forth and and
and and last but not least is are the
problems of how you virtualize the
infrastructure highly managed the
infrastructure and how do provision the
infrastructure in a shared research
environment so let me take you through
some sample projects and as the title of
the talk our primary focus is to try to
develop these cyber communities and what
I mean by cyber communities are this is
an example of a cyber community if you
go through the nanoha org in
Center you will find a lot of resources
that are of interest to people working
in micro electronics so there are
collaboration tools they're learning
modules their seminars there's courses
and tutorials but there are also
simulations and and we just to give you
an example if you look at the usage
we've seen the usage go from about five
thousand users to now about twelve
thousand users of people who are doing
micro electronics who actually come to
the nano hub and do work either take
classes learn certain things learn
techniques run simulations and so on and
so forth and I'll show you a I'll show
you a an example so if you went to the
Nano hub that org you'll see this
portal here and so for example if you're
interested in in carbon nanotubes you'll
find all of these resources you can go
through a seminar there is a particular
seminar that's being taught by Professor
alum and you could go through skip
through different parts of the of the
seminar you could view materials and so
on and so forth they could also do
simulation through this portal you can
actually run a simulation so for example
I could launch the simulation and and
I'll look at the so this is a model of
the carbon nanotubes but you know right
in the middle of the simulation I may
want to change the parameters I want to
look at some different I want to get a
different view of this of this carbon
nanotubes and and I would run the
simulation again I get the electronic
representation and then I get the visual
presentation so this is a
so this is a an example of something
that you could do and again so that was
an example of a very simple simulation
that runs in the back and in the
background but you could also run
simulations interactive simulations you
could actually so you could run
interactive simulations like these sure
if or when it goes to another one but
let me just show quick one so you could
go through the visualizing a quantum dot
you could change parameters you could
play with the simulation online as the
simulation is running so this is really
let me just do it let it run
so the significance of this is to to us
it may not be all that I mean it's it's
something like running a VNC but but to
to a community of scientists this is
separating them from the infrastructure
letting them concentrate on the signs
letting the infrastructure run in the
background and and not having to
swimming so you see more than you want
to see about quantum dots but let me
just stop this and so anyway the other
example is going through web-based
learning and in fact the majority of the
users for nanohub our learners people
don't want to come and we'll learn about
a specific techniques will learn about a
specific simulation package and so on
and so forth and they actually this is a
learning module where they actually
could go through they could take tests
and run exercises and they could see
experiments and do experiments and so on
and so forth so basically what we do
here is we allow remote access to
simulators and and and computational
resources and it's basically running a
simulation in the foreground and and
running a virtual machine in the Indian
ano hub infrastructure in the in the
indie nmi cluster that we have running
at Purdue and letting the users see a
remote desktop and obviously for some
particular simulations and particular
experiments it doesn't make sense to run
them on the nmi cluster so these are
routed through the Condor Globus through
the third grade
or through other clusters that we have
so the idea then for the Nano hub and
the reason that the Nano hub is very
successful is that it sort of gives
scientists a new way of thinking of
using and sharing computational
resources software packages simulations
and results including data and so this
is what we're calling the science
gateways or the and the idea that we
have and the vision that we have is that
this nano hub constitutes a community a
cyber community that then we would like
to do is would like to export this and
utilize the same technology the same
idea of developing the cyber communities
and there is cyber communities is a an
interface a community for like-minded
scientists working on a particular field
to collaborate through high-performance
computing and grid than middleware and
now the idea is what we want to do is we
want to use the same technology for
other to create other hub technologies
and just to give you an idea for example
we have about 40 people are building
these hub technologies they're funded by
the National Science Foundation they
receive about 2 million dollars of
funding overall now and and the idea is
that over the next five years we will go
to about three and a half million
dollars a year for the people that just
build the hub technologies so let me
give you another example another flavor
it's a different flavor though and there
is the alkali hub we have a group of
about a worldwide maybe 40 50 may be
approaching even even more than that if
all the way from Japan to Oklahoma and
so on and so forth who are interested
all interested in studying the e.coli
and all come
tribute some resources the each building
a database if you wish and our vehicle I
hub is building this environment the
cyber community to collaborate and share
the databases that they that they have
so this imposes new kind of challenges
because when you're sharing when you're
sharing simulation packages when you're
sharing data then you've gotta worry
about the schemas and so on and so forth
so we've got people who are working on
schema matching and schema mapping and
so on and so forth canonical interfaces
and what have you and these are the
different ecoli hub resource databases
some of them are clustering some of them
are map views echo sick is a is a
pathway database there is a sequence
alignment and so on and so forth so
there's about 50 of these different
databases that that these scientists are
interested in working on and we have
within this group we have about 10 but
maybe about 10 computer scientists
working on this project along with the
biologists helping them build this
environment this particular system runs
on a bunch of heterogeneous databases of
all sorts the the the all the schema
matching and everything is all sort of
the front work is being done in Oracle
and this is a project that just about a
year old the funding here comes from NSF
again the the regional the Purdue
regional center the visual a Purdue
visual visualization analytics enter the
/ vac is a project that is department of
homeland security funded project with
the main mission of looking at disease
outbreaks
and the idea here is with a group of
these regional centers and Purdue we
have one and where we collect a medical
healthcare data and this healthcare data
then we look for patterns in fact we're
also integrating this with veterinary
data because they're actually some
diseases for example the flu that
migrates from the swine to the human
community so in fact we get hospital
admission data emergency room data
over-the-counter drug sales data we get
a whole bunch of veterinary data and so
on so forth and and what we're doing is
doing analytics doing data mining on
this data trying to find patterns and
and an hour later on I'll talk a little
bit more about some of the specifics
because when we meet with the folks in
the Department of Homeland department of
health and human services they complain
of the false negatives that they get the
false the false positives that they get
in the sense that in the sense that for
example we there was a case of in a
little town five people showing up at
the emergency room showing the same
symptoms and this obviously constituted
an alert and then upon further
investigation it turned out that these
people are from the same family which
has less significance there was a lot of
school absenteeism one day which raised
an alert but then upon further
investigation a turned out that was
senior day out so so what we're trying
to work with them is and how to make the
system a little bit more intelligent a
little bit smarter in terms of detecting
these or raising these alerts and this
is a we're working with the Indiana
Department of Homeland the security and
the ANA Department of Health Services
and the and the federal Department of
Homeland Security in fact the funding
most of the funding comes from the
Department of Homeland Security and it's
through the pnnl fact this week there is
this national visualization analytic
Center at Stanford which is the reason
that I'm in the Bay Area so another
flavor of project that we have in the
cyber center is a is a pipeline project
what we mean by pipeline is so if you
look at the pipeline in systems biology
you have different you have proteomics
people who are looking at the protein
people who are looking at the genes at
the genome people are looking at the
iron metabolomics site omics and so on
so the different groups different
communities are looking at different
aspects of the of this biological
pipeline and and and what we're trying
to do is we're trying to build a common
infrastructure that that they would use
so I show you two examples of this of
these projects and then what we're
trying to do to help them so this is a
session this is actually a system that
we built that that does protein analysis
and while it's going through the demo I
will maybe talk you through some of this
so when you go through the to the
pipeline login the idea is you've got a
blood sample say you run through the
blood sample through a mass spectrometer
and you get you get all of this data you
get a huge amount of data you get
perhaps more data than you then you
could handle and what do you do with it
and in the idea is for example you want
to detect Peaks the goal here is
medicinal discovery is to try to figure
out what cells are diseased and what
cells are not so you've got all
there is generated the pipeline this
infrastructure we built stores all of
this data allows the scientists to
visualize the data to look at the peaks
in the data and and actually to go
through specific experiment runs analyze
them look at the data for those specific
runs Z values here indicate energy
levels so the idea here then is to run
an experiment take all the data that
gets produced by the experiment stole
all the raw data but also do analysis
and run experiments for example we have
an X mass set of analyses that we run on
the data and so on and so forth the
reason we need to capture all the all
the raw data also is because it is when
you're doing medicinal discovery and so
on and so forth it's very important to
capture all the raw data and it and its
its its its federal law that you'll be
able to go back and and test and check
and check all the older or raw data so
the aya nomics project so the ayah so
here we're talking about gene regulation
and the ayah nomics project also though
this is a it's a plant experiment but in
fact the same pipeline the same
infrastructure is used the same
infrastructure is used by the by the
economics group and the pipeline group
and the proteomics group so the idea is
what we're trying to do now is to take
the is to take the the same it's
basically the same the same thing you've
got
the so let's run through this so this is
actually a planting path by the way
there's nothing fancy about it this is
actually a gray a planting plot where
they're actually plants planted there
and they're trying to figure out how
plants become more efficient in terms of
iron and zinc and so on storage and how
to make specific plants more useful and
so as you can imagine this experiment
stick a long time and there's a lot of
data that it gets gathered in the middle
how do you build this infrastructure so
that the the horticulturist doesn't have
to worry about by the way in the back
here we have a db2 database this is
running in WebSphere and the the
scientist doesn't have to worry about
how you do this the discovery on the
data and how you search the data and so
on and so forth so we've got a basic
search techniques and we've got an
advanced search techniques where they
could go look at specific around
specifics parents they look at specific
results and so on and so forth so that
where I think we're making innovation at
Purdue in this not in building these
specific systems but in actually
building a generic infrastructure that
can be used by the IO nomics people the
proteomics and the genomics and so on
and so forth so that they can jointly
study the study the cells and and and
and and and so on okay so I'm gonna skip
I want to spend few minutes talking
about some of the specific research
projects that we have so one of these
groups in the cyber center is a database
group which is our group my own group
also and this is not a small group I
would say altogether is about Google 45
people and this is
example of one of the projects that that
we have in the in the database group and
and building the data infrastructure
this specific example is for is for the
health care surveillance and that is
we've got heterogeneous databases first
of all we're doing data cleaning they
are scrubbing on the data we're doing
semantics traction building metadata on
the databases that that are more visual
we're doing the schema matching and
we're also because the fact that this is
a health care data there's some privacy
privacy issues in terms of anonymizing
the data before it is shared and so on
and so forth so this is a so to show you
why the visualization is also very
important on the left is a
representation of the same data that's
on the right but on the left it's its
numerical it's tabular and on the right
it shows a direct correlation between
temperature and coding damage and and
and and and and this is much more
powerful way of saying things this is
another example that of a project
building a infrastructure for medical
education and and and it gives you the
ability to browse view and play
multimedia data and and most of these
data here is video and and this is
another project actually this project
just finished that we did for the Navy
and this is a project for knowledge for
maintenance data we were getting all the
were captured we're capturing the
maintenance procedures on board a for a
particular radar avoidance system
on an aircraft carrier and doing
knowledge projection on it that is
trying to build a knowledge base as to
what procedures wet things that went
wrong if this thing went wrong then the
next thing would go wrong and so on and
so forth and when we run into glitches
we consult with a shore-based smes or
experts and and so this is actually a
working system that is deployed and now
in the Navy in at Crane this is the
newest project that we have and again it
is taking all of these bits and pieces
and building a system for biological
data base management and and this is a
where we're doing the sequence
processing the annotation and the
provenance and the and the defensive
tracking I want to emphasize the
annotation and Providence because this
is the contribution of the system and
the idea here is that we wanted to
enable the database the biological data
base with the ability to annotate the
data which is which is what people we
work with tell us is the most important
thing and and so we allow we allow the
users to annotate columns to annotate
rose to annotate specific cells and also
Allah we provide capabilities to run
operations so for example you can
manipulate the annotation you can you
can query on the annotation you can
update the annotation and so on and so
forth so imagine the annotation now is
becoming a part of the database and and
you and actually we build a schema also
for the annotation and and and and and
so on and so forth so the system also
indexes sequences and and compressed
sequences and in the other aspect of
system is provenance and that is and
this is an important feature that's
that's not previously available in these
biological databases and that is the
ability to figure out for a particular
piece of data that i have in the
database were this data come from what
is the origins of this particular
information where was it if it's
aggregate information where is
aggregated from if it's a copy you know
and so on and so forth all the
historical data is also stored in the
database and and we believe that this is
also a very innovative work so this is
an example of the end of the Providence
in this system and and this is the last
example of a project that that I have
and is the newest project and there is
the idea of quitting physical objects
and and and here just imagine that when
you go through google and you search
you're searching now stored data you're
searching databases you're searching
metadata what we would like to do is
going through google would like to query
and access the physical world actually
access physical objects i want to be
able to instead of going to a database
and getting information on the cameras
and the chairs on in this room i would
like to go straight to the RFIDs tags
that are on these chairs and in these
cameras and query them directly so and
this is a new project that we have and
we can scroll spacey and so in here
we're doing database discovery quitting
and monitoring building the
heterogeneous index on this particular
physical world and so on and so forth
okay so this is sort of the overview of
of some of the projects that we have
going on in the on the in the cyber
center and if you want to talk a little
bit more about some of the work will do
database grew ball so I can talk about
Oh
sorry
so the question is the question is on
the invitations and let me go to
so in fact that's exactly the objective
the objective is that you want to be
able to treat annotations as if they
were part of the database but you want
to in other words because because you if
they were treated as if door the part of
the base say for example you have an
attribute and the attribute called
description and the description has
these so it's the simplest form of a
notation you have a field called
description description contains some
annotations but then you could not query
this you could not for example what we
want to do is we want to be able to we
want to be able to run sequel queries on
the annotation itself for example we
have yeah but but this is a this is so
the idea is we want to be able what
we're doing is with annotation SQL we
want to add sequel constructs that
allows you to manipulate annotations for
example we want to be able to update the
annotation we want to be able to figure
out a specific cells on this annotation
we want to have a specific annotation
with a particular field with a
particular value with a particular
column with a particular so in other
words where it would be it would be
another table it would not be an
attribute would be another table behind
this table that then you're joining with
this table if you want to think about it
that way that could be another way of
thinking about it but it's not a column
in the table right
okay so sorry so for example if you want
to think of it as as an annotation table
that then you would you would join with
the original table you could but then
that so yams so many you added I mean
and I think you understand easily tables
myself
no but I mean so tell me now in your
building and my sequel database you're
building an Oracle database how would
you handle annotations I mean you don't
you don't you don't have that this is
the tables of the latter take this trip
oh and this is a table that annotate
this pair and it's got three more
columns and I have to make sure that
whenever I change something in the
original table I go and update columns
in this other table right
it's not that I don't think that there's
a lot of stuff to be done here i just
went here what your take on it gray
yeah so traditionally that's not how
annotations were handled right i mean
invitations were not handled as as as
databases and what we want to do is want
to handle them as databases i want to be
able to to run sequel queries on the
annotations themselves not because
they're stringfield's right so so but
that's not how they were handled the way
you're describing is how we would like
to do them but that's not how they are
handled now in database systems
I can see the the actual syntax for the
for the annotated SQL but but that's why
I was trying to see if I could read it
but I can't blow this up but I wanna be
able to add annotations archiving and
restoring annotations propagating
annotation so I could propagate an
annotation from one from one column 2 22
another database I want a query data
based on their annotation values and
anon index and retrieve annotations so
unless those annotations were stored as
first-class citizens in the database I
could not do those things and an
existing database systems don't don't
allow for that how did you want to say
something I'm saying maybe having having
a having an extra table for the
invitations this is the way that we this
is the way that it's going to be
implemented but from the user
to have constructed sto my head a big
data and label all these souls by the
same researcher instead of inserting
each topic with the same
so having this one
plantation and then from the background
from the
at the back end
sorry after he left it was an it wasn't
even thought of when he was there i
would imagine that the more critical
thing
the set of 1 divided statement
that caused the annotation
should be automatically synchronized
but that will only happen if the
annotations are stored in the database
the annotations were stored as files
outside of the database which were
traditionally you think of their
descriptions then then that wouldn't
happen I come from any I point that be
stored in another foul they will sort of
be there storing them in the database
has some and I know that they sit death
was gotten to the point where there were
rules and triggers
and those kinds of things but some of
the things that you want to say with
respect
you don't want to sport what everything
to look like it's mayonnaise but some of
the things that you want
that have happened you don't want to
make happen by making an addition
for each data item
if everything is green
then having a table that says Fred green
marched right yeah i agree with you i
agree with you for sure and that's why
we're saying that that yeah now i agree
with you obviously surely don't want to
you just want to create you want to
store all the things only that you have
annotations for not not have quite the
country you want to have annotations
things that don't require it's example
i'm giving we want to annotate everybody
is having color green
but we don't want to store 54 million
cells in the database saying Green Green
Green Green Green we want to know that
when you look somebody up the color is
green or maybe their colors green Wes
there in the exceptions list so are sure
yeah short obviously a shoo shoo fly
shoo guy when you combine it on a blue
and a red you get our guidance
annotation as problem all right
but that's the best of subset where it
would seem like a personal question bro
so there'll be one way of one question
as to how to how to implement this and
how to build it sure yeah supporting
some some rules for the annotation so
when we combine annotations for the same
self you get a new one and to provide
these roads to the database tonight
yes I mean in fact in fact those would
be an ad the notation here there are
some rules that yeah thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
