Ted sulker with us today dr.
selker develops and tests new user
experiences he spent 10 years as an
associate professor at the MIT Media Lab
where he ran context-aware computing
group co-directed the Caltech MIT voting
technology product project and directed
the counter design intelligence project
product design for the future his work
is noted for creating demonstrations of
a world in which human intentions are
recognized and respected and complex
domains such as kitchens cars on phones
and email and of course and mats Ted's
work takes the form of prototyping
concept products supported by cognitive
science research prior to joining MIT in
November 99 he was an IBM fellow
directed the user systems ergonomics
research lab he has served as a
consulting professor at Stanford worked
at Xerox PARC and Atari research labs
and taught at Hampshire College
University of Massachusetts Amherst and
brown university he's here today doing a
series of talks with various teams in
the Maps group giving feedback on are
you our own user experience and I'm glad
that we have the opportunity to have
this for all of us to hear from em so
dr. sucker thank you this is a topic
that's really exciting and this talk is
completely new so forgive me first I
want to make sure I mentioned that I
can't think of anybody that has made any
group that has made anywhere near the
impact on making visualization valued
and productive that this team the Google
Maps team has made in the last couple of
years I'm pretty intimidated it's
amazing the direct manipulation the
changes to what we think hand we can
understand and
and use and and and learn about the
world through through this thing and how
quickly I mean I don't know if you have
500 million users a day but I wouldn't
be surprised so anyway I guess that's
that's that's where I come from maps are
are are very of things and you know they
go from this lovely Jesus thing oh yeah
this lovely you know visualization of
you know how hard is to write on this
bike ride and and and and an overlay of
the physical terrain two things we call
maps because they're just a
representation of something that will be
spatial and have meaning this here was a
user interface for Alzheimer's victims
that I made its on PBS that is a map of
applications they can use so you know
the word map gets used in various ways
but it's about spital orienting
ourselves in space and maybe time and
certainly the the use of the spatial
domain for communicating goes from
imagery ah to caricature Erised imagery
i call that caricature ization usually
things like icons are caricatures of
images and are are used to to bring out
some aspect or make them memorable in
some way separate from being an EQ
object that is a specific thing and then
symbol symbols are if you have to
abstract it to the point of having just
a link and and all three of those things
are used in all visual languages and
certainly maps use use vuze single
symbols icons and images and people
basically in every user experience are
trying to orient themselves when we're
in the jungle you know we've got our
peripheral vision
and we're like we can check out motion
really good and our peripheral vision
and we can focus and that's what we do
is or Foe be all animals and so we're
used to focusing that's why we do the
search thing okay but being oriented is
one of the lovely things that that a
that a map is about it and certainly as
we think about search we don't have we
call it browsing when we're when it's
all about being oriented we call it
search when we're doing something
focused so I think it's really a new
dimension that's being added to the kind
of way you guys deal with data knowledge
whatever to be working in the spatial
domain not just you know in terms of the
physicalness of it but rather the
semantics of overview background
surround information being critical to
to something got separate from the
spatial thing although we can remember
very well a specific image we've seen as
I was saying earlier we're we're
extraordinary good at that actually we
remember things much better as sequences
and sequences in time we call stories
often and so those are kind of some of
the some of the elements notations
always very I mean this is a depiction
of the rainfall and wind and and and
they light the daylights that big hump
for part of the world and parts in
various months and time time of year and
and time of day that I used in choosing
which mountains to climb it's in this
wonderful book called mountains of the
world or something and in using that
book though I got in trouble because
this map of chimbo wazoo curt note oh
excuse me orizaba or each sabha is a
mountain that I destroyed a car on I use
this map to decide that I could just
drive up this road well that road even
though the book kind of said you should
probably get you know
Jose herim eras to ride to drive you up
in his four wheel drive it looked like a
fine road up to the you know about a
couple mile mile from the bit from the
base camp and so so what if it was
13,000 feet and you started riding on it
and it's a network of hundreds of roads
and no one knows what they all do except
for well I found some hitchhikers but
yeah sure I did put a puncture of the
gas tank and we got out of it somehow
and but if you look at you know these
books also found in climbing books
you'll see these very specific
annotations all over these cracks and
they are kind of trying to look like
what you might see you've got these
little these little rays coming off to
the left that means it's a left facing
crack you've got these dots where
there's an anchor and trees all over one
of those trees those trees are really
important because those are where you
tie in but you know these specific
annotations or vocabularies are very
common to humans and maps up in specific
areas take it to 22 levels at which wich
are taken there for a couple of reasons
this one is an outsider's map it was
made by some some stupid American you
know know nobody there made maps they
don't even speak Spanish by the way in
your exam it's in Mexico but they don't
speak Spanish really out there but these
were made that way because look at how
much informations on that page anyway so
we're trying to impoverish the you know
to make that make a really simplifying
notation to reduce the amount of things
we have to put on there so we can
overload the communication and get a
tremendous amount accomplished those you
know there's a about 12 different climbs
to climb every climb on that page would
take three days so just you know give
you an idea of and what's wonderful
about it is it shows you this this Maps
actually pretty good at being all you
would possibly need it knows we you know
where the problems are and how r
these things are and any so on and this
kayaking nap isn't as interesting but it
has it still has some some of its own
notation but space you know 3d used to
be something we didn't use with
preferred decades we've had 3d
capability on her on our computers and
and yet we have 2d in ur faces before
for decades we had to Dianna man we had
1d interfaces with the text line you
guys still have text line as your input
to your to your search system your
multi-dimensional thing but one one
thing I'm kind of proud of that I did is
we we had an interface come to us one
day at lab I worked at and it looked
like this they'd gone to the icon
factory and and come back with a bunch
of stuff and I I drew on a napkin
something that much more like this and
what I did is I made the size sizes
different the spacing is different
between things I made them semantically
group see there's the books and the
manuals and software all together and
the networks hooked up to the computer
and and anyway so we tested these two
against each other and what's
interesting is for about 30 years
starting at BB and I mean uh AT&amp;amp;T Labs
people had tried to figure out because
23 does 3d help people over 2d and
actually hadn't had any examples really
quantify the examples this was probably
the first one what was interesting is
that the first experiment when you first
try to select things on this versus this
it wasn't any faster it got faster like
a third faster after some experience and
so in fact this spatial organization
remembering the spatial organization in
this case using 3d space different
shapes different sizes actually was a
long term memory result so I think
that's really fascinating by the way I
betcha we got better data down batch of
some of the user interfaces that haven't
been tested enough out there today will
teach us that actually you can do better
than that that there's things with
animation there's things with with 3d
effects that actually can help instantly
but in any case there there's a
reasons for going to to more complex
more three-dimensional interfaces if you
if you have to do it repeatedly when I
was going to give this talk I sent out a
message to a couple of you guys and
Norfolk came back with with with
something excellent and as he always
does he said as well you know think of
it as a platform for adding data
collected by others I mean to be honest
a map always is a collective enterprise
okay a map is a complex collection of
information about a space it's hard to
imagine a map that could be made by one
person by themselves and and and really
you guys take that to an extreme and I
expect taking it further and and you
know he said what was the best value you
you can get what are the data sources
are important how would you display them
so they're useful and discoverable how
do we build communities or both
consumers and producers and those are
all really important thoughts to keep in
mind I think you guys all are but I
think what we're going to find is much
more exciting than that we're going to
find that the for social and physical
space of the world is changing
dramatically you know while we look at
that grass out there and certainly every
blade of grass has all the information
about grass he used to be that that
grass maybe was specific to mountain
view now it's flowing around on a 747
and it's not specific at all we've
destroyed its sense of space and and and
you know autonomy or whatever but but
certainly we are giving the world an
archaeological record now that in the
next two years is going to be so much
greater than all of the archaeological
records that have ever existed that it's
going to change the way we think of
every place and what we can do with it
and even what kinds of things we can we
get weak tools we can make so I'm very
I'm I'm very excited about that
and there's you know these techniques
that we can use and this one I picked up
off of your website a couple days ago
dave told me to check out this this this
picture thing it's really god awful i
mean it is impossible with this thing to
use it either as a map or a picture
viewer but it's lovely and then there's
all these overlays and and I just have
to start I started teasing you guys you
know I I'm not sure where to start I'll
start with one place that I'm very very
excited about with these pic books
pictures I was in Barcelona this
University whose name all for good 22
weeks ago and or maybe there's a week
ago I don't remember anyway 29th of mate
whatever that is and this guy showed me
this amazing visualization with pictures
that were G liquid that he'd found
himself and some days graduate student
and what he did is he simply had a you
know colorized map of where the pictures
were and you can literally tell where
all of the tourist traps in town were it
was just absolutely obvious where those
where were the places you needed to go
and take a picture right you know you
can imagine you know those fires of
Gowdy's in that Park that Goudy made and
the oceanfront it was just all very
obvious and good I mean I thought that
was really lovely and the question
becomes what is the value of all of this
information the fact that those pictures
exist all by itself was the information
that was so so important to me the
tourists coming through maybe if I was
over here is stuck in second mount view
I'd want to look at all those pictures
on the ocean of those girls not wearing
any tops or something but but you know
in fact you know that that wasn't what
he was pointing out and I think that we
will get I know you guys were going to
get to the point where these pictures
are don't look like noise they look like
they look like wow that because that's
their I understand so much more about
that place and about what i would do
there and why I why a person is there
and what has happened there
and what could happen there and then we
go and take a look at this this this
this this bubble is balloon and balloons
and or they just completely what's
really great about them is they aren't
ignoring they're not what's underneath
they are not they they they stand out
they're separating themselves what
happens when I put my cursor over there
should move away so I can look
underneath it or should it really really
expand so I can see more of that in fact
that that the semantics of of the map
versus the overlay you know is a hard
thing to get right and then we we have
all these things we want to do to our
maps we want to we want to like you know
find our way around and and we want to
add extra things and and you know when
somebody was asking me well what if we
add another thing how many things should
be able to add how many modes should be
able to get into and what does it mean
when we get into a mode and how do we
get out of it and and it's really you
know I guess Woody Allen is attributed
maybe with the saying you know time is
the thing that keeps everything from
having it once well space is you know
you know space has the same danger if
everything happens at once in space it's
just it's just a big pile and yet you
guys do it you do they do an incredibly
fabulous job of obsess separating stuff
and all and I'll talk a little bit more
about that as as we go on I'll just yeah
and so you know they're not just gonna
in the inlet in this phase where I went
and played with things and thought about
what to say about what you guys do do
and I'm sure everything's you know
always improving as it does here you
know I search for El Camino Real
restaurant and the reason I searched for
that was because there was a specific
restaurant I was trying to find and I
didn't know any other way of
characterizing it however somebody has
grabbed your search and they've decided
to put a sports shop as the first thing
on my restaurant search on el camino
Palo Alto and then I noticed that some
of these things aren't even on on el
camino I mean we're only through this is
the fourth thing and we're already at
the YMCA which isn't a restaurant either
so somehow or other those that that
search has gotten you know derailed
right from the very first for for things
and I'm just kind of sad about that
although I don't think that has anything
to do with maps but it's amazing how
good you guys are at search and why is
it with extra information some of some
of that seems to have had some problem
of some sort and I don't know probably
you can explain that to me so you know
when I go to when i go to directions i
found myself going back to a street
actually it's a set of streets that are
the streets where the people that bought
my house and in boston owned a house so
I could have looked at that but that was
like three months ago that I was there
and every time i go back to google met
to look for directions it always takes
me back to there and it don't quite know
how to change that default so you know
that memory is good but remembering
things you know our memories diminish
over time unfortunately or maybe
fortunately and and the question of how
do we make these these personalizations
be much more like humans where where
memories where where they are
appropriate and fail soft is always an
issue so personalization I think you
know you got to have conflict resolution
you've got to decide gosh do I really
believe in this place that Ted went to
three months ago is the starting
location
as opposed to today when i was looking
at mobile and it couldn't quite remember
that where IM might be the place that I
want to start from even though it knew
that when it was trying to impress me
that it knew where I was when I got the
thing to come up so you know really
deciding that stuff is is is subtle and
important and it's important in setting
people's expectations and then keeping
them at that level people don't mind if
you don't do a very good job if you keep
doing it at that level but if you're but
it's a job that you do is spiky then
they don't know how much trust to give
and how deep to make that that that
commitment to to looking at what you're
doing zoom granularity is is is
something that I find myself spending
minutes a day with on google maps I zoom
in ups I'm all the way in and I can't
see anything like that oh I'm not
looking at the whole world I just I feel
like it's I've got you know poorly
poorly sharpened ice skates right and
this I can't stop myself there's no
semantic limits and I'll give you an
example of some a trick that we did when
i was doing tactile feedback with with
with the pointing device at IBM if you
went slowly you could feel the edge of a
window and the edge of the scroll bar
and the edge of the internal window and
then you felt each of the pixels of the
text as you went over it when you went
faster all you felt was the edge of the
window right and so when you went faster
you know when you as you sped up it
would change the semantics of what you
felt with your haptic feedback and I
think that the question of how much what
a zoom feels like and how to zoom back
to the level i was at before you don't
have to have these fixed but you can
have it so that there are energy wells
so that it's easy to get to various
resolutions and that you are increasing
the dynamic range of a person's control
within the range of where they're
working and if you want to talk about
that I know a lot about control
algorithms for for user input but I
think it's a really important topic
that's why I wasted your time on it
and yeah I find this this crowbar is
just dimensionless in a way that it
could possibly find some where there
could be some semantics what does it
mean to be whittling around on a street
what does it mean to be whittling around
in a in a community what does it mean to
be whittling around in a you know right
I mean what are these what are those
different levels and why would you be
there all right and then and then and
yet people do want to have you know the
freedom to fix floor point at here
oh I don't remember what that one is
sorry point out here I guess I probably
have found myself getting you're trying
to put something somewhere and and and
the precision yet like this which is
wonder what this thing is well that's a
really important I don't know what to
search for it to get up on that there's
only one you know you know it so I yeah
the bad way down here
well that's all you know graphical surge
why wouldn't you have it you know it's
such a new double-click a settlement
after that circular start and what's
there let
yeah yeah well at right and I think that
that there was a topic we talked about
quite a bit today which is which I call
self-revealing interface and it's the
and it is so hard I'm looking at him
because I know he's a tool builder it's
so hard to make tools that have that
have on ramps that that encourage you to
get to get rid to get deeper and more
sophisticated with them without wasting
your bloody time you know you know
hanging it all around you and not
letting you get your work done and I
think that that's that's that's a real
holy grail for user experiences how to
get people to know that new
functionality exists without destroying
their their their competence in in the
process of learning them something yeah
that's actually what you did that what I
did me thank you Chris annotation I mean
I'm sure it's coming but you know when I
look at the maps that I drive across
country or ride a bicycle or go climbing
with they are cluttered with things that
are mine my personal annotations and
those annotations are all memory aids
that's what they are they remind me of
experiences they remind me of people
they remind me of dates and you know
there's no reason that you guys aren't
figuring out even better richer ways of
letting us a note 8 and I think that in
the meantime you know you're busy making
the rich ones but I think that there are
the other that you should figure that
maybe it might be fun to be thinking
about the the lightweight and simple and
and probably you will figure out rich
ways of getting rich information from
them even you know it's just I'm going
to go for this yeah well replacing hand
marking with menu ok so you when i'm
doing stuff on the screen I've got this
hand that's moving around ok well a
marking menu is this lovely thing or pie
menu is this lovely thing that the
direction you push your cursor changes
the value of what you're doing and it's
very easy for people to remember
directions so whenever you see something
that
is laying around not being useful how
many you know shouldn't always be a hand
what are the other things that that hand
can be why could it be how could it be
changed to just very light in a
lightweight give people more ability to
control things one thing we were talking
about this morning is that nobody knows
how to teach the you know if you know
how to use the cursors to use the
panning to use than if you're using the
panning to use the cursors well you know
there's very simple things you can do
when we're that's a very nice learning
moment when when a person uses a control
and there's another way of doing it why
not as long as they're both visible
highlight the other one and show that
it's also available and there's a cheesy
example of what app I'm in you might
look like but semantics are hard and my
son loves to think about words on very
much so if you anybody knows of a Latin
class he's in need of one this summer
but so you know you say Frisco CA and it
finds us Frisco Indiana so I'd like to
get San Francisco obviously and I guess
you know
that's not a big surprise and I'm not
always sure I guess one thing we were
talking about this morning is
everything's attack and these tacks are
the only information we have to deciding
whether we're going to look at something
more unless we look over there and so
that representation is completely
necessary to decide whether this is
valuable to poke at and I think that you
might want to fig you know it might be
possible to to not depend on a person
looking on two representations and think
about how you can maybe expand your
vocabulary of annotation to simplify a
person's decision of what they're what
they're looking at what is what I think
you guys that probably argue no you know
but this has probably got to be fixed
you know easily but you know when I say
90 Jason street arlington massachusetts
you know because it's in the what field
it seems to get me all these businesses
and i thought you guys were making money
from this i was told this morning you
don't even make money from this i'm sad
i mean cuz it's like it then then what's
the value is talking about you know
twenty academy street that's obviously
not ninety Jason Street nor is Nora is
70 Park Avenue although they know
something about 70-90 Jason Street and
so on so yeah semantics are hard that's
all
and a few years ago my friend maybe some
of you know Henry Lieberman rota a nice
paper kind of playing around with
alternatives to zoom and pan the typical
thing that people do to get from one
place to another as they they come you
know zooming out then zooming in right
and that's that's how we typically do
that on metaphorically and you know and
certainly it's a way of keeping oriented
but there are alternatives and so he
made something called macroscope and
this image will is a little hard to see
except that let's see if I can I'll go
to the next one to show it more but yeah
this is just not showing up so well the
point is you'll see that there's
freeways there's street signs and their
specific places and this actually we had
a better picture which show three layers
of resolution the country the city and
the street and simultaneously and we can
use dynamics animations a good way of
separating these different maps we can
use intensity colors color intensity
schemes we can use texture the texture
look of a street grids very different
from that of a freeway you know kind of
interchange look we can use kind of
purple mountains Majesty to make the one
map kind of look like it's below the
other one and we can use bounding
rectangles when we oh yeah this one when
when when we don't so if you look at
this you'll see there's the world right
and then in that world there's a couple
of places that are important there's
there's the United States and there's
some place that in Cambridge and
Cambridge here's the map of Cambridge
anyway if you look at this guy's paper
he has a video also that that he's
gotten you know four layers of maps be
able to be interpreted all at once
and it's interesting you just look at
them and you find yourself just focusing
it the world and you don't notice so
much cambridge right and when you look
at cambridge you don't notice so much
the world and that's an example of it
and and you can use various various
visual techniques to do that and it's
it's a lot of fun because basically it
gives you this you know huge range of
resolutions that you can pay attention
to about potentially the next slide or
two or some of the maps I I over from
kind of 1999 until it became obvious
that you guys owned the world of maps we
made of lots of things called virtual
campus at MIT and it started off with me
just wanting to make it so any time you
open your laptop anywhere on campus it
would open with a map from where you
were where all the bathrooms were where
the free food was where the lectures the
free lectures were as I have a backdrop
and that that was our first demo and
then we kind of kept playing with it and
I'm not sure it got better but anyway we
kept playing with it and so you know the
idea is that if your staff you might see
where the where the the closets you know
the power you know connectors and stuff
like that or in the circuit breaker
switch is if you're a student you'd know
where your you'd actually it would know
that your chemistry lab had moved and
you could see where it moved to if
you're you know somebody outside of the
university and was the weekend it would
show you there's a that there's actually
a bathroom over a legal seafood it
wouldn't show you that there's a
bathroom inside of the media lab because
the media labs not really something you
should be going into and well except for
the museum's open and if the museum's
open that it does show it to you and so
this idea of having right through the
structure of the of the value of what
these different spaces are are useful
for and to who was what we exposed we
had real time shuttle information and
and oh my gosh we had our hands for a
few minutes on the MIT data warehouse
which meant we knew where your car was
parked
and and we need more than that actually
we knew which classes you were in and
stuff then they thought that was okay
and we knew that they'd not after a
while and they pretty soon they got
scared of us having all that data but it
was fun and and one of our tricks that
really seemed to work out there's a lot
of ideas that we tried was we had these
12 different icons I want to call them
and for the different things that that I
campus exposed and it really was amazing
I mean one day I I wanted to go to some
entertainment on a Saturday night and so
I popped this thing I looked on
Ellington you know the local newspaper
you know the ones that are further for
entertainment and the entertainment
section of the Boston Globe and I you
know looked online for what's happening
in Cambridge and finally I just went to
have our map and I went to our map and I
looked over at kresge auditorium and
there were three things going on that
we're interesting to me and it showed
them as entertainment and we drove over
there and one of them was sold out and
the second one we went to was this
African drumming thing and this got you
know this whole team of drummers that
come from Africa and it was like this
huge memory for my kids and and we
decided all that and did it in you know
40 minutes and it was a 30 minute drive
so you know so that was really kind of
loving it that it just just really just
you know brought all that information
together about that and so these are you
know this is sports and this is this is
music and here's some acting and here's
some MIT event anyway so there's these
different categories there's a Bulgarian
dance workshop for going over there and
this is a I think actually meet me in a
guy named Scott penberthy may have
pioneered this kind of visualization in
1985 when we made a an overview and
in view thing where you know you can
stretch this change the size of this and
everything in that block is what you see
up here and it gives you an overview and
and and focus view at the same time it's
pretty common kind of approach these
days and I think it's useful about we
tried all sorts of different maps and
the ones that worked worst were we can
barely see it here we had ones where we
were using where we were you know when
you win some place the whole world
stretched you know as big stretchy
rubber rubber world and and the building
you're in got huge and everything else
got small and that fisheye view is a
lovely thing but it's disorienting if
it's not done in a way that people could
remember the relationships between
things because when they're stretching
and morphing around themselves actually
the spatial relationships between them
change and people aren't really good at
transforms except when they have a model
of it and so I believe that if you can
design physical models like sphere or
whatever to make it obvious what
transform you're doing to a space you'll
be able to not break people's
understanding where they are but boy oh
boy we had terrible problem with with
that and yeah that was kind of a the
tragedy of my of Matt Hockenberry his
thesis is that he that is bet his life
on that idea and it wasn't working but
it was a beautiful demo I mean just you
know though you go into the world parts
as you go forward you know it's really
great so the idea some of the other
ideas that we tried in this thing that
we're really successful was darn it none
of these actually show the one that we
deployed but anyway the one we deployed
there's a couple of nice features to it
one is that there was about a twenty
pixel wide segment between the map and
the rest of the screen which we made
kind of curved just slightly curved and
green and then there was some brown
up rates coming out of it and then there
was a bezel around a big bubble and that
was always there and so that was it
looked very much like a billboard at the
edge of right and so that metaphor kind
of made it kind of connect in with the
with the map and we put all sorts of
things there about the things that you
know the more detail stuff was up there
and another idea that I'm really kind of
fond of is that you wherever you were
that's that's you know your friends
right the relationships dictate of
course as I was telling you before what
you can see and who can see it you know
and that's kind of interesting duh but
we did another cute thing which is we
had this I am capability where you could
send messages and I'm not sure I see any
of that on here oh I may not have copied
that anyway you have message is waiting
for you underneath this person that's
you and it's the cute little person and
it can be in your dormitory or can be in
your office or it can be at the theater
that somebody wants you to go to so when
you see a message for yourself somewhere
else and you open that it kind of
already helps you understand that that's
maybe something interesting that you
might want to do and it might be useful
for you to kind of think about alright
enough of that for now I'm just going to
talk about navigation for a minute and
there's so many kinds of ways of
navigating and it makes a huge
difference and you know we can talk
about it from the point of view of you
know stretching space and time like the
hyperbolic vote viewer does and one
thing I was talking about earlier was
this idea that if you put a grid that
looks like a globe over a hyperbolic
viewer makes it much more like a sphere
and the foreshortening on the edges
makes a lot more sense and you don't
kind of have to go and kind of do some
conceptual mapping you do just a
physical mapping I think the physical
space anything you can do that to make
people believe they're in a physical
space is going to be something really
easy for the mind to do but but on the
butt on the input side I've done a lot
of stuff like we
for example when you're scrolling we
made this scrolling device that if you
just hold it in a position you go you
keep going in that direction and it's
kind of a lot simpler than doing this in
fact it's the third faster than the
rolling than the scrolling thing but
what Apple said to us as well our brand
is already working for us and you know
there's kind of some fun specific ones
we made this this rope and all we did is
put that rope over the rolling ball on a
scroll wheel and then you step on a
tandem atha and on this rock that we
made and it makes the buttons click and
it was just amazingly impeccable
instance of museums you know for going
up into a jungle you know going down
into caves you know going up into space
you know it's going up into it a big a
big building it was kind of a really
natural exploration device that the kids
just loved when we tried on making six
degree-of-freedom navigation devices we
started off thinking about you know how
could we do a 60 of creative freedom
thing with the pointing device that I
was so involved with and we started off
with these right we put these two those
two pointing devices side-by-side and
what was amazing is that when we offset
them you see the difference these ones
are offset when we offset them so that
they were asymmetrical was much better
people got confused about which one was
which when they were when they were when
they were symmetrical and they would get
the semantics wrong people are very very
good at mirror image reflection
decisions and so they would they would
screw up in that way and then we
realized that you know the best thing to
do with two hands is maybe move
something into place and then attack it
you know kind of like what you do with
it with it with when you're drawing
you're moving the page underneath your
hand and keep drawing there's even tools
for artists to move there to move their
brush around with one hand and do it go
we set things up with our left hand we
do them with a right if we're right
handed and so that's why there's a blue
button in the
that thinkpad that blue button is you
push on that and you're in scroll mode
and that's your left hand and so you
know thinking about these navigation
metaphors needs matter VA shin
affordances is so there's a 12 degree of
freedom of navigation device no it's 24
degree oh you know it gets clay I want
to make clay and want to be able to mold
things a lot of work too sometimes so
just going to give you a couple of
examples of things that I've made that
are kind of about maps but aren't maps
this is a helmet that I regularly where
parts of when I commuted it in at MIT in
and out of school what what does I could
have brought it is that when you're
wearing it it overloads your your
movements with things that help you
mediate the world outside in the world
inside without taking your eyes off the
road or your hands off the wheel and so
when you when you put it on the movement
the little bits of movement the
accelerometer picks up and turns on the
running lights and when you when you
yellow it covers up what you said with
130 decibels orn and when you talk it
goes to the this the bluetooth to your
cell phone and when you do nothing it
plays your mp3 and when you hear a loud
noise outside it actually shuts down
that mp3 and amplifies it and when you
shake your head it records whatever you
said because you've just gone over a
pothole or a curb or had an accident and
so then the next time you go back near
there it's going to say that again and
then of course you can overload that by
doing a shake when you see a really
beautiful piece of architecture you want
to remind yourself to look at again or
maybe this becomes a virtual map maybe
this becomes the information that we're
sharing with everybody and
then maybe you get known for being the
guy that says cool things about that
tells people about those spaces and
maybe we take a picture even I don't
know but certainly the GPS coordinates
are useful we don't take the picture by
the way in this case finally tip in your
heads blinking we also made a postal
truck the Postal Service gave us a
million bucks a year for a few years and
no one else is doing anything so I made
a pot a truck and I put like eight demos
in it was really fun but the one that's
most relevant to this conversation is
you know the postal trucks are runnin
around with about one-fifth capacity
most of the time so what would I put in
that truck well you know it seems to me
that right now I mean isn't there a new
ipod coming out right what if I fill the
truck with the stuff that I expect that
that demographic in that neighborhood
that I'm traveling in as a postal truck
is going to buy and want deliver
tomorrow but I put it in today now I've
on the internet and so I can just like
Amazon can just say hey you know I got
another sucker that wants to pay an
extra ten percent and now I deliver it
today instead of tomorrow and so with
this with this whoops whoops whoops what
happened
my gosh oh oh none of this I didn't mean
any of that's happened there is it gonna
do that again um if it goes forward to
me on so so this map has various
information on what information should
it have on it well here's the map in the
middle of we have six cameras and those
cameras are all around us but but these
but these things are like there's a
hospice guy you know that the Postal
Service guys are like often the first
people to find something is dead what
look at that I bet we'll do it again too
and there's these these these extra
things i could sell what about well
another one of our sponsors was kodak so
I said hey let's put a printer a really
high quality banner printer in the truck
too so the people can download their
pictures and and have them deliver right
away when they take a picture he had a
better quality than they could print at
home and so this is kind of this this
the value of space becomes interesting
and I guess one question is how many
trucks should come to my house a day
maybe none maybe only my car should come
to my house right and it's just when I'm
going through the the UM the smart you
know the smart past place on the freeway
which is you know take my laundry dump
my my groceries in my land my mail and
and so on but the point is that we can
with information we can overload the
value of location in various ways that's
all okay so what are my location dreams
you know I want to know where I am
especially relative to my commitments
and what I really care about
deformations of space happen in my head
I actually am very bad I always find it
a surprise when I look at a real map and
discover that the distances that i
thought was short longer than they were
and the other around
but we do have internal maps that are
that are different and yet the danger to
our memory capabilities of having
deformed things that we look at is that
if we don't have a model for why they're
deformed we get very we can get we can
get lost because orientation and focus
are the number one and two things in all
in all experience in my in my view
overlays and inserts are definitely
tools that we have to work with and in
that macroscope they you know Henry kind
of takes it to to some extremes and you
guys do all sorts of it and we're
talking earlier about how you know when
you put you know neighborhoods of San
Francisco and you use a different font
that's and it kind of and it's
disrespectful of the roads that it's
over it's kind of crosses roads and
stuff so it really is saying I'm not
part of the map I'm about the map and
when you have your user interface stuff
floating outside of it it is not the map
it is it is it is something that can
control the map and so as you think
about all of these things that you
co-locate in this spatial physical space
you have to understand how to
differentiate them and when you're
overloading a person's cognitive
capabilities I mean because you know
it's really a danger if you don't it a
person can't focus can't get oriented
they can't they can't they get they get
just too stressed
and you know this navigation of the
interface is the number one frustration
i have with google maps and that is just
that I I stand as i said minutes a day
trying to get the right resolution on
maps and that debt just shouldn't
shouldn't shouldn't be to me it's an
easier thing to take care of them a lot
of it figures you guys get so right
previews right I'm about to do something
is there a way you can do a little
animation that can give me a feeling of
where I'm going so that I don't make the
mistakes that I that I making so often
you know if I you know if i if i zoom
forward i'm going to get about that
resolution yeah that's what i want i
continue the action so that's that's
that's what cartoons do they'll often go
out on the run off the cliff and they
let in the air for a moment so you know
that they're going to fall right and and
you know if you could actually get
yourself back off the cliff before you
fall that'd be even nicer so what can we
do we can do lots of stuff you know and
obviously you know comparing things is
something people like to do i want to
compare the resources what is it what is
the gas consumption alternatives and and
the cost consumption the cost
differences in the danger differences of
flying driving you know swimming walking
to do something what what is the the
wait time you sometimes it might take a
little bit longer on a bike but i'm
going to get a lot of that exercise
these trade-offs are hard or hard to
come up with the experience differences
that i want to think about you know
what's the efficiency predicted in real
speed and congestion so you know we have
predicted we have predicted traffic
delays and then we have the real ones
we're going to run into we were talking
about some algorithms today that i
thought might even might even
destabilize you know congestion i mean
if you if you get if you give too many
people the same information and they all
do some this is the predicted thing then
you end up with everybody over there
having a problem too so that's going to
be a real
problem as this thing gets more and more
utilized is what is your effect on the
things that you're actually giving
people information about you're not
going to change the weather but you know
things like congestion you might you
know when my brother was saying you know
I he's both a mountain biker and I by
Anna road writer so he loves to know
what the quality of the road is for both
not not to say one's better than the
other but to know which what he's going
to use that path for is he gonna is it a
single track as a double track as it is
it just potholed to the point where you
couldn't ride a rod road bike on it or
is it a lovely place that you could
actually hold a race well certainly you
guys are in a position to do a lot more
you know you I mean when I when I look
at things on craigslist I'm always
wondering how far it is I'm gonna have
to drive and the next click is to go and
figure out how I'm gonna drive there and
that is a big part of how I'm deciding
actually what I'm going to where I'm
going to you know what I'm what
decisions i'm going to make in making
lots of decisions of cost and distance
and time you guys could be exposing your
map technology to various people and in
various processes in various search
situations and i'm sure you guys have
much better ideas about this to me but
it just seems exciting to me too and so
you know it's three o'clock and i guess
what i want to talk about is that you
guys are making the future of tools and
tools are the things that make us more
powerful than we were before we had them
they allow us to do things we couldn't
without them and the real the real
question of how they feel has to be on
some level that they feel like something
that doesn't exist so here i am walking
around on a little more walking and
climbing on a side of a glacier at base
camp at everest but it's trivial because
of the 747 and the yaks and the chrome
molybdenum in the plastic sold boots and
and the carbon fiber of shanks and my
in my in my you know hardened steel ice
axes and the polypropylene there's an
awful lot of stuff making me feel
absolutely naked I mean naked in that I
could just do it effortlessly and that's
that's uh that's kind of what we want to
feel we want to feel that deliciousness
of simplicity and the real question is
how do we teach people to take on new
approaches and make them feel like it's
something they already always could do
and it's so natural that is something
they can't imagine anybody not doing and
I think you guys are in a fat the most
fabulous position of anybody in the
world to make that happen in the
broadest possible possible ways and I
definitely appreciate you guys bringing
me here to talk about those the things
that I that I some of the things I've
done in the mapping area these are just
some of the prototypes I've made over
the last at MIT thank you and I'm not
sure what you were expecting so please
lets us have a conversation yes
area annotations
lighter weight loss
my nap so it's another thing i have to
learn how to use or it's not me
annotating mins okay now how do i get to
it click the my maps to oh ok how do i
know that the mind Apps tab exists and
why is it a different tab oh it's a mode
I understand it's that time that's how i
feel about modes silly for something
later weird yeah I just I mean look you
know I I mean I you know earlier when
they were trying to get me to use my to
use a to use mobile maps I like open
this up and I said cash you know let's
see here's where we are yeah okay like
that's been somewhat related question I
just walked out
always and only the hand yeah close to
you hello I didn't ever notice that it
was closer open if you click it gets
closed so those were introduced so that
because people were discovering on the
ground I see was the glows and open did
that help ok but I it wasn't clear to me
that the that sort of bills I thing I
wasn't sure how what you're suggesting
is going to help people discover to drag
them out well there's a whole lot of
other things that you could you could
discover besides drag the map right
let's see what do I want to do I want to
learn how to zoom we can click a
different clique and we can zoom we can
we can we can pan we can zoom what else
could we want to do at that point we can
want to select we could want to expand
that that little maybe make a map inside
of a map and we can once we have control
over a spa or over space we can probably
overload it with a few interesting
opportunities for for a user that that
learns how to do those so how would that
bullseye thing help to do the holes I is
you have you know you have up and up is
zoom and down is pan and left is left is
a make selection and right is is expand
is make an inset map for example and so
now even before you before you do
anything if you do that gesture it will
do that action and if you don't and you
make and you just do the normal thing
curse around it does that but if you let
it sit for a second up pops this
teaching tool that teaches you that
those that those different options exist
a teaching tool sounds like a good idea
yeah that's that's the dream I mean and
you know i'm not sure that at the level
of granularity I've explained it will
work as well as I and then the final
thing I just want to mention you you
gave an example of overview overview
maps google maps actually has an
overview map we've we've found that
users in general didn't like it didn't
use it much i think is it now turned off
by default I
yeah I think it used to be maximized by
default it's over in the right corner
right now it's often now nobody knows
about though right so you had it for a
reason I bet and that reason was that
somebody sometime enjoyed it and it was
useful for some things what are those
things when is it useful and important
and the you don't really necessarily
wanted popping up and popping away but
you want these these important I mean
you know what I noticed about Google
Maps is everything so much more is there
than I ever would have imagined and I
mean incredible lovely stuff however you
know one question is after you have so
much how do you expose it in a graceful
way and i can't imagine that that
overview is never useful I mean I i well
I don't think it's never used I I like
but I can remember how to turn it on and
turn it off right the problem now is is
discoverability most of the time it's
it's not useful at at least eighty
percent maybe ninety percent of times
now it's probably very useful when a
person has zoomed out the whole world
isn't that a time when you get the guys
obviously lost actually it's useful when
somebody zoomed in and knows there's
another one I bet both of those are
important places to to re to like leave
the last the last the last resolution
you had as a little mark on this
overview thing they'll click on and get
back to where you were I think undo is
incredibly paltry in google maps and i
don't think it's that way because it's
hard for you guys to do it it's hard to
know how to expose it probably and maybe
this is a opportunity to bring back that
wonderful overview map I'm just you know
trying there yeah other thoughts or
questions or things you wanted to think
about
I did sign the NDA
these poor people have been sitting with
me all day they sick of this now
yes yes yes how we are putting more and
more information with layers you talked
earlier about how we are putting more
and more information with layers and
layers and it's all getting very busy do
you have in any good intuition on how we
might be able to selectively turn off
and turn on layers so that people can
browse quicker I mean what I'm imagining
is if I want to go to a restaurant that
is close to a ruler or something in a
particular city I might turn on the
water by layer and the restaurant layer
and find that very quickly as a browsing
action and they seems in general people
are very good at this for instance with
books because the you know you sort of
open a book you flip through pages you
find a figure or an equation that you're
interested in and then you read the text
what's the equivalent for maps and how
do you do that smoothly well I think
that this whole overview issue is one of
those examples of a way of exposing it
and the question of do I have a magic
bullet is going to be the following
thought I was taunting you guys because
you've got those buttons up at the top
that are that are that they're turning
on and off Wikipedia photos and this and
that and you know I can go down there's
a couple couple selections and boy I i'm
sure you've picked exactly all of them
and those user interfaces are going to
stay the same and static forever not
what what those are is there a stab at
doing what you're saying but i think
that the idea of having layers that you
turn on and off is extremely brittle
right can I remember it does it exist it
they still have it in that you I oh now
they've default there to off and I
better go find that place to turn it
back on you know all that no one wants
to do any of that so what you want to be
thinking about is one get having a model
of the user where you kind of have some
intuition that this might be a useful
thing for them now and some graceful way
of exposing the opportunities for things
that are going to
prove their they're going to give them
the richness that they that they're
looking for I mean I spend a lot of time
on a map looking for a street looking
looking at the map I do this on maps
after all I get frustrating i go to the
index i look at it in the index whoops I
find out I'm in the wrong city yeah I'm
talking about a physical map you know i
hopes i have to move over to the next
city ok there there i found it now it
says h3 so then I look over the map and
I realize it's the map on the other side
with h three on this side it's only you
know and right and that dad I'm just
telling you about the process that i go
through in a normal old map think about
all of those misconceptions that I had
as i was making those decisions and
looking at those different layers and
the question is I what I believe is you
guys have something much better than
than what I just described as a user
experience and you know you know that
you always leave your search your search
window open it states that it's maybe
the gospel of google the search window
rules or something but except you have
two or three of them and they're
different and they're well but but I
think that that you know what are those
Gospels how do you expose the things
gently and and and you know one of their
ideas that's that's why I talked about
that pi minus by the way they work they
work up to about 12 you know after 12
you know you got to do other things but
you know there's there's a symmetry that
people remember that's a good thing and
we can start loading in in what are the
things that people are good at
perceiving recognizing responding to and
how do we not use up all the visual real
estate there were some other things that
I forgot to tell you about a couple of
those maps that were about time and you
can even expose some things about time
on maps so I think that you know you're
just going to start making a list of
what what are the priorities of these of
the of the information a person needs in
what situation and can you tell whether
they're in that situation or not if you
can party on and if you can't well that
you've got more difficult situation
and if that's a reasonable answer the
other option is to I'm going and mapping
this to something completely different
that I built for myself that I use a lot
which is up when I go look at a web page
that is very complex I often want to
filter out content so I will find a
thing on the page and then ask my
environment to show me all the other
things on that page that have the same
CSS class and that's again a notion of
layering information so you could go
back and apply this to the map and for
instance point at something on the map
and say show me the layer that contains
this and everything else like it and
that would be an intuitive way of
discovering layers I don't know how well
that would work for a user who can see
I'm just guessing happening yeah would I
put on the screen right now is just this
was a menu search system that we made
where the priority of the results that
came back were layered and and higher
and higher contrast and and also
overlapping each other to to to
highlight them and there are variety of
techniques you can use but I think that
this this this notion you're talking
about of filtering is inevitable on some
level right it's you know and and we
have to understand how to do it and I
think one of the crucial things that
will probably save save your ass is undo
right you get rid of stuff how do you
get it back you know what I'm do so easy
it doesn't every it doesn't have a lot
of healer to remember where and how you
just you just kind of run in the other
direction and that that seems like a lot
easier than some things and I don't know
why people don't use undo more in user
experiences they used to not do it
because of course it was expensive
computationally and and memory wise but
these days you know
any other comments or questions
