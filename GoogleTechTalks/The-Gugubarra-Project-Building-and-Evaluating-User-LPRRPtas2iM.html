profiles glad communities she's our
modeling some of the things you are very
much thank you so I good afternoon
actually the name of the university is
good I'm not German but good is a big
thing in Germany because he is a famous
poet and writer in the back in a few
years ago before I start the
presentation I'd like to give you may be
a very brief background information of
who I am so that you get like a
perspective of the reason why I started
to do this work as the background I have
more than 20 years of computer science
background in databases I spent a lot of
research in particular an object
databases back in the 1890s object
database actually did not really make it
in the market but we did a lot of
research on the area in in the meanwhile
i also had for 10 years a company where
i was calling the company and we did
actually some business in conferences
and trade shows we come this year in the
state so i was often in boston back in
Europe but the reason why I mention it
because we had a lot of websites that
we've been designing and using it for
e-commerce like selling conferences or
trade shows so I became very exposed to
using websites for a business reason and
when I close down the company a few
years ago then I I want to do something
different than simply do we continue
doing research in database and with
diverse small group of researchers in
Franco your six all together and we
wanted to do something on using web
technology for helping owners or
websites whatever the reason why you
have a website and we came up with this
project called Google bara 2.0 which is
an attempt to create tools for building
and managing profile of web users
but the name is actually something funny
they are is a bird in Australia and the
idea is to create tools helping the
owner website to understand better the
interest of their user the assumption
that you have to be registered to a
website so you are willing to give your
information your profile and it must be
a reason why you are registered on this
website and you own a might have a
business reason why has this website and
we build a user profile for each user if
you are not providing the work we do is
no of interest because we are now able
to then track your interest so what is
the goal the goal is to give the owner a
website a tool that you can customize in
with parameters to understand better the
suppose the interest of a user on the
website there could be also be useful
for qualifying better the members of the
community so what we do we are actually
creating a profile for each registered
user and we collecting the profile now
only the obvious information the one you
are already giving us like a name or
address but also we try to understand
what you're done on the website and we
analyzed some of the action you do or
the pages that you look at the duration
but at the same time and this would be
like traditional clickstream but we also
ask the user for a feedback so the the
enormity part of building this profile
on one side we look at the user behavior
on the website at the same time we also
asking this the feedback and then we
compare what you've done on the website
and what you told us and we recalculate
the way the profile take into account
the difference between what you are
doing on the website and the feedback
and then you have a bunch of let's say
you have a minyan user on a website and
it
someone has a session and you calculate
the profile maybe one or two times per
session you have a lot of numbers and
then it's very difficult to do something
with all the numbers then when we try to
cluster user with similar profile so
that we can show more visually classes
of user that are sharing some kind of
common interest so we cluster on profile
not only stream now why you want to do
that you know there might be a lot of
reason and I didn't want to cast on a
particular reason so you have a website
you're the owner why you have a website
and without your business goals or
social goals you know and that's
perfectly fine if you want to know more
about your user then the profile could
be interested in for me these are some
of the reason why you might want to have
a profile for the user and and we are
not really bound to any of them I just
want to go a little bit off from the
website because I got actually a couple
of interesting ideas by going to place
it there nothing to do the website in
particular if I go to a supermarket
everybody goes to a supermarket nowadays
I find it kind of interesting similarity
between what's going on in a supermarket
and possibly what's going on our website
this is like I think is a French
supermarket now if you think of a
supermarket sometimes she will go to
special location and in such the
location you find something like for
example here you will be interesting why
you get wine if you're interested in
need you go here this is like a French
version of the midsection now if you
don't want to cook you go to the frozen
food section and you find something
there you might be more unhealthy food
you grow fruit and vegetables and these
are the areas in the supermarket where
you find content sometimes you don't
find the content because the supermarket
is somehow complicated to search what
you're doing a supermarket well if I
will have a camera
and I will be able to track down what
you're doing a super much you do all
kinds of things in the supermarket for
example on going back to the fruit and
vegetable section I can look at tomatoes
intensively for five minutes or I can
touch the tomatoes and see whether the
tomato is ripe I can take the tomato and
put it back I can take it to make on
weighted tomato and see how happy the
tomato or I can take it tomato or a
bunch of tomato in the plastic bag and
put in my in my whatever I'm carry in
the Superman doing a lot of things in
the supermarket in particular section
for example in the wine section i'm
actually going get the bottle and check
on the date and another particular
information like fun so i take the
bottle i look in it will get back and
look at the price and stuff like that so
thats a lot of activity is going on in
the supermarket anytime you do something
you show something or yourself beside
that I don't know who you are you could
be a kid following your mom and you take
him the bottle of wine but you don't
really want to buy you could be actually
the father that's really interested in
buying the bottle of wines so there's a
little bunch of things that can happen
in a supermarket and each of this guy is
actually doing something differently and
similar and he sure is some kind of
pattern of behavior that could be
interesting to analyze location are done
in a supermarket where you try to put
products so they have some little
similarity but location on are always
the same I don't know about here but in
for example in Germany which is actually
sad but close to the cash you put all
the products that are actually very
relevant for example I don't know
definitely known United States but in
Germany will be very surprised when you
go to the cash to pay on top of the cash
up cigarettes that's actually amazing so
you go to the cash you can't miss the
cash because to get out of the
supermarket you have to leave the
supermarket for the cash
and then you have all the cigarettes you
pay a lot of money to put the cigarettes
there and somehow the law allows you to
do is so the interesting finger you are
a little kid and you're exposed to
cigarettes so location in supermarket
are kind of a specific and the content
you put into location actually very
important you can put something very
expensive or you can put something not
very expensive in the corner of a
supermarket where maybe people that
don't go very often and on top of that
why you go to a supermarket well it
depends it depends who you are you can
pay something but not necessary you can
go to supermarket because you are with
somebody else and you don't pay anything
but you touch a lot of things so at the
end of the day for example the action I
finally pay of course Paula faiz the
buyer but what you've done before you
know was a you know an expression of the
interest of what you done in supermarket
now this is what happened to me when I
go to a supermarket I was very
interesting when I went to the cafeteria
I'm first time at Google but I used to
work at IBM here in in the valley I was
at the EMA almaden more than 20 years
ago and the cafeteria there was very
nice but was very different here here
you have a very dynamic cafeteria where
people do all kinds of things and for me
the cafeteria similar to a supermarket
some more you touch you you do things
and you don't pay but at the end of the
day you might take some food or not so
the question is where all these
customers and how do I know what they
want well I can track what they do but
that's the only one part of the story
because I'm all sauce the feedback you
know and and get to learn from them what
they think is their interest and then
try to compare you what what actually
they do so that's the starting point and
going back to a website we wanted to
offer a cow toolset that you can
parameterize and customize depending on
your needs so that's what we wanted to
do something that is not bound by
particular strategy and offer it to the
owner
and we call it non-obvious profile
because that's a non-obvious part of the
profile of a user and we use parameters
so with this we can combine with the
chosen parameter deploy a strategy for
managing these profiles and again the
profile is done in two parts looking at
what you do and asking you a feedback a
very brief history on the project we
started late in 2004 in my group in
Frankfurt and we did the first type
prototype we will call it google barra
1.0 just to show the idea we presented a
couple see beat trade shows and now we
are reengineering the whole thing in
google bara 2.0 we are at a design phase
and we will start some kind of
implementation in parallel so we also
are mostly interesting to learn what
kind of feedback you might have so how
does it work in least in our approach
each user should have a profile the goal
of the thing is that it is visible it is
known there should be a reason why user
is registered and it should be a reason
why a user and the owner website do
share a profile if it's not reason you
don't use it then that's not the point
the profile are for the moment beam is
only visible to the user but nothing for
be said this part of the profile could
be visible to the community I got the
feedback doing one of my presentation I
we didn't think about it but he could
actually show part of the profile not in
the name but the behavior part also to
the rest of the community that could be
like community driven again so and the
idea is try to understand the interest
it's a super user so the thing is i'm
the owner of the website i define the
topics that are related to my website in
our approach for the moment mate is a
static list the pages can be dynamically
created there is no problem but I should
be able to list the topics that related
to the website for example I can have a
website with
do we product people support news in
different parts and the user profile is
calculated dynamically every time you do
something on the page and when you give
a Fiddler's whether it is automatically
triggered by an action or because you
want to do it explicitly and then we try
to class the similar profile why you
want to cluster because then you can
actually show trends for example five
percent of the community as an increase
interest in a particular topic we buy
ten percent as a decrease interested in
two or three topics all the time and
something like that it could be useful
also to analyze the behavior a community
when you introduce a new service you
know before introduce a new service you
try to analyze the behavior pattern of
people so whether we get the data we are
at the behavior from the log files
generated by the web server but then we
combine it with the FIBA which is given
by the user so to be more specific here
if you look at the website a bunch of
pages and each page is some content that
you have actually created you know what
is the content and you know about the
the specific of the content and all
other pages are the same you know for
example you can have an area up there
where you don't really put anything
significant and the real important
information may be in this part of the
website or vice versa you can perform
action you can download something you
can feel the form you can pay where you
can simply click on the link and
something like that so now all the extra
not the same at least from the owner
perspective so here is a point we take
that's the first type prototype I give
you a very brief introduction the first
prototype and then I'll go further on on
the the new prototype in the first
implementation we were very naive we
started saying well I have a bunch of
pages and I define a number of topics
related to this page and for each toppy
the owner gives the weight and the
weight is just the number between 0 and
10 are no interest in one very
interesting from the owner perspective
now from the user perspective so in
other words I can have a bunch of pages
for example on Java but in one
particular page is maybe the
introductory information so it's not
very heavy so I put a very low mark
whereby if you click from there in other
page where maybe this coding or
something much more involved I will put
their higher weight because for me who
ever spend time on that page is for me
more relevant for me as the owner I will
then infer that if you spend time on the
second page you might be an expert in
job where we least somebody that is more
interested in Java so for me as the
owner of website when I define a website
I yes I put topic or in content on the
website but I know why I have laid the
layout I might have a teaser that people
come and read something but it's not
really the focus on my interest so i
define for each page topics and then a
weight now the first prototype was very
easy because what we did we look at each
time a user was done only the page a
page at the list of topics the list the
topic of a wait there was between 1 &amp;amp; 0
&amp;amp; per session we were basically
computing your interest by looking at
the duration so if this is the set of
topics on a particular page then you
will multiply by the duration you stay
on that page and then you normalize it
but a durational page is to get the
number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 very naive for a
number of reason why is now if because I
can spend two hours on a page it doesn't
really mean that I'm actually doing
something interesting on that page I
can't sleep I can go to the toilet come
back I spent an hour on that page on top
of that the page is very big maybe I'm
only interested in the last corner
there is something on a particular topic
and I really have nothing to do with the
rest of the page but since I created the
page and they put a lot of weight on on
one part of the page and I'm in firming
an interest that you don't have but that
were very easy to demonstrate it so
there were a lot of limitation on this
approach it was page base and of course
you know sometimes you really want to
see the parts of the page it was no
action base so I was not taking to
account any action you do on the website
but only the duration the duration is
not an indication that you are
interested and so in the second
prototype we introduced notional zones
and action and try to mitigate the
duration with action plus the feedback
so that's the second party knowing in
the design of our new system we are
introducing console I zones topics
action topic in action and weight and
again the user feedback so I'm only
focusing on the new prototype the first
idea is that when you go to a website
know all the pages are the same so I can
define a location in the website which
is a composition of parts of the page
several pages and we call it a zone it
could be set up pages a set of parcel
within the page a set to pass the server
pages any combination of and the zone as
a free states if it's on it will be used
in the calculation of the profile if
he's off it will not be used in the
calculation the profile and the first
state is is only used if you do an
action on that page so this is an
example this is like a map 24 is a
British equivalent of a calculating
route and if you see this page on the
top you have a banner with advertisement
broadband on the left on the left part
you really have the part which is really
here this website which is calculating
route and the search and on this part
you have a bun
shiva advertisement here is the wrong
company but that's the British come okay
and as a marketing so when I define this
website whatever the reason I don't know
the reason I don't know if they make
money on this website and how but
definitely the layout has been different
so for example let's assume the owner of
this website I create free zone the one
on top I'm on the left and one here so
how the topic now fits they don't fit
into pages anymore they fit into zones
that's a different with the first
prototype topic asleep redefine but now
they are associated to zones so I can
have the same topic spanning through
different pages or vertical horizontal
and again I have a weight so the
interesting thing now is i can define
the weight of a topic in different
location so if i go back to this example
here that's the first page on top and
you see that this i defined for example
five zones the first song ji-won is
actually the banner part of both pages
and then i have a specific zone z2 will
have the request for filling the form
for the calculation and the result is
this page where you actually give all
the details of the route and the map but
here you don't see in this in this
snapshot but you also have here
information on relevance of hotels that
are located in this area the the idea of
this order website I think it was rather
clear I'm trying maybe to have the guy
who's interested in this map to click in
hotel and maybe book it and maybe I get
a percentage out of this book but I
don't know exactly but that could be no
business reason for that now what I do
with this website i define the list of
topics for example in my example here
five and they listed over there
broadband find the location calculating
house insurance and hotels and then I
associated the relevant topic to the
zone for example z1 is only broadband
because i only put our advertisement and
broadband but maybe for me this is not
very important so you see broadband is
0.5 wait it's a medium interest but if
you look at the zone z2 somebody that
goes there and does in action there it
will be finding a location in
calculating route 0.60 it is rather high
but if you actually do fill this form
and you end up here and you do something
here before finding the location and
calculating route are actually higher in
value because you actually did
calculator out so you're interesting
name the service and calculating route
is definitely high for me now this is
topic in zones now will be done in the
second prototype we are looking at the
action you do in the zone now on the
pages in the zone action or global so
you need to tell me as an order what
kind of action you interested you define
a set of action that are applicable to
the website and you put again a weight
which is the indication how important is
this action for the owner of the website
and again it depends on now on the
reason why you have a website if the
website is actually commerce were buying
is a very important action you will put
a very high number but if you don't sell
anything and for you only it you know
the website is just a community where
you want people to come back and be
happy and maybe every time it download
the file is a success you will put a
very high weight on that so again you
have a definition of action you put the
relevance to the other side which is a
bit surprising and then you look at what
the people do is an example
my defined for action a page request
which is always there send the value
because I feel the for if I click Lee go
out on the website is different if I
click and stay but in this example the
really important action for me is the
sand value when I calculate the route
and I put the higher value free which
means for me is the most important
actually you can do all my website in
that particular zone and i asserted head
to zone so you could actually have an
action in another location as a
different weight which is reflected that
action our context sensitive so and we
calculated the the profile by looking at
the action i'll show you in a minute and
looking at the action you do on in each
zone and the duration you spend at the
same time we are also combining this
feedback mechanism so that you can then
compare what we think is your interest
to what the people say when i asked for
feedback the user will be actually asked
to either confirm or change the value in
the profile but we don't right over the
profile we compute the different and we
call it a this different will be used
for a so called dear I profile and you
can actually set up your own rules that
are like a script if the different is
high or is more or is an average you do
something with this deer I profile and
then you can use this / for recalculate
any for the next profile for example you
can detect people that are consistently
telling something completely opposite of
what they do and then have it like a
classification or like that so the
feedback is a way to learn and compare
what you're done with what you do and we
don't question the feedback so we just
think we take it as an information
but since the feedback obviously as any
impact on the profile we try to mediate
between what you tell me and what you do
and that's the way we do it so now I'm
going to be more in detail now we
calculate the profile so for ever use of
the profile the part that we calculated
by looking at what you do is looking
it's done in two parts it's an action
profile so what you do in the zone and
the duration profile so how long you
stay on a page the action profile is on
the action on the zone that could be
several pages we buy the duration
profiles on pages and the pitch can have
several zones in it since the racial and
action are like two parts of the story
and which one is more important is not
clear we give a parameter where the
owner can actually decide the influence
of duration and action in the
calculation of the profile and it's done
in this way if action is that one on the
left and duration is here we multiply
part by two constant so that if I want
to have a mix between duration and
action in the relevance on the
calculation of the profile I can tune a
and B of course if a is one there is
only the actually important or if d is
one is on it a duration if both of them
are 0.5 is a balance but I might
actually decide that duration is the
other relevant for me and I put maybe
0.8 relevance on action so every time
somebody does in action on my website
this is taking more into account and
duration expense on the website you
could actually changes by analyzing the
community and then try to experiment
with this number now the action profile
works as well as I do an action on on on
my website first question is where so I
need to define what is the zone in my
website where i did this section that
says on cool i have an action this
action is related to his own and he has
a weight that i gave and this is
basically this parameter then i multiply
this value which is by the sum of all
the ways for all our correction in this
zone and in order to normalize it we
calculate the sum of all the zones where
an action occur and the associate top
the list contained a particular topic of
interest divided by the sum of all or
collection ways and it looks like that
and at the end of the day I get a number
between 0 and 1 which is basically
telling me the relevance of the
important of the action you're done in
on the website at the same time the
duration profile still works on pages
the problem we have it in when I
download the page now I have a
bachelor's owns there but I cannot
really know how much time you're I were
on its own because there's no way I can
do that I can only say how much time you
spend on a page so I'm back to the
calculation of duration per page and the
page is associated to topics but the
topics are now embedded into zones and
the only thing i can do you see there is
to compute the time you spend on the
page look at the weight of the topics
you see how we do and then normalize it
by the total duration I spend on in the
old section on the website and I guess
that we normalize again between 0 and 1
and then I combine together if you
remember and this would be the numbers
that i have in my profile so each user
has a profile that is a list of topics
with numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 1 calculated
between action and and duration problem
is that since we introduced it zones and
the durations on pages we were facing
the property now i have a page download
it but
bunch of zones so I had to come up with
what are the topics of this page the
topic of the page are the topic of the
zones but there's on a different at
different weights so we came up with
some kind of your risk here and I said
well you can decide with rules which one
you want to take you can say I scan the
entire page they look out the zone and
for every time I have a same topic with
different value I take the maximum value
well take the minimum order the average
why can exclude zones that are not
sensitive in my calculator so I'm trying
to reconstruct the idea of a topic list
per page at this time assemble by the
zones of course you know each community
behaves differently so i need to be able
as the order to customize my strategy by
choosing parameters and the parameters
the following set in the topics /
content the ways defining which section
are relevant in my website and put in a
weight turning the states of the zone
all off and using the strategy for
calculating the weight of the topic
within the page out of the zones and
then I Crean numbers and I can monitor I
can you know the strategy depends when
you want to recalculate the profile you
have a profile where you can see the
user jaw if for example has an increase
interest in Java or decrease interested
in Eclipse and so forth and now it comes
the feedback because I can ask the user
to give me a feedback the fever is I
look at the web at the profile it I
confirm the number or I give different
numbers and now what we do we don't take
your feedback as a starting point for
the profile we don't because we don't
know the meaning of this feedback we
compute so if not is a profile at time T
I ask for feedback or you give me a
fever and then I calculate the
difference between the profile I
calculated and the fever you gave me
that's an information if I go in time I
can monitor you may be a time later and
i have another profile i can calculate
the difference between what you done
before and what you don't know i can
still ask for feedback can i calculate
the different but i can even calculate
the difference between your feedback so
in other words i am able to measure all
of these differences now what are the
world these differences no Andy is a
different of your behavior that i
calculate it myself d is a difference
between what you do and what you tell me
and FD is basically the diff between
what you tell me in the past and will
tell me now of course you can even
combine cross different what we do we
have a scripting language where the
owner can decide to create rules for
then calculating the deer I profile
based upon these numbers the analogy
always use is you're a pilot in order to
fly an airplane and have a bunch of
tools in the cockpit that gives you the
altitude that you mean it in whatever
the tools don't tell you what to do but
they basically assuming you have an
automatic pilot system the pilot will
say ok I set the rules say if the
altitude goes down a certain threshold I
will do something and here the same
thing for example you could say well if
somebody is changing mind and it keeps
on giving me different feedback am I
classified this guy is it behaviorally
inconsistent in the way tells me or on
top by checking what you do he seems to
be in stable I can then look at the
vertical and set the person is tell me
something completely different in what
he does what does it mean I don't know
but I just wanted to that and it's
consistent in time then I can just
somehow try to turn into a meaning for
example if the diff between will you
tell me what you do is
very high I can infer for example that
you're not very happy or your reason to
be on our website is a different one day
will you tell me no matter what it is I
came money today I can check it so
that's basically the numbers now the
thing is that i have a bunch of numbers
at the end and it's very difficult to do
something with numbers because i have
you know number between zero and one
maybe medium people and medium profile
recalculating in time and very difficult
to understand what's going on unless i
look at one particular guy Joe and I
kissed most spot this profile in time
then it's okay but if I want to know if
Joe is doing something similar to others
the only way is to try to cluster they
behavior what I think is a behavior by
looking at the profile which is this
combination so you know I clickstream
clustering like a traditional thing is
the clustering on the profile so we are
clustering now on the profiles that we
are combining with the feedback
clustering we are not expel on
clustering so we try to see whether we
could use something already out there by
clustering the profile we realize that
if you use classical clustering
algorithm means they go out of scale as
soon as you have five topics and more
than 10 user so we try to adapt our own
clustering mechanism we invented one
what we don't claim that this is the
best to try to have a cluster which
scales because the thing is what are the
factors here number of topics and number
of visitors well and he has to be able
to cluster so that the end is reasonable
the time to recompute the classes so we
come up with something i'll be happy to
a feedbag now we have a paper on that
there can be a downloaded from our
website and we try to adopt a cluster by
priority algorithm where we don't take
all the topless into consideration but
only the one a certain priorities so we
try to reduce
the the work of the algorithm to a
septum setting a septum threshold so
that he can scale up and we did some
little experiment on that and it's
promising with the idea that I'm trying
to visualize and the visualization is
also a very difficult part use it with
some similarity for example if I take to
win to user let's say oh USA you seven I
might come up and said they have a
little interest in Java why do I said
that because in the course of the
profile the action the duration of what
they did on my website and their
feedback combined came up with numbers
that are maybe below a certain threshold
0.3 for example we by this user Bob at
absolutely no interest in Java Mimi
didn't do any action on the website he
didn't spend any time or very little
time on any page we have to do java so i
put them there but by this guy maybe did
a specific action maybe download code
and cold downloading cold and spending
time on there was a very high weighted
action and therefore I put them there
now in this case Ellis is on a whole but
if two people have done similar pattern
then I could cluster them and say well
if I have a community of the seven user
the people that I'm focusing are the one
who have at least some interested in
Java then I can get these two guys and
that guy and I don't want to look at the
rest see the cluster will Devoy that you
look a million people now what you want
to do it you can choose a domain you can
find minions of domains where there's a
reason why you want to cluster people
and depending on the reason this could
help you to classify now if this is
actually on time then your trends this
could be now snapshot now like a week
later my community has completely
changed people are disappearing from
Java so what happened I don't know but I
came monitor that something's happening
in my community
my website what you do is another story
but at least I can have a feeling I
what's going on and that's all you know
exercise of doing this project here if
you as I say if you're interested on
class then there'll be more than happy
to send you more detail and we're not
really expedient clustering so any class
they ugly from the work very fast on a
buncha number would be very happy to use
it I like to finish what if somebody is
any interesting on implementation have a
few let's say additional slides on on
implementation but to make it short the
most if you have any question I want
topic that is actually interesting to me
a list which is likely not really
technical it's not really very technical
but when you're talking about profile I
think you are some are in trouble by
definition because the idea that you are
creating a profile to a user is always
very scary think of somebody who go to a
supermarket and you create a profile
what years done or he has touch melhem
two times today oh he has spent five
minutes on tomatoes and then you know
and you infer that this guy is a
vegetarian or at least he has a lot of
interest on on veggie he didn't look at
the midsection so I don't know if he's
vegetarian or no but definitely is
interesting in him fruit and vegetable
and I recorded this information and now
this is tour we use the database like a
db2 and this store how would you feel
about it well I think it the ole idea of
profiling has been captured and you guys
also did some interesting rules for what
I call business code no data protection
security and stuff for that I think this
is a very important issue there's one
area that I don't think it is not
mentioning any let's say computer
science presentation like all is social
maybe you'll be very surprised to hear
from me but I think it ultimately what
we are doing by looking at the profile
of
people is to have them coming back which
if you look at marketing and say this is
a good thing I'm really stick time
stickiness to my website I think it is
also an issue that we should be aware is
to what extent this coming back becomes
an addiction I know it look at least
sounds very strange but it would be good
to understand to what extent the
technology becomes a platform for
addictive behavior it's not that the
platform makes the addiction but it's
actually addicted people that can use so
that's why I wanted to conclude no not
technical by avoiding this thickness
become sickness or repeat it becomes
addictive I'm actually earlier than
expected I have some more information on
implementation but I'd be happy to take
questions no I'm because that's last two
slides of the presentation yes what
we've done is in the first
implementation which is destroy we use
it on a small community project based 50
pages our website and the community of
60 people that are using this website a
regular base and what we did is we try
to see how to implement the zones now to
implement the zones we have two
possibility conceptually you could take
a website that is already existing and
try to infer from the website the
content and define the zones and that's
what we did we basically look at a
website and you know the you get the
page on the web server and then manually
unfortunately for the moment being you
try to understand what is the content of
the website define the topic define the
zones those are created in a way that
you need to know the last data
modification of the page and the idea of
each element and then you create your
a database of zone and elements in a db2
that's what we do is actually the good
thing about it that you can actually use
it on any website because it's not
really done by you in theory you could
actually incorporate in a content
management system with a little bit of
extension and then design your website
already with the zone and so the
experiment we done are actually at the
moment still on a small scale I mean the
great challenge he also for the class
turn if i have a annoyed a portal and i
have a minion user and then each user
span a session lasell or minutes and is
repeated now what does it mean and
that's basically the things that we are
very much interested because at the end
of the day is only by doing some
intelligent data mining this number you
can actually come up with something
useful because it would be very unlikely
that you look at one particular person
because you want to see
yes we are doing a bunch of feedback
from when I say something of your users
yes did you ever try to consider the
difference between a few
and then actual profile is an error and
use machine learning approaches to
adjust the history of these connections
to minimize it sir that's a very good
question because that's what i call 15
rules in reality you can even have a
logic system that automatically given
certain rules you program define the
dear I profile depending on the
differences for example let's assume
where you denote that there's a more
than fifty percent of the feedback is
different significant from the original
one then you could do something or only
ten percent of the feedback is different
than other one then you do something
else basically what you could actually
come up is the root system then
depending on your business rules you
could then create a dear I profile
accordingly for example let's assume it
I'm not really interesting with people
that constantly I tell me something
completely different than what they do
so nineteen ninety percent of what they
tell me is completely different I don't
I'm not interested I can program it the
diet basically clustered them in a in a
in an area which I'm not interested
maybe I'm very interested in this guy
that the very consistently say eighty
percent of what they tell me is
consistent to what they do and I fuck
with all those guy well maybe that's not
the case and so yes you know any that's
a intelligence system they would take
this number and do it a business rule
with that would be good but I'm only
producing numbers that's basically what
I do
yes people healthcare see cosmos where
it is relevant market too heavy yeah
they're Japanese insider man is related
yes so maybe they assigned amended
decided mr. decide to people's habits i
have another prophet maybe you can
change their someone's then yeah that's
actually be like having a assistant that
learns from the community and adjusted I
think he's all possible he is only a
matter of what kind of priority you put
on there I mean but that's a good
observation in particular I would say
when the profile becomes public to the
community he could even be that the
community is influenced by Oh eighty
percent of my friends have an increased
interested in Java in the last week I am
sure that this has an impact on your
behavior or eighty percent of the people
have a decrease interest on topic in the
last week why now maybe you're still
interested on the topic but i think it
this is influencing that the community
so i think is in both ways it could be
that the system learns so you can adjust
your weight as the owner but it could
also be that the community evolves and
this is an arid i think is very
interesting we didn't have any time to
look at her and he also goes a bit into
the social network things because
especially with the web 2.0 now the
community is influencing much more than
before my stabbing point was never a
typical website i do the content the guy
calm wants to get something back and he
might get something that is looking for
or not with a web 2.0 and the community
thing I think it this creates a
completely different dynamic there could
be an interesting very interesting area
to look at so i take it also added the
other part because if a profile is
visible to the community there is
definitely an impact on the people as a
poster if each individual profile is
only visible to the user and the owner
yes yes
we're not trying to understand if it's
right or wrong that's the thing we don't
try to give a meaning I'm only
monitoring them the feedback you give me
is different than what you do I don't
try to press them or you could do is to
try to see on the scale of all users
whether this is a pattern I'm sure that
if you see the eighty percent of your
community seems to be telling you
something completely different than what
they do that must be something long gone
home either your website has another
meaning to them or maybe this community
is not the community that you trust but
this is your interpretation I don't come
up with any room for them but you can
come up with your own rooms and stay
well learn it because that's a number
that you can do action with a community
but I stop there because any attempt for
me to cast it symantec would be wrong I
believe at least as pulled up to the
starting point
more questions or criticism or if you
see anything that also doesn't seem to
make sense in a please let me know
because I'm very interested
another
let's assume by you design a website and
you have a reason for this website you
know values I don't know necessarily is
people content on the website and you
have your reason to structure the
website way content and allow me to do
certain acts on the website for reaching
your goals little way at one point yes
yes correct I think he somehow is a way
to qualify the user in relation to your
goals so if your goal is for example
that you want as many people as possible
to download free material the more
people do that the more they are close
to the kind of user profile you really
would like to have yes yes buying it
would be the obvious yeah any more
questions well if not then thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
