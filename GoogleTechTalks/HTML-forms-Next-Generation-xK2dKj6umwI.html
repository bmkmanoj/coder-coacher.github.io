dave is a w3c fellow with a world wide
web consortium and has been involved in
a number of a past technology efforts
including HTML XHTML math ml voice ml
multimodal interactions and is is
looking at ways of making the ubiquitous
web more real thank you so I'll turn it
over to Dave to talk to you about web
web based replacements for spreadsheets
and simple forms okay good so sorry
about the little difficulties here I
it's always an issue somehow the screen
resolutions and things cause problems
and I hadn't expect that because I came
here and give talk about a year ago and
it just worked fine this is one of the
things that we're trying to address
through work on the biggest web which is
new work we're trying to launch a
doubletree see at the very disparate
moment and the idea of being able to
make easy to build distributed web
applications involving much wider range
of devices so that means you will never
have to worry about plugging your
computer in so long as its network just
built to drive the projector remotely
hello today I'm going to talk about work
is going on a double Creasy renewed work
on forms and this is something that I
was involved in the early 90s very early
stages I've been working on a project HP
Labs on a system for putting together
quotations for HP's workstations and and
from that we've heard about some work
going on in the CERN and Tim berners-lee
his work early days of the web and this
back in 92 I flew out there and got
involved early work on standardization
of HTML and took some the ideas we'd had
from this auto process order quotation
system and that led to these discussions
with folks and on a mailing list the
Timmer set up to the the early work on
forms which then came rolled out through
the mosaic browser so what's even going
from here
else get home alone so the timber
honestly came up the proposal for for
the web back in 89 and I guess that them
to have rolled out as something people
could try out in 1990 so that's kind of
this the first version of HTML HTML one
you can call it is very very crude it
did have one kind of form like featuring
it called is index and the ideas he used
this demo to be able to type in
somebody's name and then query I think
it was there's a certain phone database
or something like that and so I came at
him with all these sorts of ideas about
how we could do rich more could a
interesting visual much more
feature-rich forms and and then with the
pre discussions of mindless lots of
people involved that led eventually to
the forms we had in near the mid-90s for
the HTML to an HTML 32 and then again in
the mid-90s WEC got involved as setting
up a standardization group and we had
the that led to the work on HTML for
which the kind of forms we've got today
see if this works yeah so at that time
the standardization what was all moving
pretty quickly you can see from the
dates here and we then started thinking
about what do we do next so Stephen
Pemberton and I organized a workshop and
goes to some hotel near the airport here
and the future of HTML and then it was
quite strong backing as a two day
workshop a lot of strong mapping for
trying to move the web across to xml run
away from tagged soup and sort of do
forms and a more structured in it to
more grown-up kind of a business kind of
version of forms and that work was later
spun off into a new working group which
did develop the excellence proposals and
then the XHTML peered is the xml version
of HTML and nappin was where things were
for several years and then back in two
thousand four adobe hosted a workshop on
a web applications compound documents
and they're kind of rumblings of
discontent people are feeling what maybe
all this work on the xml verse
HTML knew it was all very well but
wasn't really meeting the dresses of
day-to-day requirements of existing web
developers and after that workshop this
little sprinter group formed called the
Wat working group and I'm just going to
the next slide so I'm going to sort of
bring all these threads together as I go
along so HTML XML has been a huge
success but not actually really on the
desktop as such so the point of issues
was the work on sort of trying to
migrate HTML on to XML is more a
question of like how did can we do that
hardly around people start using that on
existing browsers and it wasn't really
especially compelling to make people
make the jump and I think we failed to
really get all our eggs in the right
class kid or might not right phrase but
the idea being that you want to make it
much more compelling by using compound
documents you can use a mixture of
different kind of tag sets and have a
much more flexible structure for the web
so that work has taken a lot lot longer
than people expected work and compound
document formats this is still coming
together I guess we should have taken a
who should have been aware of this after
all Apple's work on was it got the name
Apple went through all this stuff many
years ago and they had lots of problems
too so that we should have been aware so
we've had seen this demand for a nude
work or on a Texas HTML or that of a tag
soup both by some of the browser
developers and also writes with HTML
evangelists and a very active blog
entries a few months back so these has
been calling for kind of incremental
improvements not revolution but just
minor evolutionary steps from
maintaining htmls is today this not say
you shouldn't carry on working on a much
bigger more powerful version of X HTML
and XML tomorrow but you have to keep
maintaining an existing product line
essentially the story so this is a
direct reese's responded to this you're
about we've been going through our
talking to our members about charters
and things and I think we're the point
now where very next few days we'll be
announcing like
like the new working groups and the new
charters and quilt dissipations there
has been much more open process than
before we've published the charters and
explanation explanatory documents about
this so the basic idea is there's going
to be a new HTML working group that
focuses purely on evolving incremental
evolving it tag soup and HTML and the
idea is to provide two equivalents
civilizations of that so you can either
serialize it as HTML or you can
serialize it as XML and the I did the
idea being that make it easy for tools
who's a lot of service our tools are
based on XML and then you end up having
deliver it as HTML work on HTML to XHTML
to will continue separately and the four
months working group will continue to
work on X forms and there will be some
kind of task force which will be a cross
between the forms group and the HTML
group and the idea is to be is inclusive
as possible so that is do the work on
HTML and the work on this HTML forms as
much as possible in public because
that's another one at the pieces input
we got so in order to see what the
internal changes are ispeth worth
visiting again with the HTML for forms
this is an incomplete summary but you
know it's like we're so HTML forms have
been extremely important for the web
they've acted kind of interactivity
which has made a lot of business
applications possible so we have markup
for a variety of kind of form controls
it's not totally inclusive the work we
had in the early 90s we're talking about
wider range of controls and some of
these controls have been discussed
example in the what working group but
they didn't kind of meet the consensus
of the existing browser developers and
that in the mid-90s like Microsoft and
Netscape in particular so we didn't see
things like sliders and bit controls and
things at that time and then of course
one does advantages one of the features
in the mid-90s was to focus on
accessibility in the web accessibility
initiative dog 3c and so there are a
number of features in HTML for which
they're primarily for accessibility and
including labels label element that's
one of the design mistakes you made in
the early 90s we didn't do labels
properly and so feels can be associated
labels and there's also a pretty wolf
more flexible object model the scripting
that people sort of realized at the time
there's kind of a historical accident
but a good accident so the document how
it can have multiple forms and each form
is a collection of name fields and one
of the typical clever things it turns
out is that if you have more than one
feels the same name that's turned into
an array so that mean then allows you to
have more powerful forms and people were
actually were thinking sporting at the
time and I would leave the text but
you've got the sort of syntax for
addressing it in terms of its like
JavaScript syntax then another
properties on the objects behind the
form fields such as the name type the
value let's read only disabled and so
forth and then for scripting purposes
the number different kind of events
which you can use in addition to like
unchanged and folks blur and submit
there's also things like the keep
strokes events but to do significant
validation particular client side you
have to go into scripting so xforms was
a reaction to that and it's about to
really enterprise strict form since we
brought together the leading electronic
form companies of the time and they're
making a transition from paper-based
forms to electronic forms and so they
had a lot of experience of really
complex forms much more complex than you
get in your average log in feel or
simple or not online through purchasing
pages and so these this has actually
gone pretty well and there are many
implementations of X forms and it still
isn't widely used but mostly in
corporate and government circles so one
of the key things which is a fairly
obvious really is applying the
model-view-controller design pattern
which had been sort of a had not been
applied in the early version of the HTML
forms so it gives you a kind of
separation of concerns which makes very
easier
developed of applications another aspect
was the abstract user interface controls
wish again opposite of device
independence this is important because
the web is not just about accessing
stuff on the desktop it's also about
maybe using through speech or small
screen displays and people can innovate
and do different kind of devices so you
really want to avoid having
over-committing on the what the controls
how what they look like and how you
interact with them another thing is some
work coming out of kind of the Mozilla
of xbl xml binding language you can use
that to provide kind of rich graphical
controls like showing a value perhaps as
a thermometer gauge or interesting ways
interacting through knobs and all sorts
of things so using xbl together SVG
allows xforms to provide really kind of
rich user interfaces x.x forms is not a
full xml language in its own right now
requires to be part of some other host
language such as XHTML recipe G and one
of the key things is you can export the
data as XML Rob needs to have rather
crazy syntax use the submitting data
from HTML forms and then important point
here is that the use of expert for the
integrity constraints so HTML forms
there are no real integrity concert you
say this is a Fiat text field or this is
a radio button we can't say this is a
date or something like that you can't
say this feels required if that field
has this value on the other hand we have
people working on XML and schemas are
talking about sort of lack the grammars
for xml formats for date xml data but
again they lack these kind of notion of
integrity constraints which are kind of
non-local cut across the document
structure so x forms has this sort of
bind element which allows you to use X
bar to express a wide range of data
integrity constraints so xforms hasn't
really caught on for public use and the
public websites are such and a number of
factors for that although there's some
quite good materials learning materials
for X forms is it's got a bit of a
reputation as being difficult
new freeze of namespace prefixes and a
few other things it's a it you have to
start afresh it's not something which is
looked like the old of approach in HTML
forms and also there's been a lack of
native implementations IBM sponsored a
native application for Mozilla which is
available but most things have been done
through like plugins sorcery javascript
and there's a wide variety different
ways people have done them with Java ok
so but the next thing is web forms to
doto which is a name of a proposal
coming out of the wat working group and
because I mentioned this is not part
couple 3c so again this is now focusing
on incremental extensions to HTML rather
than going off doing something
completely fresh from a clean sheet are
so it's gone back to the original work
we did in the early 90s an HTML plus
some of the features which never made it
into HTML 32 or HTML 4 so things like
extended set of types for in a datetime
number range and civil and through these
the sport for date pickers and another
kind of Pickers which which otherwise
you have to construct yourself a few
scripts and and then their number of
ideas this whether it's clearly that
this is informed by the work on xforms
they've taken some of the wake songs
ideas and try to recast it the context
of HTML such as the ability to put
regular expressions as a validation
constraint what these are types and that
could be used things like credit card
numbers for some strange reason the web
today everybody the usability of typing
in credit card numbers is abysmal you're
not allowed types of spaces between the
fields but that's how you would
recognize you can consume any string of
digits it's very hard to see what they
are phone numbers and credit card
numbers always have some kind of
grouping and yet on the web sorry you've
got to do it the wave machines weight
machine likes this is one line of
JavaScript it's just bizarre um
okay the required fields is a common
pattern on the web you see the little
red asterisk or something around next to
fuel which tells you it denotes this
field must be filled in you get a kind
of a slap on the wrist if you don't do
it so they had a boolean idea this field
must be filled in notnot context-based
another thing from exomes is thing kind
of the use of input modes or like you
want to type something in kanji or some
other a writing system you want to build
to make it easy to provide the right
kind of mechanism the sport to do that
it's open like a picker or user
interface mechanism the flags are
suppressing auto-completion like the
password some some sites use this
mechanism is actually inside as I think
some years back and the idea is you do
you want force people to type the
password rather than let it be auto
filled in by the the browser based on
its you have never you lost time you use
it so some sites use this sometimes
don't then another main problem with
HTML was the way in which all the fields
always had to be nested in a form
element and that got in the way when
people are trying to use tables for
layout it's less of an issue now because
people are using CSS but doing the kind
of the rich of a multi-column layout but
the still so that's one things that
they've explored it to you to it I put
on the field form attribute to name that
ball Ramdas having it included within a
form element and there's some stuff to
do repetition which I think's again
inspired by the work on xbox and this is
not terribly widely implemented there is
one implementation natively for opera
and whirl and then also there's a
partial I think it's partial
implementation script JavaScript library
for work making weapon into an explorer
arm so that that's that's where focus to
do their little look at the task force
would you have to sit up within unfilled
in the next few weeks so it's a joint
working drawn membership from people
from an HTML and
Foreman's background and hopefully this
you some people have argued this would
make it harder to make progress to build
consensus it's already well if you get a
people of friends in your room is easy
to make a consensus amongst your friends
but if you've got people and dim
backgrounds to make a really strong
stand that it will stand the test of
time it's important to get people from
together from a wide range of experience
and I'm very optimistic about that
having been involved in both camps so my
expectations for how it's worked is I
think it's not going to do any rubber
stamping and existing proposals I think
it's going to have to go back to looking
at the starting assumptions you know
major basin in by the use cases the
forms we use on the web suppose does
kind of wack business forms look at the
key design choices to follow from that
and bring a synthesis of different ideas
together so this is my view on the set
of assumptions then I'm going to go into
some work I've been doing which gone for
a series of names and with some demos of
how to do richer forms so we have a I
think the basic idea is it's got to be
an incremental extension to HTML forms
we're not doing something to requires
you to use namespaces in XML I think it
must be my view as it must be capable of
being deployed on existing browsers so
you you can reach out to a very high
percentage of people immediately if you
have to wait until new browsers roll out
then you're putting in several years
into the future for serious used by big
websites and I think there's no point in
doing this unless it provides
significant value of the existing
practice so okay some of the choices
that flow from that some people are very
comfortable with hacking away in
JavaScript but I think many others they
find it expensive a lot of scripting is
expensive to get right especially be
able to do it differently for each page
it's it knows the testing and the side
of it becomes a problem and so maybe
it's better to look at declarative
treatment like the maybe some simple
spreadsheet luck expressions rather than
are affecting people to write lots of
JavaScript for event handlers
and the advantage of doing this is that
not only is it easy of people it's
easier also tools particularly for tools
which can do reason over the forum logic
for example if I was able to express the
the forum logic declaratively then iono
tools could generate the server side
script to the validation service side as
well Nichols we tied into some kind of
Content Manager content reasoning system
on the server based on the knowledge of
what's actually the data models in the
database so the wrong one the next issue
from that is well if you are going to
have such expressions what language you
use special language so javascript is
attractive because many people are
familiar with it also it's very easy to
implement because browsers already have
a JavaScript system you can use
JavaScript evals so that sort of a two
pluses for that takes path in XML I
being quite widely used now server-side
so but so that's something we have to
discuss then another thing is going back
to analogy to the Style Wars and Star
Wars are about some people said you
should never have any styling
information embedded in your document at
all you should always be separate and
other people said well it's kind of
useful to have a style element in the
document and have some star rules there
and even or it's kind of it's nice to
have a style attribute so there's a lot
of debate some years ago as to whether
to allow us style attribute and elements
but i think that the pragmatist one out
and so we have starch mutant it's here
to stay and the same thing applies to
the the logic forms logic should you are
include this additional information with
the four fields directly as something
now just to some kind of block at the
beginning of the document or just linked
separately I hope the work i'm going to
show you takes the case of just
including it locally but it's to be
debated
then rather than having like this deals
required yes or no sometimes it's useful
to say this thing is required or this
thing is relevant in the context of the
valleys of other fields so too how
flexible no I or is your form logic one
of the things I've been looking at is
the relationship of forms the web forms
and spreadsheets big nodes Excel
spreadsheets are very widely used and
the bane of my life goes after each
business trip I have to fill out a
spreadsheet of the expenses and you
think that well couldn't this be done
better on the web and if so what are the
lessons we can learn from spreadsheets I
don't think just recasting the existing
spreadsheet model on the web is is the
way to go so I don't think the num some
approach is here to stay but we do need
to learn and one of the things to learn
from it is the separation between the
stored and presented values so if you're
doing like you've got exchange rates for
currency exchange rates house are they
stored sufficient precision we don't
necessarily want to present in Wohlers
decimal points just maybe two is good
enough but you might want to store with
three decimal points they present it 12
so can you do that excellence does this
by separating the difference using the
model view controller design patent to
separate the stuff so that's fine but
today on the web is that's not supported
so that's one thing be nice to change
another thing relating to this is the
valleys of computed fields and whether
you can ever write those I'll come back
to that later and then there are some
issues to do device independence for
when you want to repeat feels like a
number of line items in a in a form so I
last year I started doing some
experimental work and it's gone through
a series of names initially your call it
forms light as being sort of named a
throwaway names like being like like
like beer nobody wanted and it's then
changed to excellence tiny at the
beginning of the kind of three
chartering process and
and that's currently as a name
associated general direction of
excellence transitional the idea of
being you can do things in HTML and then
if you were too rich or more powerful
forms and you can transition to the full
power of XML and excellence but I reckon
the name the name is unimportant because
it just be absorbed into HTML to html5
or HTML air now what if it is false so
this is experimental so it's based
around a JavaScript library
cross-browser library and after you sort
of minify take out the surplus white
space and compress it's about 6k bites
sighs and up to G's it and it works on
you know many existing browsers so I
reckon my son's and it's great 99% about
right to exactly what the Senators are
is a little difficult because this is
based on what web what browser people
come to a likely stood up in Seaside if
you look down it gets longer long tail
of different Oh browser to people have
never upgraded and it also works sort of
on mobile browsers although I have some
usability tweaks presentation in the
pipeline for that it's essentially what
it's doing is adding just a handful of
new attributes original no new elements
just a few attributes and then using
javascript interpret there's attributed
to provide the behavior and including
calculated fields and there's just using
a topological sorts to assure the
calculations have done quickly and
that's again borrowing from the work on
spreadsheets where were these from
sorting techniques boom dependencies
between calculated fields how do you do
that problem
so with this new task force I think
we're going to see a synthesis of
proposals and the idea is here in this
synthesis to aim for some perhaps on an
HTML syntax which has aspects of the X
films architecture but not the whole
thing it's just the ideas aspects of
that as a basis for a conceptually
similar approach so in terms are
explained what it means a minute but the
idea is to make it easy to move from
HTML forms to xml on xbox when you want
the extra flexibility so what further do
here is a simple thing some demo for
data types so as you can see low here
have a pointer but the input elements we
have a type attribute it isn't I
people's number so at very simple and
tactical stage and is using the title
attribute to do a tooltip so hopefully
fine does it work on this machine it
does right okay but we would see that in
the video but the tooltips never scale
in size but so we have numbers and if i
type into this hopefully bc and pataky
yeah so what's going on here as it's
checked it's not a number so it's that
field as in marked as being invalid and
um this is being picked up for my style
sheet and rented and red and so fry them
back to hear three
okay so it could check that and the
dates you can have the type a date in
right now and three
so it's using the data object taking
advanced to date object to doing the
parsing and then after you typed in like
spreadsheets after you tabbed away from
that field it then it passes it into the
internal format the date object and then
reformat sit and that being introduces a
cultural language dependency because the
format you want to present the dates
will lieutenant on the language it's
also it all could bake picker this just
generated in this case industrial the
theory being that on browsers which have
native implementations for what the
sounds we emerge up we end up with then
you can be able to use the built-in date
pickers rather than having to generate
this way anyway okay so that's not about
what I think oh oh alright yeah the note
opera course meal degree of grief in
this work because opera aim to be one of
the faster browsers when they were doing
their work it's the end up signing what
they'll do is that when ash meets have a
numeration of business techniques that
use some honey efficient internal
representation and that means that if
opera doesn't recognize the absolute
value you've supplied water you can't
find it from the script because they've
reversed it to order they they default
cases and so in the case of a number
that's fine because opera supported web
forms to do so it knows about titles
number but if I go to opera mobile it
does not know about a type equals number
so i get back time equals text and this
happens on a number of different
attributes so I therefore have to make
the demo work on opera as well as other
browsers I only supported use of
different names these attributes data
type as alternate time no number of
cases where does it happened now I
believe that opera is
fixing this property should see okay for
that one of the issues is sort with this
using scripts that generate Pickers is
that you'd like to use images in those
things you generated so if I go back a
page you'll see there's a close eye
there's a close graphic on the top right
the scripts have to load this but the
browser context effects even script does
not remember the or I the script is
loaded from so it means you can't very
easily use a relative your eyes for the
scripts for the images from the script
so in this case is using absent URI and
that's because you want to be able to
use this library from non variety
different locations so some minor tweaks
which be nice to be able to fix that the
next lesson as an HTML didn't figure out
how to fix that one it would make
scripting of these sorts of controls a
lot easier okay
any other oh yeah the way in which i was
using style sheets or CSS to control the
rendering so it came up in red is
because basically the script is using
dynamic CSS classes is adding a class to
represent the state of the field and
there there's an alternative proposal in
the CSS group which is to use some new
pseudo classes or the colon syntax colon
invalid or curl on required or something
and but that doesn't work in existing
browsers so this idea of being able to
use a small set of economic classes
makes sense backs compatibility of
course that means you've got difficulty
trying to get people to agree well can
we reserve these particular set of names
for that purpose in this context first
of interesting challenges regular
expressions so this is like for a credit
card number or something so if I can
actually move by the digits and how
about knows it and if I back so it's
basically you look at the pattern
actually down here we have a pattern
attribute and it's got a rib expression
for that Greg expressions are a little
subtle and i'm not sure what percentage
of scrub JavaScript programmers are
actually familiar with regular
expressions i'm assuming if they were
given these kind of capabilities they
will learn quickly
right well if they can cop me something
like this for a credit card that's fine
but it is a thing because the javascript
is very powerful and the beep a powerful
the most people aren't aware of how to
use that power and another example is in
a kind of Ajax stuff is that the use of
closures with xml httprequest but again
none of examples you can cut and paste
was very hard to find the good examples
maybe the search engines can gets
laughing and we have computed feels so
okay so the idea is here we have there
one time too okay so just like a
spreadsheet except unlike a spreadsheet
so we hip here that the idea each fields
got a name so we have named calls X name
equals y and then the third field
calculate X plus y I think that the idea
to build these logical names the
calculations and respect for logic is a
lot more attractive will be a lot more
attractive to people than having to do
things like c 1 plus unknown c2 d-d one
and the using negative macro languages
in spreadsheets i think it's kind of
accent so i've got here i think it was a
also type read-only which is HTML for
things i did thinking that she comes out
very clearly on the screen but there's
actually subtle little coloring and it
again dump the star sheet so that's the
idea of doing simple spreadsheet like
calculations just saying next page
so the idea is here is to make this work
what you're doing is mapping the
calculation into something then call
javascript your value and do that you
have to rewrite the expression when the
document loaded so in that case the idea
is before dot X plus bought that why
come on threaten them some other things
of 15 come follow this you can add min
and Max constraints as well so
restricted via the numbers and on
numbers and dates and that's useful so
in rearrange controls point out where it
is done bottomley we have meaningful 7
and max equals 5 tipple so in other
words it's not just 11 valid validate
equals something it's lots of little
constraints through together can we use
the test where it's a regular expression
or the actual data type min and Max
civil the idea here is type equals range
you can see bottom here so that turns it
into something which is a slider in
principle the mins max step equals 1 so
these are actually proposed I think a
long time ago and picked up again by the
web forms to do a proposal and on if
this is an opera or Safari then you
actually get a real slider but because
there is no is no slider mechanism it up
currently in Firefox we have to
substitute some hack just like
and at five it might go down and simple
okay then some more context sensitive
validation constraints so the idea here
is if you've seen it back so the first
one x must be a number y must be number
greater than X so that's saying that the
is validation constraint on the two so
if i put in five and put in five the
next one will be an error and if i put a
number just great in that say six it's
okay so again what we have now is the
constraint of attribute and so the idea
here is that y greater than X so if a
simple the
what's going on
get out of that
ice which is using the same JavaScript
syntax as before for calculate now if
this was like smell then I'd have to
probably escape these things like less
than a greater than or ampersand but in
HTML tag suit you know the browser's
know about these problems you don't have
to escape it which makes it easier again
before ordinary users required fields so
we got here so this is easily out here
we have this field which is this ha you
can't even see Scarlett it oh well the
idea here is this field is why is
required if the first first field X is
not it's not non empty so that means you
can make the make context-sensitive make
what fields required based on the
valleys of other fields
you also includes calls to our
JavaScript yes yes you can in fact I
have some examples of that later okay
and then we have concept of the
relevancy which is where you don't want
you any show things the user which
expect them to really fill out as you
hide some parts of the form which are
not relevant I can get paper forms these
picnic tax forms there's just so many
even things and it's very scary it's
actually you don't need to fill them
most of them out so it depends on what
you do so like in this case this is I
think my attempt remember i'm looking at
insurance forms where they want to find
out how long you been living your
current address is some measure of how
reliable you are I don't know anyway so
if you type in a 5 that's okay that's
fine but if you type and say to two
years then it asked to another question
which is how many years were you living
in your previous address and
ah
browser the browser spot to me flip
that's it
so we're here we have naturally cool
relevant and it's like X less than four
so again very simple expressions and the
idea is that through your style sheet
you can say you know you can basically
suppress the fields which marked as
being irrelevant through through dynamic
CSS classes okay so the next question is
the idea being honest with where you
have things where multiple rows or
repeated data or repeated to her along
atoms so in this case is to the
beginning rudimentary sporadic at all
product name / number quantity price and
so we can now put some ID no foo to 10
okay so we have a calculation total
price which is being calculated across
number purchased times price of unit
down the number of rows so how do you
want to express that so we brought down
so we have done at the bottom here we
have a field a total it's read only and
it has a front again calculate with a
function to predefined function which
sums over the line item which is the
name of this field set come back to say
and what times unit price and the the
fieldset very good for the book there
the fields that name equals 19 and
Justin calculations across a repeating
set of rows and using the repeat number
attribute to cause the numbers to be
duplicated that ok questions natural
around all right so essentially no the
idea here is that it's not just saying
you want to duplicate that piece of
markup in the field set is actually
treating as an object that is the best
like defining an object in some sense of
data model which is then being generated
in this case it's generating as a table
but on a mobile device we have a small
screen you can't you do have a lot of
width the screen you can't really show
tables very well so in that case it
makes more sense to view each row in the
the data with one screen and have the
things labels and feels vertical and
with some kind of mechanism to navigate
within that within the rose so the
repeat number it's a name that's come
forward from xforms it's telling the
minimum roads display or winning run
rose to generate the beginning and then
there's issues which i haven't explored
in this particular demo yeah
is that whether you want to how do you
want to support the uid when you fill in
the last row that automatically add a
new row or do you want to provide some
explicit UI for adding euros and things
like that just very much sort of a
application designer's choice and the
one of the things about this was to have
a label that widened the scope of the
HTML forms labels to binds to room like
a row a column of fields rather than
just to an individual field the HTML for
label attribute has a for it matches ID
counting that's the way it's defined an
inch my thought is this stuff which its
accessibility in tables trying to
explain the structure the table supports
like navigated free speech and
unfortunately most website developers
don't understand that and that's not
really taking off well that's another
reason this better to visit implants
scenes but if you imagine it in mobile
device you don't idea of device
independence you really want to try and
separate the the model from the actual
presentation so you can choose different
peasant ations that's pretty good so
here we're saying we've got a set of
labels I'm a good back here we have a
look we got as a fieldset this is base
simple markup right good field set and
you've got a set of labels for the set
of fields and it's just duplicating the
structures are pretty good so giving
your presentations appropriate to the
device context
and so this to develop the device and
bison dependence is important what else
we got it's the idea of providing some
kind of script API for being able to add
delete or reorder rose and again the
idea being able to separate that so that
the application design a particular
webpage they make their own choices to
what user interface model is appropriate
for that an application with a set of
users widening of labels so it matches
if you can't find the field of matching
ID it'll look for the field name which
then allows you to use the same label
matching a whole set of fields for the
same name and that's important in this
context and like what a demo which makes
it very clear in just a moment another
thing to do is I just said that the to
evaluate these things using jobs could
devour to evaluate these expressions
involve the rewriting process and that
process is oops off on the screen it
involves rewriting a field back through
in terms of formed up foo but if this is
a concept of the current row and so it
will add the square brackets dollar
using dollar which is a local variable
just define that forms little purple for
the execution context of calling about
foreclosure and but the expression
preprocessor is informed by the object
models it's very flexible about that
kind of thing it's one of the more
subtle he sits about how we use exotic
expressions in sway
okay so another challenge was then what
is the convenient way of being able to
fill out initialize such repeated set of
rows so in this case here's some data
and we scroll down so you have the field
set we able to the labels the labels
could be anywhere in here because it's
pulled out from the object model not
from the syntax and I just for
furthering persons find easier to put
the labels that start and then we have
the first row would they fire at the
second row and then the remaining rows
were generated automatically so that way
you can just provide the data for the
rows you want to fill out kind of radio
buttons so we radio buttons are part of
the very beginning of performance and so
in this case what I'm doing you've got a
radio buttons in a checkbox and it's a
case that in if you're male that's fine
but if you're married to a female and
married then it might ask you if your
maiden name again one is really sure
it's kind of like use cases and it does
really matter it's so how that's that's
done through again this see
so we have again relevant attribute with
an expression so it's saying it's named
using as kind of a JavaScript tested
quality see the genders female and
unmarried so in this case the checkbox
are is evaluating to a boolean so the
other married the field here evaluates
to boolean whereas for radio buttons it
evaluates to the strength of the rich
case of the enumerations being used ok
now please continue to give question
during the clinic as we going along Rob
waiting for the eggplant be happy about
selection lists many the meeting is
smaller again you can put selection
lists into these repeat tables and no
screwdriver so in this case it as I pick
the product they've got the price and
that's because there's a function
provided by the author which gave the
price for each of the products and again
the total price is 0 until you actually
fill out the number but to so again we
have in this case we have the
calculations of sum over the quantity x
unit price and the period calculate
equals price of item so this is the want
this was the unit price field is defined
as a function right click it right I'll
skip through some of this
yeah I'll skip this is a bigger piece
rod example way these calculations would
count over the number of check boxes and
buttons and for that this talk is on the
way the doubletree CC is going have a
look at it from that from that point of
view later in other cases we want to use
in HTML usually a flat set of names of
fields and the idea is to extend the
object model so you have a non-flat
space and so the case here is you what
we've got is shipped to a different
address and we have a field at the
bottom here we're just picking up the
city from either of those two fields
sets and get the bottom here and it's
using this this the years ? codon
operator in javascript to pick up the
values so here's if this field is true
this is the check box then pick it out
the ship to city or the built-in city so
the idea here the object models be
extended to include collections of names
from field sets so it's basically an
incremental extension of the HTML forms
model and comic boxes skip over that
Smith's claims so there's something more
complicated examples of forms I just
want to show this thank you pick the
value here 20 me
and I'm
so we've got some constraints required
fields I a little bit subtle in the room
but you'll see that there these fields
is on the field here or pink and because
they're missing the required barrage de
missing and if I then stuffed pig foot
values into that example it's the the
column header it knows that its remains
in error invalid until all of the fields
missing fields are filled out for that
particular column so this is the case
where the form knows that for each feel
what the labels are free to label what
fields are relevant to that and uses
that dynamically work out which feels
submissive and valid and this is all
very simply done in the syntax so I
won't should you can have a look at that
on the web / eyes this is a bit too
subtle so just summarize the
experimental extensions and I'll wrap up
lots of questions this is what happens
when it's squeezed to working Vicki but
out of time oh so essentially it is to
set up new attributes of patent
constraint calculate required well
minimax and these are actually named to
taken from xforms again this
architectural consistency this is using
the same model and symmetry names of
practical it's got a wider set of data
types it's got rich use of labels and
field sense it's got this mechanism
sport road repeats but based on an
object model robyn syntax syntactic
repeats that's something which with web
forms to the dough and xforms don't have
I think we have some discussions Xerox
is hosting the forms working group
meeting this week here in Palo Alto
discussing is further there and then
there's extensions to the object model
so as an additional have small token new
properties labels are the inclusion of
field set in the collection of name
feels so you can afford name my name is
the name of the field set a collection
or a fieldset similarly that feels it
has a collection of names the fields
within it
do this sort of path based naming to
climb things and a small set of built-in
methods like count and some over and
then some subtle things to do with the
rewriting so you can use JavaScript of
hours so that's that france-based
editing I hang up and wait and i'll give
you another talk about maybe next year
this is the work I'm doing on
browser-based editing which works goes
around all the problems if design mode
and exec command for those who look to
that and sits across browser based
library for which basically the ideas of
spreadsheets do although they are the
ideas to have a tool to demonstrate
doing that on the web as complete
replacement for spreadsheets but next
year I think and my final slide was
basically again at summary so the we
expect to have a quarter participation
for for the HTML and the forms groups
are within a few days and I very much
hope that Google will read participate
in the work on the next generation of
HTML and HTML forms and that say thank
you so much and ask questions
