reduce to speakers today Phillip
Rosedale and Corey and Rekha from linden
lab and I guess got five six years ago
now and I first met these guys somebody
told me they were working on on
something pretty cool and i went and and
they were originally located in hayes
valley up and up in san francisco and
literally in a garage it was a graduate
was almost still being used because
there was an auto body shop next door
and the fumes would come in and to the
other side was a corset shop that served
dark garden they had a fetish where and
other types of things and so this was
around like 2000 2001 so there wasn't a
whole lot of technology especially
consumer technology innovation going out
of the time but both Phillip and Cory
had a really audacious vision of a world
that users would build and and again if
you remember this is sort of before
blogging and podcasting everything
caught on so if you were talking user
created content people would think sort
of like bad mp3 files from mp3.com biack
why would anybody ever want to do that
and nobody can create anything of
interest and so then when i started to
look at what they were doing of course
immediately signed up and had the honor
and privilege of working with them for a
number of years before I came over to
Google and so I think late two thousand
for Phillip and Cory came and sort of
gave us a little bit of a peek inside of
Second Life which is a fully user
created virtual world built programmed
sculpted designed and and lived in by
now over 150,000 people in 91 countries
between the size acreage and gross
domestic product i think it's larger
than monaco and and Luxembourg is next
so we figure it's only it's only another
five years till they get a TLD for her
URLs and and then eventually a UNC so
thank you film Corey for coming and
filling us in on the development of this
world over the last year's thank you
thank you thank you honor so will will
you know in I hope Google and linden lab
style all will make this fun we're not
certainly not going to show you any
slides we're just going to goof around
and second life Corey is the great
architectural brain behind second life's
technology behind its scripting language
behind the
team everything else and on top of that
he's like the fastest builder in second
life so we'll do this fun thing of I can
try to keep your attention and talk
about like the company and how
successful we are and then Corey can
attempt to distract you by making
dominoes yeah we're quarters going to
say we're unfortunately today although
we love Google we don't love Google
enough to delay a system upgrade so
we're actually like not really in the
main grid right now as we call it in
Second Life we're doing a database
upgrade right now so we didn't want to
change this because we already scheduled
didn't wanted to come down and chat and
so it Corey's alone so the only
difference about the real second life is
that there's always a ton of people
hanging around gawking at what you're
doing which is kind of part of the magic
of it but anyways how many people here
like have used second life for have an
account or sort of now so so a few so
like Hunter said the basic idea with
second life was and it wasn't something
that was possible until five or six
years ago to even really start working
on it was this radical idea that well
what if you could create a 3d immersive
environment that looked as good as a
video game that was tactile and visceral
and exciting and you know sexy fun to be
in but had the of course very you know
web like and very compelling property
that everything in it was built by you
and in fact that the model of the method
of building would be the method of
living you know that that that you would
just you know do things there in the
same way that you do them in the real
world you could touch things you could
sculpt things you could paint things you
could just build you can make stuff and
so we started the company with his
vision like what would it take
technologically to build an environment
in which you could make things and make
really cool things and so you know the
basic capabilities discussion of second
life is as you can see we've got a
physics engine that's simulating the
whole world everybody sees the same
thing that physics is happening like on
the server's not on the clients there's
a scripting language there's a little
script that's inside every one of those
dominoes because I bet they're going to
set themselves back up in a minute and
the the dominoes are basically
programmed to set themselves back up
after a second see that and the
scripting language which corey actually
wrote the syntax for is is a big part of
the system so he can actually code the
behaviors in each of those objects they
live
of in each of those objects the world of
second life itself as you can imagine is
a huge server farm because it takes a
lot of machines to simulate all the
stuff that people make so just you know
as a basic for those who haven't kind of
heard a second line this quarry is
standing in one server machine right now
the whole world of Second Life is at
present about 2,000 CPU cores running
about 30,000 acres in real estate with
about 10 million user created objects of
which that Domino would be an example of
one the world is inconceivably large
that is to say the rate at which we're
adding new servers the rate at which
people are buying new land in it exceeds
vastly the rate at which you as an
individual could like walk around and
see all the stuff that's bent that's
happening so its event horizon if you
will is kind of expanding outward at
this point we kind of passed that point
a few months ago as hunter said there's
about a hundred and fifty thousand
people living in here there's about
5,500 people online in the evening max
concurrency people are doing things like
taking pictures kori can show you like
all those little red dots are actually
there's a photo blogging service that a
third party set up that's called SL pics
and we're just you know very Google
style we're just taking the feed from
those guys and putting those pictures up
but these are actually live pictures
that are coming out of second life as
people are just taking snapshots of
what's going on so again just to give
you an idea scale 2,000 machines a
gigabit per second at peak so very very
large server deployment 5,000 you know
people in there about 20 thousand people
a day using second life and then the
most amazing thing is if you give people
the ability to make things obviously
they're going to value those things and
in some cases want to buy and sell them
from each other one of the important
things we did right from the beginning
was we allowed everybody to own their
own intellectual property so when you
build a rocket like that it really
belongs to you you can mark it as being
created by you you can sell it somebody
for a certain price that's cool I don't
see that it's going to blow up this
short attention span theater you know
when you're in second life everything
needs to explode or have a fire worker
you know your your mania for
entertainment is even so greater than
real life because because it can be um
so all these all these things that Cory
is doing are all examples of this stuff
but the most amazing thing is if you
bought one of those fireworks and we
could go on one of the catalogue sites
and look right now for one if you bought
a fire light work like that it might
cost you 250 linden dollars which would
be about one u.s. dollar okay to buy
that firework so you might ask yourself
are these guys are these guys just crazy
or does this stuff really work so the
answer to the really works question and
that's kind of the update from late two
thousand four when we were here is it
works in a big way users buy and sell
objects like that firework from each
other at a rate of at this point about
five million dollars us a month and
that's climbing like twenty-five percent
a month there's about four million
transactions the average transaction
size is like around a dollar um there's
in the last 30 days you talk about you
know is this costco is this 10 lucky
people selling people all the things
they buy in here in the last 30 days
there were a hundred and eighty thousand
distinct objects that were bought by
those people so what you have here is
you have a vast creative environment
which you can make anything combined
with a property and rights and
transactional currency system that lets
people buy and sell things from each
other very very easily the other piece
of this if you're wondering so can you
can you build a real living on that then
if there's five million dollars a month
in transactions bear in mind this is not
money that we're making this is five
million dollars in transactions between
individuals in second life the way that
works is oh that's weird are you drawing
with it oh it's star acts and stuff
right yeah so one of the most prolific
creators of objects in second life is
the guy who made the wand that Corey can
probably show us it's like in his hand
and this magic wand basically does
things you know it's it's this wand of
many strange things so as Corey does
stuff it just sort of follows along and
does strange things like if he says like
listen or something it will make a giant
ear and it's just incredibly weird watch
this Santa
I really brings home the whole 5 million
dollars in Santa's every month um so uh
the way people make money so so you know
let me you know wax on a couple of the
aspects of this so people are basically
as I said they're buying and selling
things to the tune of about five million
dollars a month this enables a
substantial number of thousands of
people to make at this point significant
amounts of money with sort of a hundred
hundreds low hundreds of people who
would tell you this is their full-time
job this is all they do in second life
now those people come from all over the
world so one of the things that's so
profound about second life is you can
kind of imagine like cord you have the
Saburo though look at that he's just
like eet EES he knows me he melded with
me the so check this gun out right so
this is like the coolest gun you can get
in second life it was built by a
graduate student up in Seattle and and
that student has a you know gone two
gone to college basically on the
revenues that he's made from selling
this weapon we're trying to hire him
right now don't you the the the gun that
he made their costs about five dollars
it's about a thousand linden dollars or
1200 linden dollars so it's about five
dollars a piece now just stop for a
moment consider something all it takes
to make money in second life is
basically like a paypal account i can
describe it more i'll stop for questions
we'll start talking about stuff there's
a currency exchange system where you
basically take the linden dollars that
you've charged for the gun you've sold
and you basically can give those linden
dollars you can sell those linden
dollars to somebody else on the currency
exchange and with a paypal account or a
wire transfer you know you can get the
money back from what you're doing what
this means is that some some kid in some
faraway country where you know the cost
of living is a tenth or whatever what it
is here can basically surely on the
basis of his or her intellectual
horsepower can build a gun that competes
with the gun that Corey had on all
that's necessary is cleverness all
that's necessary is intellectual skill
diligence working with people in world
you know as necessary to get the thing
mark
or whatever but none of this requires
shipping tariffs h-1b visas or anything
else and so youryour international kid
out there can basically sell a five
dollar a pop gun to what is nominally at
this point at least a domestic us or you
know North American audience that
willing to pay five dollars so if you
think about that I mean it makes you
think wow you know how fast can
something like this grow so we've we've
created a sort of a pure intellectual
palate or canvas for people to do things
and we've actually created a way for the
ones who want to to monetize that so
it's kind of a basic overview you know
you can see Corey's you can also imagine
some of the big businesses in second
life for clothing you know you can see
how dressed up Cory is there the market
for tattoos and skins and sunglasses and
clothes and rings and earrings is huge I
mean those are each each one I said
there is like multiple hundreds of
thousands of dollars a month in object
sales a lot of this stuff nobody really
knows yet it's why it's fun to come talk
to you guys and it's a very this is
changing very rapidly people are
building content very rapidly you know a
couple of years ago this was all
basically just dirt we started in 2003
with 16 simulators online and there's
2,000 simulators online today the other
thing let's see about the mechanism what
haven't I told you is you basically buy
real estate from us you you give us
money to basically rack a new server if
you will and that server just comes up
wherever you want it on the map and
you're able to then develop the land so
for example the woman who's making the
most money and second life is a woman
who lives in Germany who's our little
sort of rockefeller and she's making
probably a hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars or so a year basically
developing real estate for people
building houses and then reselling those
houses to them that real estate at a
higher price so she has an immense
business doing that so just like in the
real world real estate pays to be in
real estate even in second life um uh
touch a little bit on demographic it's
really the early adopter crowd a lot of
people see second life and they think
okay it's a bunch of IT nerds that are
that are they're doing that and yea
indeed we were you know they've got the
people who built it but if you look at
the Wow if you look at the demographics
today it's forty three percent female on
the average age is 32 the age
distribution looks just like the u.s.
population curve there's a smooth
descent to 67 years old there's lots of
people in their 50s 60s and 70s using
second life the i mentioned
international into about twenty-five
percent international so we believe that
the people that are using it and coming
in and doing things in here are pretty
much just everybody I mean anybody that
has a clever idea entrepreneurial enjoys
the community that's that's that's
evolving around all this so uh that's
probably a good that's probably a good
overview and I look to you guys like so
and all this stuff is sort of baffling
so in terms of having a good
conversation and going farther on this
stuff like what do you want to know
about and I'll kind of keep going yeah
let's we can we can we can take a look
at that so the question is what are the
parameters kind of how to objects work
how to actions on objects work clothing
is easy to understand but how about
something like a gun how does that how
does that actually work Corey can kind
of show us here by taking a look at this
gun in more detail the gun itself is
made of basic primitives that are glued
together to form a larger object and
then there are scripts which can be
essentially dragged into each of those
parts of the gun the scripting language
itself is basically event-driven it's a
sort of a sea style language that that
lets you respond to events so something
like on res means when the thing gets
made do this and then there'll be
something like link message means some
other object talk to it there's messages
for like on clicked you know like when
you click on something and then when you
let up on it so it's I don't know it
Corey I don't know what language would
be the most like but yeah it's a it's
pretty easy to modify things obviously
to do great work and it requires that
you'd be a great program or just like
anybody else but but to go in and like
modify what noise you know you're you're
little you know you know squeaky toy
makes when you squeeze it in second life
that's really actually pretty easy and
rapid modification
people riffing on each other's ideas is
definitely a big part of the power of
Second Life we were just telling you so
that's basically the you know kind of a
rough over you yes yeah standard
scripting language like glue oh I don't
know Cory you want to the reason we
didn't was because we knew wanted to
have thousands of people writing
physically some you know physical
simulations and scripts working together
and we looked at the state of the art in
two thousand on sandbox languages the
amount of work to beat one of the
existing sandbox languages into
submission was very comparable to the
amount of building one from scratch it
was also issues like garbage collection
and then do you want to do anti what
we're working on the next generation is
yeah so what we're doing right now
actually is we're switching over to mono
so mono if you know what that is it's
the open source net implementation so we
basically are that where we are right
now on that is the current scripting
language is compiling to the common
language runtime and we're basically in
final testing on that and that gives us
a pretty significant speed up and
ultimately lets people start writing in
other CLI languages so our goal is to
move now to a more standards based
approach I should also say just for
those who don't know we're our whole
system and everything has been built on
a lot of open source components the
servers are all Linux paste the code
running on them is just c++ we have
clients for linux mac and windows we use
a bunch of standards-based stuff
wherever we can the complexity though of
what we've done is extraordinarily high
there's a tremendous amount of code
interfaces modules conceptualizations in
here and some of the stuff there just
wasn't anything out there yet for us to
really reuse who's next that's nice
what else can we talk collisions between
physical objects right right so the cool
one of the coolest things about this and
one of the key architectural pieces that
we work together on by the way my
background I Corey and I both are the
the two senior technical guys at the
company I was the CTO and before that
the VP of media systems at real networks
my backgrounds physics so I worked on
programming networking codecs stuff like
that Corey Corey has a very wide
background but had but you know most
recently before linden lab was working
on gaming technology so so networking 3d
stuff like that we one of the neat
things that we did to answer your
question is we built a simulation
environment in which the servers contain
all the simulation so they're
authoritative and then they in a terse
manner update all the clients with the
same information so what's so cool about
the Domino's example is there's
basically a rigid body physics engine we
use havoc as one of the components of
that for rigid body collisions that's
handling the collisions of those
dominoes and then what's so cool about
that is that if there's multiple people
sitting in world and again I apologize
we can't be sitting in the main grid
right now which sucks when there are
multiple people sitting in there they
all see those dominoes contact and fall
at exactly the same time because
basically the server is authoritative
lee sending that information the clients
are essentially kind of locally
predicting it a little bit so that it
looks smooth again there's just it's
just that I mean we're really good as a
development team there's just kind of a
ghastly amount of work that that's gone
into this it's as hunter said it's it's
a five-year project now so
yeah how well sometimes you can have an
inconsistency between the prediction
state of the client what's happening on
the server and when the server gets the
new data sends you the new data it
updates so rubber banding or that kind
of snapping back happens sometimes yeah
but we've done a pretty good job of
eliminating that the other thing that's
really cool is that our simulation is
our simulation is and this is the thing
we can't show you Corey's just standing
on one simulator but when there are
multiple ones connected together you
can't see the boundaries so we've done
all the edge crossing behavior and
continuing the physics simulation from
one machine on to another machine we've
done all that work that's a tremendous
amount of work it's a big pure pure
connected network essentially the 2,000
CPUs that I mentioned and each of them
is running a physics simulation and a
scripting simulation and a weather
simulation all one world yeah there's no
shards in second life so if you think
about second life people always talk
about World of Warcraft you know
everybody knows world of warcraft with 5
million people in there not only is it
you know does not have the sort of
capability is that we've built here but
we're probably I don't know about as big
as a single world of warcraft shard
right now so from the standpoint of
people being in world at the same time
we're like the biggest in the world or
we're very close you know we're actually
eve online for those who geek out on
games has they've actually done a really
nice job with a single world they have
like 20,000 people or something enrolled
at once but but the point is that the
big online environments you know they're
amplified by content by complex behavior
by people being able to form communities
you have to have all that stuff
happening in a contiguous space and so
right from the beginning the whole idea
was that the network was all these
machines and it was all going to be
connected together and everything was
going to be visible from everybody else
and that's what's driven a lot of the
economic competition that drives that
big you know five million dollars a
month I talked about all that stuff is
driven by the fact that it's all in one
world you can walk somewhere and bust
out something cool that you've built and
show it somebody else you don't have to
worry about boundaries of any kind
lots so yeah so the question is what
kind of security issues we've run into
and the answer is there's like boy we
could talk about that for like an hour
very important thing is the architecture
setup so there's very little action in a
distance so while you may be able to say
confuse havoc and cause the physics
engine to take down an individual
machine you know they're two thousand
simulators it 125 square kilometers of
space so if there's one machine that
crashes and then comes back up it isn't
a tremendous impact the most interesting
attacks have been self-replicating
attacks the scripting language allows
self-replication so we have the expected
gray goo attacks and basically there we
respond by giving residents a lot of
local control by we have we'd now call
the space lasers that allow us to you
know go to orbit and nuke the site from
orbit it's the only way to be sure you
know and so so we have ways of
responding to that and the sort of
traditional game response would be to
nerf those features nerfing meeting at
the one that game creator decides hey
that's really cool feature will take it
away and and we decided we're not going
to do that because there are too many
cool things you can do with
self-replication and it's useful it's a
useful feature to have so well there
certainly are security issues you know
the scripting language is very heavily
sandboxed everything's happening on the
server side so it's a lot harder to
cheat us than games that trust the
client and all we have an amazingly dumb
client right because we're streaming
everything there even all the content
isn't on the client most of the time
yeah i mean the simple thing is the
other thing about security is is sort of
rights management control because
everything's happening on the server you
don't have this ability to go like
cleverly hack your world of warcraft
client and steal money from the other
guy you can't do that because
everything's happening at a central
server so whereas whereas immune to
those attacks as you guys are in the
sense that you know you're maintaining
central databases if you screw that up
people can hack in but if you do a good
job it's possible to fully protect it so
like the scripting language when corey
is opening those scripts that script the
actual source code of the script is only
on the server and it will only send it
to you to look at it if you have the
correct rights for it so on things like
that you know we can reasonably preserve
rights so people can sell stuff and
there's not just rampant copying having
said that there's a rich debate and in
fact a real a real
pragmatic usage case in second life you
know that makes it better than the real
world and that people do tend to share
things there's it's a very open sharing
based environment uh and and you know
you can choose to have all the objects
you've got set you know fully fully
permissive so you give them to people
you know you know we believe that this
is better than the real world in a lot
of ways and a lot of the people that are
here live here and they live here
because they make friends here and they
can build things they can externalize
their thoughts here in ways that in the
real world you just can't so you know we
don't we don't see this as a game we see
it as a platform that is in many ways
better than the real world and you know
everything so far indicates it is kind
of growing that way right so the quality
of the graphics why don't the graphics
look better
yeah so part of it is content quality
we're not in the main grid hanging
around in some of the most carefully
built spaces that are generating lots of
that commerce I'm talking about those
spaces are quite amazing people are able
to do local lighting shadows and things
like that on their own essentially as
light maps and shadow maps and things
like that but probably the biggest thing
you're talking about is where are the
lights and where are the shadows you
look at the graphics engine the triangle
count per scene here is typically a good
fraction of a million so it's a very
high density seen the challenge one I
mean we could speak to this again for
hours but probably the biggest thing in
our system is that we're not able well
we're working on this but the challenge
with second life is because everything
is editable you can't pre light so you
can't pre light and pre-compute a scene
so you can't set up some of the easy
tricks that you can use to make a scene
in the Unreal Engine look better having
said that technology is on our side this
stuff will look exactly like the Unreal
Engine it'll catch everybody else
because GPU technology is moving toward
everything being dynamic and all CG
effects and others running in real time
without regard for the content set we're
not there today so with us you see us
having to strike a trade-off between a
lot of editable objects and a lot less
lighting basically I'm being real simple
there's we could you know come and see
us afterwards we can go on and on about
all the little other things that are
good or bad
yeah most of our users probably have a
little bit good deal better than our man
spec our minimum spec today is like a
gigahertz machine and a g-force to
second life runs really slow under that
configuration it will run on a mac
Cory's running it on a Mac here this is
not a particularly great machine it'll
run on a g4 powerbook but horribly on on
an Intel atosh is that only our word or
two other people say Intel otash I apple
pie doesn't think that's funny on one of
those machines it actually runs great
just for everybody to know Apple is
going to have a nice Renaissance here of
reasonably fast machines now the the
Intel chips are competitive now with pcs
in terms of graphics the the base
configuration that our users have is
probably more like you know on a geforce
FX or something like that any modern pc
tho those bought in the last year and a
half is going to run second life at you
know full speed you know five years ago
we would have been out of business
bandwidth is so cheap today as you guys
well know that it's a negligible cost to
us but we run at an average of about 80
or 90 kilobits per second to each client
that's online so again that's about a
gigabit per second of peak egress right
now at heavy traffic times but a gigabit
per second today is you know virtually
free so it's it's 884 so 84 kilobits per
second on average then it will pick up
to several hundred but yeah it's a lot
of bandwidth that's definitely one of
the sea changes that were taking
advantage of the ability to just
cavalierly use quite a bit of man with
I just wondering if
cause like a plan
what you're streaming is positioning
no so the big challenge the big big trip
for us was that we didn't do that we're
actually streaming the model information
we're essentially streaming the vertex
information the way that we're doing
that though is very very clever we're
streaming the vertices and the textures
and the sounds and everything else in
real time that was our big R big kind of
mission of the company was to take an
environment and make it so that the
download which the now our download is
20 meg and there's 10 million user
created objects in world and about 15
terabytes of user-created data that are
in second life so our whole challenge
was to send none of that information
down beforehand and we also believe that
you know if you look back on something
like you know the sims or something like
that really interesting people are only
going to get interested in an
environment in which there's that
unpredictability that comes from there
not being a fixed monopoly set so to
speak err you know piece set Lego Lego
set of things
science
scream that
fairly constant as
well we struck it in between where you
know it's technically to stream the
vertices for one of these typical scenes
would be unfeasible so what we did was
we came up with some very clever ways to
essentially use these the sculpt double
building box blocks which you haven't
seen you is where you can twist and
manipulate and you know stretch an
object so we're using a kind of a
constructive solid geometry model we're
streaming the textures we cash them
optimistically but again there's 15
terabytes of data if we ship this thing
to you in a box it would be on 2,000
DVDs up to a gig to 50 meg do a gig you
can set it yourself I think it tries to
use as much as again can you up can you
improve things by having a higher come
on like like for instance those dominoes
are all kind of replicas another than
the dots and bottles or
we wouldn't have to transmit all the
persons of all yep object that's that
stuff that we're you know some small
pieces that were done we've done in more
stuff we're doing so we're building
hierarchical models and optimized of
course smiling because one of my big
design decisions at the beginning was
let's not try and do that it's it's just
crazy we can't do hierarchies but not
done having our yeah seems like that
yeah one of the only things like like
the coolest things you can't quite do
yet a second life is you can't have like
a big jointed monster you know walking
around you can if you want to really
work at it but it's terribly hard so we
need to add that kind of hierarchy but
that's us I mean we understand how to do
that we have a great you know we have a
pretty good size team so do people find
everything just by browsing no um yeah
it's great um here we go if oh the
Finder is probably not up oh you have to
type something but go to classifieds
okay so this is an example of this
basically what we let people do is list
content places you know people objects
going forward in in common listings that
you can get to we sort we do things like
sorting by traffic that's pretty cool
that's how many people have come to that
location we also allow people to pay for
classified ads and we actually let them
bid for placement so they bid for how
high they're going to be in the
classified ad listings that itself is a
big and growing business so it's it's
pretty I mean I think that search and
discovery of content is one of the key
assets that we're building here on top
of the state I mean obviously there's 10
million objects in here it's already a
big search problem
let's go
what we've built into the system is the
ability for you to set objects on a
quite granular level as to whether you
want them to be editable resellable
transferable quarries worked a lot on
that yeah basically this is the Creator
you have a lot of control over what
rights you want to have both in the
object as it sits there in the world and
the rights as they once they're
transferred to the whoever takes the
object or purchases the object one thing
that we've done is it's sort of like
first sale one of the things we've said
is the Creator can either say you can't
resell this item or they can say you
can't copy this item but you can't
restrain Bowl and that's been a point of
quite a bit of contention with our art
creators because certainly especially
you know year or two ago we were making
a lot of these decisions the really
early creators were very much creating
for a lot of them in a very artistic
sense and so they wanted moral rights
they wanted to say look I've made this
thing would never let anybody change it
or modify it one of one of the guys
we've consulted with a lot in thinking
about this has been Lawrence Lessig
who's a big thinker about intellectual
property rights and how they do or don't
grow a society and so it's a huge debate
and it's a very rich topic that we take
really seriously and like Corey said we
do little things to try and you know our
motivation is to get people to be as
nice and as sharing as possible there's
a guy in world for example who's created
a Creative Commons licensing machine
that will actually a fix a Creative
Commons license with the appropriate
licensing text to any object that you
create and so I think we're going to see
a lot of higher level branding and
licensing schemes emerging that sort of
lean on the basic low-level features
that are in the system that allow you to
set rights controls but it's a really
big topic it's like a good a good
question
you can't you can steal a texture
there's nothing we can't prevent that
yeah exactly yeah yeah I mean you can
you can copy you can copy textures you
can copy vertices so the the physical
appearance of objects you know in the
same sense that an mp3 stream could be
recorded are going to be fairly easy to
are going to be fairly easy to to steal
you know we could we could get the
geometry of Corey's Spaghetti Monster
here pretty easily but as i said earlier
sophisticated things like the scripting
that's attached to it is harder to get
and then in general there's a lot of
social practice emerging around you know
what happens to you if you steal things
all the time you know and i think what
we're going to see and we're already
seeing in second life and stuff like
seal programs and groups and stuff that
our outing people who are being what
they regard is abusive you know
government governance is a huge issue
here what we have is essentially a
little replica of the real world and an
opportunity to redo things in a
different way and so you see a lot of
experimentation around that broadly
second life is pretty anarchic compared
to the real world but as it's growing
there are little pockets of order where
people are establishing zoning and
governance and local rules I think
there's going to be a fascinating debate
around courts emerging I mean it's a
longer topic but people are going to
start deciding who they want to let on
their land and you know using black
lists or white lists on property and as
you see that congealing into larger
systems you're going to essentially have
early nations or early a fine
communities that are emerging and
excluding each other so yeah we had a
guy gosh great example of like how far
you want to how far you can go the
scripting language we had a guy who
basically built uh what does it RSA so
he basically made a thing where if you
were to avatars now bear in mind your
two avatars in second life you don't
know each other's real identities right
but you want to do business together you
want to say you're going to sell cars
one of you is bill gonna build the
dealership and pay the land costs the
other one's going to design the cars
you're going to split the money
fifty-fifty again this five million
dollars a month that a subject here so
how do you how do you come up with a
business contract well there is this guy
who based
wrote in our scripting language a thing
where you two avatars could walk up
agree on a document click a button and
have it crypto sign give back to give
you back a token that you could use to
recover that document in an
authoritative way later on and say this
is what we agreed to so that's an
example of kind of how far you can go
with this stuff and with the language
that we've built yes where is real money
floating into you apart from sales of
land so we make our money essentially
right now from the largest the largest
share of our revenues is from land use
fees which is essentially recurring fees
for land so we sort of charge property
tax you could almost think of it like a
hosting fee for the land that's in world
so we sell people real estate that
essentially covers the cost to the
servers as we're putting them on we
basically auction it off where there's
contention between you know people as to
who wants what space and then we charge
you according to the amount of land you
have in world so if you have an acre of
land in second life which is a pretty
pretty good-sized space you'll pay us
about $25 us a month recurring for that
acre of land so it's a great it's a
great business even from the beginning
for us
five
well the furthest right right kinetic
energy is dangerous you can be hurt by
flying objects in second life but let me
back up and say one thing whether you
can be hurt or killed by flying objects
so to speak as it's consensual act in
second life but it's kind of neat
because it's based on the rights of the
landholder so what I mean by this is can
you be killed in second life well no not
in most places but let's say you're
walking into a western bar right and you
walk into this western bar and up at the
top of the up at the top of your screen
you see this little heart icon come on
which we don't know on right now that
heart icon means that in this place you
can be killed by by kinetic velocity and
so it's kind of cool so what it
basically means is you know weapons now
work and being killed basically means
you're sent you are taken away from that
space and you're sent to wherever home
is for you which is only one place in
the world so it's kind of a nuisance you
know it's a nuisance to be killed you
can't lose anything obviously in second
life because this is real this is
people's real lives in real content but
we just do that as a kind of an in
between so consensually if you agree
that the area you're in is deadly that
if the landowner sets it that way in
other words you consent by going there
you can get killed but it doesn't mean
you lose anything you know lose any
property
she oh right yes yes exactly wouldn't it
be fun but at this point there is no way
to take an avatar and you know beat them
and knock parts off of them no but we
think that's funny I mean if everybody
if everyone's adults and agrees why not
in fact we're working on stuff like that
right now yes yeah totally so yeah what
sort of parental controls do we have so
what we do and we've done this
electively is if you're 13 to 18 uh and
yeah self-identifying i'll go on though
to say why there's some real teeth to
that if you're 13 to 18 years old we put
you into a continent basically off to
the you know distant one side of the
other I want to tell you which we're
basically there are only 13 to 18 or 13
to 17 year olds in that continent and
like whyville or some of the other team
communities we vigorously encourage the
teens to report anyone who appears to be
an adult so what that does is because
you can't speak teen that that basically
means that you know in adults in terms
of protecting teens from adults and
adults kind of time to live in the teen
grid is very very short similarly we
encourage adults to report people that
they believe may be under age that are
in what we call the main grid which is
where everybody else is and in cases
where we find reports and it looks
likely that someone is underage we
demand proof of identity proof of age
fax documents things like that so we're
actually pretty aggressive about doing
that we don't have to do that we could
let everybody in sort of over 13 with
parental permission but we think that
it's the right thing to do you know
maybe we'll get so big that it'll be
difficult to do that or that will be
handled by users or something but today
that's that's that's what we're doing so
the parental controls are pretty
effective there's a place for teenagers
and they tend to get sent there if there
yes so in an exception to the sort of
usual kind of before we do try and look
for adult content things like that but
again that's not highly scalable we'll
have to figure out ways to have that
done by by users and other people help
yes but that you know you can monitor
what people what people are putting in
their pockets and what they're putting
in the world and take a look at it on
the main grid anything goes however
whole region's can be marked as mature
or PG so you can electively Nazi stuff
that's immature regions if you don't
want to yeah they're absolutely or any
other common we we have like a birthday
party ritual where we set you free and
put you in the main grille and turning
to it I haven't been to one of these
things in world but oh yeah it sounds
like kind of cool you know rite of
passage yes the cornfield so great I was
I was talking to a very well-known
internet CEO the other day who told me
that when he first locked in the second
life for the first time he was sent to
the cornfield immediately so the
cornfield is a penal calling if you get
in trouble in second life and I think
again the cornfield is probably a non
scalable little amusing idea but what
happens today is we can you can get
suspended in second life for like a
couple days or seven days and then you
can get kicked out you actually get put
up in front of a citizen board for
review if you're going to get kicked out
the cornfield is this weird purgatory
where we will sometimes send people to
sort of cool off and you can't get out
of it and it's it's absolutely hilarious
I mean you know it's it we have a very
small content development team part of
our magic is we don't develop any
content right but they occasionally get
to stretch their arms a little bit and
have fun and so it's this cornfield with
like an old like 1950s tractor you can
ride around it's just a huge cornfield
and then right in the middle of it
there's an old black-and-white
television that plays some of those like
recidivism you know like 1950s black and
white like you know you need to be good
to society Johnny and it's just this
this is Oh Johnny lied about lying that
it's it'll it'll kill you it's so funny
and it just plays forever you know so
it's also courted show you can stream
live music and live a video in the
second life as well so there are movie
theaters there's live music live music
is one of the big phenomena right now in
second life you think about it this is a
micro example of why what we're doing is
so so cool right you can go and show up
at a nightclub in Second Life stand on
stage
your avatar and basically play with
shoutcast live music that your piping
out of your studio directly in the
second life if you haven't tried this in
second life as an observer it is a
really eerie experience because you're
sitting there with your avatar sitting
around you know chit chatting with
people next to you at the cafe table and
like I'll walk in I mean I mean a little
little advantage to being me we all have
the same name i'm phillip linden
quarries corey linen all like walk in
and the performer will look at me and
then he'll be like Oh Phillip Linden in
the house you know I mean it's just
weird you know super super weird thing
where you're walking in as an avatar but
they're actually live people buy CDs
from each other leave tips and just
generally you can you can raise as large
an audience you know in second life on a
Friday night and live music is one of
the unfortunate man grids not up we
can't look up all the listings there's
like live music every night and there's
you know fifty or a hundred people will
be at one of those shows and I mean
that's the same as what you get on you
know Polk Street in San Francisco so
it's a really interesting phenomena and
you can ask people for money you can get
tips and linden dollars you can sell CDs
so that's really
oh I didn't know that homeless guy moved
into his apartment yeah we had a one of
our residents was staying with friends
because he lost his his place and he was
effectively homeless and they showed him
a second life and he's a pretty decent
musician so he started playing live
music put out a tip jar said I'm trying
to raise money to you know actually get
an apartment again and gather enough
money to move back into an apartment
yeah we've got I mean there's stories
like that I mean it's really a fun place
to work not just because we have kind of
an unusual internal culture I think in
some of the same way as Google does but
also just because what we're working on
is so neat I mean you get stories like
this all the time I mean there was a guy
on slashed out the other day who said
I'm an IT engineer in a country in which
the unemployment rate is twenty-five
percent he said but about half of my
income is second life so I'm about
halfway done with this problem you know
it's pretty interesting as little as we
can we keep a short term yeah
temporarily we kind of keep everything
we see financial transactions and chat
and instant messages that would be for
if somebody really gets in trouble you
know I mean if there's a warrant or you
know a federal you know something like
that happening we've never I don't even
think we've had to do that yet but we
keep a short trailing record of text and
then it's gone but again pragmatically
the world is so huge in the data volume
so large none of this stuff lives on a
real database we use my sequel for
central storage of some of these assets
but the actual simulator machines
themselves they're kind of like
in-memory data systems we don't even we
don't even attempt to use a real
database the transaction rate would be
vastly beyond even now what what what
you could do I think with it with
anything that's out there
I was currency get in the system and
can you show us the page where is it up
so we basically so we're like the
Federal Reserve we basically manage the
money supply that's a long conversation
but in essence we yet we act it we act
with the goal of stabilizing the money
supply we don't actually make money from
the currency although we charge a
percentage on currency exchange
transaction so we do make a revenue that
way but we basically manage like Alan
Greenspan the market and our target of
management is to keep that upper line as
stable as possible and you can see over
the last month the variances between 270
and 281 or so so the currency is
actually quite stable again the volume
is high there's about eight hundred
thousand dollars transacted I think last
month so it's already a fairly stable
market there are speculators there are
day traders in our currency so there's
lots of people in their trading trading
but but but you know / economic theory
that's actually a good thing you
actually want multiple day traders
fighting each other
objects with it
and they're got excited
server you can play back in
yes yeah we've already got most that
done so I mean there's there's a lot of
yeah we're also integrating Firefox or
more correctly we're integrating the
gecko core but Mozilla and so that's in
testing right now so that's going to
obviously let us bridge into pretty much
well all of the web yeah so you'll be
able to manipulate objects in world that
have web surfaces on them basically
they're connected to the web we already
do xml-rpc and email bi-directionally
today from the xml out an email in or
email out in XML our XML in from the the
web so that's how people do stuff like
you know you can make an object in
Second Life where you can click the
button and have a change something on
your website you talk to it web database
what else you had another one
yes
totally yeah so we've been approached by
pretty much everybody you know this
thing's kind of taken off in the last
few months our mission though is to is
to maintain a level playing field in the
level platform so we won't we as a
company won't do a deal pretty much with
anybody for almost any conceivable
reason and advertising is a great
example of that so we're encouraging
people to build advertising syndicates
and systems in world but if you talk
about like putting billboards in world
will never do that we've been approached
by people who are interested in doing
that but we just tell them well you have
to get you have to buy land if so if
you're an advertiser and you want to buy
real estate and put billboards on it hey
good for you it's on the website you
know you can buy land or buy land from
another user there's there's actually a
group of users who built a thing called
meta adverse that's actually a fully
automated system where you can get
billboards and bus signs and stuff from
them put them on your land and there's
thousands of people who have and then
they actually display ads when people
walk by the billboard you can see when
an avatar walks by and they actually
charge the advertiser and give some of
the money to the landowner in much the
same way I guess Google does with
AdWords
yes you can see everything I mean you
can see you can see the name of the
Avatar that's walking by you if you're a
billboard so you can record who probably
saw your advertisement very easily and
you know yeah that's right that's right
oh yeah you can tell where they looking
so yeah you can see if they're looking
spot on it your billboard no obviously
yeah i mean i mean i guess not totally
obviously but heck no we would never let
anybody see each other's demographic
information or anything else that they
didn't want to expose houses put across
country to usually us focus them well
it's mostly us right now we haven't
localized the client full double-byte
yet so as a result or even European
languages so so what we have we have the
chat system
right so we expect and hope that this
will really take off like in Asia as
we're able to start doing that which
will be soon but but today it's mostly a
European and North American phenomena
the UK is our big number two outside the
United States we always say that like
bad weather you know bad weather good
broadband and oppressive regimes are
really good reasons to people use second
life you laugh but second life competes
with the real world if you look at who
we're competing with we're just
competing with discretionary time it's
really interesting and you can see
patterns of that like in the United
States I'm going to be at like PC forum
and I what is it next week and talking
about this and I did an analysis that we
had never done before where I looked at
how many people per thousand people in
metro areas use second life and it's
totally like seattle point five like one
of the highest numbers in the country
right terrible weather good broadband is
really interesting there's sort of a
pattern around that Los Angeles in New
York lowest level of use now part of
that can be that those are huge metro
areas with larger populations that don't
have computers and stuff but still it's
a fascinating statistic big difference
between different areas
so IRS regulations what do we run into
well first of all just like eBay or
anything else if you're drawing money
from us you know if you're transferring
currency you're getting a wire transfer
into your bank account that's an income
of that you have to deal with that so so
first of all the problem is on you as a
person who's making money in the same
way that is if you're using ebay to make
money having said that though we reach
out to the different regulators and
government folks and like tell them
about what we're doing but frankly this
stuff is so early and so different that
a lot of them are just kind of I I don't
know what to tell you but we you know we
were you know a lot of this stuff is
just kind of new territory in terms of
what the the rulings will be but I think
I think with respect to making money
it's fundamentally and you know it's
it's fundamentally your problem because
there's an income event anytime you're
taking money out so it's now incumbent
on you as an individual to justify what
costs were or anything else you know in
your you know when you do your tax
return
yourself some dollars that we have
right people talk about that a lot I
really think that would be a long ways
off I mean where is the property I you
know I so people do have discussions
about that but I I can I would suspect
that it's going to be one of those
things where the governmental
regulations that will be hopefully
relatively consistent with rates of
fastest progress I mean I don't it's so
hard to imagine a regulatory scheme by
which you would measure the value of
your assets and second life but we
haven't been approached by anybody
talking about that but it is an
interesting kind of a intellectual
question how much money did Corey spend
during this and not he didn't I 38
linden dollars is it really holy moly so
30 times too but that's a lot of money
um star axons one is probably the
coolest single thing you can own in
second life so 30 bucks apiece yeah like
I say though seriously we had a user
conference and we had a bunch of our
users there and then we had a bunch of
lawyers there because we did at the
state of play conference in New York and
one of the attention getting things I
think we said a couple of times was look
you guys most of the people in the
audience that are that are doing
businesses in second life they make more
than you so just just you know keep that
in mind you know as we start I mean it's
it's really profitable right now because
it's an early stage market where people
are kind of plowing the dark right there
they're moving into the unknown they're
building all this new stuff that
nobody's ever seen so the opportunity is
enormous and that's part of the you know
the sort of pioneering feeling that that
permeates second life and brings people
in so quickly
how many of those messages hold I would
guess I mean you know we look at we yet
do you know we have a way to know that
like I said it's probably thousands and
like I said the there's like those
gotten that gun we looked at that's
similarly fancy and cool it's probably
in the five to ten thousand range now
maybe a bit more and like I said there's
the really amazing diversity question
you know how a second life different
than real life again let me say this
this is a world this is a tiny little
town right 150,000 people twenty
thousand people a day five thousand
people out on the street so to speak at
night that that in the last month people
have purchased 180,000 distinct things
so you go through this town and you'd
count all the purchasable things there's
180,000 of them okay two more questions
once i'm guessing that every user builds
a little replies a little bit you can
split them up into people who most
bill and mostly consumed what's the
population like how does that break down
so in the trailing seven days
seventy-five percent of the people have
made something from scratch and that's
with the demographic that has a median
age of 36 that's fifty percent would be
mailed by use it's astounding actually
you know let me let me add to that
though so there's there's playing around
and making things and then there's sort
of active production we've also watched
the rate of active production as a
fraction of the audience as a fraction
of the total user base we estimate if
you looked at Second Life about a year
ago you one of the statistics you can
look at is the number of buyers the
number of sellers in a cohort you say
how many people sold and how many people
bought that number today is about 75%
buyers and twenty-five percent sellers
so another way of looking at a
statistically suggest that about
twenty-five percent of the population is
creating content for about seventy-five
percent so we're still very young by
that metric let me go to you had a
question because we haven't heard from
you
what if he wants to think of another
atom object
what happens to everybody's article
so what he does is he actually records
everybody who bought it and he directly
males you in the system updates so part
of the reason he's been so successful is
everybody who has the one is talking
about oh well I got the new update today
and now it does cows or whatever because
remember the point of the one is the
ones basically an emoticon equivalent
for a 3d virtual world you hold the wand
while you're sitting around chatting and
all these random things appear because
all it's doing is parsing chat text so I
wasn't using it that way but if you're
actually having a conversation it's
basically like you're getting this sort
of emoticon equivalents around you all
the time yeah so so that's one of the
powers as well as that you have objects
that can update themselves dynamically
so now he built the system only yeah
yeah no we haven't built in like a fancy
update your version thing yet but you
know we could I mean it's just lots more
code it's already a lot of code so we'll
be here to hang around I know where I
