time ago I even have a tick tock here in
Google about six seven years ago anybody
immediately dangerous a small room and
so nowadays after a son and because of
the uncertainty about my squirrel we
decided to create them Maria DB version
my squirrel that the be guaranteed
always be free available without
commercial features and and we are
working very closely community to ensure
that in fact our employees they spend
forty percent of the time working
customers forty percent with the
community and twenty percent the kind of
a free project that is that they can
decide on that is good for them future
or the project that's we took actually
the idea from google have you given what
we how we make our living is that we
make we continue developing maria deeply
for customers we also give support for
both mysql emory idibia ok let's go
through more interesting things so what
is maria Debbie it's a branch of my
squirrel the text features and we call
it a branch instead of a fork because we
are one hundred percent compatible
compatible with my scale so we are
dropping replacement but with a lot of
extensions and we are compatible on the
library level and on the user level
internally we are doing a lot of changes
enhancements working both with the
community and with the customers to do
that there's a lots of patches out there
that never bent into my squirrel from
google from facebook from from others
and we are have their last year working
on getting those in and there's still a
lot of work so we hope to that by the
end of this year we should have all the
major patches in into it so we are and
that's the difference with drizzle
drizzle doesn't care about backward
compatible they had compacted
compatibility they are looking for at
what
they do and innovate and do something
different but that also means that if
you have my Skrill installation you can
never easily go to drizzle it's just too
different and it's also unclear when
this will be stable enough to be used in
production and it's more a kind of a
project where you can do much much more
things so we have open development model
all our mailing list survey regarding
development our lunch lunch pattern and
we actually work working with people and
they have it before we started there
were a couple other folks of MySQL that
was not happy with how my skull was
going those are people those folks are
not working on on Maria DB and we expect
them to interview to be totally
dependent on this one and base their
changes if ever needed two hours on
hours and current state so we released
Maria DB 542 our first stable release in
February and as this mysql 51 has been
stable a long time so why did it take us
a long time to do a stable release and
the major thing with my squirrel that
even if the server is open did the build
system the contagion and the
infrastructure to do packages is not so
and it was a long time to recreate that
and everything we have done is available
for free and favorite and in different
projects for example we are using
buildbot for the build system all the
chances we have changes we have done
it's contributed back to build but and
they accepted it and all the
instructions how to duplicate everything
we have done we have documented and you
can find out our wiki so before my
square is used to say you can work for
miles at my SQL anywhere no you can work
on my SQL anywhere so we changed kind of
that
we also made d beat maria de b-52 out as
beta and that has the changed that we
didn't have time to add to phi 1 but
basically 552 it should be a relatively
stable already because we have taken
things that has been into production
access and google patches are in their
practical years and we expect that
should be a stable release within 2-3
months and one big contrast from us and
oracle is that we actually do say
forward-looking statements that we
expect to keep so what's the difference
between 51 and mysql to today we have
lots of extra storage engines we have
using extra DB instead of in the DB x DB
is made by percona it's based on
the innodb plug-in plus google patches
plus work from microrna it basically
gives you the performance of the next
version of mysql in a stable release
today and with the stable release
another problem we had with 51 was that
when we started to put fight or run into
that our test system is running it'll be
many machines we noticed a lot of random
failures in all the tests cliff that
exists for MySQL so we spent basically
half a year by removing all compiler
warnings and making all these tests
reproducible and ensuring that no week
when the test fails we know that that is
actually a bug because we had no random
failures anymore the manor designed of
Taylor's was actually fatal bugs in
mysql that we have fixed some of those
who have contributed back to San Oracle
as some of them we have to have not
because son and a special raka has not
been responsive at all when we completed
contributes patches to them and if they
are not going to work with a community
why should the community work with them
so slow query log base to extend the
statistics so we are there lots of more
mation about slow queries microcircuit
second position process list so you can
do exactly with much higher position see
how long a quid has been running so we
have actually this is nice slide this
shows from where the different features
are coming I've actually go through all
of these features in detail so if you
know need to know more so the dread are
different storage engines that we have a
pull-up streams and the the green parts
are things that they got from third
apart parties from both whimper corner
and our Delta some of those may even
come from you from from you the blue one
is developed by us and then we are
pulling a lot of things from MySQL trees
that the Sun and Oracle has abandoned
the best thing with what happened lately
is that my skill was has been working
with six dot 0 for three years at least
been announced on every conference it's
coming it's coming now it scrapped and
lots of the code that is there including
the backup we never come into my
schedule is with and as although the
full optimizer team is not working for
me they thought that they didn't want to
abandon all this work that has that
spent years on doing so most of that is
backported to maria DB version but most
of that actually in in in fiber 3 but
then thread pool support and the
collation santa maria stories engines so
that in 51 we wanted to add ashlita
little ass to fire one as possible so we
know we would know that as soon as we
got all the test systems everything else
table we would have a stable release you
haven't got any notable bugs at all
since we released this couple months ago
so we are feeling quite fine about it
so we're first looking at the extra DB
story changes as i said is made by
pakona which is one of the biggest
support companies or act actually the
most active on outside of oracle and
I've been doing a great job I'm those
people actually coming from my square so
do you know what they're doing so the
improvements from will to cpu I think
that most of the Praxis comes from
google some of those actually been
developed by pakona much more diagnostic
they were it's a way to save the buffers
so if you want to have taken my scroll
down and have a very fast warm start you
can do that they betta industry
statistics and a lot of stuff and and
then the slow query log so we took per
core / cornice patches optimize it to
make it notable faster and had take less
code that's something what we do so when
we when you take a patch from community
we don't just take and apply it we
actually spend a lot of time to see that
how does it fit our infrastructure how
can we optimize it how can make it
smaller because many people out there
doesn't know you my skull code very well
and we can usually reduce it to usually
regarded use it to to third sometimes
half and get about fifty percent more
performance and that's something what
they do may be worth your community we
don't only text patches the actual
optimize it and weep anything Maria DB
we actually take responsibility of
keeping them up to date so with them by
adding information to them conf file
which is basically from SQL d you can
tell exactly what what you want to have
in the slow credit log and we should
have a example for about that so my
square you just you get some limited
information about the queries that takes
a long time
and in them slide below you can see in
red more information about the query if
it was in the query cache which section
is pretty important if you're using it
and how the joint optimizer use the
query because otherwise you don't know
that what's the reason for for for the
slowness and if you want to ever do
anything bugging especially for on a
place where you don't know anything
about this is extremely useful
information and we also added them mica
possession as you can see at the last
column here so you get more information
about the query because their drama time
is not good enough and this was added
last because we want to be compatible
with MySQL if it would have changed the
time two microseconds that could
probably have caused some problems for
with for some people so we'd take
extreme measures generally is to ensure
that we don't do anything that could
potentially crash of course when we add
more things to the information schemas
there's always a small chance of
something but we also also try to add
options to have a more compatible murder
so table elimination this is there for
the FI one day major new feature that we
have it's basically this was little
customer asked this for do because they
have a new dime in some new software
packages that day basically we'll have
one table they create a view of all
tables in the systems and then they just
select things from the view which makes
them queries against the database
extremely easy because you don't need to
know anything about the database you
just select the columns you want of
course it's a hell for the optimized
especially with my squirrel because it's
sad
it has to do a join of for 250 tables
which you'd actually not use in those
and Oracle and sequel server had an
optimization that they ultimately detect
things like that this is table that is
not used and removes that from the query
so customer asked us can you do that and
we added that so within a mantra maybe
we know how to NT employees we have all
the original core developers who knows
the MySQL code under working for us so
we can basically do any changes
everywhere the basically cover all code
in the server and most of the storage
engines but we don't have that much
knowledge about it in a DB but that's
why we have a close relationship with
back corner to ensure that that's done
and here's a lots of three four slides
about the table elimination how it works
in more detail I would just skip those
we only have four to five minutes and
but the slides will be available so you
can see basically here how it works and
which cases it will able be able to
remove tables and we are working on
extending this even more so you can be
and the main thing is that you can go in
many cases down to index only scanned
for tables that are not used that Mexico
couldn't do the form and of course this
only Maria DBS oh and we have we don't
expect my squirrel to have a pick me up
we know that drizzle has had some
interest in this patch and we have
worked with the diesel people so that if
they find something interesting in
Moorea DB they tell us and we tell them
here is the code here's the pet's health
works to give it to them so dick I use
it and we also monitoring what they are
doing and they
that hey this area little cool feature
and as long as it still keeps us on a
user level to be compatible with with my
scale then we are looking at include
including it so we have a good
relationship in working we also
extending Maria DB to have much more
plugins and and that that case in some
sense going in the direction for drizzle
but backward compatible but we also are
spending much more time to doing
interfaces that the personalized you
wanted a problem with drizzle is that
they are forcing interfaces or plugins
when it did it doesn't make a sense for
the current interface but they're not
changing it because they just they have
two minutes a minute developers but they
don't have many who has great knowledge
of all occurred and how it works
together so we spend a lot of time to do
it interfaces correctly and of course
when we have done something with
children still have you do it we have
done it so they can see that do they
want to use their implementation of ours
I actually have a slide for that yeah so
pigs team how many knows about PB XD
here one so this actually one of the
problem with evident America ecosystem
we have great technology we have a we
are using things like people still has
been around for three years is actually
in some cases much better than the DB
but because anybody outdoors and push
the house output put the information out
nobody knows about it that also one of
the problem we are facing with Maria db2
to tell people that hey we exist we are
better and he's here something that you
can do to make your application better
so P big P is little bit like in a deep
in the sense that it's a sectional it it
has
the versioning with the development is
there or the structure how they do
things is to total the difference in
that in the sense that the only bright
things sequentially so if you're running
on disks you get much better performance
on inserts magnitude better than innodb
can do until really theoretically they
will always be able to do the inserts
and deletes and updates better but of
course you have to have I didn't have
different performance in other cases but
as far away seen pbx T has a possibility
to become a great contender if not
winner in the Indian race of storage
engines for my scrum and we have a close
relationship with those it's included in
Moorea DB Sault Ste Marie a DB we take
them approach that we want all the
stories in vendors and developers has
been neglected by my squirrel to be
including my idea so you can easily use
it and we added storage engines also
very late even in a stable or beta
release as long as the storage engine
doesn't change the maria curl at all
because if you don't use it it has no
impact at all but if you use it then you
have course are bound by the quality of
the engines and we have extended show
engines show to show which engines are
of each quality but we need to get
technology out and not just keep it away
from from people and here's some more
information about BMX team and you can
just almost as fast as I telemetry
readers
and the interesting thing of it pbx t is
also that you can do replication no of
MySQL through the logs in pbx T which
means that you can a bit normal overhead
fortification goes down to 142 one-fifth
so you can get five certification if you
only use in PB XD and we are looking at
see that can we use that in general in
for Maria DB to get that faster to get
replication faster but for those and the
different but what's it order difference
will be b xt first is that this
community developed all the road maps
and everything that happened it's
available you can go to you can
communicate with the developers on the
maria DB develop a sleaze took a quick
of course you can contact them directly
also and so you know what happened you
can work with them and do if there's a
bug you know when and if it would be
fixed because they will tell you not not
like a black hole that is a B&amp;amp;B in the
DB for years they have also done a lot
of study of SS trees SSDs and they are
optimizing it fall for that somebody
upcoming features are in memory tables
because the design is very suitable to
also keep things in memory and the pbx t
guys are looking at them the the backup
that oracle has disappointed in 60 and
as far as we know we never happened in
any community version of mysql we are
looking at working on to ensure that
that will happen in maria DB that was
something that comma come out from my
school conference lately where as far as
I know nobody of you have attended so
the Maria storage engine this actually
has been a great source of confusion
because when I went out from son
almost one year two months ago we were
working internally Maria stories engine
that was meant to the place in a DB and
when I went out from San I took some of
the Maria DB team with me and we thought
that ok we will go out with work with
son to ensure that them it always be in
ribbit replacement and then couple
months later occur suddenly bought son
and the reason for doing Maria DB was
not as important as before we still
going to go to complete it but no we see
it's much more important to ensure that
there is a free version of MySQL than a
free version of in the DB and that's why
I develop and the last year has been
almost one hundred percent on Maria DB
and then we kind of kind of got into the
confusion that we were we thought that
okay we need to change the name of my
scale because we don't want to conflict
the Oracles trademark I never thought
Maria DB kind of the logical name
because we are working on them Maria
storage engines for yes but of course
people find the cause was confused so
what is money is it the engine or the
server and that's why we lunched at the
user conference a contest to rename this
the engine to something is something
different and we will announce that as
soon as we have looked at the results
and we come home from here whenever we
are able to fly out from us that's the
different issue so with Maria the engine
we are it's a crisis if my item so that
we do the playthings or on a crash is
that it's based on Maya some code with a
lot of work and development and we are
very close to adding transactions than
we normally be rude i completed it a
long time ago but because of the focus
of all maria DB we haven't but we did
our group commit to get the much higher
speed for it
and we use it internally for temporary
tables when the heat tables is not big
enough because normally in mysql if eep
tables for temple he gets the big
receipts to my awesome table the problem
with myosin table see that all the
records are always stored on disk and
for its record facial fits we actually
do a discreet operating system vista
across cast at sbisa with my with maria
storage engine will actually catch the
record said a memory so this in practice
this means that Maria DB should be
faster than my square when a complex
queries maybe actually have to hit disk
in normal cases so the tread fully
support this was something that we did
for customers I i did for customers four
years ago it was added to 60 but i
wanted to have it in 51 but back four
years ago they said that 51 will be out
in a couple of months so we can't do
anything with it of course it took three
years almost to get 51 out after that
and i always thought it was ashamed that
we never got this nice feature in so
this was one the first thing that I
backported to maria DB from 60 so it
normally you have one process by thread
type a pack sorry one thread per
connection in my mal and that works
reasonably well but if you want to have
a couple hundred thousand connections to
to my squirrel it doesn't work or are
you also had a problem if you have lots
of running queries at the same time you
get a lot of context switches which is
not good so with this one you say that
you see you tell how many trades you
want to have running the queries at the
same time and then we take one trait one
query at a time and where we have n
threads running we don't take more
queries
finished and that worked very good for a
customer the problem was that if you
have thin running queries and you have
put this up to 10 you can't anymore
login to the mouse cursor and see what's
happening because oil treads are
occupied and I fixed that by allowing
you to use both models at the same time
so you can have depending on the port or
have you connect you can either say that
does this connection use the trade pool
or the one tread pattern by connection
so you get the best of both words so I
would say that if you are rather you
know that you have a lot of short
running selects running at the same time
you put those into thread pool and stir
and statistics queries and then you have
something that you need need need no
this has to be executed you just put
them into one trade / connection we had
a nucleation so what's why is it what's
the big deal with the collation the
thing was that the creation collation is
actually pretty different from all the
regulations in maryland and the divinely
support in upcoming 55 or 60 for the for
this one so and we got connected on them
IRC by by some people in crisis said
that they are going to decide here on
university or government level I don't
remember just now that database we
should use there's no freeze database to
support the creation collation so if you
don't get the solution for this in some
weeks the problem has to go to oracle or
some other database commercial database
just for the whole infrastructure
croatia and everybody did the one thing
that was missing was this one so we
implement this in about three days for
them and they were happy so that's kind
of have you tried to work with community
somebody is in crisis we help and that
was a
and we did get some help from people at
that time with his son to get this done
but they couldn't add that into him the
FI one beaker because they haven't
strict the rules for what can be done in
a stable release this perfectly safe but
it just doesn't work it has always been
hard not always but the last eight years
have been incredibly hard to get any
changes done in my squirrel that was one
reason drizzler was created Brian acre
was so fed up that he couldn't get his
own changes that is a deemed critical
into the mysql server just because some
money that told him that hey we want to
do people do a really soon you can't do
anything even if an everybody didn't
know that the release is terrible yes
away and that was why Driscoll was
created a frustration for getting
anything done we are fixing that we
don't want anybody to be frustrated if
you even give us a patch we will always
be there's always somebody a DB version
where we can add the patch if it makes
sense for the larger community so we
have no y 1 is closed there we can only
do bug fixes 52 is in beta we can do a
little more flexibility to there but not
new features but if you notice that
something is missing for making this
feature useful because they'll do it and
everything else goes in the file tree of
course we own that stable features to a
tree so the Federated X this is from
Patrick Galbraith he was the one who
wrote them original federated engine in
my scale affiliate engine allows you
front one mysql server connect another
server i and phase ii formations and
when he quit mysql mysql stopped all
development of a federated and the
people paying customer reported bugs my
skirt said it is not a supported future
anymore even if the cut custom had
depended on it and instead of working
with by the gullibility actually wanted
to work with Simon
they just deprecated engine and that we
know that there was lots of customer
user depending on it so we actually have
worked with Patrick taking in the newest
version that has been keeping up to date
putting into Maria DB put it into the
test system helped him actually to fix
some issues with it and that's just the
better federated a federal things in
that instant my scar server so I'll 10
minutes okay I always taken great pride
in working with people and not I unused
as a community and ensure that their
needs are satisfied I really hate the
fair the fact when you say say something
is deprecated just for your own
convenience when you know that other
people are using it that's also on the
reason i'm working on Maria DB I would
hate that the oldest 20 years and more I
spent to the server will be just wasted
because or a couple close of development
and I don't want that to happen I would
I feel bad about everybody every single
person who is using my scale depending
on it and suddenly confused it anymore
that's why we are doing this and my
other people in my team feel the same
won't be want to contribute we want to
make people happy that's why working out
open source so compatibility we are
dropping replacement look libraries are
one hundred percent the same you can
cook you can connect with mysql library
to maria DB vice versa it just works and
we have people just on IRC just said
that tried it no no issues of course you
get more features with us so there's a
not necessary that you can go back
easily below the dump of course if you
use a creation collation of us pbx team
dr. doom back but we are basically the
big brother of of my square and we are
insured we are compatible so for each
least we do the people in the latest
changes for my squirrel
s those in a beta test system that MySQL
has usually we have to fix a lot of
things and they meet you at the list and
Moscow maria da 51 is come compatible
with my square Phi 1 whenever mysql
fight at five is released we were pissed
maria DB version and make that
compatible with 55 so we will always be
ahead and they're closed source features
that oracle is no developing people are
base to try to replicate those in
marietta be so infrastructure or digital
told about that that no the
infrastructure is free we have removed
music set we have better test shoot the
animal compiler warnings so it my belief
is that Maria DB is a stable version of
my scrub we know that there's faith the
box that they haven't haven't fixed and
we know that we have a stable test
system that my school doesn't have so in
52 we had virtual columns users that use
a status aversion to that's basically
index and table statistics that them you
should already know in Google I think
you have those in your build they have a
party partitioner p cash that basically
it one of the biggest problem with my
eyes them for poor performance point of
view is that we have a global mutex on
the key cash that actually has topped us
for performing in in a heavy multi-core
environment good that's no fixed and we
are adding new engines from the
chameleon theme to it let's see so this
is basically the virtual columns patch
where we you can basically have a column
that is calculated you can even if you
index it we actually might realize it
but you will not have to maintain
yourself just a bad you can do it the
same thing with trigger this is just
much more elegant and if it's not
materialized it's faster and easier
and what will happen beyond 52 we have
we have our development team the damn
the optimizer team especially had
backported a lot of the works work of an
optimized that had worked the last three
years on so the mysql vitatree the work
is almost complete we are not only
backport that they are greatly enhance
it and but how my optimizer pip team
says it basically we had taken five
years leap forward in the optimizer
works in mysql so in the 53 sub-queries
a performant joints are better with we
see improvements of 10 200 times for
more complex queries and and maybe
should the guys actually won't abuse us
to do a bit of the user conference but
the thing just made fighter to bed time
couple of weeks ago but you can't really
have to be at us so find the trees and
Freddie but we will keep up it up for a
couple of months to see that order or
the additional features like dynamic
columns so you can different rules can
have different number of columns we also
add them heap tables with bar chart and
blob support we want that to get that
into 53 and then after the summer baby
beds could be a pepper and we will have
a phone home feature which basically you
can opt it will be turned off by default
but we can you can basically turn it on
silica its statistics of body adb uses
specifically which feature are you use
because one of the biggest problem in
development database is to know what
features are people using racial with
put your sources so we really want to
know what people are used in production
so we know that Oh txt is heavily used
then we can add more resources for that
one and of course all the statistical
collects we will have them publicly
available but of course not so you can
track individuals we will basically also
match
we can't even track dos but we Bieber
you want to show people how Maria DB and
in some sense mysql is used and we are
working with community so in it there's
still room for things in 53 if people
work with us you can still get it in
order once it gets in five and five four
and if you notice we are doing three
releases this year we expect that that
that very soon we will do wonder least
basically a year but there's just so
much interest in getting things in that
we are over will be good patches and we
want to have dispatched out as soon as
possible so that was almost 10 minutes
so questions yes it's part of a test
shoot and so that means that for each
push we do a full pissed on I think 17
platforms we hoped expanders to 2030
over time and embedded is part of it so
it's supported oh sorry the question was
will be support the embedded server and
actually the emitter service something
that has been greatly forgotten within
my square land i think that's it's a
great piece of work and if it's just sad
that it's not as used because it can
give you two times improvements or 10
times improvements if you have short
queries by embedding things into your
server yes
I mean we did release the question was
what's the largest database that we know
of it is usable Maria DB we just
released it with and as my squirrel we
don't require people to register or
download so we don't know we only know
that lots of people have downloaded some
twenty thirty thousand and we haven't
got a single complaint okay we go to one
complaint but that was something we
fixed a cup a couple of minutes but yep
so in five dot one mysql inter to use
partitioning of course we are based on
51 so we have that too they are added
some more extensions to that in 55 and
when Biggers when fighters fighters RC
we also have that amarilla DB the
problem with that is that is not really
taking care of at the optimizer level
especially there is no work going on as
I far as I know that you can do parallel
query on the different partitions but
it's more question that if you have a
query that way you use the partition as
a key like we can find the correct
partition no there's not much work on
doing that with in murrieta bit self
what other he'll be working with storage
engines like Cal poynton and scale DB
that does that on the storage engine
level automatically and they create a
big claim that they have tremendous
performance improvements for doing that
so I mean we are trying to do we are
trying to handle the upper level and let
the story 700 the lower level that's
much better than adding partition upper
level yeah
so here so if you look at what was
originally said in the okay sorry the
question was that originally in a manual
ten years ago we had a big statement
that that we don't have transactions you
don't need them and no then somebody can
say that we did a 180 degrees turn if
you go and look at all the cumin tation
we said that that for many applications
you can overcome transactions you don't
need them in main application and atomic
operations is enough with atomic
operations basically means that if you
get the crash you don't lose data it's
still atomic my square didn't have
atomic transaction Bavarian already
planning to do a crash safe myosin so
basically have an internet transaction
but you can't be basically use commit so
the big argument back then was uni
really need roll back as a command in
your applications and I never had to use
roll back ever as a command for the
rolling back because if you curl your
things to properly you can avoid
drawbacks but we of course we also
joined position and explain where we are
usable we also said that of course there
are things that require transactions the
various question about what's the
importance of transactions and a hickey
Tori the water of a nerdy beam came to
me that was about ten years ago and said
that they are having a great
transactional database and you want to
have it I said of course you want to
have it because the DB will my square we
can only satisfy maybe seventy percent
order of the needs back then the
transactions because support ninety-five
percent of the needs so just quite so
patient where you
go and where you want to do what you
want to do there's still a lot of people
who are using my IM and only my asset
just because it satisfy the needs and
the extra performance the gates form it
is worth it but of course then you had
to see that what can you afford to lose
if you can't afford to lose anything
then you had to do they use atomic
operations like my eyes Maria no support
today doesn't tell transactions with
this atomic so you never lose anything
it has automatic rollback which is not
transactions and many of them SQL
databases they know that have
transactions they have a because you
can't combine things into many instances
but they do have many of those atomic so
you don't get the hafting written
somewhere so that you get to crash your
database is destroyed more things so in
that case if your questions where we are
is a total up and you can find all
developers on the maria channel at
freenode we don't have any internal
channels so you can see what we are
discussing they're all our
communications are going to develop
minnesota maria developers list on lunch
pad you can participate we are doing
things what you would expect from an
open source project to be able to commit
you need to show that you are clever
enough you don't will not cost any bugs
and you can understand that you need to
do reviews before you commit but we do
have committed outside of our company
doing commits to maria DB we expect that
to be bigger but we want to ensure that
everything is properly reviewed before
it before it's pushed but then we have
an active develop athletes the people
who are more unsure can just post apache
nods to be included and the and if it
makes sense be included if not we tell y
and demi discuss ever so that's what you
expect from open source project and we
are working
hundred percent natural like that so
Maria DB is not a project of multiple
maybe we adjust the driver and enabler
of it anybody can participate anybody
can become a driver we are open so thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
