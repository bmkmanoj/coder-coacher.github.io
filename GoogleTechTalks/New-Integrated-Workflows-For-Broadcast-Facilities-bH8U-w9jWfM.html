continuing TV speaker series today we
have Chris Lennon from Harris systems
for Harris Corporation rather he's been
working in the TV industry for about 20
years now he's driven several
significant standards such as PC MP
which allows distribution of program
specific information for ATSC digital
broadcasting currently he's in the
middle of wrapping up a truly monumental
standardization effort which is going to
be the next generation trafficking a
billing system so allowing broadcast to
share information about available
available spots people to reserve those
spots reporting billing etc it's going
to close the final ballots going to be
in the next few weeks we can expect to
be rolled out on Moss in 2007 so this is
going to be what we're looking at is
going to be the way the industry
operates for the next couple years so I
anticipated being very interesting also
one thing remember this is going to be
on google video so when we asked
questions internally let's make sure we
don't ask anything confidential so Chris
graduated from college of McMaster
University in Ontario as I mentioned
he's been working in TV for 20 years
even at harrahs for the last 16 years
and he's currently the director of
integration and standards in the
software systems group and the standard
easement talk to us about is Cynthia s20
is the simply 2021 that's being brought
together by the S 2210 working group so
those are the magic strings you can
search for any Internet to learn about
it and without further ado here's Chris
alright thanks Jeff as Jeff said I'm
here to talk about the the bx f project
within within cynthy and as a quick
intro to this the the problem this was
initially targeted at solving was
traditionally in the broadcast industry
we've it's been a terrible mess of
proprietary one-off interfaces and
literally I'm not and I'm not
exaggerating when I say there have been
hundreds of these interfaces created
over the years connecting systems
allowing them to exchange metadata
exchange schedule information that type
of thing it's just been a terrible mess
for customers and for vendors alike so
that was the initial
this was targeted at solving and it grew
a little bit out of that but we've we've
done I think a pretty good job of
keeping the scope fairly reasonable so
that's just a quick background of what
this is what it was initially targeted
at and hopefully by the end of this talk
you'll have a pretty good understanding
of what it is what types of work flow it
enables that a lot of these things and
for those who who aren't very familiar
with the broadcast industry a lot of
these things here might not seem
revolutionary to you but they are
revolutionary in the broadcast industry
some things you might take for granted
in the broadcast industry just that they
don't they don't work as smoothly as you
might think today there are a lot of
systems in place in broadcast facilities
right now that have been there for 10 20
30 even 40 years so the lot of the
technology is not exactly leading edge
so when you're talking about things like
this this this truly is leading edge in
the broadcast technology area so let's
go ahead and begin how do we describe
the environment in today's typical
broadcast facility and if you ask the
typical broadcaster you'd get well you
know if he was politically correct you
might say exciting chaotic certainly it
is quite chaotic when I when I talk
about these hundreds of different
proprietary interfaces going back and
forth exchanging data certainly from a
systems perspective it's quite chaotic
it you could even could even use the
word dizzying its mess is a good word to
describe the way data flows in a
broadcast facility right now it's it's
quite a miracle that the pictures and
sound get on as professionally as they
do when you when you look the under the
covers and see how do these places
actually operate it's a it's quite a
mess right now so my my personal
politically correct way of
characterizing the broadcast environment
is dynamic and it certainly is dynamic
today and with the advent of digital
television a lot of the new technologies
that broadcasters some of being forced
kicking and screaming to
come up into the 21st century it's it's
been a bit of a challenge there's a few
significant trends that have been been
driving us in the direction of new
technology most significantly are a few
of them here the storage metadata or
storage media area where we're going
primarily from a linear tape-based
operation where you actually have have
the content on magnetic tape and being
run off of magnetic tape and and when
you're talking about episode 5 of
friends I can actually put it in my hand
and feel it and hear it is moving
totally away from that to nonlinear
types of delivery file based storage and
you know would you say tape is dead no
not quite but since death throes that's
for sure then the whole analog to
digital area on the consumer side we're
all familiar I think with the fact that
television is going largely analog to
digital the HDTV movement is becoming is
finally getting the momentum that people
were hoping it would have for the for
the last several years and and over the
last one or two holiday seasons it's
really it's really done well and I've
seen just for for this holiday season
you're getting you're finally getting
decent HD sets down under the
thousand-dollar level and and really in
getting LCD stats growing in size
there's a lot of technology that is
there's pushing pushing this forward a
lot quicker now than it had been yeah it
had always been a yoke in the broadcast
industry for a long time that digital
television was always ten years away but
now you really can see that it's not
that far away and in fact analog
television is due to turn off in in less
than three years we're only two and a
half years away from analog television
signal ceasing to be sent across the
airwaves so but that's the part that's
visible where I say on this slide here
it's not just in the transmission area
and a lot of even broadcasters get
caught in the trap of saying the digital
transition well it's just the fact that
I'm now transmitting bits rather than
you know analog waveform
but that's not that's the easy part as
far as I'm concerned that that the fact
that you're transmitting in digital
means you have to change everything
upstream to digital in order to to make
this all work within your plant so
there's there's a very significant
domino effect that's taking place in
broadcast pills facilities as a result
of the consumer end of shift from analog
to digital then finally and this goes
along with the the whole digital area is
the area of embedded metadata and I
don't know if you're familiar with
things such as a AF and mxf which are
some some newer standards that have that
have emerged to allow embedded metadata
along with the digital content that's
the beauty of digital content you can
embed metadata right along with it and
doesn't have to be decoupled so those
are just some significant trends here so
in the area of content distribution you
can see we had the guy you're friendly
UPS guy delivering tapes every day to
the TV station well the UPS and FedEx
and all those guys must be really
feeling that the pinch of this because
across 1700 TV stations or so just in
the United States think about the number
of tapes that were flowing in and out of
there when you have one tape /
commercial / program that's a lot of
tapes going back and forth every day to
all these all these facilities and
that's by and large being replaced by
digital delivery by by satellite fibre
channel even over the Internet so the
major change there you also have eyes
talking about decades-old systems and
it's it's not an exaggeration to say
several broadcast facilities are using
systems that are 30 40 years old and
they're still using them today it's a it
hasn't the the broadcast industry
probably hasn't evolved at the rate that
a lot of other industries have and now
they're having to make quantum leaps
rather than having a gradual evolution
over the last few decades they're having
to jump into modern technology all of a
sudden from stuff that was built back in
the 60s in some cases so it's a it's
been exciting and a painful time to be
in the broadcasting area so
for this is my before and after kind of
picture a broadcast facility had and it
has more than this but here are four
distinct areas within a broadcast
facility airtime sales were actually
selling the commercial content that's
going to go on your on your signal
content scheduling where your scheduling
programs digital asset management you're
managing all those all those video
assets that you've got and then you've
got the the automation area which is
actually automating all that putting it
to air getting your transmission on the
air and before those operated really is
completely separate islands you had you
know one area and they finish their work
with something and they hand it off and
say okay it's not my problem anymore
it's your problem you deal with it so
this is the way it was and this is the
way it was for you know since the pretty
much the inception of television up
until a few years ago and I got a little
carried away with animations here but
you had things like you know floppy
diskettes and people handing pieces of
paper back and forth and some of the
some of this you know believe it or not
still exists today and you know of
course you had just stacks of paper and
it's funny when you're talking about the
whole business here is his video content
but it was the whole business was very
very paper driven so anyway this is it
was it was a real mess of what you what
you had in this area and this really led
to what I'm terming here the digital
meltdown what this this chart is
illustrating for you is if you start
down on the on the lower left where
you've got your advertisers and I think
everybody here is familiar with the fact
that advertisers now are wanting to get
their message to more people across more
mediums get it probably more targeted in
a lot of cases and so they're putting a
lot of pressure on broadcasters in that
area and then on the other side of the
very top you've got the content owners
and these would be the people who
produced the actual program content that
the commercials are being inserted into
they say on the other hand well I need
to protect my rights with it because the
fact that I'm making these making this
available digitally means it can be
easily pirated copied without a loss of
quality
as it's being copied so you have them
putting the pressure on the
broadcaster's saying yeah you need to
get this out to consumers on various
platforms but protect it so the the
lowly broadcaster then has all this
pressure being put on them to do all
these new things but do it cheaper in
with fewer people you know there aren't
big new budgets within broadcast
operations to to do delivery to mobile
devices for instance so that sort of
thing they're just expected to do it and
find a way to do it and and hopefully do
a cheaper so it's it's led to a to a
real problem it on the far right the the
last part I've got here is talking about
the many platforms that you're not just
talking about somebody sitting in their
living room in front of the television
anymore television content the fact that
it's that it's all digital now could be
delivered to a vast array of platforms
some of which you can imagine now some
of which we probably can't even imagine
that it will be delivered to just some
background for those who aren't all that
familiar with the the evolution of
broadcasting this is a just kind of an
overview of the of what what has taken
place over the last few decades in the
area of broadcasting you started out in
the 70s and 80s where you've got free TV
and that's the dominant means of getting
content and advertising to two people
all the advertising revenue is pretty
much based on ratings at that point
again people sitting in the living rooms
broadcast and cable TV or the the major
means of getting that content to people
of course you've also got you know
cinema regular old television and VHS
tapes and it's all analog when you're at
that point then you shift into the 90s
and the turn of the century here you get
I'm characterizing that it's a
subscription pay-per-view gear up where
that became a a pretty dominant force
revenue it becomes more based on
subscribers rather than I balls that are
that are being counted in ratings you
know things such as pay-per-view video
on demand satellite TV come in digital
cinema it starts to come in DVDs video
games etc
then moving out from from now to you
know the next 15 years or so looking
forward I'm characterizing that as a
transactional consumption hira is what
we're moving into their much more
targeted advertising value-based you
have electronic download of content
interactive TV which has had some some
problems getting getting going and it
remains to be seen how much of a success
that's going to be but you shouldn't
discount it completely games your
ecommerce or got some people in
broadcasting term T commerce where
you've got commerce through your
television set and as we discussed
high-definition television being a major
factor their mobile television internet
television online gaming there's several
and you know you can go nuts with that
list of the things that are coming down
the road but that's just some of them so
that kind of characterizes where we've
been where we've been going here the
biggest thing though within broadcast
facilities has been these technical
limitations that you've got have been
vanishing and so there were good reasons
why in a lot of cases and in some cases
not so good reasons but in a lot of
cases they're been good reasons why they
didn't evolve and why you have these
systems that have been in place for
decades but a lot of those those have
been disappearing lately and as a result
that the target for broadcasters
recently has been more work flow and
that's if you go to trade shows in the
broadcast area now it's all about
workflow workflow workflow how do we
make this all work better if it goes
back to that digital meltdown slide that
I had where where I discussed the fact
that they're getting all this pressure
to do all these new things but no more
money to do it with so they have to they
have to improve the way things operate
within their plants become more
efficient do you know we all do more
with less type of thing so the
traditional approach that they've that
the broadcast industry has had for
connecting systems has been largely
point-to-point solutions I've got system
a needs to talk to system B the two
vendors get together work out a way to
to do that as a result you have a whole
collection of proprietary interfaces
which by their very nature they're not
extensible they were built to solve
today's problem and you know if my
requirements change two or three years
from now there's no easy way to extend
those it's they're very static oriented
interfaces largely batch in nature as I
was talking about with the different
islands within a facility one area
finishes their work and hands a file off
or if you're unlucky a piece of paper
off to another system so very bat
oriented file-based when you have
exchanges that the whole concept of
messaging between systems truly is a
revolutionary thing in this industry and
these interfaces for them for the most
part we're computer friendly certainly
certainly not people friendly if you
look at a lot of these protocols they've
just looked like gobbledygook to most
people there but they were you know they
were built for a purpose they were built
using 10 20 30 year old technology so
you have to understand where they came
from two to see why they are the way
they are so the solution is the XF the
broadcast exchange format and this is
something that a couple years ago I
formed a group within simply which is
the Society of motion picture and
television engineers which is the major
standard-setting body for television and
for digital cinema and i took this
problem to them and said my company at
the very least harris corporation has
literally we alone have hundreds of
proprietary interfaces that we have
built over the years to connect systems
and we're really not interested in
continuing in that direction we'd like
to we see an opportunity for
Standardization here and so we started
this group a couple years ago and it's
it's grown to a very large group like I
said over 80 corporations involved in
this hundreds of people involved in the
in the effort and we'll get a little bit
later in to where this is and in the
status of the group but suffice it to
say this is not smoke and mirrors this
is this is something real and about to
be implemented in the in the industry so
what is it in the the initial scope i
can if i distill it down to
it's its simplest level it's a single
protocol as we have here for exchange of
content and event-related and when I
talk about event-related it's more
schedule related type things I've events
the need to take place at particular
times so you've got the content which is
actually the programs on commercials and
then when are these supposed to be
broadcast out to the consumers and
primarily it was initially designed to
work among these four types of systems
program management those who manage
program rights when am I allowed to air
this particular episode or this movie
that sort of thing traffic systems which
traffic systems primarily primary role
is to schedule advertising and to
optimize revenue for for broadcast
operations does a lot more than that but
that's the that's the bottom line
automation systems which actually put
all the spots and in programs to air and
then the the one that was added very
quickly after we formed the group was
content distributions this is where I
was talking about UPS and FedEx being
kind of put out of the delivery business
in leith the broadcast area of
delivering these tapes this all being
delivered by my digital content delivery
companies who have relationships with
the major studios who produce all these
programs with the various ad agencies
and advertisers for delivery of their
commercials so there's some people
making very good businesses out of out
of just the delivery of those those
files now what technology is behind the
XF it's XML the the base of the standard
is it's a schema we have been very
careful to build in what I'm terming
informal extensibility into the into the
schema we acknowledge the fact that if
we decided to try to build a schema that
was the be-all and end-all and would do
everything for any everybody we'd never
get it done so our goal very very
quickly became build something that will
that will be a solid foundation upon
which we can build on so it covers you
know eighty to ninety percent of the
requirements of the industry right now
but you're always going to have things
that that one system wants to exchange
with another cyst
that no two other systems will ever want
to exchange does that belong the
standard know so what we did is a lot of
extensibility within it informal
extensibility areas we call private
information that allow you if you have
something that's not covered by the
standard you don't just say well I can't
use a standard it doesn't do what I need
it to do there are places you can put in
your little proprietary things if you
want to add those in those extensions
it's also totally transport independent
if you want to to use this to exchange
files still and again like I said there
are old systems here that may not be
easily upgraded to something that would
be capable of changing dynamic messages
back and forth they may be stuck with
file exchanges so you know we permit
file exchanges using this protocol I
think the the more likely scenario
thought of the more modern systems will
be it'll be message based you know using
soap and similar technologies to
exchange XML messages back and forth
dynamic exchange of information rather
than getting away from the traditional
that I was talking about the batch
exchange of data between systems so
let's talk about a few of those systems
that are involved the content
distribution systems as I said today
largely content does arrive in the form
of files and that's been as I said a
revolutionary thing in the industry that
it wasn't that way a few years ago and
the beauty of that of course is the the
essence and when I talk about essence
essence is the video the audio and video
components essence arrives with metadata
the the symptom of content is content
equals essence plus metadata okay so
that's you'll hear me talk about essence
a metadata those are the two components
of content you're in the scenario now of
minutes versus hours or even days to get
new content so you can you can have
systems now request dynamically new
spots new programs and actually get them
in a matter of minutes rather than
having to pick up the phone call the
distributor say hey I need this program
right need the spot and it'll say well
okay it'll be in tomorrow's FedEx
shipment a whole lot a whole lot quicker
more efficient now we also within vxf
support pusher pool models so either the
content distribution person if they
suspect or know or suspect that a
particular broadcaster is going to need
a piece of content they can push it down
along with its metadata to them or you
can you can do a pull back from the rod
caster to say hey I just got this spot
at it I need that you need to air this
McDonald spot this afternoon they don't
have it in house can you deliver it to
me they can make that request using vxf
another significant area of impact of
the bx f standard is in the area of what
we call ingest and ingest is the
ingestion of video content into your
broadcast facility so that it's ready to
air what this enables using bx f you can
have fully automated ingest again the
old model here was you know once you get
that tape in which may take a matter of
days to get that tape in and now you
have to have a highly paid and highly
skilled operator load that into it into
a VTR shuttle it along say okay here's
the start of it type in the metadata
that's associated with it make sure that
video quality is okay go to mark the end
point and then say okay copy this to a
video server so that i can actually air
this so very very labor-intensive time
intensive process this can become fully
automated these are being delivered as
files they have metadata along with them
you have the bx f standard that enables
you to request that metadata and request
the content down once it comes down the
system that receives it can recognize
what it is and automatically ingestive
have it ready for error again in a
matter of seconds or minutes rather than
hours or days so that's that's the the
quick overview of that another major
impact that bx f is anticipated to add
in the broadcast area is the area of
sales sales has had for a long time the
desire to sell spots right up to the
last minute or the last second however
there's been operational reasons within
broadcast facilities they couldn't do
this and some of these we already talked
to that then it's not just linear
schedules we're talking about with 30
sec
spots it's becoming more and more common
to sell secondary events so you have the
the program squeezed up into a
particular region of the screen and you
run a spot or a promo in you know in
parallel with the programming or the
they sponsor a little graphic that comes
up and spins around or you know little
guy walks across the bottom of the
screen make money off of all that and
sail the broadcast sales people have
recognized the the fact that they can
make money off of all these different
things they're not just constrained to
30-second chunks of time throughout the
day so so it's it's enabled them to make
more money out of the same schedule that
they've that they've always had and
obviously competition with new nitez
media is driving this that they have to
find new ways to make money because the
this lead the advertising pie is being
sliced thinner and thinner whereas
television used to have a very large
chunk of that pie now a lot of those
advertising dollars are going to people
like Google and other people in
different media it's not that I don't
think advertiser is spending that much
more money it's just this it's getting
sliced up smaller and smaller so the
broadcaster's chunk of this is smaller
so they have to find new and innovative
ways to get more money out of the
pockets of the advertisers and of course
the XF enables all of this this dynamic
selling of inventory the scheduling area
obviously major impacts there as
broadcasters move from traditional
single channel operations to within a
digital realm multi-channel is suddenly
quite possible the in the same bandwidth
that they used to use to broadcast one
signal with today's compression
techniques you can you can easily get
four to six broadcast channels in that
same bandwidth and that's only going to
improve as compression improves and
that's that's using mpeg-2 that's not
even using mpeg-4 which now the industry
is starting to look even more at mpeg-4
which pretty much doubles what you can
do so the is you can imagine scheduling
becomes far more complex when you're
talking one channel versus perhaps 10 to
12 channels and this is without even
buying any additional spectrum this is
using the same spectrum they've always
had and one
interesting thing is that the FCC does
not dictate how how that spectrum is to
be used other than your primary channel
so you have three or four secondary
channels that you're broadcasting you
could do whatever you want with us and
people you know they're talking about
doing your nonlinear delivery of content
using those so not necessarily
time-based but piping down content to
two boxes you know set-top boxes or pcs
that the people are receiving the
signals on so you can watch the content
whenever they want or you know it's
sending down multiple versions of an ad
so they can target the advertising a
little bit better a lot of different
things that they're they're able to do
there what the XF allows you to do is
not just send a complete schedule which
it does you can send a complete
broadcast day or multiple days but you
can also send a subset of that if you
wanted to pull out an entire program and
all of its spots and secondary events
and all that and replace it with
something completely different no
problem you do that with VX at or you
can do event by event and it enables
when you're talking about an event by
event level you've got three different
things you can do there you can update
you can insert you can delete you also
have something that that is
revolutionary but may seem like
something that they might have wanted to
do for a long time is feedback from the
automation system which is actually
airing this stuff back to traffic so
that automation can dynamically feedback
to traffic what's going on in the actual
on-air area so again this is this is
blurring the lines between the various
parts of broadcast operations and making
making it so that they they're very much
combined now and responsibilities aren't
so black and white between departments
anymore and finally as run information
and again that can be totally dynamic so
that today at a typical broadcast
operation as run information which is
saying this spot aired or this spot
didn't air or half of this spot air you
know the video broke up partway through
this that information typically isn't
sent from the automation system back to
the billing system until the next day in
a lot of cases that's too late yeah you
if the advertiser this was the last day
that they could air that spot because
it's for a movie or something or it's
very topical
if it didn't air today it's worthless so
you have to credit the money back to
them well if you can do this dynamically
and bx f allows all this to happen
dynamically you can you can then let
them know hey that spot that you were
supposed to run five minutes ago
something terrible happened with it are
you okay with me running that in the
next show and so your recouping that
that revenue and not just having that
revenue disappear which there's a large
amount of that revenue it's just
disappearing right now so big big
benefits there and I was alluding to
automation or as I've got it turned to
your play out what it boils down to in
terms of the actual on air control of a
broadcast operation is during the day
there's much more of the control is
moved out of the master control sweet
and back into the trafficking area to
the business type of people so it's
giving more control to sales and to the
the people who who actually built the
schedule however those people typically
work eight hours a day so what do you do
for the other 16 hours every day and
over the weekend well bx apple also
addresses that and what it does is
allows a lot more of the metadata to
flow down from the scheduling people
down to the playout facility then was
there now so that the playout people can
actually make intelligent decisions when
it's 2 a.m. on a saturday they can make
intelligent decisions as to where things
have to move when they have you know
terrible things happen which always do
so pretty dramatic changes in the
playout area and then finally the
billing area and a lot of people tend to
forget about billing but ultimately
everything that happens in broadcast
feeds back to billing and that's how you
make your money so everything we've been
talking about feeds back to billy i was
i think i mentioned before the
reconciliation of those as run records
becomes much much simpler because you're
finding out about those things
immediately rather than letting them sit
and fester for a day or so and then
having to say what actually have a no
that didn't air well how am I going to
reconcile that how am I going to make
that good with the advertiser it's
removing a lot of those problems and the
bottom line at the at the end here is
minima
it's preamp make good situations so you
know fewer times in which you're having
to preempt something make it good later
or the worst scenario was having to
credit it back to the advertiser which
you really hate to do so here's a use
case unless what we'll do here is just
walk through a semi-realistic use case
of how bx f can enable better flows
within a broadcast operation so I took
some artistic license with this but
let's let's see how this goes so we say
otherwise typical Tuesday morning a
study is publicly released indicating
that beer increases intelligence and
milk kills brain cells okay so this this
is released yeah we always suspected
this but anyway so of course within
within broadcast operations sales says
get those milk spots off of here we
don't want to have a news flash coming
up that says milk it milk kills brain
cells and then say have a commercial
brought to you by the local milk council
so you say yank those things off of
there so they do that and that's so you
know this is all stuff again enabled by
bx f that could not be done easily
without it of course being salespeople
they immediately turn around and call
their beer accounts and say hey guys
congratulations on that on that
announcement today that scientific study
that says people get smarter when they
when they drink beer and you know what
strangely enough i've got some time
available on my schedule today alright
yeah I by the way I pulled those milk
spots off so in and if they're good
salespeople they sell those beer spots
at a premium because they're at the last
minute and they're capitalizing on some
good press so they're actually taking
advantage of an otherwise bad situation
here so the traffic system that deals
with sales immediately sends these
double orders for these new beer spots
to air and they're saying rush get these
get these things as quickly as possible
we want to get these on air we've you
know we just taking orders for these and
we can make a lot of money if we get
these two air within the next couple
hours however as is usually the case
with last-minute changes a lot of the
beer spots that the beer advertisers
want to run they're not available at the
station right now
so so then you have automation the
automation system is able to use bx app
and send a request to the content
distribution systems say hey send me
these beer spots i need these as soon as
possible i'm going to air these you know
within an hour or something so you know
within an hour a couple hours these
missing beer spots arrive at what's
called an edge server which is where the
content delivery people distribute the
spots too they're automatically ingested
to the plate of air servers metadata is
fully populated in the automation
systems database the spots are ready to
air so they air no problem notifications
immediately sent back to the traffic and
billing system they recognized us a
conservatively a fifteen percent bump in
in advertising revenue whereas today
that this type of thing happened
typically what would have happened is
they would have pulled those those milk
spots on and put promos for future
programs on which makes them no money
whatsoever so they would have lost a
significant chunk of money and in this
case using vxf you're able to make a
little extra money out of an otherwise
bad situation and then at the end the
broadcaster wonders hmm is it possible
to fund a new study that's going to
prove that television exposure improves
skin tone so anyway that's my that's my
pathetic use case but it hopefully makes
it makes it real on how this can all
work and make things better for
broadcasters I apologize that this this
may come up as a bit of an eye chart for
you but this is just a high level
diagram that I have that that shows the
relationship of the various systems all
feeding through this bx f protocol at
the top here you've got that content
distribution system the left you've got
traffic the right you've got program
management and on the bottom you've got
automation and basically you've just got
any type of event related metadata or
content related metadata flows through
bx f it can flow from any system to any
system none of that is dictated although
you can certainly specify in the in the
messages the source and destination or
you know there could be multiple
destinations for certain messages so
this just kind of illustrates how it
sits between all these systems and it's
just a facilitator for
education is really what it is a quick
status update on where are we with with
bx f this is a very conservative
estimate of over four thousand man hours
it's it's quite a bit more than that but
that just gives you an idea of how much
effort has been put into building this
thing and it is when you see the schema
it's pretty comprehensive and there's
been a lot of a lot of thought put into
this over 70 well the seventy official
members is higher than that but these
are people who have actually signed
releases within simply to work in this
group and give you an idea a typical
symptom is a dozen people or less so
this is a monster group within sympathy
that came together to build this and is
still together the schema is complete
right now the actual document the lot of
people get to make the mistake of saying
the standard is the schema it's not the
standard is is it is a document that
goes along with the schema and helps you
to implement that schema the actual
document actually we're beyond the first
graph but the draft that we're going to
submit to to simpy for balloting will be
complete by December first which is only
two weeks from now we're actually now up
to about the fourth draft of it the
document itself prepare yourselves it's
about 500 pages long it's huge so when I
talk about this being a very large
comprehensive Standard it is but the
good news is that 500 pages if that
includes the schema itself so you can
cut that down really really the guts of
it and that the part that you actually
have to read line my line is only 50 or
60 pages only yeah good bedtime reading
what we've what we've done is recognize
the fact that again we're not perfect we
have had the implementation of pretty
much everybody who's going to implement
this but you know when you build a
schema it's it may look good but in
practice it may not work the way you
anticipated it would so what we've done
is said we're going to have a validation
phase that runs from basically right now
and this is the this actually started a
little while ago until April of 2007
during which
participants can go and test this out
see how it works and get feedback back
to the committee if there are things
that are broken in the schema or things
that are less than optimal it gives them
an opportunity to do some initial
implementation to give feedback and fix
those things just because we're going to
to ballot in December in front of
sympathy doesn't mean we can't change
things our final technical ballot we're
expecting the technical level ballot to
be in June and that's the FCD ballot you
see here that the CD is committee draft
which is our our initial battle at SAS
empty the FCD being the technical level
ballot so we can still change things
particularly if they're broken between
now and June why did we make the
evaluation phase between now and april
well in the broadcast industry april is
the the biggest month there is its when
NAB is which is if not the biggest the
second biggest trade show in the world
and that's what all of the broadcast
vendors are working toward and that's
what I expected this year's NAB you're
going to see quite a few demos of this
bx f and people hyping the this kind of
capability because the the industry as
Jeff said has been waiting for this for
a while and I do expect very rapid
deployment of this standard after that
yeah well we'll see how well this is
received at any be but I expect this to
be very warmly received by the industry
and the fact that they've people will
have built prototype implementations of
this they'll be able to move on to fully
product izing this very shortly after
any be that's the problem was showing
something at a trade show is people
expect it to be a product immediately
thereafter so but that's actually gonna
be good for us it'll see this this
implemented pretty quickly so that's
that's Mike and presentation I hope
that's that was the helpful and at least
giving you an overview of what bx f is
intended to be at this point maybe i'll
stop for questions and if there are once
we get past some questions I'd like to
go into a quick tour of the of the
schema itself we don't have a whole lot
of time but I can give you a quick tour
of the schema any questions before we go
on to the schema
I was wondering if you could elaborate a
little bit on AAF and mxf you can talk
about how they how they relate to this
dinner sure both AAF and mxf are our
standards for embedding metadata aef is
more at the time of production of it so
when you when you're actually producing
a movie or commercial or that sort of
thing there are more and more cameras
and production devices have the ability
to automatically capture metadata and
embed it in so that nobody is ever
having to hand key this and even it as
far upstream as you want to go to
actually shooting a scene it captures
all the information about that scene who
was involved in it and that sort of
thing and all the various production
systems as you go down through the
production chain can embed their
metadata in an AF which is advanced
authoring format this was what that
stands for in that form then mxf is
quite similar but it's a little bit
further down the chain and it's material
exchange format is what that stands for
and it's meant so that there is a single
way it's it gives your back up for a
minute mxf is a rapper and it wraps the
essence the video and the metadata in a
in a single standardized way so that
various systems that are exchanging
these these professional video files
have a single wrapper so that they can
look at that wrapper understand what the
content is be able to get at the the
actual video essence in a standardized
way you know in the in the broadcast
industry even though video servers have
been in place for plus or minus 10 years
in various forms they didn't they didn't
talk to each other very well it
particularly went now that you have the
consolidation of broadcast operations
where you have groups that have 40 50 60
stations within the group if they had
acquired their video servers over a
period of five to ten years from various
manufacturers they can't actually move
the files between those video servers so
MX app was meant to primarily to solve
that problem of being able to move the
video between these systems and also
wrap the metadata in there in a
standard way so how does that relate
well bx f relates to that in that we can
request the movement of those files down
when i was talking about automatic
ingest automatic ingest is enabled by
the fact that we say they sent us this
piece of content they send the piece of
content in an NX f wrapper you can then
dis embed the metadata and move them in
if the essence into whatever video
server you have because it's in mxf so
it all really fits together it's all
it's all part of the same solution there
must be a naming scheme and so forth
associated with all of this you know I
could talk for another hour about
content you're talking about naming the
piece of contents or identifying the
piece of content merchants that for
example of night I can literally talk
for another hour about that um the the
15 second answer to that would be there
are there are two principal standards
that maybe three that are enabling that
in the commercial area there's something
called ad ID which was started up by the
what's called the forays the American
Association of advertising agencies I
believe is what Sam it's the agency
group also created by aana Association
of national advertisers so if the
advertisers and agencies have created
this ad ID which is a a single
consistent way of identifying
advertising content and then in the
programming area there's got something
called I San the industry standard
audio-visual number which the the quick
way to describe that everybody Miller
with the ISBN that's on the back of a
book it's the same thing for
audio-visual content and that's
administered by the ISO although in this
country the registration agencies are a
couple companies secure path and a
little company called Microsoft question
so you mentioned this country which
leads into my question and also the
three-year window for analog broadcast
how's that all related to us versus
International and how is the whole this
whole scheme playing out in the global
market first of all they be the 2009
deadline for turning off analog is us
only that's that's something that's been
imposed by the Congress
the United States and that's when that's
turning off different other countries
have different schedules sorry it's it's
in it's in the legislation however
there's some interesting wrinkles in
there where the version of the
legislation due to a UH I don't know how
you determine but a small problem at the
governmental level the version of that
the legislation that the president sign
is different than the one that congress
passed and so constitutional lawyers are
saying that means it's not the law so
there are still is still some contention
about that it remains to be seen if that
actually happens there's also some
issues with you've probably heard about
this the federal subsidy for set-top
boxes forty dollars a household you can
have up to two of those when you do the
math on them though that doesn't add up
to all the animal like households that
there are so there's is it going to
happen let's wait and see they seem to
be very serious about it happening then
I think it's going to depend to some
extent on you know we don't have that
long to get the set-top boxes out and
and have people you know that the 80
year old grandmother syndrome is the is
the major problem here you don't want
her to have her TV turned off and her
not know how to get television after
after 2009 do it they solved the
problems on the broadcom the reception
end of receiving the multipath signals
largely that's been solved there's been
a generational improvements in the in
the chips in receivers that have largely
fixed that problem so it's a lot better
than it was yes international adoption
thank you bx f we've encouraged as much
international participation as we can in
this group and simply is an
international organization that is not a
US only organization and in our meetings
that we have of the cynthia say as a
general group meets four times a year
and we do have participation from every
continent in that but having said that
is the participation in my committee as
as great as I would like on the
international side no it hasn't been
it's been the work has largely been
driven by by Americans there while there
have been a lot of participants that are
outside of the United States they
haven't been as active and it so perhaps
the pain isn't this great in other
countries in this area I'm not sure or
perhaps they're waiting to see what the
United States does we have on our
roadmap for our group we were under no
illusion that we're going to be done
with this when it gets through it's
empty ballots it's the first version
will be done we will then our plan is
then later in 2007 to reform the group
once people have implemented this and
look at extensions to it and some some
clear areas of extension are the
international areas having said all that
though when you look at the schema you
will already see some some nods to the
international community in there in the
area some areas that aren't that much of
interest right now 22 Americans that
such things as conditional access and we
have the various elements of dvb it's
not just ATSC specific dvb related
elements are all in there right now so
we've done our best but again keep in
mind that the majority of drivers behind
this have been American companies are
you aware of competing international
standards safe from Europe or China that
are trying to solve the same problem I'm
not aware of any specifically and we
tried to do our best to to avoid that
type of situation of trying to get the
word out both over in Australia Asia and
Europe that this work is taking place
and like I said we've got a decent
amount of participation from those
vendors but just they're not they're not
the major drivers so I don't think
there's anything to anything competing
like I said for for gloom for global
digital cinema and television simply is
the body to do this under so you know if
it's going to be done by a legitimate
standards organization that's the
organization that people would be doing
it under okay so it is the focus totally
on broadcast in this case as opposed to
any other delivery I the initial focus
was on broadcast but as you saw
and as you'll see if you troll through
the the schema it certainly supports
nonlinear delivery of content as well so
you know just the making a certain piece
of content available not necessarily a
specific time it's it's got some
capabilities in there that they have
everything that's needed for non
broadcast applications probably not
because we haven't had it's been
broadcasters taking guesses at how that
would be done they're not experts in
that type of delivery but a lot of the
broadcast companies are looking at doing
nonlinear delivery of content as well so
I would say there's been a decent
initial effort made it that is is there
more effort needed yes I think the whole
committee recognizes there's more effort
needed and that's certainly an area we
would encourage participation in for for
future extensions to make it more
optimized to nonlinear delivery of
content de Ferran is a broadcast your
including in that layer channels
delivered through by msos like cable oh
absolutely yes yes yeah yeah I can give
a real quick look at the schema here
actually let's since we're limited on
time okay so here's a rule this will be
the accelerated view of the schema what
I'm looking at here in Jeff you have
access to this and you're free to share
this with any members of your
organization but this is the
documentation file of the schema this is
an HTML file which is actually pretty
nice for going on hopping through the
schema if you don't have a tool like XML
spy or something like that that's nice
for going through the schema this allows
you to go through it's got hyperlinks
all through here as you can see but let
me just skip past the attributes since
we're pressed on time but the schema is
is split into three primary sections at
the top there's the data area which is
mostly what I've been talking about here
then there's a query area that allows
one system to query information from
another system and then a query response
area which is a place for them to send
the response back so if we just focused
since we don't have a whole lot of time
on the data area the data area under
there is primarily composed of just a
few different areas here there's the
content transfers area which allows you
to make requests of transfers of content
from one location to another the
schedules area I think that's fairly
self-explanatory what that is although
that schedules also includes as run
information you are a formats area which
allows you to build skeletal formats of
programs into which commercials will go
the content area think that's fairly
self-explanatory its content and then
we've got a Content contract area which
is kind of rights management business
rules type of information and then down
at the bottom here you've got
configuration and this is an area I
didn't talk about it all but this allows
one system tell another system how its
configured in different areas again I
won't go into a whole lot of detail
there but a pretty neat area and then
the last one that I'll talk about here
is private information
I talked about the fact that we can have
areas within we have areas across the
schema where you can put in if you have
something proprietary that only system a
and system B want to exchange that is
not covered by the schema you throw it
into private information and that's a
whole structure that allows private
information at all kinds of different
levels of the scheme you've got that you
at the element level also at the
attribute level okay all right thanks a
lot all right thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
