the bigger philosophical questions like
what means for paper system actually be
scared I say my encryption system is
securely where that mean what kind of
heart just kind of makes its actual
secure it's going to talk about how we
actually prove secure your proof throw
out a lot sometimes things are
supposedly proven that later broken and
it was actually mean to prove something
the excess and wall talking about groups
that are breaking this topic of your
analogies they give a brief outline of
what that means why it's important
you're talking about interesting then
finally how did three times does
retirement communities is this is kind
of a less emotion
was it imply if their auction are
ciphers signature schemes and
conversions for that meeting economy
plus T apply yourself so what is secure
actually and one kind of sign questions
would you trust a group decision that
leaked even a single bit of your
plantings and this is a good standard be
used to measure implications here you
can't even tell one bit for sacrificed
and better if he can tell to psych texts
apart oculi information on the contents
investments so we take the bar Senate
say okay we want this ever seen actually
not the any information or give you any
information distinguished committee
cycle Texas then we're going to consider
sit here and so this idea came up about
25 years ago she researchers name so
they would call shopping Bulls
and they kind of came up with this game
and so kind of going back to curves
principle the only thing being seared
that's how I got behind this game the
way it works is that alice is going to
cherry public key this could be our say
any sort of public key schemes another
going to look at this that she could get
Bob world so she might be using a
symmetric key system just give him some
black box answer answer questions w
gripping Oracle so she jerks his public
eating days as well and then what ball
can do is he couldn't use that all the
keys much signal to decrypt messages
with it who can you know feat in garbage
can do all sorts of things with it
basically sit there and crypt any chosen
plaintext city walls then thought that
we is going to do is going to decide on
to your messages these are as to
challenge and Tim's journal he's going
to send them some Alice don't house is
going to do is just flip a coin and pick
heads and tails and incorrect prophetic
message comes up so it message beep
she's gonna trip that with her public
eat instead the second text of all
another game here is that given justice
ciphertext and this horrible box job is
just a guess location clips and
in practice called intentionally under
chosen plaintext attack the short term
associated snack security this is an
idea that Goldwasser McCauley came up
with 25 years ago Teddy's ad police I
context and I gave you everything i gave
you can occur short if you punky I give
you algorithm I gave everything except
just bid be receiver keep you can't even
tell to cipher text you chose the
Playtex core part now the question is
you know how does this relate to actual
cryptosystem a talk tough about our say
we asked little bat pads in the past
security and look look at our site so
you know this example alice is going to
send Bob public key this case I've got
CLE 701 the exton was five then Bob's
going to pick two message let's say
they're 10 and 40 to send them back to
Alice she's going to figure in a bit of
this case let's 80 and so just going to
send back encryption of the value 10 and
this is the value 63 but there's no
madam ization so Bob can just as easily
hurt these two messages himself and when
63 comes back he knows that her minister
so he thought always win this hand so
you know based on this very simple
example are say is not snag is secure
and in fact noble cryptosystem that
doesn't have a randomization the input
is secure because they've all at the
same problem where where you can always
distinguish between two site protects
that you chose now girls I questions do
we even care about us maybe we use our
say South America's distinguish building
that big a tissue and some cases it is
so do you think about anything we're
kind of going back to that first
disciples the two times had for me to
recognize patterns they occupy use our
essay or even a s ECB mode I can see the
same blocks of messages I think you're
going over to can distinguish between
blocks so that's what this effect a
distinct ability is important so going
back to whether the status one are safe
no no sometimes we use our same case
where it's a short message which one
block and you don't care about same kind
of the application we talked about last
week might be able to hide the number of
users you just want to sign a random
user number that's in purple so you can
encrypt your real user numbers
impasse around these are saying current
user numbers you don't even care people
recognize the savings appear that you
just want to hide out in here so savers
ability is initiative every case but you
know it is important level security that
you talk so you know what is
semantically secure and so an early
example is it true mr. some color album
oh and I've kind of got all the details
up here but it's very similar to the
diffie-hellman key stage name them talk
to me in this case you're seeing your
key is just a value s and then your
public key is going to be an element
jeopardy or that group so sour do system
parameters are proof in a generator the
group in public users going to be that
element the generator to the exponents
so you know I give somebody this value H
which is your love a heater message the
way that they prep is that they're going
to pick a random value and this is the
important parts as I met report noted
tremendous a cryptosystem is 10 is
curable during the credit value our and
raised
sir raise raise the generator that X bar
and then also raised the public aid
alarm and multiply the message in by
public you a star so that's the person
lying whore pull it down and Galvez
going to these two values as I CMD it's
just a radiation but L somebody to rip a
CD and take the value C they go see your
PS their race CVS and then they get the
public key to the value are and they can
divide the value D by that and they get
back there is no message into some great
edge problems and the next I'll talk
about why but it's nap is secure and
that's under a sub shin and talk about
it first week it's this pithy comment
section and talk about the next slide
another nice property is that sacred
texts miram analyst so if you look at
the encryption function there somebody
even is GH k multiplied in GH values
then change for that exponent is then
something is still be perfect this kind
of makes it that I can take a ciphertext
three random as a passive long and it
can hide you know the origin aside some
things to look at
or this kind of makes 10 things you can
have neutral third parties that career
and my cypher text and pass them on it
kind of high where they came and next
week we're going to have a guest speaker
is going to talk about some boating
protocols and some of these make use of
this free randomization it's very nice
tool another nice profit does homework
so I can take to cipher texts and i can
multiply them together i get an
encryption location of messages that
becomes a nice some nice properties new
protocols another nice thing about this
is support pre-computation i can
generate values hg2 different exponents
capable of this at a time you know hit
us at a time keep it for very fast
recursion and final thing is that it's
conducive to zero knowledge person so
there are some proofs this isn't I
created today this is an ice drifts or
decision so I light up lots of very nice
so how do we actually prove that this
particular system is Cenac this year so
first time I talked about two
assumptions and these are computational
decisional that we help so computational
diffie-hellman problem is if you
remember back that first week we talked
about the atomic exchange you're given
an instance a generator a generator
chatter next Monday generated excellent
be near job as an upload output g eight
times this is a hard problem and if
you're able to solve this problem you
can also find discrete box by reforming
a kind of a easier problem is just
decision deciding between two thousand
so again given this changing a genie i'm
going to give you mentally either GE to
the power b b or g some fantasy and the
decisional diffie-hellman assumption is
it's laughable if it's difficult and we
go some ruse everything it's difficult
it's
every so talk about that then but the
way this reduction work is that loves of
those going back let's max security game
that has a non-negligible advantage I'm
guessing that bit so he can get guest be
with anything more than an exponentially
small probability of success no we can
do is you take that semantic security
game and kind of massage in the decision
to be helmet and put into going to use
he was an Oracle to salt the DiPietro
and see idea here is that if this is
cryptosystem we're not stems el gamal
specific then a lot of other metal
something fit so if we get a stomach all
kind of black box that beat the
semantics here to game and I can solve
decision if you held it in a lot of your
groups don't be surprised what
researchers got into this people are
thinking too hard problem so what they
know is that this is gonna be helmet
doesn't hold income a common group which
is just integers mod problems it's
actually easy to tell between these two
back to the apt and see so it's
important to actually do this in the
right
some people can do this over certain
subgroups of CP different curves and
things like that but it's kind of
interesting aside so it's the ideal for
my Redemption so that if either put this
is to what I usually do is assume that
it's not secured or so
and then I'll reduce some problems so if
it's our sake it can take a factory
instance and I say okay I've got a black
box and install our serif raigarh say
then I can use that black box salt
factory so it's a comment techniques
that use this hypothetical into the
graveyard hasn't world it's all
smartphone this doesn't get it again in
a lot of different context it is kind of
a general way actually proves it was
Sakura or what assumptions so you know
it's max carrying the end all secure and
you know we that Casey 8-ball the tool
to ability crip repair costs or that he
current so kind of a common attack is a
lunch nap time and the idea here is that
you know all this is probably left or
terminal in some point I'm some of you
may have asked me you know send a
message to home a lot just for eternal
it has everything so much time attacks
you go to lunch so nice it's your
computer and you know decrypt messages
ahead of time so it's not actually
attacking yet they're sitting there kind
of pre computing things trying to Crips
there won't be not actually have a key
but you know maybe blog did something
they can encrypt decrypt whatever they
want so similar to the sneck security
because that except the difference is
that getting alice is going to give all
access to both an encryption and a
deeper for so the pockets of their top
these Oracle's and the encryption
Olympics be a public key it also might
be symmetric cipher behind of some sort
of glass box he gets in there talk to
both Oracle's encrypted everyone speaker
but everyone's at you be all stuck cut
be ready and then he gave silence
challenges so your pigs to messages and
send them to apps and at this point
house now comes back and locks or
terminal block no longer has actually
the diac assess teachers your goal but
now house is going to pick the random
message beep and send him to cursor them
and afterwards long now just has the
public he can just encrypt things after
she gets into access and now as we try
to pass
so this is also called chosen ciphertext
attack the idea is that Bob gets to
choose cipher texts that Alice asked
decrypt this call not adapted because
after he does his messages he can't
adapt and start asking more questions so
this is called chosen second text
attacking CCA because it's not an apple
one or my stories about CC everyone so
if I say interesting ability under CC a
one secure that's a security definition
that is harder than semantic security
because in this case baza more powerful
so the crypto system has to be strong
I'm taking this further this is not
adapted what about the captive so it's
just like the lunchtime attack you said
now after bob has sent alice's
challenges he still has an extra to be
crucial now she was sittin back and
encryption of all these two messages but
you become tribute Lee basket incursion
of that some kind of the one rule is
that after she sends in this challenge
her Oracle will be here anything except
that specific message so this is a very
strong notion security not only does bob
have the public key algorithm decrypt
what everyone's when everyone except for
one particular message so you interpret
this is an event this level security
Timmy very top now let's think about
toggle ball going back since would el
gamal be adaptively
chosen ciphertext attack scares CCA 2
i'm going to be in stay anonymous and
the answer is enough and it goes back
this idea that can remand my eyes keep
you home or difference so let's think
about how he attacks well a lot can give
is covered i'll still give Boggs public
ehh and a decryption horrible deed so
she's not giving them the value of us at
bottom is enter two messages m0 and one
and shield encrypted soup it began gdr
at MV time but remember we can prove
analyzes and it's also homework we
multiply something in so all bob needs
to do is multiply some value into the
second part cybertek's they give it back
from Dallas remember the rules this game
is he just can't get her back the exact
ciphertext you just between a bit in
there and send it back to our initial
lead early so you can ask you orrible to
decrypt in this case see to me end of it
back a decription I you two times enemy
then you can trivially figure out what
happens it was so alcohol is not CCA to
secure and the idea is that because the
sniper Texas Valley and change it in a
meaningful in a meaningful way you're
never going to be this game so kind of
an equivalent definition is that you're
done
table under the sea CA to subject and so
it's kind of ties back to what we talked
about last week where you never want
ciphertext to be my mouth anyway if you
can't edit or alter ciphertext a
meaningful way you're not going to be
able to have this level security because
you always have this attack where I can
put one bit baby crib and obviously this
is not necessarily a real setting gut I
have decription Horrible's out there but
yeah given the patter Sarah can bump as
much power as possible it almost nothing
else when you did walk this case the
only things he doesn't know Cedar Key
has bit B Easter I guess that the ideas
that we've given so much power that if
you can't break it all these tools as
disposal this is a very going to be a
very public purposes social question now
is do CCA one this is the persecutors
exist and answered yes as I said I'll
giggles not but there's another crypto
system called Kramer shoe which is based
on the same assumption the DD h and it's
a bit more complicated that's not stop
to that and it is proven to be ecca to
secure under this assumption what it's
going to use our collision resistant
hash functions to talk about beat one
and this is going to be a way that they
can show
cypher text not been modified in a way
that would allow some of these
commercial so they have a great ass
construction and there's also a talk
about a second visit theoretical result
they would take any the sanity secure
for lunch time attack secure
cryptosystem and uses her lauch proved
you can run to CCA to secure system so
kind of mechanism take any cryptosystem
securing those two weaker definitions
and make it more into this harder
screaming evolution so just to recap we
don't think we talking our sake of the
Senate announced an Epicure alcohol
snack mascara cannot CCA to sit here and
one of the exercises actually look at it
and decide whether it's you see a 16
year old its security and similar to
attack parachuted we haven't talked
about just mentioned is his CCHS a year
and last week we also talked about our
say boy EP bingo two definitions of it
this means a hot commodity symmetric
encryption paddock and if remember we
talked about you can't just tack on a
random blog RSA expects to be secure so
there's construction out there they
actually have a more complicated padding
scheme that makes our essay cch you
secure under what's called a random
world that's basically assuming that you
have a hash function that
so it's kind of the state of how
practical purposes relate to security
definitions and are saving these comedy
and it's kind of the standard we use in
this case and things like Kramer shoot
these things that are generated by zero
knowledge protocols they're still pretty
inefficient so creamy soup is pretty
large tigertext there's a lot of
operations but there are instructions
that are getting more efficient on
beating stick so I mentions are not
approve and you know what's a zero
nostril this is a major part paragraph
research and basically azeroth prune is
a system that gives you a way to prove
that so statement is true false without
revealing anything else so the example
come up in the next few slides but i can
actually convince somebody that
something is true so that they can't
they don't have no more information they
basically at one bit of information this
is gonna be a very powerful tool
urban graphic protocols instructions so
kind of go through a very simple example
is this alibaba's cave so alice is
standing up the front is cave and this
door in the back just a straight line is
a magic cool she wants to prove it Bob
who's outside she actually knows the
senior pastor that will open the store
so what she's going to do is the first
step she's going to commit to one of
these hallways she's gonna go about a or
people and involves gonna wait outside
sochi in this case that she goes down
beep and now Bob he's going to come to
the door and he has no much always she
went out he's going to challenge she's
gonna say no air me and he's going to be
this friend so what else good is that if
she actually knows the passport and
she's in the wrong hallway she can over
the door come out the right home if he
happened to say the hall with she's in
that she can just go back the way she
came so he said he hears you can just
turn around and leave if she says she
has to open or get out so the next step
she's going to come out the hallway he's
even firm that she came up I hope so you
think about this if they do this for a
lot of steps
you know she keeps consistently getting
her whitehall correct and he believes
that another door can only do custom of
the password he's gonna make notes that
she actually has the password because
somebody didn't know it they must be
very lucky because every single time
they must have picked the right hallway
has ignored and come out oh and so these
sickening years he doesn't learn
anything is another senior password he
doesn't know anything except that she
there is the secret password she knows
so let's look at a more interesting
example this is graph three color
building so some of your letter would NP
completeness NP problems this is a
problem is np-complete and it's
difficult so the idea is we've got a
graph which are these on these vertices
connected by hedges and we don't know an
efficient way to tell whether we can
color the middle is this graph three
three colors it's giving an arbitrary
graph this case insist upon an is-3
colorable and the idea is that coloring
means that note to it s cool no edge may
have two vertices of the same colors
glue this picture all the edges have two
different colored dots on the ends and
answering whether an arbitrary
three colorable is a difficult problem
if you do that efficiently then P equals
NP you solve all these problems are now
officially something so we believe this
is hard to be mature so let's suppose
that house knows the three coloring this
particular graph for any pictograph she
was screwed up so we do with this your
mouths pre steam boilers the way we
would work is that shoot first free
level all the nodes so in this case you
know the colors are essentially the same
thing like relabeled in red these could
just be a permutation be the same colors
and permeated rapidly than what she's
going to do is she would commit teach
about we haven't talked about big
commitments yet it's another
cryptographic primitives that basically
allows her to give somebody else about
and she's going to hide what she
convinced to but later much is going to
be able to reveal and there's no way
that she changed the idea might be that
put you know water is 0 in an envelope
seal the envelope and hand it to you you
can't open it until I guess nivea
lockbox already put in a lockbox give it
to you then I can't change the values
found and you can't open the box and I
want to be able to you
so she's going to commit to all these
vertices and what bob is going to do
this is taken in Japan so if you
remember the came that chemical is going
down with always the challenge was him
picking which hallway same idea here so
he's gonna pick an engine ran in script
so let's say pics this edge it's kind of
the center of the graph but she'll do is
reveal it ends and bought this was
should have checked the two notes have
different ladies and that's all he's
going to be able to check know what
you're going to do was keep repeating
and so these think about what did Bob
apps you learn well he learned that
whatever she committed to those two
labels had a different color so he keeps
doing this and gets enough trials he's
going to be convinced that there's a
three-color described me as each time
he's going to somehow you know have
committed two values they're different
colors now if the graph was not very
colorful no one she committed there's
going to be two men for the same color
and there's a no significant chance to
keep my guess the edge that has the same
color and so she's cheating you enough
trials I probably she's going to come
but if she's honest she's gonna be able
to pass this test every students about
yes did you beat that by keeping
everything I should be labeled it's
let's say she left all the notes exact
same color that each time she does this
Bob would just learn the cup so
relabeling it's a way of showin if let's
say next time you know he picked coming
to the moment I think that it's next
time these are the same colors you can
learn okay well in that third colors
great or ever but shoot labels it then
this note that's common it's going to be
a different color each time he's not
going to know which Senate was the first
place that's actually a quarter
conference yesterday only six if you go
back to the cave example that's why she
picks and in her hallway each time like
I said somberly good example she
wouldn't learn anything but that's
basically why she needs to make sure he
doesn't learn anything and so at the end
of this what we have is that Bob is
convinced that there is a three-color to
describe so what's your budget are a
nice school and the things you won't be
able use for it's an authentication so
you imagine log on a website and since
type in your password is sending over
the network okay screw you that I know
my password and those tools misspelled
zero how much boost knowledge and
basically convince somebody else that
you know
the Nexus your value the East dropper
listening and can't drive that screwed
up because all your can make one bit of
information yes or no I notice your body
another thing might be secure
multi-party computation so we could have
a bunch of computers on the internet and
we may all a sensitive values I have
secrets about a personal information
community General computation and if we
all hope I come together agree or
computers a function with all our
interests we might be worried about to
be cheap so one way to actually do this
is to send a proof that you computed
this multi-party computation to correct
that you're not cheating or not you know
if this thing is some averaging protocol
you're not giving it a value that's not
trying to cheat the protocol so now and
yes you can use your las cruces turtle
very computationally and five those
bogus burdens and the nice application
here is that what are the italian oaks
and give you a proof that the votes when
either tamper with and sound like
correctly but didn't leak any
information about what's person actually
voted the next week benedita is going to
talk a bit about sub loading protocols
that can make use of very small or nas
proofs that can prove that okay these
abilities were not
I get into a third party kind of three
randomized eyes and come out are still
the same votes just realized you can
prove that an efficient web and this is
the real focus of research from pure
sites but a lot of work on McNally's
adjectives on the bottom and there are
many flavors of Sarah stronger versions
which not are acted well these things
about current protocols Remington where
you not pull that protocols going on
once and it's a very kind of richfield
that's still being developed and a lot
of things are happening in this area and
just kind of shipping in the future so
kind of setback for me talk about things
in crypto being equipped with each other
kind of like complexion class on
delivery there's an interesting results
are that we talked about all solve
things like we talked about one-way
functions symmetric key encryption
public key signature is such a little
bit of infinity and these big things
that this first list of bullet points
all these things are equivalent
so we can improve that there's one
one-way function out there construct all
these things maybe not efficiently but
they cannot won't be constructed from
each other you find function that
generates pseudo random bits mean that
looks like granted us we can't
extinction this then we built only fun
we build symmetric key ciphers we can
build public a message now Cove you
think this is like a class of functions
there's a higher purpose that you know
starts with reconstruction call a
trapdoor permutation this is very
similar to your public key basically
it's a function that's easy to go in one
direction and hard going others like
rewarding for both the traffic or makes
it easier reverse so kind of public key
where the function is computing pokey
it's difficult to decrypt unless you got
this here so this kind of standard
abstract definition travel travel
permutation does imply public encrypted
and that public key crypto implies
security so that implies things like
this common things that exist and
finally key agreement would imply
one-way functions so the idea is that
somebody discovered a function they
approved doesn't want a traveler
permutation then public key crypto
exists he agreement one-way functions
that means that all these trucks with
all these primitives have talked about
can be implemented Travis so now what
actually apply to robusta classes can be
asked if traffic rotational test if we
can actually find a motion and
satisfaction parts there's a lot whole
definitions for all these are not the
first specific things that we're what is
it
tradition but you don't actually know if
cartography exists a this actually be
done in a brutal way things like AES and
des shot one these are kind of that hot
construction there's nothing backing it
saying okay well this must be a look
with these are two things that people
you know kind of worked on put together
functions that kind of stand up to the
attacks know about if a s is broken
tomorrow it doesn't have any big kind of
theoretical it doesn't mean that
blessing classified collapse writing
like that it should be broken some kind
of obstruction but what is cryptic
dozens well one big question it implies
that p deniability and there's a net
kind of exercise on the exercises that
you would prove this but basically
something that one-way function exists
then there exists languages that can't
be created multiple time that would be
the team's Michael NP i'm having an
interesting thing is that the Commerce
is not the true pita p naught equal EMP
does not necessarily climbing
exists and the reason is is that you
might have classes an MP that are hard
only in a small fraction cases whereas
more wave functions need to be part of
the heretics so this is kind of a gray
area complexity and stuff exactly my
strong field but one-way functions we
possibly be in a class that is different
than people because they needed heart
and arteries so these are very kind of
theoretical issues and connect on
bringing it back to the practice what
about if things like factory where they
fit in this picture where does the
harness actually come into these nice
practical assistance both factoring
let's ask the question what happens it
tomorrow somebody knows how to factor
fast moves that collapse keeping their
P's and collapse you know I mean we
can't be printed out the answer them
factor you know to be this class Taylor
section and paint going to you it's not
thought to be equivalent is not
so factoring were easy tomorrow you
wouldn't necessarily mean that people's
anything so I think it's actually you
know possible to see something of an
efficient factor got really I would not
be surprised by and as we mentioned a
little bit lonely questions last week
factoring is easy and fun so this is
this class eqp which means basically
randomized pawn polynomial time and it's
possible that we keep these equal to
just regular probabilistic governments
so all of these things listed up here as
far as I said and plus it's not post
function but as far as I know none of
these are actually complete so these are
all kind of songs that participated
practice so the moral so you can know
can figure out an additional songs and
staying with the grace locks that i may
be mistaken especially the latter ones
but it's kind of interesting question
because you know what do we do if
tomorrow something learns how to solve
all these and publishes a paper that
makes it official and thirty thousands
of research in
if games at P or how you actually do
crypto and there were no Park Falls and
you can actually have some constructions
that are there being efficient but you
can do things where it requires certain
different steps and so you're kind of
relying on large constants in the
Balkans just because of these polynomial
time doesn't mean it actually is
efficient kind of practice and spent a
huge constant in there so thurs hope is
factoring is polynomial time tomorrow
the actual are going to do it might be
so expensive with that no reason the
example there is promise so for years we
know that Prime's good problem alcohols
of finding find them kind of some
English subscribe and these are run by
doing a lot of trials and you know
Jenna's grandness and will be about five
years ago we feed it up as a
deterministic and the atmosphere coffee
this is really slow apparently the
Protestant one it's not good at a long
with that if somebody figures out how to
do factory
thats going to be fishing practice so
this talks actually a little bit shorter
than I anticipated but next week as I
have missed a couple times giving in to
talk for benedita talk about a voting
systems
using a lot on things we talked about
forex course you kind of pics nets and
things like visual crypto which an
interesting thing and Sarah NOS proofs a
very simple ones and so special after
day I will open it up to any questions
and if you're under these see are going
to go to the chef and go here
okay so if anyone has a question plz
fillery gasket yes putter here so hungry
one occasion but not know what they said
in court the question is are there
secure search algorithms and yes there
are and there's been a lot of work on
this and kind of private database
operations and so the kind of heavy duty
one is your whole life party computation
that you can build basically a circuit
that when you put in our search results
little teen books and then search engine
you execute this search that it is and
return result that's really handy doing
as I said it's very inefficient and its
construction or not practical yet secure
multi-party combinations can become more
efficient for future but on the flip
side there are some special how birds
are didn't design and special kind of
protocols of doing a secure search some
things can do security sometimes giving
searches over all the databases and get
them in a lot of work
yes my digital signatures examples of
zero knowledge groups did you ask other
signature example of zero dophia digital
signatures you have signatures are
digital signatures in example zero
dollars yeah they are not because well
there are ways you can make signature
schemes that are zero knowledge but kind
of mostly they're talking about like if
DSM so signing a piece of data something
could actually figure out what piece of
dating son so that's it was your
knowledge is that you actually get no
more information the fact I give you a
signature on it a signature sexual value
of sudden the original information that
actually does mean a very small amount
of information adversary let's have a
complicated definition but the way they
do these proofs is that the income house
later I show that are between eyeless
involve some of you just seem like this
this whole 18 students whole protocol in
their head and have a court ball that's
distinguishable original so basically
yes and so the kind of digital scanner
to talk about are not sir thomas but
there are scenes out
chemical and so there's a question yes
so the question on the fruit chat is
that for examples though studies are
probably screwing up this chance and
foremost fail and that is true so
there's a whole class a language class
about light t which is interactive
protocols and these are probabilistic so
with these are in all the proof examples
all the example to have our
probabilistic and I'm actually a little
we're officially a sort of kind of
guarantee to be solutions but in this
case so going back to the cave example
graph three colored house could just get
extremely lucky she could you know pick
know what coin box on flip at a time to
be able to pick the right tunnel in that
cave and know basically you just run
this until there's a chance that that
happening is into Testament we do it a
hundred times
you can just believe that is extremely
high probability Alice didn't get lucky
but it's a good question what is the
proof and these are probabilities are
not like mathematical proofs and they're
not like certificate type of proof these
are the proof is actually engaging this
protocol so it's kind of an interesting
complexity class ID which is kind of the
complexity theory is equivalent to all
the Ottomans that you use polynomial
space so it's equal to P space if same
thing is that everything in that class
can actually be proven with your mouth
and everything at NP which is so glass
has a zero knowledge / ok sorry there
more questions room I traitor good boy
what is this very good
okay okay so you're going back to the
cave example and the question is what
information is involved yet when how
sounds out i know i think this pearl
actually she doesn't ski and see which
size she went into if he does then ha
that's the pro work essentially he's
still I think I see would always take
see if part of her girls are him not
knowing which tells you that he went
she's hurt she thought would forfeit all
human that's my problem in that case
yeah so that came examples kind of a toy
example it's the graph for color Billy's
a little bit you know more realistic and
then
I think the example I can't think a big
reason why executive wise need to see
which time she goes it yes you might
just be able to guess the pub has
figured out what L is it random
right so if he controls are an owner
generator it's the same thing and if you
think about the three-color building one
he controls from a number generator then
that he knows how she relabeling I grab
need to work backward to figure out what
the actual three color is so Alice
having independent source man this is
central in three colorful protocol
because if not then walk and extract the
usual information and that's kind of a
neat thing about signals for the random
number generators needed both yes the
venoms needed always because you can
predict which ones he was going to ask
about but you can think I grabbed the
end it with different exact axillary
always close ways I house knows Bob's
random numbers she knows he's going to
guess so you go back at k example if she
does involve always picks a she's gonna
good at baking dishes know the password
and ran brett india three couple breaths
she knows what and she's gonna pick
she'll always just tell it the graphic /
than color those two guns to be
different colors and this definite
interesting things how they improves for
this is the idea that when you're
simulating this we talked a little bit
about soon
you can control the randomness and then
basically rewind ba Baba be like Turing
machine and you rewind back to the
original state and run it forward and
it's kind of a technique uses groups and
on the quickie you have kind of a
introduction is there an audience it's
in pretty dense like how the first
curfew factions are pretty accessible
there's tons of material there
yes it's pretty the probabilistic random
number prefer my number tests are very
similar to remember yes so it's the same
idea with the trying to find out as I
said that it is not brought into Gaza
yes and improving at not crying feminism
right so the question for the common was
that kind of this whole idea what proof
is similar when you test drive ality to
use develop a written test and Bert
recall correctly if it's a problem that
would fail if it's a composite it'll
fail except with its small probability I
have it backwards but it's saying that
you might just get really lucky testing
a number and you're going to miss you
know that it's actually a positive and
this class of language
I get my things RP or in the Arizona on
one side let's say it's a Plexiglas that
contain
promotion so it seems to leave India
thread color cool that we can color
truck about to try the chief that you
have mistakes for large amount of notes
it's like graphic super mark and a
probable like one edge you can get away
with that bracelet question is in the
graph coloring what's your public anyway
let's say we got a graph that I know I
color everything but have 11 edge and I
couldn't color well then the probability
of cottage around is the number bites so
if there's endograft it's going to be a
war vet square dance and so that would
actually be the basis of how many
problems we're going to do and so we do
some function and wedges late rounds get
confidence
but the cutting should thing is that
there's an interesting result of Grass
Knot isomorphisms and proving that a
graph is not isomorphic can you stand 0
dog proof for this that's actually not
impede don't give somebody a certificate
proving interactive
so that's not what H things about
students that these are all proofs for
things that are two are
the cup
immunity really grabs hearts out
siggraph yes and in this case you don't
need you're not creating the nose but I
mentioned graph not the proof for this
actually kind of interesting thing is
the way I would do is there enough proof
for graph I supplies right dudes I think
encrypt or commits at every single match
and so I have something crap but have
every note every possible hedge beat
incursion and there's two challenges so
in this case Bob either asked me to show
him actually this is a site figure this
out remove that girl has a cycle which
is another enemy blue pump is all I
would either challenged me for reveal
the cycle so I'd open up edge have a
path through the vollrath or you just
asked me to reveal cool wrap this show
it's the actual Grail so you if I try to
cheat and give him a crap that didn't
have a Slagle it would catch me you know
half the time and I try to give him I'm
trying to do anything else you catching
it out cited question behind with it
there any more questions
yes Obama
follow my question when you trust on
that occasion scheme which is our only
probabilistic accurate yes I would if
the probabilistic means that you can
drive it up as much as you want so it's
like flipping homes so if you say you
know where I trust something except in
the case where the letter heads in a row
yeah trust it because it's not
home vs
yeah this way every criticism is
probabilistic aggregate you know there's
always the case we're seeing is an
exponential chance just guessing p.m.
first try that's it the exception of
information here at the secure fence
any other questions
right well it up and then decide next we
are really hurting from the top should
be interesting as a good speaker and
kind of tie to get a lot of things we
talked about this course and give any
questions feel free to email me thank
