NASA's Kepler mission is in a launch and
that's focused on detecting extrasolar
planets and to talk about his part of
that mission is Travis Metcalfe from
Boulder Colorado in the National Center
for Atmospheric Research and he's also
going to touch on our product he's
involved with called pale blue thanks
for coming thanks for the invitation
I've tried to make this presentation
accessible public level because I'm
aware that it's going to go out on
youtube so feel free to interrupt with
questions at any time you may have seen
this image in the news in the last
couple months this is the first direct
image of an extrasolar planet the planet
orbiting a star other than the Sun a
several years ago the Hubble Space
Telescope took an image of this star and
discovered a dust ring a ring of dust
around the star and the fact that it was
a ring rather than a disc given what we
understand about the formation of
planets suggested that there may be a
planet in this in the system at the
inner edge of the of the ring that had
swept out the material in the inner
portion of the disk so a few years late
a couple years later they went back and
took another image hoping that that
planet would have moved and sure enough
they found a slight motion of the planet
over the two-year period now this planet
is several times the mass of Jupiter and
it orbit its orbits its star several
times further away from its star than
neptune is like three times the distance
of neptune from the sun what we'd really
like to find a course is the holy grail
in this field is an earth-like planet in
orbit around a sun-like star and i guess
the reason that that's the Holy Grail is
that we really want to answer this
question are we alone in the universe
and so what we're really after is
habitable planets
planets that are orbiting at Earth's
distance and they have mass similar to
the earth to accomplish that objective
what we need is very precise
measurements of the amount of light
coming from a very large sample of stars
say a hundred thousand over a several
year time span and the reason for that
is that if if we look at stars for a
sustained period of time what we'd like
to there are some fraction of those
stars that will have planets and some
fraction of those planets will be
oriented in such a way that the planet
will pass in front of the star from our
point of view and that will cause a
small dip in the amount of light that we
see for a short period of time a couple
of hours and the the depth of that dip
is a measure of the relative area of
that planet compared to the area of the
star now in general we don't know the
sizes of the stars that we'd be looking
at and so in order to get an absolute
size for the planet to know if it's
exactly the size of the earth or twice
the size of the earth we need some way
of measuring the absolute size of the
star that it's that it's orbiting and
that's the main thing that I'll be
talking about today so NASA's Kepler
mission is going to launch about two
months from now the main goal of this
mission is to find habitable planets
around sun-like stars to accomplish that
objective it will look at this enormous
single field of view in the sky it's
about 400 times the size of the full
moon and we'll just stare at the single
big patch of sky using very high-quality
digital cameras taking measurements of
the brightness of about a hundred
thousand stars every 30 minutes for
about four to six years the thing that
that drives the time scale is that to
find earth that are its distance around
a sun-like star you need to see a small
dip in the amount of light weight an
entire year until the planet comes
around again
and find an identical dip in the amount
of light and then a third time to make
sure that the period is the same there
are many things that could produce a
false detection of if you just have to
transits let's say a sunspot or
something like that so three three and a
half years is about the minimum amount
of time that you need to monitor the
Stars in order to find earth at Earth's
distance so too to determine the
absolute size of the stars and therefore
the absolute sizes of the planets that
are discovered a small fraction at any
one time of those 100,000 stars will be
monitored at a higher cadence we'll take
a measurement of the brightness every
minute instead of every 30 minutes and
that sampling is sufficient to see
oscillations in the amount of light in
the star itself stars naturally pulsate
very very subtly a few parts per million
in their total integrated brightness and
those oscillations can tell us quite
easily the absolute size of the of the
star and therefore the absolute size of
the planet this image is a snapshot of
the part of the Kepler target list in
google sky that we're using as part of a
public education and fundraising project
called the pale blue dot project and if
you want to know more about that ask me
at the end and i'll i'll tell you a
little bit about it but what I'd like to
do now is give you just a broad overview
of how we can learn anything about the
insides of stars using their pulsations
and then talk about the specific
low-level form of artificial
intelligence that we're using to try to
do this in an automated way the amount
of data coming from the Kepler satellite
will be so immense that we just can't
possibly keep up with that amount of
data without automating the procedure so
I'll talk briefly about the amount of
data will be full Astro seismic
information so the pulsation frequencies
of hundreds of stars every three months
for several years so to put that
perspective in the last five years such
measurements have been made on maybe a
dozen stars so the volume of data would
be much much greater so i'll talk about
escrow seismology i'll talk a little bit
about this the genetic algorithms and
how we're using them to automate this
procedure and finally give you the first
results of our first application of this
of this automated method to a star that
we know and love the sun it's it's this
hundred square degrees near the plane of
the Milky Way in between the
constellation Cygnus and Lyra it was
selected to be close enough to the
Galactic plane that you could find
100,000 solar-type stars to monitor so
far enough out of the plane that you
won't get as much contamination from
very large stars that are that were are
less interesting from the standpoint of
extrasolar planets yeah yeah all right
so one of the earliest works in the
theory of stellar pulsations or the
oscillations of stars was written in
1926 by British astronomer Sir Arthur
Eddington and this is the way it's the
book was called the internal
Constitution of the stars and this is
the way that the book begins at first
sight it would seem that the deep
interior of the Sun and stars is less
accessible to scientific investigation
than any other region of the universe
our telescopes may probe farther and
farther into the depths of space but how
can we ever obtain certain knowledge of
that which is hidden behind substantial
barriers what appliance can pierce
through the outer layers of the star and
test the conditions within well 80 years
ago when this was written eddingtons
answered was theory theory is how we'll
will create mathematical models of stars
and that's how we'll learn about their
interiors
but 80 years later we now have a
different answer estro seismology so
espero seismology is the study of the
internal structure of stars using their
oscillation or pulsation frequencies
basically it's analogous to seismology
on the earth in that we use sound waves
that probe through the interiors and
bring information to the surface in the
form of brightness and velocity
variations surface motions one of the
main motivations for wanting to know
about the insides of stars is that stars
are essentially working nuclear fusion
reactors and we have one at the center
of our own solar system that we've been
studying for 30 years if we could
somehow master the the form of energy
production that the Sun and all the
stars use we would have an inexhaustible
form of clean energy for the planet with
no radioactive byproducts so that's the
grand scheme we've been studying the Sun
as I said for several decades in this
regard a field called helioseismology
but the Sun is just one star at a
particular set of physical conditions at
a single age in its evolution and we to
try to ensure that we haven't fine-tuned
our knowledge or understanding in some
way to fit this single point of the Sun
it's useful to study other stars that
are like the Sun say that sample
different physical conditions and
different evolutionary stages of stars
to make sure that we haven't fine-tuned
our knowledge on a more immediate
concern is that the Sun consists of
oiling gases with embedded magnetic
fields these bubble up to the surface
the magnetic fields get twisted and
break and send huge ejections of
material out sometimes towards the earth
and these ejections of charged particles
can be a danger to astronauts on the
International Space Station can damage
satellites and can induce currents that
bring down electrical grids on the earth
so from a practical standpoint it would
be nice to know what's going on on the
end
so that we can learn to predict these
sorts of events in our own son well
here's a very intuitive example of how
we can use sound to see inside objects
that are normally opaque like the earth
the Sun and other stars are opaque the
hot surfaces are opaque to radiation
they can't see down into the interiors
directly but it turns out that they have
their own source of sound waves that we
can use to probe the interiors if you
look at a small patch of the Sun over
time and this is a time-lapse movie so
it's sped up quite a bit and you see the
earth here at the same scale to give you
an idea of how how small a batch of the
Sun we're actually looking at if you
look at the Sun surface it's just
boiling there's there's these boiling
motions up flows and down flows and if
you convert these motions into it just
sounds you'll hear something like this
basically this boiling is creating sound
waves at all frequencies of wide range
of frequencies and some of these
frequencies are resonant inside the
spherical cavity of the star and set up
standing waves coherent oscillations
that we can use to probe the insides of
the stars they travel through the
interior and bring information to the
surface and we can study it there the
convective motions are a little bit like
a piston so they are driving density
waves the sound waves pressure waves
through the interior of the star the
speed of sound inside of a star depends
on such things as its temperature and
its composition and so we can use those
sound waves to actually probe those
those quantities since the temperature
of a star increases as you go farther
and farther in the leading edge of any
wave front of sound waves or pressure
waves that are moving down towards the
center of this
are the leading edge is deeper into the
star and will have a higher sound speed
and it will gradually refract or bend
away from the center of the star and
back up toward the surface and when it
hits the surface it essentially just
bounces off and back down into the
center of the star and this is how these
standing waves are are set up now the
sound waves that are generated in stars
are much much lower than what the human
ear could ever hear and the sound waves
themselves are only generated and travel
inside the star the space around the
star is an empty vacuum and sound waves
can't travel through the through the
empty space between us and so it's only
through the variations and the
brightness at the surface of the star
that we can that we use to determine the
presence of these sound waves on the
interior the sound does not it's
important to realize that the sound does
not directly travel to us and we're not
actually listening to the Stars we're
converting the variations in the amount
of light into sound waves now to do that
in a way that the human ear can
appreciate you need to speed up the
sound waves by a factor of about a
million so there are lots of things that
here on earth that generate sounds that
are beyond the capabilities of the human
ear to hear for example at the low end
and slightly below the range of human
hearing blue whales have songs some
people find very beautiful
I'm not sure what they're saying I think
they might be complaining about the Navy
sonar or something but if we speed up
the sound waves that we record
underwater of the blue whales we can map
them into the automobile domain and hear
a sound that like like the one I just
played similarly bats emit
high-frequency sound waves as a form of
sight basically that are above the range
of human hearing but if we slow those
sound waves down we can also hear them
and I'll warn you that this is a
slightly disturbing alright so we'll do
similar things for stars in a few
minutes but the basic idea for on the
way there let's just talk in general
about about oscillations and how we
characterize them and we'll start with a
simple example of oscillations in one
dimension and a good example there is
the string of a violin so there's
essentially a single number that can
characterize the oscillation on the
string of a violin and that is it
represents the number of times that the
string wobbles back and forth between
the two end points and the frequency of
the tone that the string emits is a
function of that of that number so the
more times the oscillation oscillates
between the two endpoints the higher the
frequency of the sound that we hear so
these are a few examples of the some of
the lowest order oscillation modes in a
violin string the frequencies that you
hear and the geometry of the oscillation
mode essentially tell you something
about the mean density of the string and
the overall size of the instrument
that's playing it so the human ear can
easily distinguish between something
like a violin
and something like a child
okay let's move to two dimensional
oscillations here the oscillations
divided into two broad categories and
one category the radial modes the
oscillations are symmetric about the
center of the drum so again you can
describe those types of modes with the
number of times the mode wheels back and
forth between one side of the drum and
the other and again they are the tone
that you hear from such a such a awesome
mode will depend on that number so the
frequency is higher for higher numbers
the non radial modes are not symmetric
about the center of the of the drum and
instead the energy of the oscillations
seems to move from one side to the other
back and forth and this pattern of how
the oscillation energy moves about the
surface of the drum is another number
that tells us about the geometry of the
oscillation mode and also helps
determine the frequency that we actually
here so again the the information that
we that we get from the frequency and
from the geometry of the oscillation
mode off the head of a drum tells us
something about the average surface
density of the material on the top of
the drum as well as the overall size of
the drum so we can easily distinguish
between something like a bongo and a big
kettle drum all right now to 3d
oscillations and this is where stars are
the perfect example again we have the
the separation into two broad classes of
modes the radial modes and the non
radial nodes the radial nodes from the
outside of a star look like the star is
just breathing everything's getting
expanding and contracting you see the
stars surface uniformly get brighter and
fainter but if you look on the inside
you find that
the oscillation actually does wiggle
back and forth a different number of
times on its way from the center of the
star to the surface so some parts are
expanding while other parts are
contracting it's not just a uniform
expansion and contraction like a
breathing motion necessarily the non
radial nodes again show the
characteristic behavior that the
oscillation energy is moving from maybe
one side of the star to the other and
and this pattern on the surface the
geometry of the oscillation that we can
actually observe tells us something
about the frequency of the oscillation
mode and these are some of the lowest
order patterns that we can observe in
other stars because the the so-called
dipole quadrupole and octupole modes
have very large features so that when
you average over the whole surface of
the star which we must do with distant
stars we don't have any spatial
resolution across the surface of the
star they're just too far away so in the
case of the Sun you do have spatial
resolution but when we're looking at
other stars we're just looking at an
average of everything on the surface
that's pointing towards us so it's only
these lowest order non radial modes that
we can see so we see the radial nodes
and these lowest order non radial nodes
yeah that's right remember that these
sound waves are essentially pressure
waves and so as we're changing the
pressure on different parts of the
surface those different parts one part
heats up while another part cool it is
an actual tangent brightness and then in
stars like this sorry I should have
repeated the question it stars like the
Sun these brightness changes are
measured in a few parts per million
there are very very tiny oscillations in
the amount of light so the Sun for
example you can see the whole surface
get brighter and finger with a period
roughly five minutes every five minutes
you'll get a brightening anything but
but at this very subtle level
so what do we actually measure from a
distance and there are two different
possibilities for how to measure these
oscillations in stars there's the light
variation and that's the method that we
use that the Kepler method the Kepler
spacecraft will use because the total
library a shins are so small as i
mentioned parts per million that the
turbulence the scintillation noise in
the earth's atmosphere just completely
washes it out so there's no hope of
measuring those brightness changes from
from ground-based telescopes you have to
do it from space in this top plot you
you like you're actually seeing
oscillations in the star like the Sun
similar to the Sun you see the full
range here is less than half a percent
and the very largest oscillations that
you see in this and this star monitored
over nearly two months those
oscillations are those variations are
actually due to just tiny star spots
rotating interview and out of you again
sometime later those are not the
oscillations that we're looking around
what looks like noise the thickness of
this line is actually mostly due to
those boiling motions themselves and the
tiniest effects that you can't even see
at this scale are the actual
oscillations but by decomposing this
signal into its constituent frequencies
you can separate out those effects and
see the oscillations clearly the other
possibility is to measure the surface
motions that are caused by these
pressure waves these are measured in
just few meters per second it's just the
material on the surface moving on
average towards you or or away from you
and we can measure this by passing the
light through a spectrograph and looking
at the dark features that are created by
the individual chemical elements in the
spectrum and the rainbow and those dark
lines move back and forth in frequency
as this the source moves towards us or
away from us so we can measure that
radial velocity those two to document
those variations and this in fact has
been the primary method that extrasolar
planets have been detected by because
the star in with a planet in orbit
around it will have a reflex motion so
if you have a Jupiter out here it's not
just that Jupiter is orbiting the Sun is
that the Sun and Jupiter are orbiting a
common center of mass and so with as the
Jupiter goes around the star the star
wobbles a little bit and you can measure
the radial portion of that wobble using
this this method and thereby infer the
presence of extrasolar planets and this
is by far most of the couple of hundred
extrasolar planets planets discovered
around other stars have been inferred
from this sort of technique and in fact
that's what's driven the technology to
get very very precise measurements of
the radial velocity that finally just in
the last few years it's precise enough
now to measure the oscillation motions
on the surface of this star so let's
look at a few examples of the
oscillations in a few different types of
stars just to give you an idea on what
they're all about so the nearest system
of stars to the Sun is the Alpha
Centauri system it's actually a
collection of three stars in orbit
around each other one of the stars is
slightly larger than the Sun another is
slightly larger than slightly smaller
than the Sun and the third is it just a
tiny red dwarf star called Proxima
because it's at the moment actually the
nearest star to the to the Sun so Alpha
Centauri a was observed some years ago
using this radial velocity technique
from the ground and if you look at
essentially the amplitude or the power
of say the volume of the oscillation as
a function of its frequency if you
decompose those signals out into their
constituent frequencies you see a whole
range of frequencies with discrete
values between about five and ten
minutes excited in Alpha Centauri a and
if you convert those frequencies into
the audible range by speeding them up by
a factor of a million or so you would
hear something like this
so these these oscillations tell us
about the size the mass the chemical
composition even the efficiency of
convection in these stars and their ages
which is another thing that is very
difficult to measure for individual
stars and will become much more easy to
do using the technique of estero
seismology now towards the end of its
life our own Sun will slowly expand into
a red giant star this is a simulation of
convection in a red giant star done at
University of Minnesota you can see the
convective cells are much much bigger
occupying a significant fraction of the
surface of the star compared to the
movie that I showed you earlier and when
you translate these oscillations again
into the into the audible domain you'd
hear something like this all other
things being equal a bigger star will
oscillate in lower oscillation
frequencies when these observations were
actually taken a press release was
issued with this very exciting result of
the first detects one of the first
detection of solar like oscillations in
another star the investigators released
this sound file along with the with the
discovery press release and one of their
collaborators collaborators was in
Belgium and the their students reported
that that very weekend the discotheques
were are the djs we're already
incorporating this sound into their
music so if anybody ever tells you that
there's no practical application of
astronomy you can tell them otherwise
finally at the very end of our son's
life all that will remain is the hot
dense core of the of the what used to be
the red giant star a white dwarf star
and this is one example of at the very
very end of a white dwarf stars life it
actually is that such high pressure that
when it gets cool enough it will begin
to crystallize in the center and so at
the very very end of our
is life there will just be a big pot
crystal at the center of the solar
system this particular star BPM 370 93
is oddly a little bit more massive and
so more massive than an average white
dwarfs are and so actually crystallizes
begins to crystallize at a temperature
where those stars are known to to
pulsate and so by studying the
pulsations you could actually detect the
presence of this crystal crystallized
Center and the white dwarf star and
again if you translate these oscillation
frequencies into a sound you hear
something like this again all other
things being equal a smaller star will
oscillate at higher frequencies so I
think you get a general sense that by
observing the oscillation frequencies in
other stars we can get some idea about
its absolute size it's sort of one of
the first things that comes out just
from the range of oscillation
frequencies that it that it exhibits and
remember the motivation here is that if
we know the absolute size of the star
then the measurements of transiting
planets will allow us to convert the
relative radius of the planet compared
to the star into an absolute size for
that planet so let me just state take a
step back here now change gears and talk
about now that we are beginning to get
these observations of oscillations and
other stars how do we translate those
observations into actual knowledge about
the star the general way that this is
done in science in general is that once
you have the observations you create a
computer model a mathematical model
that's what Eddington was talking about
80 years ago and in general your model
is not going to be perfect the first
time so you look at the differences
between the model and the observations
and you try to adjust whatever
parameters or geometry or physics of the
model to try to get a one-to-one
correspondence
between the observations and the model
output and this process of sort of
revising the model to try to improve the
match to the observation really it
fundamentally that's an optimization
process and what role does aesthetics
play it's sort of like one example is
during Copernicus's time there were
competing models of the of the structure
of the solar system once they realize
that the earth was not at the center of
the solar system and the Sun was
actually there there were competing
ideas that well the orbits of the
planets could be ellipses where they
could be perfect circles with perfect
circles on top of those perfect circles
epicycles they called them and from from
the standpoint of aesthetics they both
made equal predictions but one is
simpler and so you'd prefer it's like
Occam's razor you'd always prefer the
simplest okay so mathematicians have
devised various methods to deal with
optimization problems each with their
strengths and weaknesses let's imagine
that this surface represents two
different parameters of your model on
the two axes and the height of the
surface represents the quality of the
match between the predictions of the
model with those parameters and the
observations that you have in hand now
if your parameter space if you like
looks like this and pretty much any
optimization method that you want to use
will work just as well you will select
some initial guess of those two
parameter values which will be somewhere
in this parameter space and then you'll
iterate in some way to try to improve
upon that first guess and the most
likely outcome is that you'll if your
optimization method is good at all
you'll find this single peak in the
parameter space but what if your
parameter space looks like this then the
problem becomes a little bit more tricky
if you give an initial guess for the
parameters the most likely outcome is
that you will end up at a local optimum
other than the global optimum right in
the middle now if you just calculate all
of the models for each combination of
all of these parameters and you can
construct a map of the space and know
where exactly where the global optimum
is but the whole point of an
optimization method in some sense is to
avoid having to do that so that
motivates our use of a genetic algorithm
which you can think of as exploring the
space as broadly as a complete grid of
the all the parameters but with a
substantial discount essentially a
genetic algorithm is an iterative Monte
Carlo technique with a kind of a memory
of what has worked better than average
in the past excuse me here's how it
works you you populate your parameter
space with some number of random
combinations of the parameters and you
evaluate the model for each of those
combinations and calculate the the
height of that surface the difference
between the predictions of the model and
the observations that you're looking at
you assign a fitness a goodness-of-fit
to each of this trial trials that is
inversely proportional to that quality
of the match so or to the inversely
proportional to the difference between
the observations in the model so if it
fits well it gets a higher fitness if it
doesn't fit so well it gets a lower
fitness then you select a new population
from this old initial random set of
parameter values from the old one waited
by the fitness so things with high
Fitness have a better chance of passing
their characteristics on to future
generations now without something else
without another ingredient you would
never find a solution that's better than
the best in your initial sampling of
parameter space so you need some way of
mixing up the information
way and a genetic algorithm uses a
series of operations that are analogous
to breeding and mutation so that's where
the genetic part of it comes in it's an
analogy with biological evolution
through natural selection so you mix up
the the information from that newly
selected population and you go back and
evaluate the model of those now shuffled
up solutions and continue iterating like
that until you've essentially stop
improving your match to the observations
now all of the details really are in
these in these operations that mimic
breeding and mutation so let me just
spend a little bit of time telling you
how that works so suppose you have two
parameters in your model and you pair up
while you the first thing you need to do
in order to apply these operations is to
encode them in some way and so the
simplest way of encoding would be to
just take the numerical values of the
parameters and convert them into a long
string of digits this string is
analogous to a chromosome and each digit
is analogous to a gene okay so then the
breathing operation randomly pairs up
these encoded representations of the
parameter sets and then to breed you
randomly select the position along the
string chop the strings at that position
and swapped the two strings from that
position to the end so this is analogous
to breeding the mutation operation is
you randomly select a position along
each of the strings and then change that
value to a new randomly selected value
that's like mutation so once you've
performed these operations on all of the
the whole population you then decode the
strings of numbers back into actual
values for the parameters and you can
see in this example the final set of the
new set of parameter values is related
to the original set
in an extremely nonlinear way a very
stochastic random way there's a there's
a sound theoretical basis for why this
particular combination of operations
leads to optimization it's called schema
theorem but I honestly don't understand
schema theorem so I'm not going to
explain it to you or even try so that's
how it works in theory how does a
genetic algorithm work and practice
there's a famous story about Francis
Crick the co-discoverer of DNA who gave
a talk about evolution and and DNA and
at the end of his talk one of the
members of the audience stood up and
said I just can't see how evolution
could possibly create something as
complicated as an eyeball how do you
explain that and his response was well
my dear evolution is cleverer than you
are that really summarizes why we use
genetic algorithms because they work
they just work so here's an example of
the initial random sampling of a space
of two parameters say the mass of the
star and its temperature and if we let
the genetic algorithm go and iterate
through this process wow that was fast
let's wait for it to cycle through what
you see is a relatively fast initial
convergence to a to a single point in
this diagram but then after it gets to a
relatively confined region the genetic
algorithm continues to try to innovate
so you see the signatures of those two
genetic operators in this in this
diagram in that around the point where
many of the solutions fall you see a
kind of a cross hairs appearing pattern
and that's the mutation operation the
mutation operation remember takes a
single position
along that string and randomly changes
the value so that's it's just changing
the value smaller or larger of one of
the parameters and so you get jumps in
one of the parameters at a time the
crossover operator can change the values
of two parameters at once because
depending on where it decides to cut and
splice the chromosomes if you like this
can lead to diagonal jumps in the in the
parameter space and so you also see some
larger or smaller jumps in in the
diagonal directions in this diagram all
right now to the the final topic how are
we actually using genetic algorithms
this the sort of low level form of
artificial intelligence in the context
of trying to model stars and match our
theoretical models of their oscillation
frequencies to the observations that we
that will soon get from the Kepler
satellite I mean the genetic algorithm
is a stochastic process and so if you
run it forever it will always find
almost always you can contrive specific
mathematical forms for the parameter
space that that will deceive it or make
it extremely inefficient but if you run
it forever it will eventually most
likely find the answer ok so the
traditional approach to the task of
modeling stars is to take some non
seismic observations say measurements of
its total brightness its colors that are
an indication of its temperature and
these define a kind of a box in this
parameter space here and these tracks
are models of stars that start their
lives over on one side and then evolve
so the star is changing its total
brightness and its temperature over time
and for a given mass
the star you'll get a nice track in this
diagram for for each for each stage of
that star's life so the idea is that you
adjust the value of the parameter say
the mass to try to pass through this box
of classical non seismic observations of
brightnesses and colors what what Astro
seismology does is along each point at
each point along these tracks you can
also take that model and perform a
pulsation analysis on it and so it
provides a kind of a third dimension to
this figure so that not only must you
pass through the box but the oscillation
frequencies of the model in that
particular point must also match the
oscillation frequencies that you observe
so it's a provides many many more new
constraints that we didn't have before
to find the optimal match between your
stellar model and the observations now
the trouble the good and bad thing about
the Kepler mission is that it will be
producing data at such a rate that we
just can't possibly try to keep up using
this traditional adjust the models by
hand and out for the best so what we
really need is a general purpose tool
that will probe all of the values of the
parameters where where we expect to find
solar like oscillations and other stars
so a whole wide range of masses for the
stars of compositions and here even of
ages that are represented by the
position in this diagram and even the
efficiency of convection and the basic
idea here is that you take the
oscillation frequencies that Kepler
observes and you feed them into this
stellar modeling pipeline that is that
is driven by the genetic algorithm
oscillation frequencies in let the
genetic algorithm go to work and get the
optimal values of those parameters out
as output it's a computationally
intensive problem but humans don't have
to be in bad
to start the thing up for our first
application we're using data from the
Bison Network bison stands for
Birmingham solar oscillation network it
started a project to establish a global
network of telescopes because the
Earth's rotating if you want to observe
this on twenty-four/seven you need a
network of telescopes around the globe
and this was started more than 30 years
ago and doing helioseismology seismology
of the Sun for for quite a long time
very precisely the nice thing about this
data set is that the duration the length
of the time series and the precision of
the time series are comparable in fact
even better than what we expect for
other sun-like stars from the Kepler
mission and so we can we can degrade the
observation so that will match the
uncertainties that will get from the
Kepler observations and then test if we
feed those oscillation frequencies to
the to the genetic algorithm does it
find the actual properties of the Sun
and we have the advantage with the Sun
that we know those property is extremely
well they've all been measured very very
well including the age you can determine
the age of the Sun or the solar system
just from the edges of meteorites for
example so here's an example of how the
behavior of the genetic algorithm on
this bison data set you can see what
we're looking at here is a measure of
the difference between the model the
best model in a particular iteration of
the genetic algorithm and and the
observations as a function of that
iteration or generation number and you
see in less than two hundred generations
this is for four independent runs of the
genetic algorithm seated with a
different random initialization you can
see that initially the convergence is
quite fast that's driven by the breeding
or crossover operator and then that's
followed by a series of discrete jumps
improvement
in the fit from random favorable
mutation operations you can see that
three out of the four runs finds the
global solution in under two hundred
generations and we actually ran these
these simulations for three hundred
generations and there was no further
improvement so that the idea here is to
optimize our efficiency so cut it before
we stop improving as I mentioned the if
you run the genetic algorithm
indefinitely it will eventually find a
global solution but a more efficient way
is actually to run it for a finite
amount of time but just do several
simulations with different random
initialization and you can and you can
end up getting the global solution get
fewer model evaluations than you would
by just running one forever so that's
how it the genetic algorithm did it
takes ten ten thousand CPU hours for
each of these runs so it's a pretty
computationally intensive problem we've
been doing it on a single rack blue jean
system at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research and here are the
results when you put the sun's
oscillation frequencies into the genetic
algorithm this is how it did so here
we're looking at the frequency of the
oscillation versus basically a measure
of its geometry so here we're looking at
the radial modes dipole quadrupole and
octupole modes and in fact we only fit
the 36 frequencies that lie between
these dashed lines and only the and we
did not we did not actually use as
constraints these octupole modes so
fitting only the l equals 0 1 and 2
modes in this range you see that the
match is really really quite good and
that it also matches the l equal 3 modes
and the modes that are outside the
frequency range at the low end for all
of those all of those modes so in terms
of matching the frequencies that we
actually observed in the Sun the genetic
algorithm does very very well and
looking at the the more traditional
observational constraints like
total brightness and the temperature of
the surface temperature you see a
typical error box here for how well
those parameters might be constrained
for objects that we will see in the
Kepler satellite and the dot there is
the solution that the that the genetic
algorithm found so not only does it
match the observation frequencies but it
matches the temperature in age than a
very high precision and the the total
brightness and the and the radius the
key to finding the absolute size of the
planets to very high precision so it's a
very encouraging first result put the
sun's oscillation frequencies in and we
get the sun's properties out and so now
our task is to repeat this sort of
experiment for stars in other regions of
the of the diagram where maybe they're
more massive or less massive or older or
younger and make sure that it can fit
those stars as well and what we'd like
to do what we're working on is actually
making this tool this pipeline available
as a terra grid science gateway so tied
to computational resources so that our
collaborators many of them in europe who
don't have access to their own
supercomputer can go to this web
interface upload their particular set of
observational data from the Kepler
satellite click a button and the the
genetic algorithm will run on some
computational resources in the US and a
week later they'll get an email with the
solution will also be archived to the
website to avoid duplication of effort
and of course the website will also
allow people it's all open source so
people can if they have if they do have
their own supercomputers can run this
code on their own the basic idea here is
to encourage a uniform analysis of the
Kepler data so that when we're looking
at these hundreds and hundreds of stars
every few months the tools that we're
using to analyze them could be the same
for all the sets of data so any things
that we want to infer about the
population of stars and that
Kepler satellite looks at will be self
consistent internally self-consistent so
it's a great 46 first success if there's
one thing I'd like hope you'll take away
from this talk it's the answer to
edingtons question what appliance can
pierce through the outer layers of the
star and test the conditions within I
hope you know now that the answer is s
true seismology thanks any questions
sure so we're working on a publication a
public education and fundraising project
to fund this asteroseismology part of
the of the Kepler mission basically the
consortium of investigators who are in
charge of this part of the mission are
headquartered in Denmark and so NASA
simply cannot fund that part of the
project it's not legal for them to fund
a foreign institution and so as an
alternative we're starting this program
where members of the public can adopt
one of the hundred thousand stars that
the Kepler satellite will look at for a
donation of ten dollars they get like a
personalized certificate by email and
then when planets start to be discovered
around the Kepler stars that will get an
email saying oh look your adopted star
got a planet around it and the link to
information about where they can learn
more about the discovery the idea here
is to you know there are many companies
on the internet who have these deceptive
name estar programs and we're actually
using we're funded by the Google Grants
program for AdWords advertising so we're
competing side-by-side with these
companies giving people a non-profit
alternative to
we have their money support scientific
research rather than just lining the
pockets of these companies that are
doing it so the basic idea is people
select a star using google sky so they
can go in and browse the target stars
interactively in google sky click on the
place mark and find the number and then
say i want to adopt that star and the
place mark will then say who it's
adopted by so nobody no two people can
adopt the same star that's an important
feature as well they could also choose
from a special text version of the
catalog maybe select a number that
signifies a special date or look at the
physical properties of the star to try
to make it as sunlight as possible maybe
give it a better chance of having
planets around it and then as I
mentioned they get a personalized
certificate by email and and information
that the once Kepler starts discovering
planets so so far we've raised less than
ten thousand dollars but we're really
hoping to get some kind of exposure to
get people excited about this project it
really is a cool offering some real
estate on the planets yeah or mineral
rights or something yeah yeah so the
question is about the the computational
costs of the of the genetic algorithm so
the blue jean as you know probably is a
special architecture that that uses slow
processors like 700 800 megahertz in
order to pack it in small enough space
there's two thousand and a single rack
so but part of it is just the
unavoidable cost of evaluating a lot of
models
it's it's complicating all the models in
the space it's a five dimensional space
to begin with but it's about a hundred
somewhere between 100 and a thousand
times more efficient so you're only
evaluating less than 1% of the models
that you would have to evaluate for a
full grid of that space but it's a big
space so less than 1% is still a lot of
models that's really so why not just
evaluate all the models and use the grid
over and over again for all those stars
the main reason is because when you
calculate a grid the physics that you
use in the models is frozen in and we
want to have the ability to gradually
improve the models over time so that we
expect that when we start looking at
oscillation data in other stars we're
actually going to learn something our
models aren't going to fit right and so
we're going to have to make changes to
the to the constitutive physics to the
ingredients of the models to try to
remedy that basically and so that's the
main motivation is since the grid
freezes the physics and we really want
the flexibility to improve things over
time so the question is about how many
parameters it's feasible to use the
genetic algorithm to tune for this type
of optimization I've successfully used
the agenda to cover them for stellar
models up to about six or seven
parameters but not more as the parameter
space gets higher and higher dimensional
it gets harder and harder the genetic
algorithm is a less efficient method
no I have not tried the neural networks
and what we're actually developing now
is a kind of a hybrid approach where we
use the genetic algorithm to narrow in
on the region of parameter space to
assure that we're in the right local
maximum and then use a more traditional
gradient climbing method to narrow in on
the precise values and uncertainties but
and that I think has the potential to
improve the efficiency of the approach
so the question is about encoding the
parameters doesn't matter if it's a
regular quantity or a log of a quantity
in fact one of the quantities we encode
in the log rather than rather than the
wrong number because it spans a wide
range of values and no it doesn't it
doesn't seem to matter the basically you
just have to fine tune it to try to
optimize the efficiency on a
case-by-case basis I don't think there's
a general prescription it would allow
you to to know a pre or I whether or not
it's going to work in a specific case
without just trying so the question is
did we learn anything from the Sun that
might help us with the Kepler project
helioseismology seismology to the Sun
has provided those lessons basically for
20 or more years and what what's
happened as a result is that our models
of stars like the Sun have been
extremely well calibrated for this one
specific case so we know from experience
that that kind of improvement in the
models is possible with these types of
observations and now the task is to just
do that at many different physical
conditions and many different ages 4
stars we have calibrated at a single
point and now we need to calibrate the
models at all these other points the
question is will the data be available
online yes there's a specific timeline
for Kepler data to become public because
of the planet-hunting nature the
timeline for that is longer than then
some people would like but the people
who've been working on the name I've
been working on it for a very long time
so so maybe that's appropriate the Astro
seismic part of it I think we'll be done
as openly as is feasible that's that
seems to be the pattern so far any other
questions thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
