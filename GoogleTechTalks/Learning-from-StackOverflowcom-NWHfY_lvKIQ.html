open source group here at Google um so
when I when I sent off well actually
when Ellen did the the hard work of
setting up the room sending off the
announcement that Joel was coming I got
a lot of email I got one was like wow
that's really funny that Joel's coming
here in the middle of Perth and I
thought that was scary and funny at the
same time because I was in no committee
when I got that and then another one was
can we get a copy of Stack Overflow for
our internal use I was like well you can
ask him at the thing which brings up
questions we have a Dory instance set up
if you'd like to use it you don't feel
like using your own voice and just
typing that's fine and for our friends
who are be seeing from seven or eight
offices worldwide so just search for
Spolsky I'm sure you'll find the Dory
page you're smart people so that's about
it from with no further ado Joel Spolsky
thanks thanks thanks for coming
everybody can can people hear me is this
working I'm trying to stand over here
because I understand that these scanners
are trying to take an image of my brain
which you're going to upload into a
computer and run to do searches for the
best sushi restaurant Palo Alto for the
rest of my life I'm gonna talk today
about Stack Overflow let me introduce
myself a little bit if you don't know
the the whole story I'm actually with
Michael Pryor who's sitting here the
co-founder of fog Creek software which
is a software company and I'm going to
walk around a little bit because like
when I stand here the camera goes with
me it's a software company in New York
City and we started about eight years
ago it makes fog bugs which is bug
tracking and project management software
used by development teams around the
world to make better software the
another project that we've launched
recently working with a guy named Jeff
Atwood who is a blogger at the web site
coding hard comm it's called Stack
Overflow and that's what I want to talk
about Stack Overflow is a website where
people ask questions and get answers you
may not be able to see that so I'll back
they'll just make sure
all screaming here there are a lot of
question and answer sites and there's a
couple things I want to talk to today
because this is Google that have to do
with search because I actually feel like
search engines are kind of failing in a
particular realm of expert questions and
answers worth something you could ask an
expert in the expert would be able to
give you a true and correct answer and
the search engines for various reasons
which I'll go into our just not finding
it Oh a lot of the companies organized
around search have tried to make
question and answer type portals and
Yahoo is famous for this how is babby
formed question mostly what you find on
Yahoo Answers appears to be adolescents
asking questions about reproductive
Sciences and put it politely and and
most of what you find and and for very
various other reasons this stuff is just
not working out that well on the search
engines but what I'm really going to do
today is tell you a little bit of a
story and it's a story about
anthropology and sociology and the story
is about how when you have a group of
people and you give them an environment
you don't even have to have the people
you just create an environment those
people will come into the environment
and behave according to what you built
in certain very very subtle ways that
you probably didn't think about so these
are the Spanish Steps in Rome and
they're they're meant to go from the
Spanish Embassy the Bourbon embassy at
the at the base of the steps up to the
Trinity today Monte Church the top and
so they were built to be stairs but they
became sort of this living room for
backpackers in the middle of Rome which
many of you probably went to in your gap
year and partially it has to do with the
steps being the perfect comfortable
height to sit on the steps are very wide
so you're not blocking anyone if you're
sitting there you have a fantastic view
of the Piazza down at the bottom when
you're sitting on these steps and so
they became sort of a living room
because of the shape and this was
completely non intentional some things
some some things are a little bit more
intentional where you create an
environment with the goal of maybe
steering people are letting people wait
in the line or whatever it is that
you're doing and some things are even
more precisely designed to create a
certain type of behavior whatever it may
be and
one of the things that we're learning as
we move into the era moving from the era
of computing to moving into the era of
the Internet is that we're no longer
worrying about computer human
interaction because that's kind of a
solved problem usability I don't want to
say solve but usability is something
which is no longer a major impediment
and there are a lot of known solutions
what's not known so well is when you're
using a computer and there are other
people involved because it's it's an
email program or it's a social program
or a social networking or its web 2.0
not allowed to say that I take that back
you have to think about human to human
interaction that means you have to be an
anthropologist and you have to think
about how humans work and you have to
think about stuff that ethnographers and
cultural anthropologists like to think
about all the time so that's really what
we thought about the environment in
anthropology it's very clear that the
environment you create influences people
and how they behave and similarly the
user interface that you create for your
applications will influence how people
behave and you have to think about it as
an anthropologist to be able to do a
good job I'm going to talk about how we
did that with deco phone why it works
and so on so when you have an app like
Yahoo Answers let's just I just want to
poke around some of the other this is
what we did in the early days of Stack
Overflow we poked around some of the
competition the question-and-answer
websites to try to see like what the
heck is going on here in terms of user
interface and some of this may be accent
I'll ask answer discover what is it
about this website that means that you
really do get teenagers asking questions
like what eats the ants I squish at
least it's not who eats be enticed
squish mahalo answers I don't know if
you've heard of this but this is a
website from Jason Calacanis who has an
inordinate belief in micro payments for
some reason and so the website is all
about earning a dollar of Mahalo dollar
doing this and spending on Mahalo dollar
doing that and that creates a certain
environment and it creates questions
that are all kind of like scams where
you can earn $7 or get a coupon good for
five dollars off at Supercuts or
whatever there are much more serious
forums this is the sort of standard I'm
going to call it the PHP BB
because almost all web forms are either
using software that looks exactly like
this or they're actually using PHP
itself which looks exactly like this
with this idea of topics and replies and
who knows and it all looks great serious
there's a particular website which whose
name I will not mention but it's got a
big - in the middle of the URL and we'll
call it the - website from now on and it
is uh I don't want to officially say the
raison d'être for a stack overload it
certainly pushed me over the edge
because this is a website where you ask
a question usually typing it into Google
about a specific engineering or
technical topic and you go you the
answer appears to exist there and when
you go there you don't see the answer
and you see a lot of pages saying please
sign up give us money and you will see
the answer and you say wait a minute
that's not right they must be showing a
different page to Google and they're
showing to regular people and there's a
secret which I won't like that you ain't
on because I want them to burn in hell
but um that that particular site looks
like what it looks like because I mean
they've pre they create a site that what
does this look like this looks like one
of those corporate enterprise startups
right like we won't even tell you how
much it costs just go to the bank and
get all your money bring to us and give
it to us and then go back to the bank
see if you get a loan
Amazon sort of kept reading all the
articles in Newsweek magazine about how
Google was just a big search box so they
made a big search box where you can ask
a question right at the top and I don't
know if that really makes sense but
people ask a whole lot of questions on
here and they don't answer a heck of a
lot of questions and that's just a part
of like the design decision to emphasize
asking rather than answering so we built
Stack Overflow and it looks kind of
bizarre and there's all kinds of little
bits and pieces all over the place which
makes it beloved to programmers but I
want to go over here's a little bit of
story concept was about about the
beginning of 2008 we started coding
almost exactly a year ago we shipped we
launched in September 2008 we had a like
a four week beta or something and we've
been around for about six months and
we're currently running six million
visits on and I'll go into more details
on them specs there's certain reasons
that we thought search engines were
failing with various
queries this is this is not actually a
particularly bad example of it but
knowing that Li is an HTML tag is
something that search engines don't
necessarily know I'll go more into this
this is my list of problems with search
that Stack Overflow is trying to solve
when we're trying to solve all these
problems at the same time um number one
the signup scams so that's the website
with the - where they're trying to they
tell you that you have to sign up and
pay if you want to see the answer and
actually you don't um there's just these
little road bumps like register this is
from sequel service central but a lot of
them have this it's like hey we got the
answer for you just one week but just
please register and that's just a little
bit frustrating and that actually
reduces participation I think
dramatically um now you're here now
we're going into some serious things
here search engines to get you a lot of
wrong answers when you search for highly
technical questions and that's the
biggest problem so here's here's three
popular categories a security hole a lot
of times we'll find a piece of sample
code that somebody has said here's the
answer to your problem and it's
something like turn off your firewall or
or more specifically um you know just
the typical like XSS vulnerability
sequel injection vulnerabilities that
you see in like so much sample code and
when you see that result you do a search
you see you get a result you say wow
there's an XSS vulnerability there I
gotta tell this guy there's no way to do
it there's no way to change it there's
no way to fix it on a typical form
software because you're looking at a
discussion that took place four years
ago
then there's the hard problems this is a
I don't know how popular it is but a
Google interview question implement Rand
seven in terms of RAM five and I won't
go into the details here but there's a
lot of wrong answers to this question
which is awesome because I can use this
as an interview question for college
students and even if they've researched
this question they will come in with the
wrong answer because you just have to
have a certain level of smarts to be
able to distinguish between all those
people asking the question in providing
wrong answers and people providing right
answers incidentally Stack Overflow has
a right answer multiple answers is much
more common where you get to a
discussion forum and somebody says have
you tried this if you tried that go here
I think there's an article about that
here's a Microsoft knowledgebase article
etc it said
etc you have no choice but to try every
answer and see if it works usually in
the dark until you accidentally kick
upon something that worked - this this
there's no page rank among answers to
highly technical questions a lot of time
to get obsolete results because there's
no PageRank when you have a very very
narrow technical question about some
very very obscure API that's not working
in some very obscure way on some obscure
platform that you're programming for
there's only a hundred people that are
going to ever look at that question and
therefore nobody's ever going to link to
the question and certainly you can't use
PageRank to link to the appropriate
answer nobody's going to write a blog
post about how the best answer to this
obscure question is such-and-such so the
authority of all these sites are the
PageRank is nil unless you know maybe
the site has some rank but it's just a
discussion forum so it's very very hard
for a search engine to see what the
right answers are it doesn't have any
way of using its normal methods and in
particular you get certain common
problems obsolete results is a really
really popular one is that Google for
example knowing nothing else about two
pages will take the older one and give
it a little bit or the one that's been
on the internet for longer and give it a
little bit of a push and that actually
turns out to be fundamentally wrong with
a lot of technologies so a very very
common problem you find is how do I do
such-and-such on my iPhone and then you
get to a lot of pages saying no it's
just not possible there is absolutely no
way to write an application for the
iPhone unless you make a webpage and
access it by a Safari and that was true
for a year and it's not true anymore
but there's a lot of pages that they'll
say that similarly if you search right
now for interior photography on Google
your number one result is an awesome
article about interior photography
written by Phil Greenspun before anybody
had digital cameras so here's my four
key reasons why search engines are
struggling with these highly technical I
got a programming question problems
number one they're to where they have
too few views so there's no authority
them that's really number two there are
too many ways to phrase the same problem
a lot of times you're struggling to find
the right words that will happen to
coincide with the words that the person
describing your problem happen to use
and that means that that your search
space basically is kind of diffused
among all the different possible
synonyms particular for a particular
problem and then there's the preference
for old links so here's nine things that
we did in Stack Overflow to try to build
a site that got around all these
problems and these are really these are
the the nine building blocks of the
social engineering that we did to try to
create a site that was anthropologically
correct and that would cause people to
behave in the way that would work and
that would basically solve all these
problems I'll go through them one at a
time is that's the key part voting this
is the easiest thing I mean these things
are really really easy every single one
of these ideas is copied from somewhere
else this point is copied from Reddit by
a Digg voting is the idea that you vote
up the answers that are good and it's
actually astonishing on Stack Overflow
how quickly the voting gets you the
right answer because other people come
in and vote up the right answers and
this happened this is a question that
was asked an hour ago and within an hour
the number one question already had nine
votes so as you can see it within
usually within a matter of minutes for
common questions you get a bunch of
answers sort of flowing in and the best
ones get voted up there is a one little
tweak of the voting algorithm which is
that the person who originally asked the
question has the special power to bestow
upon one answer as the official answer
and I'm to the top no matter what the
votes are and right below that you'll
see the number one community voted so
here's an example of a question where
the person who asked the question
decided that that answer over there
marked number 26 was actually better
than what the community thought or
solved his problem better than what the
community thought was the best answer
which was number 78 um rather than
picking a particular topic of
programming and attacking that first or
creating a hierarchy like Usenet which
is web 1.0 technology I guess which is a
old-fashioned technology we decided to
use tags and if you look at the
questions on Stack Overflow people are
pretty good at putting tags on their
questions and there are usually two or
three obvious tags to put any questions
so it allows you to say I'm asking this
question from a vb.net perspective not a
c-sharp perspective or I'm asking this
question you know I'm using like a lot
of times you'll see these questions and
you'll or you'll be searching for a
question you'll get to a result that
doesn't even apply to the correct
technology that you're actually using
it's that same problem in a different
domain so we put the tags in but we did
really really neat stuff of the tag so
number one we wanted you to be able to
create a view if you're a Python
programmer we want you to be able to
make Stack Overflow into a site that's a
great resource so you can tell it what
questions you're interested in what tags
are interested in what technologies are
interested in we also wanted you not to
have to see things that you're sick and
tired of hearing about like let's say
you just really don't ever want to hear
about dotnet programming ever again and
so you can list ignored tags which
you'll never see but then actually Stack
Overflow is doing all kinds of really
smart stuff with these tags so for
example my programming knowledge is
exceedingly obsolete I worked on a
little product called Excel where I was
in charge of the macro language strategy
and we created a thing called Visual
Basic for applications which is a way of
programming Excel which is very very old
but people still use it and so those are
the tags that I picked you can see up
there I pick VBA in Excel and when I
come to the site now it's going to look
for questions that it thinks I can
answer not because I said I was
interested in those tags but because I
have successfully answered those tags in
the past because I've because Stack
Overflow recognizes me as somebody who
can answer these obsolete questions on
Excel VBA
whenever there is a question on Excel
VBA Stack Overflow is going to try to
show it to me
because that's the best way it can get
it answered and as a result of this
intelligence that's sort of tag based
and our knowledge of the participants in
the site and what their skills are we're
able to achieve more than 90% of
questions getting answered with a
accepted answer we have editing and
here's a little difficult if it occurred
purpose of editing was originally so
that questions could get better and
answers could get better and better and
better while it's rather than freezing
most forum software the discussion
thread takes place in 2004 and four or
five people participate and then it just
remains is this frozen artifacts on the
Internet until the end of time and
that's why questions get out of date and
then also is why you can't remove errors
when you discover them and the questions
never get better so we kind of looked at
Wikipedia and said what if we let
everybody come in and
these entries and make them better and
better and better than the model for
Stack Overflow you know one of the early
pitches was it is a Wikipedia for where
every topic is an extremely specific
very very long tail programming question
where will have the best the question
will have the answer the answers will be
sorted and anybody can come in and edit
so if you've discovered that the number
one answer has a flaw in it you can hit
the edit button and fix it and if you
discover that the question was poorly
written or the question was written too
narrowly or the question was not
explicit enough you can go in and edit
the question to make it a better
question and our hope is that a large
body of the questions that are in Stack
Overflow will become the canonical place
on the internet to learn about very very
narrow specific questions about very
very narrow and specific programming
topics so in this particular case this
guy Martin very quickly answered a
question in hopes that he would help the
person as quickly as possible the person
asking the question just get something
out there so maybe that'll help the guy
solve this problem right away and then
he came back two days later because he
was disappointed that he wasn't earning
enough points for his question because
his question was kind of or I'm sorry
his answer was just a couple of lines
saying go use STD bit said don't roll
your own which he spelled wrong so
somebody fixed role later that's not
shown here and and because he wasn't
earning enough points and he obviously
wanted to earn some more points and
there just points he went in and edit
his question and provided sample code
and it got better in here in more points
because he provided sample code but but
a lot of times people will edit each
other's questions and these things get
added a lot and sometimes there are edit
Wars which is a problem but in general
the quest the answers the questions can
be cool better and better and better in
order to get people to do the things
that we want them to do on this site we
have a concept of badges and this is
sort of like achievements on Xbox 360
that's sort of our model for that and
it's based on the napoleonic quote the
quote from Napoleon saying that I don't
remember directly a soldier will fight
long and hard for a little piece of
colored ribbon so we give people these
little pieces of colored ribbon these
badges if you look at my name up on the
top of the screen you can see next to
that the 4,800 that's how many points I
have and then there's a little 15 and
that means I have 15 silver badges and
their little 28 says I have 28
badges so you earned a whole bunch of
badges and anybody who sees my name
anywhere it appears on the site will
know that I have a certain amount of
credibility and they can see what things
have done and people will actually go
and try to earn badges to complete the
set you too can get every single badge
on this list except for beta tester
because the bed is over ahh
karma is based on the philosophy that
you can't just pay people to answer
questions and I believe that that is one
of the reasons why Google Answers never
really worked because there is sort of
something fundamental
mahalo answers I think is gonna fail for
the same reason there's something
fundamental going on here that people
are willing to do for free what they're
not willing to do for small amounts of
money they may be willing to do them for
large amounts of money if you asked me
how much it would cost to provide a day
of my consulting um there there is no
price but I've spent at least a day
answering people's questions on Stack
Overflow so we you know sort of
fundamentally understood that people are
not going to want to leave you that
there is no if you try to clear a market
using what I call the econ 101
management method of very very small
payments like I'll give you a dollar if
you can help me with my problem ok
nobody's answering it let's try two
dollars that the mark is not clearing
those low levels but people will do
things for free in order to contribute
to the world so we have karma and
Karma's just points you earn points for
all kinds of things but mainly for
getting your questions and answers voted
up and so the best thing you can do on
the site to earn karma is to come in and
vote some things up there's a few as you
earn more and more karma you get more
privileges on the system they're usually
pretty nominal privileges but they do
encourage you to it's sort of like a
human CAPTCHA until you've asked a
question and answered a question you
probably don't have enough points to
comment on questions or to edit
questions and so if you come in and
you're like hey I want to comment on
this you'll hit comment and you'll
discover that you can't because you need
a little bit of karma not very much and
that'll encourage you to go do something
to earn a little bit of karma and there
are all kinds of easy ways to do it and
in fact the Wikipedia model one thing
I've actually encouraged people to do
you know very explicitly is if you want
to earn some quick Karma and you don't
know anything about programming go find
a question that seems to be kind of
popular a lot of people looking at it
look at the top five answers and merge
them into one big glorious answer that
just cribs from those top five answers
you're allowed to cut and paste and put
them all together edit it really well
write some sample code test the sample
code and submit that as your answer and
you will get voted up and you'll earn a
lot of points for that and that's
exactly the behavior that we want to see
we want to see people improving the site
making questions better and better and
they're not obsessing over the ownership
of a particular question or answer we
put in presearch I don't know if there's
a technical term for this but when you
start typing on the name of your
question which I've done here when you
hit tab will look for the words that are
most likely to be keywords and then
we'll we'll do a quick search of already
asked questions and we'll provide them
for you there and you can click on them
and just see the answer and that's meant
it's a deed ooping mechanism that's
meant to prevent duplicate this is not a
forum for answering the same things
again and again and again having people
say this is already been asked here this
is a we're trying to create canonical
questions and answers and so we want
there to be one and it works really
really well which is sort of surprising
because we don't have very good search
technology we just have sequel server
but it still works and one of the things
I mean the way I knew that stack over I
was going to work is on the second day
of the beta I logged on with an actual
programming question I typed the
programming question in in the title I
hit tab and I saw the question had
already been asked and I clicked on it
and had been asked you know eight
minutes ago and there were already a
whole bunch of answers and the answers
had already been voted on and the top
most highly voted question answer was
actually the solution to my problem and
that's a phenomenon that happens again
and again and again with Stack Overflow
we designed this not with the idea of
the of SEO which i think is a little bit
too naive we design our site with the
assumption that our home page is Google
the front page of Stack Overflow is you
go to google and type a question and
that's how most people find Stack
Overflow because they type the question
and so we've optimized I don't want to
say optimize we've built everything
around this assumption our URLs have the
name of the question in the URL and our
you know permanent and clean we have
whatever meta tags we have to have we
got the sitemaps we've got everything
we've done everything to make our pages
look as reasonable as possible to
search engine because we knew that
that's where traffic is income from
indeed as you can see here eighty six
point six percent of our traffic is
coming in specifically from Google
questions there's a little bit of direct
traffic and that's the that's the
smaller group of users of the site of
the Hangout on the site all the time and
for some mysterious reason the other
search engines are there well they're
there you can look number nine is
live.com and I have no idea why that's
only 0.2% of our visitors it doesn't
really make sense oh well um so so that
was our that was our design but that
that's the front end we were really
obsessed about performance we knew that
getting fast answers and the site being
snippy and snappy and quick and stuff
like that was was important and so
here's the technology stack that we use
it's actually built on a Microsoft stack
the performance I know you guys don't
use it that much here but the
performance of c-sharp which is a
compiled language is just ridiculously
good this entire site is serving 16
million pages a month and we're doing it
off of two servers which are almost
completely unloaded so we've got a ton
of headroom on those two servers one
service a web server the other servers
running Microsoft sequel Server 2008 and
they're both eight core Zeon's but the
and you know there were a lot of
optimizations that went in there but you
know no matter what people say this is a
pretty good stack and one of the things
that I've always been concerned about is
if you start building a technology like
this using the Microsoft stack you are
going to pay for a Windows Server
license lots of secret server licenses
which are five thousand bucks for every
box that you put out and the idea that
you could possibly use a larger number
of Cheaper computers and use open-source
products which are free certainly
occurred to us on the other hand when I
compare our performance to similar sites
that are running on the open source
stack we're using about one tenth of the
hardware that they are unfortunately and
maybe that's because they're not good
programmers but in terms of just a the
types of queries that we're doing in
stuff the Microsoft stack is actually
appears to be paying for itself in terms
of reduced Hardware ballpark we thought
that are really important
part of making stackoverflow happen was
get people getting questions answered on
day one and it was really important to
me that we get a critical mass in there
on day one so that when people tried it
out there was actually somebody there
and the questions actually got answered
so I think a lot of these other sites
like Amazon asked Bell Google answers
Yahoo Answers etc whatever marketing
power they had behind them because those
were sites about all possible questions
and they didn't really have a way to get
all possible people involved in the site
on day one they suffered from what I
call the empty restaurant syndrome
you're walking you know up and down
University having down town Palo Alto
trying to pick a restaurant to go into
and one of them is empty and you will
not go in there under any circumstances
so a restaurant term knows that on day
one they got to have their friends at
least fill out the window tables so that
it looks like there's somebody in there
and that was pretty important to us and
so that was one of the reasons why I
asked John Jeff Atwood to be a partner
in this site because between Joel and
software and coding are those are the
number one and number two most highly
traffic technology blogs that are
written by an individual who lives in
either New York or California hey just
kidding we have we actually have a lot
of traffic I had about a million
visitors a month and he had probably
about a third of that but that was a lot
of programmers and so we started doing
this podcast which you can listen to
it's a weekly podcast where we're
actually basically designing the site
and he's giving me status reports every
week and that's podcast on IT course
Asians and it was just another way of
making sure that when we launched there
would be you know maybe twenty thirty
thousand people to listen to this
podcast so here's the status report
here's what happened with Stack Overflow
here's how it worked out as of about a
week ago we've had one hundred thirty
six thousand five hundred seventy nine
questions have been asked ninety one
percent have been answered my definition
of answer is not that somebody typed in
an answer but that somebody typed in an
answer and somebody else up voted the
answer so you got to have an up vote for
it to count as answered this to me is
really good if you look at the questions
that are unanswered they're either on
obscure topics or sometimes they just
like way too hard a number of post has
been growing linearly uh more or less
we're at about 800,000 our post is
either question or an answer similarly
the number of registered users this is
that smaller community of people that
come to this
all the time they created accounts for
themselves we actually use this is
awesome we use it we use to open ID just
cuz we wanted to push it really really
strongly and it was actually successful
we don't have any login mechanism other
than open ID but as you can see you can
get logged on just by with two clicks if
you have say Google account which is
nice so the number of registered users
who've created accounts on the system is
around sixty thousand right now and
those are sort of the core group of
people and then we got sort of the
larger group of people who just visit
the site the uniques now is over three
million a month over three million
unique visitors a month and most of you
probably know unique just means we set a
cookie and if it's still there whatever
there's often Google Analytics so
whatever Google Analytics means by
unique visitors are the best information
we've sort of triangulated from a number
of sources the people that work in
developer relations at Microsoft have a
number that they use which is 9 million
professional programmers in the world
there are nine million professional
programmers in the world so I don't know
how accurate three million is but it
looks like we're getting about thirty
percent of them are using Stack Overflow
in some way shape or form and not
generally actually this is a large crowd
how many of you have ever used sec
overflow or seen Stack Overflow in
search results this is kind of a good
group I'm guessing that's about 40
percent so well I asked the same
question at the mix conference in Las
Vegas and it was about 30 percent in
that room so I have a feeling that in
about the first six months we've gotten
to about 30 percent of the professional
English speaking programmers we don't
have any other language sites the number
of visits is over 6 million a month
pageviews is about running about 16
million and of course growing pretty
steadily there here's where the traffic
comes from the the large larger part of
the 86 percent is directly from Google
and then you know there's obviously
refers is a certain number of people but
direct traffic are the people that I
think of is the participants in the site
these are the people that like to hang
out and answer questions in order in
karma so the last slide what are we
going in the future
Stack Overflow was designed to be
specifically about programming questions
and if you try to ask a question that
doesn't involve
code like why does my computer blue
screen every night at midnight you can
you'll get kicked out the question I get
closed and so we're building a new site
called server fault which is the system
in version of this site it's for system
administrator questions our goal is
specifically for professional system
administrators people who's not we're
not where we don't want the the user at
home who's trying to figure out how to
plug their iPod directly into the
printer we're trying to get the actual
people working at their job because what
we found almost from the Yahoo Answers
experience is that this kind of site
only works when it's people that are
doing something professionally in other
words they really care about getting the
right answers they care about expanding
their personal professional knowledge
and they and they're taking this
seriously at a level that the teenager
is asking sex questions on Yahoo
don't necessarily care about that much
there are a few other things in the
future none of them are really clearly
determined that's really just sort of a
couple of weeks in the future that thing
is going to launch in the long term
another part of the physical is sort of
a different different different
directions that Stack Overflow could go
in one direction is you know more
towards a software product another
direction is creating lots and lots of
vertical stack overflows and all kinds
of highly technical industries for
example the Stack Overflow for tax
accountants in the United States for
example who have questions about the tax
law and then the you know another
possible direction is as a recruiting
marketplace which they won't go into
into too much detail but we're actually
accumulating quite about it quite a lot
of knowledge about who's good at what
technologies in the programming realm
knowledge that could be very useful to
programmers that want to get hired or
programmers that want to hire other
programmers so that's really all I have
I'll turn it over to questions if
there's a anybody wants to how do I
start in front row where do the set of
tags it's just like any other tanks if
anything you type in works but doesn't
autocomplete
so it tends to you know as you start
typing you'll find the existing tab and
I think there is a mechanism for merging
existing tabs I think we have some kind
of
official question system got it
yes the question was are we seeing any
bad user behavior is a community pretty
self policing so far we are definitely
seeing some bad user behavior and we're
constantly adjusting algorithms to try
to fix it and I would say you know we
try to have a google-like approach of
looking for algorithms that solve
problems rather than individually just
plucking out individual users or
problems so we've got all kinds of
methods is there's a place where you can
like temp like if you if you behave
badly and we warn you and you don't
recover from that then we put you in a
penalty box for a week while you don't
you don't get your points until the end
of the week and there's all kinds of
stuff going on there mostly it's
obviously self police because with this
number of questions it has to be
reasonably automatic but we've pretty
much found most of it we pretty much
cured at this point we're pretty much on
top of the typical problems like spam so
on dori we have a question sorry well
godori room Dori room okay more it is
one aspect of stack overflows user
interface design are you most proud of
what aspects of stack overflows user
interface it makes you so great in my
most proud um let's pick one thing well
you know really it's just every time I
hear somebody saying Stack Overflow is
awesome I asked a question got an answer
and when I asked questions it just blows
me away that you see the ant there start
seeing answers like in three four
minutes coming in so the fact that you
know what the truth is I used to as a
programmer I used to not have the
patience to post a question to a
discussion forum because I knew that it
would take a half a day to a day to get
an answer and I would really just sit
there in Google for a long long time
trying to find the appropriate answer
rather than then asking it but what's
awesome about Stack Overflow is the
active the asking question is also the
active searching for an answer and so if
an answer is there you'll find it if it
isn't it's just one extra click to
actually commit to asking that question
and then you will actually get an answer
within a usable amount of time I mean
you don't even have to go to lunch
the answers will start coming in pretty
quickly ah yes
the question was as we have we
considered licensing this to large
corporations for licensing for internal
as an internal technology we don't
really have the resources to do that
right now we're sort of talking to
various people that might be interested
in providing various resources at times
which I won't go into into much detail
but that that's something that we don't
have the immediate time to do just
because we're about four people working
on this but in the long run that
completely makes sense
the next question from Devin Mullins
what aspect of stack overflows the
initial design are you least proud of
what makes you say lieutenant like the
first one what am I least proud of in
the design boy I'm stumped it's just uh
let's see
there are personally it sort of bothers
me there right now we are closing
questions that are off topic without
having a place to send people so if
somebody asks a question that really is
in a programming question but Stack
Overflow is a perfect technology to get
an answer to this question but it's not
a programming question the community
will jump on them and close it
aggressively in a way that is not
necessarily new be friendly and say go
somewhere else I don't know where but go
somewhere else and we just don't have a
place to send them right now so what
we're hoping that server Falls will get
all the system administrator questions
it will give them a home but that's the
sort of an aspect of the community
that's a little bit too focused in my
opinion on the purity of the homepage
only being programming questions
question for the room yes
what is our current or future plan for
modernization we are not we don't really
talk about that too much I should say
that we have a very little bit of
advertising on the site pretty much only
people that have aggressively been down
our door and literally deposited money
in our bank account without permission
and so they got little advertisements
and that is enough to keep the site
running like I say it's for people into
servers it doesn't take a lot to run
this and you know our primary goal is
getting getting answers to to programmer
questions on the other hand with the
community of you know basically a third
of the world's great programmers we
think there will be other monetization
opportunities we are never ever ever
going to charge to go to the site
we're never
have interstitials we're never gonna
have advertising that has any kind of
motion in it like flashing ever not just
flash but like animated gifs none of
that either and and the debates of core
aspect to the site will always remain
free for everybody
permanently we got a another door yeah
yeah from guido van rossum I'm still
really referring people to your blog
post quote things you should never do
part one was there ever a part two
things you should never do part one is a
as a riff on the history of the world
part one at Mel Brooks movie there is no
number two and that's the joke and you
may have to wait until the end of time
to determine but there is the things you
should never do part two but but I think
you know what either the two probably
the number one thing you should never do
part way the things you should never do
for those in the audience that don't
know this an article I wrote a long time
ago saying if you have working code that
is large a lot of people are depending
on it does a lot of things you don't
just start from scratch you got to try
to somehow find a way of moving the
existing body code you have into new
code and maybe you rewrite every line
but you don't start from scratch because
you lose too much knowledge that you
that you spent and you had to fight
pretty hard for that working code you
had and the time I wrote that probably
the number one victim of that was the
Netscape the major Netscape to Mozilla
rewrite which in my mind lost them about
three years at a time in which Internet
Explorer gained almost 90% market share
and it is true that Firefox eventually
came out and kind of recovered and sort
of caught up but the only reason Firefox
caught up is because the Internet
Explorer team had been disbanded for
five years and wasn't working so they
kind of lucked out but you don't you
don't stop you don't you don't rewrite
things from scratch and I think at the
time I got an email from somebody saying
have you looked into Perl 6 and so this
was eight years ago that I wrote this
and if I and that was a complete rewrite
of Perl that I believe is not yet
shipping I'm not really a Perl follower
but Perl has been pretty much forgotten
so so so so yeah there never there's
there's nothing that you can do it's
that bad to a software product than to
just decide to start over yes
so the question is what kind of UI
changes will we have made for if we were
focused on on sophisticated consumers
rather than hardcore professionals the
first thing is I don't think this site
is going to work for gardening questions
ever it might work for gardener
questions like professionals but for
gardening questions this is probably not
the right kind of site it has to be
professionals that are sitting at their
desk doing something professional and a
professional sitting at their desk doing
something professional will probably
learn a slightly complicated UI if it
lets them get their stuff done
so they'll probably overcome this that
said there's a bunch of programming
specific stuff that's in Stack Overflow
for example the programmers seem to be
really really good at tagging their
questions and when they're not so good
at tagging their questions anybody can
edit and add tags but surprisingly we
didn't even have to explain what tags
were we didn't have to tell anybody
guidance on what tags should be they get
in there and they tagged on them they
tagged them correctly and they just sort
of understand that and I don't think
that would apply in other fields you'd
have to come up with some other method
other than tagging probably or something
a little simpler although I'm not sure
maybe the Flickr experience would be
different the the other thing is that we
because we're focused on programmers we
knew that a lot of these questions would
have sample code in them so we have this
big old control that uses sort of a
markdown syntax and shows you a preview
of what you're going to get from your
markdown and so you're actually writing
in a slightly awkward language called
markdown which is sort of beyond
simplified HTML but it's not a WYSIWYG
editor by any stretch of the imagination
and we have not had a single programmer
complain about that or have any kind of
problems about that in any way shape or
form so but I don't think that that
markdown is necessarily the right
approach for gardeners um chefs post on
February 27th suggests the number of
questions answers posted per month isn't
increasing as you'd expect does it worry
you or is a steady increase in the
databank of programming questions answer
is good enough
that's from John's script um yeah I'm
not really sure about this because I
haven't dug enough into the numbers
I don't know enough statistics all those
growth charts that I was showing you a
minute ago are all showing something
that is how is that linear is that
exponential is at the beginning of an
exponential curve I'm not really sure it
doesn't worry me at all as long as I see
I mean look literally every week I go
and I look at Google Analytics and you
know we're kind of doubling every four
months and it's been that way since uh
well fourth month so let me uh let me
take a question from sort of far in the
back because I've been just doing the
front rows here brutally as anybody
anybody in the back now to quiet there
was one over here yes yeah
right so obviously there are old
questions that are that are boring and
nobody ever goes to there there are old
questions that have become the canonical
place on the internet to ask a
particular very interesting question
about a very common programming problem
that people hit and a lot of the
questions are like I'm seeing this
particular crash what could it be
oh you've got this bug in your code okay
and that's never gonna be interesting to
anybody ever again so there did there's
sort of different classes of questions
the only tracking that we really have
for that is when you see a question we
track the number of views and we'll show
it to you right there how many views
that questions ever gotten an occasion
you'll see questions that have you know
tens of thousands of views and those are
usually popular questions like what is
your favorite programmers cartoon so you
didn't bring that up cartoon let's see I
better searches um so that one's got uh
585 votes has been viewed one hundred
twenty thousand times I'm surprised that
this Fox Trot question comes out first I
kind of like the I kind of like the
little Bobby tabbles one personally um
uh so uh yeah I mean there's certainly
like like my questions like this will
get slash dotted and digged and all that
kind of stuff and it's gonna be high and
page rank even cuz everybody's linking
to it and so forth so there'll be
questions that are like super super
popular questions that just Daiya
innocuous to have one thing that we are
seeing is that we are becoming the place
of choice for new programming technology
questions to be asked so for example
when the iPhone came out Apple made the
iPhone developers signing an NDA that
said that they wouldn't talk to one
another and provided them with a very
very crappy forum that nobody liked for
asking each other questions and so they
all came to Stack Overflow because it
was basically just launched and we're
kind of the number one resource for
iPhone programming and what you'll see a
lot of these days is when a new
programming technology comes out rather
than trying to build their own forum or
their own place to get questions asked
to their own community support users
they'll just guide their users by saying
hey use the tag you know whatever it may
be soup whatever the technology is
called and and so newer
Ang's tend to just sort of organize
around stack overflow around a tag
rather than trying to make their own
forums and we expect to see a lot more
of that whereas older technologies like
Visual Basic 6 which is now completely
and utterly obsolete and not even
supported anymore still have a gigantic
body of knowledge in the website with a
hyphen and not not very much knowledge
and Stack Overflow and that will
probably be that way forever and I don't
even know if we have any cobalt
questions just so there may be there may
be intensely obsolete technologies yeah
now I got 44 cobalt questions once you
have a large expert user base it gets
very hard to add new features or change
the UI of your product are you guys
facing this problem and if so how do you
experiment with new features um once you
have a large user base oh okay that was
on the microphones on earth repeat dad
the way I kind of feel like at this
point we're sort of tweaking and we have
a couple of places where the
conversation about new features takes
place well basically about three places
we don't want Stack Overflow to have
questions about Stack Overflow because
that's not the topic that's off topic by
definition it's not a programming
question so there's a there's a user
voice site where future requests come in
and there's some conversation about
those future requests on user voice
there's the podcast that Jeff and I do
and people will call in with questions
and people will email us and we'll talk
about new features as they develop and
then there's the Stack Overflow blog
where new features are introduced in the
comments of the Stack Overflow blog are
really where most of the discussion
about new features takes place but we're
at this point we're not we haven't done
anything that I think would really shock
people and to like not being able to use
the site we haven't made it a Twitter
clone on the home page so anything else
from the room yep
yeah when somebody edits a responsive as
highly Marchetti no it's still good well
you can't but it's like Wikipedia so you
can search the history and sort of see
there is sort of as weird concept
because we're a combination between in
some ways like a blog or personal site
where there its authorship and sites are
written by questions are written by a
particular question by a particular
person so all these questions here sort
of have ownership to the questions and
the answers will have ownership but we
have this concept over here called a
community wiki and a community wiki is a
question or an answer that has either
been put in community ownership where
nobody accrues the points and nobody
owns the answer or has been forced into
community wiki mode for various reasons
if a question is getting one thing that
we don't want to happen is somebody
asked what's your favorite programmers
cartoon and then gets 585 oh this wasn't
the number one answer this was I'm sorry
this is the question itself this is the
number one answer 812 and that was the
recognized that's the number one user
answer well things will eventually get
into community wiki mode because we
don't want somebody earning a billion
points of karma just because they asked
a really popular and slightly off-topic
question that got on to dig so if a
question gets edited too much for an
answer gets edited too much and their
metrics for all these things that are
very complicated and they're all
documented somewhere well we'll take
away the personal ownership of that one
anything else yeah I have one more here
um why are you saying this is an
anonymous question why are you saying
that quote get kids at Google and
Microsoft are working on hopeless and
useless architecture astronomy unquote
so as if it were something I don't
remember saying I would have to search
for that use any search engine you like
yeah I'm going to try to find a search
engine here and know if there is one in
it does anybody have a search engine
why our kids Microsoft Google
architecture astronauts what that yeah
not a I can't spell
I'm sure to hell suggested fenizia
that's not it though I wouldn't say that
I can't remember I'm sorry I'm not gonna
be able to answer that one right now
said it but this isn't me this is my
discussion groups I'm afraid why Google
and Microsoft well let's see what this
guy says he's got a link only this was
it he'll stomp didn't groove okay I
picked on groove live mash got rid of
them oh yeah Google Bing on tenable
salaries two kids with more Ultimate
Frisbee experience in Python that's
actually true your starting salaries are
too high guys um especially out of out
of college uh yeah I don't know this
this was mainly because um and this is
over thank God but but Microsoft and
Google are really like gigantic vacuum
cleaners at Stanford and Berkeley and
u-dub and and it really is and I'm going
to stand by this it really is the case
that no matter how useful the stuff is
that you're working on and the Microsoft
is on to a large extent it's it's much
harder for small companies to get good
people because of the presence of
Microsoft and Google which for a long
time we're in a mode of hire as many
people as we can possibly get under all
circumstances and honestly yeah I bet
you have colleagues that are working on
things that you think are probably not
as important as some of the other
startups you may know of so that's that
that's the best I can do to defend that
one you probably time for one more
question sure is one of the audience
we're done another audience question
does anybody want to know what the
starting salary is at Google for a new
content area see
yes would we want to embed executable
code sample safely the answers are right
now I mean I think our I don't exactly
know what you're proposing but I think
we're about the code in the source code
and so we do have a way to embed the
source code we definitely be interested
in ways to make the embedding of source
code better we're using a little tool
from from Google actually and having
actual source code around the page that
sounds like a pretty bad idea even if it
was safe um no not necessarily and when
you think about the type of questions
that people are asking here seeing it
then run in the browser I mean that
would probably be applicable only to you
know CSS questions or JavaScript
questions but not to the majority of the
type of code that people are really
asking about here all right well thank
you very much for coming appreciate the
