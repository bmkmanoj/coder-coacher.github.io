Robbins from Temple University who's
going to be talking about integer linear
programming using differentiable detta
consumption oolitic number three so ok
ok I would like to thank the organizers
and what's that ok can you hear is it ok
ok so this is kind of low tech but now
and I should start using my brand-new
Macintosh which I'm getting used to so
I'll be fine almost everything we talked
about so you don't have to know what
that it can some sorry I don't have to
know what an intro to linear programming
is ok thanks and so very basically the
problem is given a triangle in the plane
so you have an image to think about
given a triangle in a plane is there an
integer point inside what is the
structure of the triangle the vertices
are rational numbers so given any
triangle a plane whose vertices are
rationals find the integer point inside
so to make the problem even more
concrete let's say somebody gives you a
rational triangle on the plane and they
give you the three vertices as rational
numbers and they say in fact I'm going
to give you some more knowledge i'm
going to tell you there's exactly one
integer point inside your job is to now
find that point so it's not just
enumerated but actually finding them and
this comes up in encryption schemes and
cryptography a very big question for
example in encryption is the points in a
parallelepiped given a rational
parallelepiped in RN whose vertices are
rational points find an integer point
inside and and quickly so for example if
n is 100 dimension is 100 you might
imagine yourself sitting inside the unit
cube you look around in there are two to
the 100 vertices so just looking nearby
is difficult
so so yeah so let's let's formalize the
problem so given any rational polygon
polytope p we're going to list the
points you want to list the points
inside and we'll focus our attention on
two dimensions and just so you can
visualize everything and because connor
i'd like to be as concrete as possible
with these things so okay so this is
called a feasibility question computer
science so this intersects computer
science and linear programming people
although the field of linear programming
real linear programming integer linear
programming i sort of two different
fields and some people that worked on
this RV cannon alexander barber knock
his usted lo era burnt arm falls other
people and so this is a different method
which we start like a year and a half
ago now and it's growing but i'm i'm
just going to present the very
beginnings of of this it seems to grow
without bounds but some point you have
to truncate and publish but so what i
will do all right so what are these sums
what are that it consumes let me give
you a brief history so another so you
know what the problem is now another way
to visualize these things to think about
these things is you you have you know
what the GCD algorithm is how to find a
g co 2 GC of two integers and you can
ask yourself how do you extend this
algorithm to higher dimension is what is
a sort of a natural extension of the GCD
algorithm to higher dimensions what does
it mean to find the GCD of two integer
vectors for example in to space or or so
on so that's that's another sort of
equivalent formulation of these things
so to start let the fractional part of
XP the fractional part meaning the X
minus the integer part for any real
number X and what's people usually do is
in literature and what I'll do serve as
a joke is ok here you go now do what you
like with this right this is this is not
not a good way to do things because it's
unmotivating so let's try to motivate
more this is that
can sound obviously you can't stop me
from defining it but it's not it's not
illuminating so what is it do for you so
let me show you what it did for some
people through history and what it can
do for you so in anyway so dead again
it's called that it's their period
classically through that again first the
year was 1892 that it can studied this
function which comes up in combinatorial
ott it comes up in partition theory or
partition and integer into smaller
integers and one over this function
enumerates all unrestricted partitions
so this is if you like this is a
generating function for investing
partitions without getting into that
though that's a combinatorial motivation
a modular for motivation comes from
number theory is you write this function
in terms of tau which lives in the upper
half plane it's a complex-valued
function it lives on some natural remind
surface let's see down like that that's
better oh the other way oh sorry okay
okay right so there's the historical
data canedo function towers and the
upper complex half plane so it's a
complex analytic function entire in tau
but that's the historical motivation
where their concerns appeared so history
sort of from my perspective was the
wrong way around usually it's the right
way but in other words the more natural
geometric motivation for this data
consumption of polytopes which we've
discovered more and more in the last
decade so what's so there the classical
data can some that we wrote even though
the definition is clear on one hand it's
it's not motivated me other but it has
to characterizing properties which i'd
like to delineate and focus on so the
characterizing properties of data
concerns are it has modularity reduction
it's a modular reduction you can reduce
the a mod b and you still have the same
function so nothing just abstractly of a
function of two integer variables such
that when you reduce the first mod the
second you have the same function and
think abstractly of that function to
such that when you take f of a B plus F
of B a f is s for that it can sum then
you have an
as simple looking rational function a
and B by the way these are the 1 4th and
1 12 Bernoulli numbers really so when
you extend to higher dimensions easier
Bernoulli numbers but and so you have a
reciprocity law so if you iterate these
two laws these two axioms for the
function it's exactly like the GCD
algorithm so in fact you can compute
this function very quickly by just
plugging in integers a and B and just
iterating reducing a mod beasts and
sweeping flipping it take me aside we do
smile so it's exactly the GCD algorithm
so you can do it in linear time linear
in a bit capacity of be what I mean by
that so here's the definition there are
be some ends you can do it instead of B
operations in log B operations so the
speed is critical for what we want to do
so that's the data can sum and how you
can reduce it by these two
characterizing properties from
exponential order complexity to linear
complexity it's a big difference now you
want to extend this to higher dimensions
so it turns out these things are used to
enumerate integer points and polygons
now we want if you want to find them and
extend to higher dimensions you'd like
to find appropriate functions that mimic
this behavior and we're finding these
functions but they're more complicated
so rather than writing them down we
finding an axiomatic approach is
actually quite useful so let me show you
the axiomatic approach and the problem
stays the same problem you have you know
a polygon or or you have a simplex in in
n dimensions and you want to find an
integer point inside and by the way just
what delicate did in 1892 if you'd like
to see he he looked at the
transformation property of dysfunction
just for historical purposes he looked
at the transformation property under SL
to Z the unimodular group and saw that
when he applied the you know modular
group the transformation properties give
you a character it's a twenty fourth
root of unity and an inside its
character appears the data can sound so
it's miraculously appeared inside a
character which was a transformation
for this function but that's again the
for us we're going to focus in the
complexity of this little thing all
right so so as we said just to recap
using both modular reduction and
reciprocity we can reduce the sound to
to the GCD algorithm basically and
here's just to keep walking a little bit
through history what happened in 1951
was more del dad into the picture and he
showed that if you take now if you go
from two dimensions to see dimensions
and you ask for the enumeration how many
integer points are inside this V simplex
this tetrahedron sitting in 3-space the
simplest possible kind where the
vertices are the origin a 000 000 c and
more del showed that the number of a
ninja points inside is given by sum of
three data consumption innocuous
rational function of ABC and so there
was the first historical combinatorial
sort of appearance or number theoretic
of the data consumption help you
enumerate these things well I should put
a shameless plug for our book with
Matthias peck back there it's coming out
the end of this year and so where we put
a lot of these things together a lot of
these papers a lot of these results
would last like two decades together in
one place springer ok anyway zaki a so
just more more history and then i'll go
back and be focused on our problem sake
a studied higher dimensional data
consumption TSA's lot sporadic
appearances of these things throughout
the literature he had some manifold to
studying singularities of cyclic
singularities you called them and he got
these so-called higher dimensional taken
Psalms these are cyclothymic sums over
roots of unity so if you fix integers a1
up to ad these are
the ad switch of unity you sum over them
this simple looking function and you get
so-called higher dimension data cand
some when the dimension is too when you
have just two of these and T equals zero
you achieve actually the classical that
it consumes we wrote down earlier okay
so that appears in orbit fold effects of
zaggy and then in a paper with that I
wrote with Matthias and with Ricardo
2002 linear da front end panel for Venus
the same functions appear in a so-called
coin exchange problem so this is yet a
different direction where the same
objects appear so corn exchange problem
tells you that if you have all the
scribe decor in exchange if given
positive integers a 12 ad whose GC ds1
it turns out that you you can if you
take all positive integer linear
combinations you can achieve every
integer after some point so for example
if you take integers 5 and 5 and 12 all
positive integer linear combination 512
eventually achieve every integer the
last integer they do not achieve is
called a faux beam ians number and kevin
woods worked on this here maybe other
people here with and obviously MIT
aspect and other people so that 4b
Gnaeus number is very very interesting
and it turns out to get a hold of it we
can also use that it consumes an
analogous problem is to enumerate all
integer solutions to this in a first
talk by david where he put the set of
all x 12 XD whose sum is 0 that lattice
that deed minus 1 dimensional lattices
in our d is completely analogous to this
where instead of x 12 XD we imagine any
other coefficients a 1 x 1 plus a 2 x 2
and so on plus a DX d equals 0 that
lattice controls the behavior of this
problem so yeah so that it can sounds
they appear everywhere okay and so so
how what is this mm-hmm all right
all right okay so here's another paper
I'm advertising Lainey fiction ski here
so anyway so another paper that letting
our recent Rubinius problem by the way
this the something called Earhart here
you notice there's a whole body of work
since the 60s that tells you that when
you enumerate these things you get
Kwazii polynomials so the number of
solutions to this linear die Fantine
equation in t is a quazy what's called
quasi polynomial aunty it's almost
problem we will accept the coefficients
of periodic functions of T again these
coefficients are linear combinations of
data consumes so data consumption are
appearing all of these problems and one
would like to extend them oh by the way
just just to sort of as a cute sideline
I'd like to mention this so this is
sometimes called the chicken mcnuggets
problem the coin exchange form of
opinions so just I don't know who first
said this I don't know it Kevin the
error Matthew no I I don't know the
chicken McNuggets Forge and anyway you
walk into McDonald's your chicken wing
you don't like the name okay actually
I'm vegetarian so I never have to do
with but you walk to mcdonalds chicken
McNuggets and they want to sell you
boxes of four chicken nuggets and seven
and you want exactly 35 you know 35 is
too easy you want exactly 36 36 A to Z
you want exactly you want exactly 39
Chicken McNuggets and so there's a
linear combination of four and seven
that gives you 39 provided 39 is above
the threshold magical for Venus number
so what's the Frobenius number here it's
four minus 1 times 7 minus 1 which is 3
times 6 18 everything everything above
18 should be achievable anyway
geometrically you you're trying to find
an integer point XY on this line so
you're trying to look for integer points
and it's one-dimensional power tube so
this is what you'd like to extend the
vertices of this Paula taupe are
rationals and extending this to two
dimensions gives you a rational polygon
problem that we described in the
beginning all right so what so just
again to focus again on a problem it's
the farm and comments
all geometry but arising in computer
science a lot a lot of the historical
the historical appearances of these
wacky looking functions appeared in
trying to enumerate integer points but
now when you try to find them when
you're trying to actually find any point
you want a more general some than just
some a summing one in some object you
want to some monomials in an object so
this Grosvenor braces techniques for
doing this but I like to think of it it
really is a discrete Fourier transform
when you make a change of variable X sub
J equals e to the 2 pi is sub J when you
make that change of variable you really
see the sum of e to the 2 pi vector s
dot vector M which is exactly the
discretized integral of e to the 2 pi
ASTM which is the definition of the
Fourier transform of the object so
you're looking at the skreet the skreet
eyes for you object of the palette oh
and you can capture it out very clear or
you can capture it analytically yeah I
find what I find more convenient to be
honest to capture it analytically
because then I can use all sorts of
methods from analogue number theory but
either way so it's a it's nice this
stuff kind of enjoys being amenable to
many methods okay so let's go back again
I'm going back between one dimension
main dimensions just to ground things in
one dimension what is this monomial
generating function our coordinate what
is this generating function not calling
integer point transformers what is this
genuine function doing for you well in
one dimension your want to if you give
me an interval what's the analog of the
triangle and one dimension you give me
an interval and ask you is there an
integer point inside well yeah I can
tell you right you can tell me I mean
any this is so this is not too hard
obviously but what does it mean in one
dimension one dimension it's it's a this
generator function which would be a long
function is actually we know a formula
for it we know that there's a formula
called the finite geometric sum
and so what this discrete Fourier
transform does for your high dimensions
is it extends the idea of a finite
geometric sum to higher dimensions so in
knowingness so so it's far it's kind of
funny it's like what snowing I mean I I
know the finite geometric sum formula
but do I really know it I mean if I
really really knew it I could extend it
so let's look at what we already know
and see if we can still glean some
information from it the this finite
geometric sum formula can be broken up
into two pieces X to the N minus 1 over
X minus 1 and then minus 1 over X minus
1 each of these pieces has a singularity
at x equals 1 yet the singularity is
magically canceled right so this is an
interesting phenomena that at polynomial
can be written as a rational function
with some singularities this thing
extends in one way it extends into
something called briones theorem in
higher dimensions yet but there's
another way here in which it extends as
well which I want to I'll describe to
you so the simple looking thing in one
dimension is what we really want to
extend ok so back to the original
problem you have a triangle and you just
want to find a point inside quickly and
if we can do if we can find this
generating function with these monomials
if we can somehow get a handle on that
then we can solve this because the so
here's here's the problem so if we
encode each integer point in this
monomial generating function right here
if we encode each integer point like
this and we can compute this very long
some quickly somehow then we're good so
that's the idea that's the object the
game so let's pursue this
so what's the simplest possible example
in two dimensions the simplest possible
example is as we said before a rational
triangle and let's make it even simpler
a right angle rational triangle so what
could be possibly simpler a right angle
rational triangle with arbitrary
rational vertices find an integer point
inside ok so let's give things names
give it a name label the vertices
arbitrary vertices the t here is the
dilation parameter so the T controls you
push this line off slowly to infinity
and the T controls the dilation of
everything all the coordinates and so
now this generating function is discrete
Fourier transform of this object is
really this and T you dilated pal to buy
tea and you want to find this long thing
as in terms of a short description so so
again just to refocus our attention on
the problem we have this discrete
Fourier transcription we want to compute
that once we find a short description
that will tell us these exponents which
are encoded into our triangle it'll tell
us the exponents in a new way hopefully
just like in one dimension the old our
old friend from elementary school the
financial metrics on wherever we learned
it that encodes these exponents in one
dimension okay so so it's a basic
question okay so here's one theorem
so this this two-dimensional innocent
looking thing and I put it up again here
this innocent-looking some for this
right angled triangle in a plane that's
innocent looking some has a
decomposition that looks kind of weird
into the sum of three rational functions
yet this decomposition is very
meaningful and enables us to compute
things in what i conjecture to be the
quickest possible way so i don't think
this is a conjecture but i don't think
there exists a faster algorithm in two
dimensions so this is now as i know the
fastest known algorithm but i should say
bargain ox algorithm two dimensions is
just as fast so this there's something
called bar for knox algorithm and this
is a this is really an alternate
algorithm for part of an ax Alvin ok so
how is this different well it's giving
the decomposition of this discrete
Fourier transform this monomial
generator function in terms of new
functions which are now analogs these
new weird functions are not exact
analogs of the data can some numbers so
we found the analogs of data concerns to
higher dimensions in terms of these
rational functions of several variables
now which extend the data consumption
why approach one you retrieve the data
concerns so these are now instead of
memory data consumption emerged so when
you want to enumerate things you had
rational numbers that it concerns now
when you want to find things you have
rational functions so these are rational
functions and in order to build them up
we need an analogous properties we need
to somehow build them up to find them to
compute them because it is all about
computing and axiomatically they're
built up as follows so
so each of these functions again this is
this is the simplest possible extension
of the geometric selling one dimension
and yet it's I mean it just still
boggles my mind that it's like this but
this is the simplest possible extension
to two dimensions but there are
knowledge Astaire's in all dimensions
every dimension has an analogous theorem
in three dimensions you'd have three
variables yeah so so these functions
have characterizing properties just like
the the old are old friends that it can
sounds did and bless you and these
functions are now there's this is the
you start out with this is the initial
this is like the Fibonacci you think of
the Fibonacci numbers you have to
initial initialize f 0 is 0 that's this
and then so that's the boundary value
then you have to you have to give the
modular reduction property so if you
reduce so if i reduce team at P and Q
mod p simultaneously if I to reduce this
one not this one I have to tell you what
to do and this tells you what to do and
then if and and then you have a
reciprocity life you switch things you
have to tell you what to do and then
putting these things together it gives
you exactly the GCD algorithm again so
it's linear time so you go from
exponential time to linear time so these
are we call these differential attack
and sounds for lack of a better word i
might change it later but i think at
this point because you can differentiate
these functions these are rational
functions which can differentiate oh and
we do differentiate them so okay yeah by
the way the methods I'm pushing under
the rug everything I'm pushing out of
the rug just this file the best someone
that has used the some discreet for
analysis and some complex analysis and
so on okay find an integer point inside
p so here's an example so let's be again
going back to you have a triangle and
you want to find a point inside let's
give be precise so did if you have
coordinates let's see there we're going
to give some very concrete coordinates
for these points this
rational coordinates which are these two
and now you have these other rational
coordinates so this this point this is
the coordinates of this point but that
determines according to these two
vertices so if you have these rational
coordinates which are roughly 20 bits
each between 20 and 30 bits each you
want to see how fast you can do it and
so we put Mathematica we at the moment
we included everything in Mathematica
which is which which is fine but
eventually we might use something else
so
oh yeah let me repeat let me give to ya
it's a good let me a question let me put
the triangle up again so so these are
arbitrary rational these arbitrary
rationals so this all whole rationale
triangle when you when you oh I see
let's see now you're right in two
dimensions you can do that right in two
dimensions you can do that but this is
an example in in in even in 20
dimensions it becomes already 2 2 2 20
choices or rounding so right right
you're absolutely right yeah absolutely
right so in two dimensions it's
absolutely right but what you can do in
two dimensions you can also play a
different game for arbitrary triangles
there's a decomposition you can take an
arbitrary triangle and fit it inside the
little box and decompose things in two
right triangles so you can use right
triangles to attack arbitrary rational
triangles in higher dimensions actually
I do not know I have to be honest I do
not know of a way to do that i do not
know of a way to use right angle
simplices and decompose a rational any
arbitrary rational simplex by using that
in a sort of in a nice way but in any
case it's a different problem yeah by
the way you do not we do not need
absolutely rational I mean that we do
not need right angles but the formulas
come out more nicely oh okay so here's
so here's the here's an example so the
example for this you you just write down
diversities you mathematica chugs away
it does it flips reduces flips reduce it
flips you this is you get a review
rational train and then you hit return
and it comes back with x times y so I
love this example because so your
iteration so this is your generating
this is your generating function x times
so it shows that the point 1 comma 1 is
was in your rational triangle and so
indeed now you use we use our vision to
check and yeah there it was I could have
told you that
so that's kind of silly but but it
checks right it's a good check anyway so
there's to recap quickly you have you
have two lines of thought enumerated
things and finding things historically
data concerns were used in the numerator
things and these differential items can
be used with the same reciprocity
modularity properties to find points in
rational irrational simplicity so far
but we're extending it so I should stop
here
ok
you mean a modular function of some sort
yeah I don't know I looked a little bit
oh sorry so the question was that it can
found that the data contain a function
when acted upon by SL to Z on tau the
action is it sends tautou a tau plus B
over C tau plus D and when you plug that
into the function you have some nice
transformation law that involves that it
consumes is there an analogous function
maybe not modular but some analogous
function where the transformation law of
that function would yield these these
new data consumption die the answer is I
don't know but will be very interesting
yeah but there should be one it seems
like but yeah
further questions thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
