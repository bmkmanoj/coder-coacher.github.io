earth system prediction I think you have
some sense about it so it's basically
about producing environmental
information at very high resolution down
to a few meters so it can be used to
make decisions and the main thing about
Earth's system is to then link
environmental connectivity to other
issues like human health water and so on
and this is a kind of a carton for the
Chesapeake Bay which has a lot of
aquatic vegetation which is well known
for providing very good habitat for
crabs and oysters which have been slowly
degrading over decades and all sorts of
regulations are not always able to bring
it back so life goes from vegetation to
sediment exchanges bacteria and viruses
microbes to shrimp and crab to all the
way to fish like sardines and the bay
anchovies perch you have all sorts of
things there's human impact and it's
it's a resting and migrating place for
millions of birds every year so can we
build a tool that goes from microbes to
man so that under climate change you can
see what kind of impact it will have on
the integrated assessment and health of
the bay and so on so to deal with
climate change issues naturally you will
have partnerships across academia and
National Labs NGOs and so on so that the
team that works with me includes people
across the campus from computer science
school of public health and so on people
from coastal labs from NASA from other
universities from NOAA from EPA and the
Department of Natural Resources and so
on the entire thing is in a larger
context of initiative that's actually
across many universities but run by s
called climate information responding to
user needs where the idea is to invite
users like insurance industries
defense industries vintners public
health officials and so on and let them
tell us what is it that they need in
terms of climate information so we have
had two workshops one focused on
insurance and one was a broader 400
people participating included people
from the CIA Pentagon and so on and the
idea is that we are generating
incredible amount of data in you know
from the satellites from all sides of
all sorts of in situ instruments and so
on and we have no idea how to depict it
properly for a wide range of users so
one of the main things we see in terms
of the help we could get from google is
how is it that we can appropriately
portray all this incredible amount of
information for you so i will use a few
examples before i get to the tool that
we use to produce this high-resolution
information in terms of motivation
everybody's heard of the IPCC which won
the Nobel Prize with Al Gore
intergovernmental panel on climate
change which does global governance
issues basically what is the carbon
dioxide concentration we can deal with
what is the mean temperature rise we can
live with and those global models
basically go from what are called
external forcing so volcanic forcing
changes in orbital orbital forcing so
changes in ellipticity of liquidy and so
on to human impact so they are dealing
with very complicated system and it's a
huge system computationally very
expensive so they can they have gone
from order 500 kilometer resolution
globally in the first assessment that
came out in the late 80s Early 90s to
the one that came out last year down to
about 100 kilometers the next few may go
down to 10 kilometers but still despite
all the complexity they are adding in
terms of human interactions carbon cycle
all the chemistry of the earth and so on
it we will still need information on the
order of a few meters to be able to make
decisions of the kind that I will
explain or the top so this is the the
framework that IPCC's been using where
they have global Earth system models
that try to simulate global change
impacts and have responses from the
society in terms of adaptation and
mitigation and then they look for what
kind of governance decisions can we make
as a global society for sustainability
and there is lots of data that's used
for monitoring and then you try to blend
the data with the Earth system models
under data simulation and so on and and
this is the loop you run through what we
are proposing here is that in fact we
need a regional Earth system model
that's much much higher resolution that
does dynamic downscaling so that you can
do actual day-to-day management of
resources and so on so that's what I'll
basically try to explain the example
I'll use is the Chesapeake Bay it's a
prototype we are building it's a system
that then can be moved we already moved
it to Gulf of Mexico and parts of India
and so on so that system can be moved
anywhere but you have to have an
objective that is basically to develop a
fully integrated model for any region to
do all sorts of things that are
necessary so you go literally from days
two decades of producing this
information not just physical
environment but also ecosystems
pathogens there are lots of things like
harmful algal blooms waves inundation
and so on i will show examples of that
one of the main things we are saying is
that you have to devise a
decision-making tool where people can
interactively play games try out several
what-if scenarios and i'll show an
example of how we are doing that so in
terms of giving a decision-making tool
to users then you have to start working
with the users from the beginning itself
the old paradigm has been to produce
lots of climate information and just put
it out there on the
web or and expect that people will come
and use it and it has worked to some
extent but it's not very effective in
terms of getting a feedback as to what's
really useful so what we have done is
engaged a number of different user
groups like the Baltimore drinking water
supply a regulatory board I habitat
suitability model for Waterman that deal
with striped bass on a daily basis
people who collect data for harmful
algae in the Chesapeake Bay this is a
big problem all the way from Gulf of
Maine to Gulf of Mexico to the west
coast of California to oregon coast
Seattle Alaska and so on so there are
lots of and it's a global issue and the
point there is that with global warming
it seems to be and with population
increase especially coastal population
increase as lots of eutrophication
issues nutrient loadings which seem to
be increasing harmful algal blooms in
every place the Chesapeake community bay
modeling is Riverkeepers that are
working with us and there is a group
that manages a 40 acre forest let's
trying to use the forecast and tell us
whether this kind of thing works or not
one of the most demanding group is
epidemiology and public health group
especially because with climate change
they have been increases in zoonotic and
vector-borne diseases water and food
borne diseases communicable respiratory
diseases like the swine flu that's going
around and invasive fungal diseases and
we've known for a very long time since
the time of Hippocrates that it's not
the demon and the Satan that create
health problems but its environmental
effects and the old paradigm of doing
this has been mostly to look at the
connection between the time of the year
when temperature gets warm enough to
cause infections this is an example of
razor clams in Puget Sound where a
harmful algal bloom call
alexandria meeeeee effects the clamp so
there is over 30,000 people that do
clamming recreational clapping of in
Puget Sound it's a huge income for the
state and if you're not careful then you
often get infected by these harmful
algal blooms and we would use those kind
of correlations and say that's how we
can predict impacts on human health and
with climate change you'd basically
increase the window over which such an
infection of Alexandria would happen and
we know for the physical climate what
kind of scales we can predict so this is
kind of an empirical approach that's
being taken but the problem is that the
climate change does not get to human
health so directly just through
temperature there are lots of things in
the middle like regional weather changes
so you increase the number of heat waves
you change whether in terms of extreme
events you get more tornadoes more
hurricanes and so on more rainfall
coming more as huge events rather than
drizzle humidity's generally increasing
with warming because of increased
evaporation and so on so we collect this
sort of data every day with a number of
different satellites an incredible
amount of data is being generated but
there is no effective way of using this
data so I think one of the things we
could really use help is how would we
use all this information and make people
use it in an effective way plus with
these changes it's not like Alexandria
ms affecting the razor clam as soon as
temperature it's 13 degrees there are
lots of microbial dynamics involved
transmission dynamics involved for
example the way swine flu is spreading
its not what happened before it's
spreading even when there is no flu
season and we don't understand exactly
why this is happening and with climate
change it's possible that these things
will continue to happen so the
biological and genetic research is
increasing our understanding of those
things there's lots of information being
collected
at molecular and genetic level pathogen
information and so on all kinds of water
bodies are being monitored for all kinds
of pathogens for example buildings are
monitored for bacteria and so on and all
this information is very different than
the users involved are very different
but we don't know how to combine this
information agriculture for example when
you have equal I outbreaks of spinach or
tomato or jalapeno peppers there is
again changes in habitats and
transmission dynamics and transportation
that are spreading these things far and
wide but we don't know how to monitor
the connectivities of where things are
going so and there is responses in terms
of withdrawing beef products and so on
and that in turn affects how things
spread so in a university environment
you can do research on how these things
affect each other before you see an
impact on human health but yet we don't
know exactly how to deal with data
that's very disparate there is some
physical information that's very precise
very accurate and there is some human
interaction information that's not very
accurate but it's still physical
information and we have to combine those
and somehow be able to navigate through
the system and see how things spread and
so literally we are going from genetic
information to community level ecosystem
information and human interaction
population genetic information and we
have collected lots of data in all
spheres but we don't know how to how to
look at the interactions between them so
this seems like a very Google rich
target in terms of just dealing with all
the data and seeing how it is that it
can be made more effectively usable the
best example I can give you is that
things that are often toxic to human
beings are not really genetically
selecting to be toxic to human beings
for example debris or cholera or harmful
algal bloom if you go to the ocean and
you get infected you don't necessarily
go back to the beach and provide a
feedback to the
into the bugs so that they can
genetically fine-tune their behavior to
make it themselves more toxic or more
virulent to human beings what they're
doing is basically trying to pick a
micro habitat for their own survival for
their own genetic competition so they
are often toxic to human beings purely
by accidentally lib real calorie for
example a bacteria likes a mucus that's
on the hard shell of crabs and cocoa
pods and so on and the same kind of
mucus exists in the guts of human beings
so if you ingest water with lib real
calorie that then freaks out in your
stomach but it because it found a
similar environment so you have to
understand how the Brio calorie pics
this microhabitat how it then exploits
other similar habitats so we have to
basically understand the transmission
dynamics and microbial dynamics that go
on and it literally happened even Vibrio
cholerae itself as a bacteria is not
toxic it gets something called phage
transduction where viral viral a virus
attacks Vibrio cholera the bacteria and
tries to inject genetic material into it
and sometimes the bacteria dies and it's
it's called lysis so there's kind of a
something called Red Queen hypothesis
where there is a Jenner is like a
genetic evolutionary arms race between
the virus and the bacteria and the
bacteria ends up dying it's like a
terminal cancer and there is another one
called Cheshire Cat hypothesis where the
the bacteria can go from being deployed
or having both male and female genes to
just get rid of one of the genes and
become haploid and get rid of the viral
genetic material and escape the virus
attack so these things are understood
very well but and we have collected this
information but then to see how those
things then begin to explode and become
a global epidemic needs other
information for example there are
environmental connectivities and we are
very good at generate
information about environmental
connectivities by generating either
observed information from satellites
like temperature wind humidity radiation
and so on or by using models and
predicted for the future but there is
lots of physical connectivities this is
something that it's started in Vietnam
and exploded clinica transmitted to the
rest of the world and this is a map of
daily domestic flights in the US and
this is a map of the commuter traffic in
the US and these give us a way to look
for physical connectivity so if somebody
comes in to Boston New York or Miami
Houston whatever with a certain disease
we can use these physical connectivities
and make scenarios of how quickly things
spread through these physical
connectivities and obviously this is
something that is again very Google rich
target so if Google can track this and
combined with their flu algorithm they
used last year based on search for
example to they made flu predictions
that were 10 days ahead of CDC if we can
connect that kind of search to
environmental and physical
connectivities then it's really a
powerful tool that can extend that
predictability to many more days plus we
can collect data over people in a given
city for example Miami Boston New York
whatever pick a certain sample of people
who live there for a certain number of
years and have kids and so on and you
collect data on where they spend the
time during the day in a school in a bus
in an office and then you can use simple
Euclidean graph theories to connect them
to see if there is an outbreak in one
school of swine flu or whatever what
would be the best strategy to prevent
rapid transmission in terms of
vaccinating them quarantine them closing
down schools etc so you can create local
connections connectivities environmental
physical and human
actions and global connectivity's and we
know how to collect data more than we
know how to depict the information or
how to navigate through this information
and I think this is a very very rich
target for Google and we are you know if
the technology is improving in terms of
going from molecular probes genetic
essays and so on where we can create
using nanotechnology I not just observe
temperatures and salinities and so on or
humidity's and radiation winds whatever
you can even begin to track DNA level
information and see how bacterial phase
two instructions are happening how that
is being picked up by other bigger bugs
moving up the fish that we eat or how it
is getting into the atmosphere and so on
and we can even go all the way up to
satellites and how to combine that
information and use it very rapidly so
literally I would say this was something
that was proposed by a French scientist
Rose named the 1970s it's very schematic
but it's really worth thinking about in
terms of we have a telescope for
observing stars we have a microscope for
observing microbes how do we observe the
interactions between nature and society
which is basically what determines
everything that happens on a day to day
basis the concept is something called
microscope and it's basically I think
the way we can combine these incredibly
different kinds of information and I
think maybe Google is the best partner
for people who do this kind of research
and an incredible amount of discrete
data is being collected for example this
is meteorological stations by Noah that
beam data every day this is air quality
data by EPA and CDC collects in a lot of
survey data asking people questions
about their respiratory esta Matic
conditions or you know older people heat
waves connections to humidity increases
and so on so we are basically working
with seed
see and Noah and EPA collecting all this
information with computer science people
we are finding effective ways of
creating the data so that you can
interpolate it and look for patterns
when you have discrete data it's very
hard to look for patterns so if we can
use these information that are you know
the survey data at a county level
because of personal privacy requirements
you cannot locate address by address
where you got this information but it
can aggregate to a County and say this
county has a swine flu outbreak or this
quantity county has a high level of
respiratory morbidity among all the
people and so on so we can combine these
information and use the tool that i'm
going to show now in terms of producing
environmental information and use
statistical downscaling and dynamic
downscaling techniques to actually even
offer information to hospitals so that
they can call the people that they take
care of and say in the next few days or
a few weeks or this season there's going
to be high chance that you're going to
be suffering more so what precaution
should you take what kind of allergies
you might face you know and so on so
there's a very clear seasonality in
morbidity and so on so I will now show
more specific examples of the
environmental information we're
generating in the Chesapeake Bay when
you do this in any particular location
we were in a meeting last week as i was
telling remainder in helsinki to try to
do this for iran which has its own
issues for the chesapeake bay the sea
level is rising at twice the global rate
because there is something called closed
post-glacial subsidence so after the ice
sheets on the continent melting about
10,000 years ago continent in front of
the ice sheet was raised and now it's
sinking plus the global sea level itself
is rising so with this combination sea
level in the base increasing at twice
the rate which increases the interaction
with the
teksystems and so on population has been
increasing and is projected to increase
deforestation has been going on very
rapidly which increases the chance of
increasing all kinds of pollutants
coming into the bay plus if you add up
all the coastline of the rivers and
tributaries that's longer than the
entire u.s. west coast so there's a lot
of waterfront property here and people
like Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld have moved
into this and now it's called the
Martha's Vineyard of the south so lots
of very fancy neighborhoods coming up so
with that the habitat degradation is
almost continuous there's lots of impact
on the water quality and so on and in
any given region you have to know what
is predictable when you won't produce
environmental information in most of the
water bodies around the world and around
the u.s. you have things that you know
exist in the water whether it's a
pathogen whether it's a harmful algal
bloom or whether it's a kind of a toxin
that affect fish and so on in the
Chesapeake Bay we have one main thing
called Vibrio vulnificus which is a
relative relative of vibrio cholerae and
vibrio parahaemolyticus lib real
calories what causes cholera a big
problem in Bangladesh India Africa South
America and so on Vibrio cholerae exists
in this water in fact in the 1800s
before sanitized water supply became a
routine thing they used to be big
outbreaks and more than a thousand
people died in Baltimore in the 1850s
but now you don't have cholera anymore
because you don't ingest as much debris
0 calorie per liter but Vibrio
vulnificus affects fishermen through
cuts and Nick's and it causes up to 50
hospitalizations per year more than 10
deaths per year and it's pretty serious
so we work with Waterman to collect data
and this is a predictable signal so
there are lots of other predictable
signals like something called
microcystis which is a cyanobacteria
which produces a habit of toxin and it
kills livestock and Wildlife every year
but the main thing there is that none
most of the states don't have a
regulation as to how much cyanobacteria
you can have in the water supply so
you're going to subacute those causes
severe liver damage and oftentimes it's
too late to know that you've been
affected by a micro back microcystis
there are other things like Carl
atheneum there is pearl centrum there is
pseudo-nitzschia and so on which are all
harmful algal blooms which get affected
by the warming and by increased
population producing lots of nutrients
that run into the bay every time there
is a nice lawn people put fertilizers
and so on so all those things run into
the water bodies and this is a problem
everywhere off of the west coast of
Florida you have something called
Karenia brevis which in fact produces a
toxin that gets aerosolized so you don't
have to be in the water you'll be
walking on the beach and you begin to
have very serious last ematic problems
because the toxin is in the air so we
are predicting some of those things sea
nettles is basically jellyfish a lot of
rich people sailing in the Chesapeake
Bay they want to know if they can go in
the water or not so there's a lot of
demand for sea nettles human pathogens I
already mentioned anoxia is where
basically when you have too many
nutrients coming in you have big blooms
of phytoplankton that suck up all the
oxygen when they die and sink so that
could use a so called dead zones fish
that can through my way do swim away but
but crabs cannot go running very far so
they all end up dying this is a huge
problem in the Gulf of Mexico where
massive shrimp kills happen so that's a
big problem with the warming we know
that we are decreed we are increasing
the nighttime minimum temperature so the
insect infestation is going up and Obama
administration for example has an idea
to digitize all p hrs or personal health
records and we are trying to convince
them that in fact environmental
information should be part of this PHR
because a lot of people are affected by
the environmental conditions there esta
Matic conditions arthritis etc depend
what the weather is going to do so we
can produce personalized pre-emptive and
predictive health information and you
know that this is another Google rich
target there are lots of other things
that I will come back to in a minute the
basic tool we are using is a dynamic
downscaling using regional atmospheric
model so as I mentioned before the IPCC
models and climate or gas models
basically use produce information at
about 100 kilometers maybe they will get
the 10 kilometers at some point but we
want to produce this this can be run at
half a kilometer and then you can
combine with in situ observations and do
dynamic done a statistical downscaling
down to several meters so you can
produce information at order of a block
of a city so the hospitals can use this
information and there is a terrestrial
watershed model that tracks all the
nutrients that are getting into the
water ecoli new sediments chemical and
biological oxygen demand and so on
everything runs into the water body that
you are considering where you are doing
tides circulation salinity temperature
chlorophyll water quality you're
tracking air quality and phone so you
obviously produce winds temperature
humidity radiation etc but the number of
people interested vary across so it
could be aviation industry it could be
public health it could be companies that
are trying to do solar and wind energy
so we if we can reliably predict in the
next month for example or even next 15
days how many sunny days you are going
to have how much wind you are going to
have they can properly plan how to
produce energy and distribute energy
because it's not very easy to save
energy in those situations or how to
trade between conventional energy and
solar and wind energy so we can produce
designer forecasts of various fields at
eight days and beyond and the challenge
would be that we will need help from
somebody like Google to be able to say
how uncertain are in
mation is and to be able to give it in
the proper format for these different
users the insurance company cares about
certain level of accuracy but aviation
industry wants a much different accuracy
solar and wind energy will look great
we'll need a very different accuracy so
this information will have to be
depicted in very different ways the
other things we do is stream forecasts
as I said it can do sediment loading
nutrient loading ecoli loading chemical
and biological oxygen demand and so on
we carry skill scores basically
validation is a very important part and
the other thing we can do that we are
doing routinely now is the downscale
this information for the future so that
policy decisions can be made so this is
our depiction of how the 2040s will look
over the chesapeake watershed so this
you combine with various land you
scenarios so you have to change the crop
types you have to use Smart Growth
concepts and so on because global models
do not do this very efficiently so when
you do dynamic downscaling the very high
resolution what you can do is change how
the land will look with erosion or with
more population more bridges more urban
centers more paved areas and so on and
that leads me to how the terrestrial
watershed model works and this is an
incredibly important part of the whole
system we have to have information 3d
information digital elevation maps with
all the crop types that are in there how
much forest there is how much urban land
type there is how the cities are growing
what kind of crop changes are happening
how much fertilizer is being pinned to
the to the water how much water is being
withdrawn what kind of tillage practices
are used and so on so you can imagine
taking
Google Earth to actually track all that
information and this is incredibly
crucial to figure out what is it that is
getting into the water and ending up in
the water body that you are looking at
so we've been combining that information
from very different sources and trying
to put it in but it's not very easy to
get this data routinely for different
regions that you want to look at it's an
incredibly labor-intensive work and for
the rivers to do them right we need to
know how wide they are how deep they are
so it needs to get really 3d in terms of
what information we need to get and this
is supposed to be an animation but we
don't even know how to depict this
information probably properly but again
something we can really use Google's
help this is our projection for the
coming season for example in terms of
the stream low water runoff in
rappahannock which runs into the
Chesapeake Bay and you it's going to be
below normal and that's going to affect
how much oxygen there is in the water
how many fish there will be and so on so
what kind of help can we get from google
in that the watershed itself has as I
said other than the physical quantities
like temperature salinity currents tidal
water levels non-tidal water levels and
so on have seen attles so that is being
forecasted routinely Vibrio cholerae
that I mentioned one of the pathogens
but there are lots of other pathogens
that we can track Carla d neomeze are
harmful algal blooms there are lots of
other arm algal blooms but you can
already see the very different kind of
information being generated so in terms
of looking at 3d ocean we want to be
able to show all these things together
and it will become a little bit more
obvious in a minute when I show the
decision-making system so combining what
I mentioned before in terms of physical
connectivities environmental
connectivities and human
activities we can generate information
of seasonal order a season on how the
weather will change and how the
pathogens will change and we want to be
able to combine with human
decision-making process and be able to
provide early warning system so I think
this is another system that's very rich
for for google we are able to monitor a
lot of chemistry and ecosystems and the
physical parameters so how do we depict
these things for users that's a very
crucial thing so I will skip this part
which is basically how to combine Smart
Growth concepts in a particular
neighborhood so we took out certain
buildings and used sustainable methods
and try to estimate the cost of cleaning
the bay with sustainable costs included
vs business as usual and you can argue
that actually you can save money in the
long run so let me focus a little bit
more on this one our main goal as i said
is really to be able to provide an
interactive decision-making tool for
users that could be policy makers police
ambulance runners or you know people who
are planning for the future city
planners and so on so i will show an
example the next slide is got a
narration where you give people an
interface with the model running in the
background and they can change a few
things like population density or
pollution or land use change and
agricultural mix and so on and then want
to be able to look at various things
that they are interested in so how would
we want to do that here is just one
example but we'll discuss develop the
prediction software for evaluating how
land use in the Chesapeake Bay watershed
affects the pollution in the Chesapeake
Bay in the left panel the current land
use map is drawn and Allegiant is shown
on the right corn cotton circum soybeans
peanuts and so on you can see the bay
itself
the Baltimore area the DC area this is
the Potomac River Patuxent River the
baby should be here and this is the
susquehanna river flowing into the bay
the map can be dragged around by the
user in order to see the whole watershed
so then we can select different types of
crops or land-use types like urban or
forest or whatever change them and look
at what comes into the bay and how it
affects jellyfish concentration in the
right panel you can select the
particular output variable that you want
to see plotted over the bay we are
currently able to track nitrogen and
phosphorus loads in the bay water oxygen
content sea nettle jellyfish presence
and harmful algal bloom density you can
also select a month and the year of the
calendar we are using predicted future
climate data such as temperature and
rainfall in making some of the plus here
the middle panel is the comparison panel
once you compute an output map for the
particular land use pattern you can
store it in the middle panel then you
can make changes to the land use map and
see how those changes affect the health
of the bay by usually comparing the
output maps for the original and for the
modified land use patterns in this way
one can answer the what if question what
happens to the bay if land use in future
is changed so let's see what is the
current distribution of pollutants in
the bay here you can see nitrogen
phosphorous oxygen jellyfish and harmful
algal bloom let us store this map as a
baseline reference map now let's see
what happens if in the next year in the
year 2010 a lot of corn is planted say
in the Richmond area for ethanol fuel
land use can be changed simply by
selecting a crop from a list and draw it
on the map now let us compute the
pollutant levels for modified land use
you can see that the difference in
nitrogen pollution is relatively small
as in n is confined to the small area in
jail
similarly other output variables are
also relatively unchanged so we can say
that planting of corn won't
significantly change the state of the
bay let us undo the changes to the map
and consider the second scenario where
the crop one that is soy based instead
of corn once you compute the results we
see that the level of pollution is much
higher now and the pollution spreads all
over the lower part of the bay including
Rappahannock and your critters if you
check the harmful algal bloom density we
can see that compared to the original
land use the hav density is quite high
in James River let us deliver to the
original map once again and see what
happens if in 40 years let's say in two
thousand 48 or 49 the major cities
Baltimore and DC grow to twice their
size we simulate that change by drones
the city larger on the map you can see
what changes that would bring to the bay
phosphorus low as a significantly higher
and particular bad increase is absorbed
in jellyfish density which would occupy
most of the upper bay finally another
ability of the software is to see what
happens to the pollutant levels if some
types of land use in the bay i reduced
or totally eliminated so let's say we
want to see what happens if we eliminate
all the poultry farms on the Eastern
Shore you can see when we can build the
pollutant levels you can see that the
bay is much cleaner now and that the
pollution levels go way down and oxygen
content is higher and harmful algal
bloom density is much lower in this way
one can visually check which specific
aladdeus types are most harmful to the
bay and what would happen if those land
users would be restricted in the future
so they basically that gives you an idea
that has a incredible amount of a number
of different ways it can go we want to
make it full 3d so that you know you
have full depiction of the atmosphere
and the water body and the land use and
so people can like even as an
educational tool kids can pollute some
part of the bay see where the water goes
and swim around in the bay and look at
where the oxygen disappears we're dead
fish end up floating to the surface and
so on plus you it's a very useful
decision-making tool in terms of people
in Montgomery County for example want to
see if they clear out a 30 acre of land
and put a shopping mall in there what
would happen to the streams in the area
plus you can use it for agricultural
practices where you think organic
methods like low tillage it's very good
for soil organic quality and that's true
but sometimes those methods are very bad
in terms of water quality because it
leaches more nutrients into the water so
you can then play all sorts of what-if
scenarios for the future and seems to be
very useful to do that this is another
powerful tool that again is very Google
rich this is a digital elevation map
that we obtained commercially so that we
have street level potholes and sidewalks
and everything depicted correctly and
the model basically predicts when there
is storm or inundation search happening
and it goes from being 3d to 2d on the
streets so that we can navigate with the
GIS interface through the streets to see
which streets are actually passable
which streets are too flooded to for
ambulances or police to get through
which hospitals may need to be evacuated
and so on and there are restaurants in
Alexandria and Baltimore for example if
we can do this accurately even two days
before several 12 hours before they can
decide on whether they want to store
perishables like meat and vegetables
whether the restaurant will be open that
night or not because often oftentimes
the decision has to be made very quickly
whether you put sand bags and so on if
the flood is too high
they have to close and they lose a lot
of money on the perishables and so on so
this can be very powerful in terms of
combining digital elevation map with
high accuracy zoomable capabilities and
so on combined with predictions of
inundation and storm surge and depiction
of street by street and now being able
to navigate through those things so it
seems like this is another thing where
we can really use Google's have helped
to see how to properly depict these
things basically that's kind of the
story I want to convey if I can get out
of this
okay the other thing we do is fish
forecast I won't go into the details but
basically they're very detailed theories
on how habitat temperatures relate to
metabolic rates so you can literally go
from large-scale you can go from
molecular level kinetic reactions of
metabolic activities to population level
densities and there are relations
between body mass and biomass in other
words small things tend to be much more
abundant when you add up the biomass
whereas large things like elephants even
though they are large their total
biomass it's not as much so if you know
how much food is available to any given
ecosystem you can use that relation to
basically see how much efficiency of
food transfer there is and we have used
that to make global forecasts of
different kinds of tuna bluefin and
yellow tail and albacore and so on and
in a given water body like the
Chesapeake Bay there are relations
between temperature and oxygen and how
the predators and prey interact with
each other in this case menhaden and
anchovies and we are able to make
forecasts of recruitment habitat
suitability in other words how many
larvae will survive given the
environmental conditions and how many
adults will survive and how much disease
pressure there will be from something
called mycobacterium which is in the
water and so on so these kind of things
can be done the other thing is to really
interact with people who collect the
data so you can use data simulation
techniques with these kind of predictive
models to be able to say where it would
be most useful to collect the data
instead of going in the water and
throwing instrument wherever you feel
like you can optimize your distribution
and this works even on land we have
using that original diagram I show
physical connectivities we can optimize
the web of sensors so we can decide if
we are trying to track swine flu for
example and you know the physical
connectivities and you want to monitor
incoming traffic of flights coming in
then which airports would you pick to
monitor people coming in you you don't
want to do it and you can't always do it
at all the airport's for example but you
can use these techniques to say you
should monitor Atlanta Boston and
Seattle or whatever so you can use
physical and environmental
connectivities to optimize those kind of
distribution of sensors and monitoring
activities so that's basically what
we're trying to do with in situ
instruments satellites and some
automated sensors the basic goal as want
to just leave you with is that this
scale is covered very well by the
National Weather Service goes from
several minutes to about a week they
don't do anything beyond that and IPCC
is doing these scales where they're
looking into what will happen in 20-40
2050 and so on but not much is happening
in this we're beyond they ate to a
couple of seasons to a decade so we are
arguing that this is where lots of
decisions get made there are lots of
emergency type decisions happen here
there are lots of benefits for all sorts
of industries in this range but almost
all society level decisions get made in
this range and it's a very rich target
for improving environmental prediction
information gathering data optimizing
the data gathering efforts and being
able to combine all those data and
environmental information to you know
portrayed in a proper format that people
can navigate through it so that's where
I think Google can really really help us
you have to know lots of other things
about what kind of regional cooperation
is needed and so on but those are
details but
hopefully something resonates with
people who work on these sorts of things
at Google and we can talk further on
what is the low-hanging fruit that can
be you know work as a collaboration
between an academic setting and Google
so if you have any questions
even if I mean one of the richest
targets I see is the land use data so if
Google can find a way to help us you
know not just you know Google Earth is
used so widely now in Google ocean also
it's beginning to be used heavily but
this be able to monitor you know
literally at several meter level what
kind of crops are being planted planted
what kind of slopes there are how wide
the rivers are have deep there then I
think that basically there is a huge
incredibly intimate interaction between
agriculture water and the environment
and that determines pretty much
everything including human health and
that all happens basically through these
things so if Google can find a way or if
it can help us provide that kind of
information then we can translate it
into usable information for monitoring
waters pathogens water quality air
quality and so on the other one is
really the just being able to take
information that's you know atmospheric
not just physical but chemical and even
bacterial level information can be
collected same for the water same for
land and this information is it goes
across you know all physics chemistry
biology and human interactions we don't
have any idea how to project this
information to look at the interactions
to make decisions so I think if we start
with a sample of one location combine
meteorological information with air
quality information land use information
and water information
then what would we do to best project
this information so that you can
decisions are now being made kind of
separately if you look at the way swine
flu is being dealt with it's not being
combined with this connectivity
information to see how it's spreading
because we already know that there's
been an outbreak there's been an
outbreak in Emory University there's
been an outbreak in University of
Washington next one showed up in
University of Maryland so how are these
things popping up I think we can do that
and I think Google is probably in the
best position to offer these physical
connectivities of commuter
transportation commuter movement people
movement with flight movement and all
the biological information that goes
with it to see how can we map these can
we I mean in the flu situation I think
Google tracked what keywords people were
using in a given location and then they
said there's a flu outbreak here and
that was almost 10 days before CDC could
make a decision about it so if this if
we combine this with the environmental
connectivity I think you can advance
that time by you know another fault so
you could go in a case of swine flu
maybe in November or December what kind
of a swine flu map you will have can
probably be done by now if we combine
these information I think Google is in
the best position to think about how to
combine and project this information so
you can just navigate through it well we
don't know exactly how to do it right
now when we are using simple creaking
methods and so on to come to produce
gridded fields out of these discrete
information of air quality and
meteorology and survey data from from
CDC so
if Google can help us say how would we
combine this and look for patterns then
we can say how they will evolve in the
coming weeks and months
and
first date effects
of unique application resources as well
provide us
yeah I think we will have to kind of
work out the details we'll have to come
together as a team from you know some
people from our side and your side too
there is definitely just the graphics of
it how would you project this
information in 3d and you know make it
see how things are spreading or how they
are getting around you know so
we'll have to bring our
or environmental people and computer
science people together with your people
to see exactly how you would go about it
right now it's like the users are from
very different areas from public health
the nurses to you know city managers to
people who are trying to decide if a
person with swine flu could should get
on the flight or not and so on and
they're all dealing with very different
information so how can we even combine
the information so they all look at the
same thing
Chesapeake Bay information telefon you
have
using that as a they just have as an
example
we're guessing
it's a prototype and why we did it for
the Chesapeake Bay's because it these
things have the regional specificities
so you don't want to build a global this
works only well at very high resolution
and you can only accomplish this in a
regional setting but it's also
advantageous because each region has
something that's quirky to that region
the kind of topography you have kind of
climate you have kind of people
interaction you have kind of water body
you have kind of disease outbreak you
have kind of agriculture you have and so
on kind of like an economy population
movements etc so they are the way it
works in the Great Lakes the way it
works here the grid the way it works
here or even here and here they're all
very different so we built a prototype
here and that the basic model structure
itself can be moved anywhere but it's
the land use that goes into it for
example what grows here is very
different than what grows here what will
happen in the future here is very
different than what will happen in the
future here so the basic models are the
same but the details are different so
with the way we see it that you will
have multiple structures running you'll
have like three in the not three in the
center let's say three in the south and
you would have to combine all that
incredibly detailed environmental in
and human interactions in each location
to be able to project so that federal
government will be trying to make
certain decision regional and local
governments will be making a certain
decision military may be wanting to use
it in a certain way department of
homeland security may be trying to use
it in a certain way so as it evolves you
know they want all kinds of scenarios if
terrorists released something in Texas
like a venezuelan equine encephalitis
how will it spread to the US how fast
will it spread so then you will need to
know these environmental connectivity's
physical connectivities people movement
and so on so in the coming years so you
cannot do it with one model you have to
have high resolution model here
connecting to a high resolution model
over there and so on so there is a
natural variability going in and then
there are human perturbations going in
and then Homeland Security is interested
in just various scenarios so this is the
best tool to make scenarios from one
season to many decades
apps
you might be able to
taken Chesapeake Bay
generating a San Francisco babes in a
position but
it's comfortable sighs but it has
incredible issues with water water
resource so you would focus more on
water resource and hydrology and
restoration of San francisco-based a big
interest for certain part of the
government so yeah
and fire is a big thing here
so that so this the good thing is that
it has all the elements and you can
focus on one particular element that's
what I meant by regional specificity
California
focus
XS or
just big bed
it seems like there's rumors
practically those
patents of various
I realize
each month
where you guys come
that is
and I think how to just how to combine
the
very different kinds of informations
way one system that you can navigate
through seems like something Google
would love to do it's my imagination
anyway
frequency
triggers for
that's what we are trying to do here
this data this data goes back to almost
1960s and the survey data from CDC goes
back to the 1960s so we're trying to
look for trends and that relates to
vegetation changes because allergens
that affect people often are related to
vegetation types in addition to
temperature and humidity so you already
see the richness of the different kinds
of information so there's air quality
information involved just in terms of
increasing industrial activity in
traffic and so on there is
meteorological changes and then there
are people changes just in print in
terms of increased populations so this
is basically to look at trends over the
last at least 20 years to try to say
what might come in the next 20 years
now this project only started about
right
the concept was around people wanted to
but funding from now on said let's just
do it so the first time that somebody is
trying to do this
yes we are doing it basically to say
existing data helps us do for guests of
scene at all vibrio cholerae and so on
to validate it we will need to do this
so and that main argument is in five
years we have no choice we better be
doing this right and if we want to get
there in five years what kind of data do
we need so we're trying to drive data
needs to say if you want this kind of
information this is the kind of
information do we need to start
collecting to validate to put better
skills on these things and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
