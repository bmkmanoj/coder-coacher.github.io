in a minute but first i want to talk
about the unusual story about how i met
Steve Steve and I were sitting next to
each other on flight was a to san
francisco from true sexy san francisco
and it turned out that we have and we
were discussing through so each of those
ipods that had the same outstanding
taste in music arguably and we got to
talking and i and let me talk about what
each other did and i guess about what's
what's yes Steve did with the foundation
and I'm not going to give the whole
thing away but there's really
fascinating we want to keeping in touch
and for two years running now we've had
students out from the foundation you
have up here to Google small group of
under 2015 20 students give them a tour
around and then we spend a couple hours
actually not sitting up in gold coast
not talking about what the weather come
up group of our Googlers talking about
what it is that makes them excited about
working here what would it what it is
that makes them happy with their lives
and with their jobs and that sort of
thing and it's I think the students
enjoyed it immensely but all the
Googlers who participated have come out
of it with quite a bit as well it's a
really it's really been a great
experience and so with that Steve said
gosh what can I what kind of possibly to
repay you and after he turned down my
cash request um he offered to come up
here actually and give a talk to us
about about giving and about and about
what that means and again
the whole topic but i'm really excited
as somebody who does believe a lot in
giving the charities of your time and
money to hear what he has to say and
with that I will turn it over to Steve's
huh thanks philosophy things are you um
I think I'm a happy that you said great
music because I think the last time we
got together you said cheesy music and I
think that was fair i thought the 80s
were in boston decade and parachute
pants are making their way back thank
you so much for for having me here today
and i just want you to know i'm not
selling anything this is not a Tony
Robbins seminar there are no tapes at
the back of the room so when I gush
about Google um the reason I do that is
is because the affection I guess is the
best way I can put a big google has
shown our foundation and the kids that
come here really to be quite honest with
you is it's pretty incredible and you
should hear the stories and I tell fits
all the time it's not what the kids are
here because you haven't trapped and I
not get into our foundation in a minute
but you have them here and there there
in front of all these executives and
they're very intimidated but the second
then get out of here and get on the bus
it's nonstop chatter about how cool it
was that we were here and it changes
their lives so anyway I mean that's when
you see all the great google stuff its
general admiration just to give you a
quick idea as to who i am i have the
executive director to give something
back foundation the president of the
heartland cares foundation and i'm here
with Bob Tucker who I work with who does
many many things at the office but Bob
comes from the University background so
a lot of what we do and I'll talk about
in a second has to deal with sending
kids to college so Bob is kind of the
resident expert dealing with the you
know with universities and we're very
very blessed to have Steven K nerd here
as well and I love the title generosity
coach but that really is kind of a
catch-all title for all kinds of things
that Steven's done in his life and he's
at the point right now where people call
him for ideas and bounce ideas off of
him actually
kind of a walking google which is a high
compliment now this is a very serious
question I take this very seriously
because this is going to tell me
everything I need to know about you
you're stuck on a desert island now
let's assume there's there's power okay
but only not for you know anything else
but for your your CD player you have
five albums that you can choose and I
want you to think about them or jot them
down if I'm stuck on a desert island
these are mine so this tells you pretty
much everything you need to know about
me okay we have the Beatles revolver
Dean Martin the Messiah Dave Brubeck and
of course REO Speedwagon the hits so
this is serious i'm not i'm not going to
answer any questions until you tell me
your albums one of the reasons why we're
here as fit said was giving back to
google i believe very very firmly in the
fact that we put good stuff into the
universe good stuff comes back but my
whole goal is to enrich you in some way
today and i don't care how that is so i
can give you something or give google
something back based on all the things
that you've given us but then that it
will be a time well spent the three
points that we're going to cover today's
illuminating key questions you know what
are the key things I should be asking
before I give my dollar to discussing
giving trends just an industry stuff
that is kind of of interest if you're
into giving and then develop a giving
strategy this all sounds complicated
long and boring but believe me we'll get
through it very quickly and is not that
difficult first of all you give
something back foundation just so you
know kind of what it is I do we were
kind of informally started in 2003 when
a gentleman and his wife Bobby Dzhokhar
decided to give a scholarship to
graduating seniors from lockport
township high school they gave a hundred
thousand dollars to five students to go
to any college they wanted in the
country based on some parameters which
were character income and GPA so he
decided Bobby Joe both decided to
formalize this in 2006 and that's when
the gift something that foundation was
started now what we basically do is we
are our core is taking kids with those
same qualities but picking them or
so we picked them in sixth grade and
we've actually developed a robust if you
want to call it curriculum so we put
them through medica training we visit
Google we do things that they normally
would have no opportunity opportunity to
do otherwise and then hopefully by the
time they graduate high school they're
more prepared for life and then we pay
for their college experience so that's
the core of what we do know if anybody
has a computer but we also have a
website and one of the things that we
did recently is a side project if
anybody's ever been in lockport illinois
we built the part called lincoln landing
very very quickly it is one of the most
significant pieces of lincoln geography
anywhere it happens to be in lockport
illinois so we actually built the park
contiguous to a very very good
restaurant along the item canal in
lockport illinois so that was actually
our project and it was typical Bob and
Jill often asked myself why are we doing
this but really the answer was because
it's the right thing to do and that's
kind of the you know the Nexus of how
the foundation was started and how we
run run our daily lives now to talk
about some questions these are questions
that you know as your kind of thinking
about giving some key points I think
that everybody should really walk
through is why do I give what gives me
passion to whom do I give will my gift
make a difference in how do i give and
really one of the things that the the
key components to this is really kind of
the how we're going to talk a little bit
more about that than anything and we'll
see in a moment but the why is where we
start this is my personal reason for
giving this is where you really need to
understand this is my personal giving
philosophy and what's your giving style
and really what a lot of people don't
always think about is what is my budget
okay so you know you start in January
how many in this room have ever sat down
and said I need to go over my
philanthropic a budget for the year Wow
very impressive doesn't happen often
most folks kind of give it as they go it
can be kind of counterproductive and its
kind
intuitive but again that's one of the
things that we need to think about so
find your passion well what gives me
passion how do i define it i define it
as that thing that when you're sitting
at your desk and you have a you know one
of those wandering moments or if you
wake up in middle of the night or if
you're watching a TV show this is that
that thing in your stomach that
motivates me to not just look at it feel
bad but this is the thing that when I
think about at night I can't sleep this
is the issue that I actually talked
about at cocktail parties trying to bore
everybody what I call it then the next
step is like that Cardamone hypothesis
which is there's a direct correlation
between the amount of passion you have
for something and then that directly
correlates to giving of time and of your
treasure because quite frankly I think
if you're giving time and treasure
that's kind of the ultimate debts that's
the peak that's the pinnacle of how
strong you feel about something because
it's easy to it I want to say this like
it's it's it's any less but it's easy to
write a check it's really difficult to
do both so anyway that's kind of my
hypothesis and to whom do i give who can
facilitate my happiness I think that's a
key question you know what I'm going to
tell you a little story here I had that
moment I'm sure everybody has this
moment somewhere no matter what it is
you have that connection but when i was
in school in college I had a professor
who I really liked accounting professor
and we were in class one day and next
day he wasn't there missed a week then
he was there that he missed a week so he
came back and I've always been kind of a
you know not going kind of person so I
walked up to you know in front of the
lecture hall and you know before class
and I said you know back to Carol I
haven't seen you on where you been you
know he said well my daughter has cancer
so I'm terribly sorry to hear that he
said well we're putting a benefit
together because she had a very bad
point very rare form called
neuroblastoma which is one of you know
it's all evil but it is one of the most
evil forms of cancer because it attacks
really kids in a texture
so I'm going to try to keep this all
together because i can remember this
like yesterday because I said okay I'll
do anything I can to help and he said
well we're getting some some some items
for a raffle we're going to have a
dinner dance and we're gonna have a
fundraiser so i said i love to help so I
had at that point connections with the
Chicago Blackhawks I interned there and
I got some hockey sticks and you know I
was doing my thing I was helping dr.
Karen life is good you know I'm doing my
job but I was really doing it for him
you know I really had no connection with
the cost sort of speak until he asked me
one day would you mind dropping it off
at my house sure not a problem so I had
all the stuff and loaded up my 1984
Cutlass with the floor seats and pulled
up to the house and soon as I got there
he you know was at the door and he said
could you please put a mascot he said
because we can't have any germs in the
house so I have my heart started
thumping you know I've never been around
anybody chronically ill at let alone a
child and I didn't even think that she
would be there so we walked in the house
and there was Michelle sitting on the
couch ER she was totally ball she had a
mask on and she was holding her little
blankie I said at that moment I get this
I get this this became very real there's
a three year old little girl who all
this garbage that I had to sell I mean
big deal now I became a warrior because
i need to do whatever I can do for this
kid didn't even know her but I know I
couldn't get within 50 feet of her
because I made her sick so I think when
you answer that question I think it
becomes a matter of you know this is
very very personal for me and again that
gives passion I'm sorry it's a side note
I think the next question is will my
gift make a difference this is my hard
earned dollar okay and I think a lot of
you here this is going to be a little
bit of a little bit of review because
you're already thinking about your your
dollars and how they're going to
throughout the year but talk to the
director is the organization viable
we're going to talk a little bit about
trends in the near future part of the
trend is 501 C 3 s are being treated
just like businesses don't invest in a
loser if you have an organization that
is not spending money wisely the money's
not going where it's supposed to go you
don't give money because you feel bad
for them or you think it's a good idea
you have to really you know take the
next step and how do I get this is the
big one time or treasure you know time
is huge that's the intangible and you
know I wrote this down into in two ways
that made sense to me which were
professional skills amateur skills or
grunt skills while professional means
I'm a marketing guy I can walk into my
local Red Cross office and create a
marketing plan for them I'm directly
using my skills that I work you know
using my job part of what I think is
that the benefit of that is it's not a
problem here and again I'm not saying
this because I have so much admiration
front for you but I do but at some
companies you know you don't have an
outlet they don't let you try new things
and creating using your skills at your
job well this is a great way to use your
skills and different in different
innovative interesting ways because
you're donating your time so that's a
direct way the next way is the amateur
skills how many of how many of us in
this room is probably everybody have
something we're passionate about other
than work we all do right I hope the
garden believe it or not because
probably because the plants can't talk
back it's a one-sided conversation but
that's another way you can be a
professional the same marketing
professional can say you know what my
local church doesn't need a marketing
plan but you know what the outside looks
terrible swamp plants and flowers so
you're using your skills that way then
you have your grunt skills which is do
they need to stuff envelopes believe it
or not it can be just as important as to
professional skills if by the way one of
the things I fail to mention I don't
have it on D on this presentation but if
anybody here sits on a board or has any
board specific questions to deal with
501 C 3 s or bores in general we have a
wealth of board knowledge in the room
here and I'd be more than happy to talk
about that cuz a lot of this is going to
be very clickable and then the how do I
give
well let's flex our proverbial muscles
for a cause you know that's that's again
that's the professional in us as my
professional skills I can show the world
or show this organization using my
professional skills you know the things
that I can do to make them better or we
can sharpen our prodigious skills in
other areas you know that gives you a
chance to practice so as an amateur you
can practice your skill at agenda
charity level and again if you're doing
grunt work you you basically get the
feeling of doing great work so again it
just three different ways of thinking
about it now let's think about treasure
a lot of people say well do I give gifts
of money or time well it's kind of both
in some aspects because are you gonna do
one time gift are we thinking ahead you
know and I think part of it comes down
to what gets me more excited do I feel
better knowing I'm supporting an
organization via check or when I show up
and actually get my hands dirty serving
food now keep in mind this is not to
make anybody feel guilty I think we live
in a culture where it's very common to
make all of us feel very guilty to say
long if I'm not at the soup kitchen I'm
Thanksgiving then I'm a horrible person
I don't think that's the case I think
it's whatever gets you just you know
what gets you excited you know if it's
saving lemurs in Madagascar chances are
you're not going to get there to do it
but you can certainly write a check but
it's all about where your personal
passion lies and yes just so you know
that charity does exist I want to talk a
little bit about the psychology of
giving and this is kind of the staff
that blows people away and the first
thing is everyone thinks charities it's
it has to be you know the reason people
do it is for the tax deduction well yeah
there is a reason for that but ninety
percent of the folks can't take because
they don't do their taxes they don't
take the deduction if they don't make
enough money and B they don't help me
any nice i advise their their tax
deduction so it's it's a fallacy to say
that people give just for tax reasons
that's garbage blow that off the window
and the second thing is fifteen percent
of all the money's fifteen percent in
generous nation in the world come from
corporations and from foundations so
that means the other eighty-five percent
is coming from people like us writing
checks being passionate so again it's
it's it's very important to understand
that so we're gonna talk a little bit
just about the psychology which is fear
fear or guilt this is like point one why
do we give oh god here comes John his
kid plays t-ball I have to give him ten
dollar so he's going to help me this is
this is like again this is the gift that
works I mean pressure works but is it
going to does it get you jazzed you get
excited what was the last time you gave
a gift of like I'm mas and it was
lasting you felt great about it camera I
can't remember one either but that's
what this is psychologically this is not
the way to go about long-term good
relationships necessity we talked about
this a little bit which is boy this is a
great organization they just cannot get
their act together but i'm going to
write them a check anyway because i
think what they do is great that really
doesn't inspire long-term giving either
self-interest one of my personal
favorites the cardamom law school you
know or i can't go to a fancy dinner and
they're going to put my name in a book
so for that night i'm an all-star
because my name is in a book but you
know at a cocktail party have you ever
whipped out a book and said hey just by
the way in 1987 i gave a hundred to my
high school I rock not so much passion
what gets us excited you know this is my
cause this is the cause that if you
insult this cause you insult me you know
coma Powell who is biography was great
night
really love the guy but he once said
never hold a position so close that if
it goes down you go down with it okay
that's kind of squishy to me I just
don't buy that I say to myself there are
a few things that if you insult that
you're insulting me so again this is the
thing that passionate thing that you
know that once you figure out what that
is nobody can take it away from you you
can talk about it passionately and at
some point you wouldn't be afraid to
raise money for it that dirty word but
yeah it's true so after all what is
philanthropies you might know the
definition of philanthropy not you who
set it up a lot of people that's what it
is it's a lot of people and that's what
this whole thing is about who do you
love long-term donors give because they
love you they trust you in there good
stewards okay I give to organizations
that I know will do well with my money
and that's kind of what it's all about
it's finding it it's like anything else
you have to find out what your outlet is
for that big ball of wonderfulness you
call your wallet who's going to take
care of it like I would so we get past
that let's talk about some new trends in
the industry and I'm going to be done
here in five minutes trends in the
industry are these active vacations if
I'm really passionate about building
stuff it's not just about habitat for
humanity anymore it's about going to
Peru living with a family in rebuilding
a church in a village call them active
vacations these are becoming very very
very popular as people become more
affluent and there are their causes can
become a little bit more shall we say
pinpointed not as broad these are things
that people are doing so it's a very big
trend in the industry the next thing the
donor advised funds versus foundations
I'm not going to get into this too much
but just know this because there's a
point here foundations in the past have
been abusive because they put their
sister on the board the brother on the
board they're paying them salaries and
you know two percent of their money is
going out ninety percent of staying in
our pockets I'm making those numbers up
but the long short of it is through
abuses foundations
we'll talk about it with sarbanes-oxley
they have to run more like a business
and there's many many more restrictions
and they're expensive this start an
expensive than maintain so the donor
advised funds which is like this great
alternative which is kind of like if you
go to band gardens a mutual fund of
goodness does anybody here know what
these are okay good because I don't want
to retread old territory but to make a
long story short if I have a cause where
I want to save my lands specifically at
the reserve and Kilimanjaro I can call
Vanguard in chances are they will have
an adulterer Vanguard just throw another
because they're the biggest but they
have a fund that I can donate my dollars
to that will specifically attack that
problem why is that good because I'm
pulling my money with other folks and
the second thing is I'm not starting my
own foundation to make it happen what's
the downside of it though I'm sorry
there's better tax deductions if you do
it that way versus a foundation because
they cut back on that too but what's the
downside they're called donor advised
funds which means at the end of the day
they could donate your money to help you
know homeless in Chicago so they really
legally can do whatever they want with
the money does it happen now that really
but just know that it's an option out
there foundations give you maximum
flexibility in nonprofits like we just
talked about sarbanes-oxley at this
point because of all the abuses they
have to now go along with the standard
accounting principles that you know that
the regular companies are now which I
think makes it even that much more
important for folks to look at
not-for-profits like a business because
they have to run like a business so when
you're going to invest your funds make
sure you do it with a good it called
company but a good 501c3 here's a good
question it's kind of an uncomfortable
question but i'm going to ask it anyways
i'm into uncomfortable ness that's a
word many funders hold back because you
know they say I don't trust you enough
so you can only take my money if you
build sidewalks at the quad that I used
to walk through when I was in
college and you can only do XYZ and if
you do anything else I'm taking my money
back that's what we call a restricted
giving okay makes us feel good because
we know our money is going for something
very specific however if you like your
boss saying I need you to get this
project done but here's exactly how
you're going to do it because I could I
can't trust you as far as I can throw
you okay what you want is if you really
trust one in your organization or good
stewards trust them enough to give them
your cash okay and if you do the
research ahead of time and you feel
comfortable and that's the level you
need to get to so restricted gifts are
kind of difficult for from a 501c3
perspective because you're adding
strings to it now this is like the
personal plan this this this took me all
of five minutes to put together because
this is the common sense Steve way of
doing it now is this the way that you're
going to you can you know look online
and find plans but to get no this is my
suggestion on how I do it first thing my
first question is what gets me jazzed we
talked about it what am I excited about
conceptually these are my core values
what if I want to support now think
about this generally i dig animals let's
say that's that's where i'm at right now
my life i love animals which is not true
i'm just using that but you said
yourself this is where I want to be so I
need to find a cause that allows me to
take care of animals second question is
what organization is an outlet all right
well you really got to think about this
because I know I love animals but is
pita or the Humane Society going to best
reflect what my core values are so even
within the portion that you're excited
about you know what organization is
going to best reflect my personal
mission and then again if the
organization doesn't exist can I find a
fund that allows me that flexibility to
do it how about comfortable giving now
now is easy its time and treasure I can
donate time stuff at envelopes or i can
write a check and i'm done it's over
with
we look at the future everybody in this
room can make a long-term real a
long-term estate gift if they if they so
choose a hundred-thousand-dollar piece
of property in a home you can very
easily donate as a matter of fact it was
Loyola just accepted a
fifty-million-dollar gift estate gift
yesterday or the day before okay most
kids though are not dead sexy you know
there are 150 thousand dollars on as a
matter of fact there's a little house in
lockport that just got donated to the
historical society that is worth you
know X amount of dollars but I assure
you it's not 200,000 ok but these are
long-term gifts that you can make and
can you think about it right now
absolutely you should forward what's my
budget relative to my income what can I
give but the real question is what do I
want to give do i tithe or do I not what
am i comfortable with so again when
you're in the budgetary process you also
have to think about your time how many
of us i know i have it's so easy to say
all right Steve if you just help us it's
only five times a year if you can just
come in and help us out five times here
and then every other month it's like
didn't I just do this last week you have
to think about budgeting your time as
well it's very important because when
you make a commitment of 12 times a year
it doesn't sound like a month sound like
a lot but that's you know obviously
that's once a month and that actually is
a rather you know large time commitment
to measure success did my organization
spend wisely okay in other words there
was an organization that I know of which
will remain nameless that was helping
out 30 people they had 32 staff members
awesome awesome work if you can get it I
guess I mean all right now they spending
my money within budget not so much are
they within mission so in other words
not only they spending that money what
are they doing with it that the things I
said they were going to do with it did
they communicate with you in other words
did I get as a donor communicated with
the show me where my dollars went don't
let that fool you any organization can
do
it's very simple even though
organizations that don't have
infrastructure a digital picture in an
email let me know what you're doing of
course today do they know how to right
the ship in turbulent times I mean I'm
tired of using the example but the
economy let's face it there's a lot of
things that are going on right now that
I've never happened has the organization
that that I'm passionate about how they
adjusted their attack so that's a good
question and then do they appreciate you
it's very simple do they appreciate your
dollar George Thorogood once said who do
you love and I love it because that's
what this whole thing is about today if
nothing else it's about what about love
what am i passionate about in white
Google okay how many people in this room
