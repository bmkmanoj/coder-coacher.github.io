you from Leon France where we're at the
World Wide Web 2012 conference we've
been here with presenting seven
different papers as well as workshops as
well as tutorials and it's been exciting
for Google to really showcase the kind
of research and development and sharing
it was the rest of the world we've had a
really exciting booth here where we had
standing room only response to many of
our demos including the Google Art
Project this has been a very important
sponsor conference for
because we're trying to make information
universally accessible to everybody we
sponsor the best paper award which was
called counting beyond a yottabyte or
how Sparkle 1.1 property plans for cadet
adoption of standards we've had a
awesome response to the interactive
booth with my different product demos
we've also had a hangout hangout on air
here life with a couple of the research
scientists sharing with audiences around
the world about what is like to actually
do research the Google we also had a
really nice well attended after our
party of the brasserie where we had a
nice little display of the California
feeling of open-air bikes and
a little picnic outside as well as the
wines and cheese inside of the brasserie
and finally we also had our first
Doctore alarm where we created an
atmosphere in which factorial students
can really interact with Googlers to get
a feeling of what it's like to really do
cutting-edge research at Google that
wraps it up for us for the 2012
conference here in conference we hope to
see you in Rio de Janeiro next year 2013
