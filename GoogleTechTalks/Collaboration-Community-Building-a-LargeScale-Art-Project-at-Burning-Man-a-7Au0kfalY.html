it's good to be here finally see this
juggernaut of a complex we drove down
yesterday from Portland and we have a
crew right now out on the airfield at
NASA installing our last year's
installation for Yuri's Night so we were
totally dressed grab me until we got
here but you know slices spiff every now
and then but um we'll be heading back
there after this but uh if you want to
see if you want to see what some of what
we do totally invite you to come out
tomorrow it should be all day long from
2 to 2 a.m. on the airfield Ames
Research Center Yuri's Night anyway so
this is about the temple obviously and
it's sort of strange talking to a large
group because generally my experience
with the temple hopefully like many of
yall has been very personal so this is
the first powerpoint presentation I've
ever done friend made it for us so we'll
see how it goes I guess I should start
by saying or talking a little about how
it kind of fell into our hands because
it really did it fell into our hands we
would never have asked to do it we
wouldn't have really volunteered to do
it either but about well I guess in
december four months ago four and half
months ago we got a strange email from
burning man asking us to to come in and
get our act together to submit a
proposal for it because david best
wasn't going to do it this year and i
guess that wasn't on again off again
sort of deal but it ended up being that
that he's not and so they liked what we
did last year enough that they invited
us to come back and do something on a
much grander scale but originally I
guess it came to us to do some things
out there whenever shrine and I were
hanging out at the temple burn the night
of the temple burn two years ago he
remembers a doll and I remember to
Temple burn but you know
small question of a son okay I told him
it was time to get some of his art out
there because I really believe in what
he's doing and in his whole his whole
aesthetic and his whole approach to
things and is very humble and talented
way of going about changing the world
one piece at a time so I really love
this guy he's a great friend of mine I'm
really happy that we were able to work
together for the second year in a row
and so I guess what else 20 to cover in
this part not much this is this is a
sort of a top view of the temple but
we'll get it we'll get into our vision
of the temple but we'll get into what
that really looks like in a little bit
but um by way of introduction because I
could say a lot about this guy but I'm
not going to there's a guy that did a
great little piece called over one of
his art shows a friend of ours Dugan and
he did a great little shot and i'm going
to let's see play it for you so you get
a gun of a better idea yep
my name is Ryan I'm an artist this is
our Archer
the name of the art show is our low the
reason we named it our love's because
this is the passion of our lives and we
decided to go full on it was a gift to
all our friends and family a gift of our
love and that's the way it was in 76 76
next question this is all trash from the
street this is all made out of track
these are beauties like bones it found
somewhere else or whatever it's all
found the idea is then taken certificate
started you find you like that same
thing every bad thing that happens is an
opportunity for something so learned
something they're gonna get to touch
this hole and show us about
Jesse made these lists it's hilarious
let's take a look at it hey what is it
all i'll be on so you go to see when it
I got it I'll have you know that Jesse
never cried in her whole life they're
all pieces out of it like he's all
sketchbooks like one page out of like
Jillian's oops Oh out of Jesse's
sketchbooks pull this out really ladies
and gentlemen to life testimonial right
here as soon as he is by far one of the
best exhibits ever been to shrine is one
of my favorite people and my favorite
artists he is an absolute force of
nature it deserves reckoning
it's all about infinity right entertain
yourselves function is a long time you
have to get your kicks we're getting our
kicks
you
oh yeah
what
some stairs on
and was too
said you wanted to
be
bright house the next
you
all
star
Oh
there's water lines threatenings around
you
my
Oh
go
about this year's temple um art out of
trash that's what this thing is all
about this year I'm going to make a
piece of art out of this window we found
while I'm here why make art out of trash
it's a very popular theme right now to
be green and to do the right thing so
reusing materials is certainly one
reason I myself got into it because it
was the pirate treasure hunt I never had
into the cities looking finding
incredible things treasures and then
transforming these things into something
the idea of taking something that
somebody has said has no value
completely discarding it there's a great
thrill and being able to take that thing
like the old tinkerers of old and turn
it into something amazing it's also an
awesome philosophy for life as we go
through our lives and supposedly bad
things happen to us unsavory moments
challenges problems accidents tragedies
all of these things every one of these
things that happens to us is in fact an
opportunity for us to grow to get
somewhere to up our own personal level
of wherever we are if you understand
that concept it can be very helpful and
so the idea of building a temple a
spiritual place and at Burning Man a
sacred mausoleum that houses the hopes
and fears of the population at large to
build a sacred object out of trash
that's what it's all about it's about
rebirth
this year's temple and this work in
general is about increasing your
capacity to love that's simple and when
you take something that somebody's
thrown away and you say this still has
value that is an act of love absolutely
and so this temple is going to be a
large very large act of love and
there'll be a lot of challenges that
will be a lot of challenges and
opportunities if you will to grow I'm
sure gentlemen as there are no Layla
lady and gentlemen no trip to Burning
Man is complete no trip to the temple is
complete without making your very own
contribution in the form of perhaps a
few tears perhaps sacred memory of a
lost loved one maybe its intentions for
a new year and I put it to you gentlemen
of Google no trip to the temple is
complete without making a more
substantial donation contribution
perhaps in the form of cash donation
tax-deductible by the way in this case
shrine why do we people of Google then
of Google why do we want to contribute
to your temple project hmm
a wise person once said don't be evil
how should I heard and I say we kick it
up a notch and we be good shrine we
would love to be good but what is this
good we all know that the contributing
money our hard-earned cash to the temple
project is the closest we can come to
burning money without actually burning
money that may be true but my friends
when this temple is a success when we
work together and make this the most
incredible temple that anybody's ever
seen farsa coming any examples on the
planet the team of a shrine and Tucker
the artists formerly known as are going
to be in demand we're going to have
options people are going to want us and
we want to take all of you with us your
messages back there
nice i like that and so the idea being
is if this temple is amazing hey come on
here knows all the high-tech stuff this
is what happens when you work with trash
all the time that's okay anyway if we
pull this thing off we're gonna be in
demand and that is a good thing because
gentlemen we have a vision we have a
vision for the world with trash you know
shrine it actually is bigger than you
it's actually bigger than me it's bigger
than all of us here actually because the
thing about making trash art is that
it's giving new life to things that you
think go away you know you like friends
okay think about how trash goes away
right it goes away you take it out to
the curb you drop it on the thing in a
little bag and trash goes away right and
then the garbage left it comes with his
little there's big truck can pack sit
down take it to the dump it goes away
the dump brings the crane and puts the
bales it up puts it on a truck and it
goes away and the truck takes it to a
ship that drives out in the ocean they
push eject and the trash goes away right
now there's a texas-sized pile of
garbage floating around the Pacific
Ocean that is coagulating and getting
huge and the deal about this whole
project is that it is bigger because
it's not only our attention to build
something out of trash but to actually
colonize that new land we could go out
there and plant a flag in it build a
temple make a thing bring attention to
it could be our land it could be early
it could be anyone's land it's probably
toxic hell but whatever the thing about
the temple is that it brings attention
to a major problem just like any other
project would this other project we're
talking about it's that the problem of
waste and it's not necessarily making
art
trash because it's the right thing to do
that's that's that's cool and all but it
can also be beautiful if some of these
hope pictures of hopefully shown and
will hopefully show this year will will
definitely show it this year as long as
we can get it done and I guess the other
thing about it is that building art out
of trash messing something at the
Burning Man temple allows a greater
level of contribution by the community
large because the truth is we all have
trash we all got junk we all got cool
crap hanging out in our closet that no
one but I always want that but you wants
but we might want it we'd like to build
it into the temple and we'd like to make
it shine again so the question is how do
we get there from here right now and I
have I have these things you're walking
to come afterwards what we taught you
can take questions whatever and we'll
give you a card we'd love more
interesting north better but we have
about 40,000 between people who have
given us money and burning man now our
budgets about 110 so we have another
seventy thousand dollars to raise
basically within the next month and a
half we have some leads we have some
things going on but beyond just coming
here to show you a project we would like
to it possibly ask you for a little help
now like to try and set it is tax
deductible so the question isn't really
oh is this a good project but would you
rather give your money to us or the
government I question to ponder right i
mean basically you know we'd all know
burning man is a deep black hole that
you can pour as much energy time muscle
grease love and cash into and you may
never see anything about it we're going
to change that we're going to bring some
things I back to yell and back to the
people to help us out beyond the tax
donation we have different levels of
investment now I'm gonna go into my
little used car salesman appeal here if
you look at this is a lot right there's
a Pontiac over there the Chevy over
there the beater right here well five
dollars that might get you a bicycle
awful lot
hundred dollars gets your lemon two
hundred dollars might be able to drive
it out to apply but you're going to sit
there we might compact and make it into
these things we're really making these
cool things i junked cars and metal but
let me just present to you real quick
the levels we're talking about here so
keeping with our theme of trash we have
the trash bag level of investment
alright you might not think trash bags
much but it's it's five thousand dollars
that's a lot and that with that once you
get the features on this beautiful
automobile our spot on our crew and
basically spot on the crew means a
ticket and any access you want to the
inner perimeter of the burn we'd love to
help you keep freaks out they want to
emulate themselves on the night of the
burn because it happens people run into
that thing one to kill themselves who
knows why maybe they're there other
offering wasn't great enough so they
were willing to make biggest sacrifice
but early access to the playa spot on
the crew and neither burn inside
perimeter checking it out because the
thing is really we're actually going to
do like I'm not even give it away night
of the burns are you special second
level is the dumpster a little bit
larger hold of you trash bags ten
thousand dollar investment now hey
that's a lot right talking about a lot
not too much that gets you you and a
loved one on the night of the burn get
to stand there closer than almost anyone
and watch this thing you might think
we're joking we might be joking who
knows the third level the landfill now
we would love to pillage your landfills
the landfill level this is for
connoisseurs of junk only fifteen
thousand dollars and that gets you know
you in love one cuz well maybe your funk
you liked I want to go for a threesome
it's burning man after all but gets to
crew spots a window such as shrine is
paint show them a little bit so they
even seen this what you're doing here
canoed multiple layers it looks actually
kind of like that but it also could look
like this we should blow that up and
that's not our fault and for the true
fan shrine is willing to inseminate your
wife or husband and this could be your
daddy legend what we're talking about
something super something sort of
ridiculous and special but I guess the
thing that we're most involved are most
interested in is really turning this
whole thing over to the community to
help us out not not just where they went
out you know we're talking about money
but we're also talking about materials
and we're talking about real intense
collaborations now one of the things
that we didn't quite hook it up because
we've been too busy with it the whole
NASA deal is that uh we have these
templates and I was the first thing that
kind of came up there but their
cardboard templates that we were going
to have here for all of y'all to help
you know help us out basically what you
do is you take it and when I get it back
up here and you you write your
inscription on it and we're hoping that
we get thousands these from all over the
country and all over the world maybe
we've already had some interest in that
and some of the region's will be doing
it but it's a small little bit that
people can kind of jump in on and help
us make because I try to mix a lot stuff
out of cardboard especially since this
is going to get the burn oh wait well
I'll come back to this later but
meanwhile because you are all workers to
google any project we should have high
tech something this is a something else
we put together this is more of a more
of the detail of what the temple this
year will look like
some of the the textures are a bit
different the lattice work is going to
change that was kind of space holder but
this is Earth wood structures Friday
pegan explained with our
a lot of cardboard usage a lot of
organic material like branches other
burnable trash consumer trash is going
to be taken and patterns are going to be
made there's going to be painted windows
and these two these two structures the
stairs are made out of doors we've been
collecting this stuff we just came down
with a load of stuff to drift wood off
the beach people are going to donate
stuff if you want to bring a truck full
of driftwood into American steel at in
Oakland you can you can do that and we
have a list on the website of all the
other things we're looking for all kinds
of broken wood furniture different stuff
and so you know we're out fundraising
because although we're using a lot of
Realtors the trucks and the food for the
crew and the tools and fuel and all this
crazy stuff which isn't my department
but that's his department
but something you may be asking yourself
is as you see these two fellows before
you and that is are these spiritual men
where's the humility what kind of Temple
project is this well I firmly believe
that if you are interested in any kind
of spirituality and you investigate any
kind of spirituality and there is no
humor that's that's your first clue
right that that's absolutely your first
clue like I said before our goal and the
goal of this temple for ourselves and
for the people who are going to come and
have incredible moments in this temple
the goal is to increase our capacity to
love which is a valuable thing any
questions about the temple this year we
got everything blueprints whatever you
want we gonna burn it we are going to
burn it thank God last year we learned
our lesson we didn't burn our last year
and it's been like an albatross across
my shoulders the whole time fine finding
finding storage for it finding a finding
you know places for it to go and finding
all this stuff but more importantly
we're burning it because it takes
problems away and I tappan for me this
happened for trying I'm sure it has
happened for a lot of yelling we
discussed not burning it this year we
discussed it with burning man and it is
an option the thing is for me at the
temple and all the stuff that will go
into the temple all those deep dark
things that need to be let go those
things need to be burned um there was
been talk of moving that stuff at a
planned time people could come and take
their altars and their contributions and
move them I was like that's not going to
happen at Burning Man be here at eight
o'clock to move your loved ones photo to
a different area to burn it I personally
do not like to burn stuff I like to
reuse stuff it's a serious passion in my
life but in this case we're going to
burn it and
uh we're gonna enjoy it hey absolutely i
think maybe not intentionally but my
first burn was 2004 so I'm relatively
new to the community and my first ply
project thanks to this man was last year
my first experience on the ply building
something which is a chance to really
experience Burning Man and give
something back well that's a relatively
short amount of time then be building
what I consider to be a major
installation institution excuse me of
Burning Man which is the temple created
by David best and his people and all my
time at Burning Man my little bit of
time at Burning Man the most significant
part of it has been the temple anyway
the idea of the American dream any
huckster can walk in and become somebody
I don't know we are building the Temple
and it's kind of the American dream but
Burning Man well and another thing you
know this temple would look different in
another country because we're building
it out of american trash and one of the
ideas we're talking about is if we were
at a in india trasher in the world oh
yes biggest fast cheapest trash in the
world if we were building in another
country say India there wouldn't be much
trash around people really reuse lost up
there we this is what we're talking
about maybe going around in different
different countries and different areas
and doing site-specific installations
out of their own trash maybe it's just a
ton of cheeto bags right maybe we make
these beautiful mon dollars out of
cheeto bags and weave them together into
these like little star things that hang
out who knows but it looks this way
because we have access to the abundance
and the consumptive power of the United
States of America
any other questions nothing
ya can access that second level actually
you can be able to walk up there you can
you can build an alternate any of these
structures and there's going to be other
altars built this is this is a really
minimal kind of you know 3d version just
to show the basic structure but there's
gonna be a lot of details that aren't in
this in this particular drawing a lot of
places for people i mean my name is
shrine i build shrines and there'll be a
lot of shrines in there for people to
contribute to and we've been talking
about creating a space with tools where
people can come and build something a
small altar or whatever just like people
always have as far as there's been
things for people with pieces of wood
for people to write on that idea but
maybe you can attach a few pieces of
wood or something remember that failed
birdhouse in high school that she never
quite finished yeah you do oh yeah try
it again else oh alright um we love to
come give you some cards we have these
little cards here they kind of cool they
have a picture of them on there not we
never had business cards in a life
before but there's always gotten picked
off from kinkos so come on up I'd love
to show you more if anyone's interested
in the the actual numbers of why it
costs so much I can I'm the project
director and the infrastructure guy and
figuring out how it actually goes up and
comes down and coming down is the real
good part but I can definitely tell you
anything you want to know about that or
what it takes to build a temple well I
you know actually actually asked me in
six months what it took because it's
getting more and more intense every day
but it's a we welcome it and welcome to
challenge and I'm pretty excited and
feel incredibly blessed to be able to do
this this is this is uh this is bigger
than anything I've ever ever taken on
and it's great
the pictures that I was showing you of
the tas de Graaff last year the t temple
that is going to be and it's actually i
have a little uh i used a sketchup to do
it a little a little uh so yeah a plug
it's right here there we go to do what
we're gonna do it Yuri's Night looks
like this totally rough but anyway you
saw the pictures I haven't learned this
ketchup if anyone want to teach me
Sketchup I could really use it maybe one
of you wrote it I don't know but the
pictures that I was showing you earlier
of this deal spit like that and like
that that's what we're doing a Yuri's
Night anyway except for the top layers
or kind of sunk down into these window
that window layer so it'll be like
probably almost 20 feet tall and it
won't have the deck you can walk around
up top but that's what we're doing there
and we'll see I never been to this this
event apparently it's the anniversary of
Yuri Gagarin's first night in space
y'all probably all about that and we'll
see what it looks like hopefully we had
done in fact we got to get back pretty
soon but we welcome to you if you want
to come up there and and we'd love to
talk to you a little bit and meet you
and say hello and thanks again for
having us this has been really been
really cool thank you yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
