multithreaded test systems, presented by Murali.
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: So today, I'm
going to present our work on multithreaded
test synthesis.
This is joint work with my Ph.D. student,
Malavika Samak, at the Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore.
So over the -- over the course of two days,
since yesterday, we have been looking at the
various aspects of testing.
There have been quite a few interesting talks.
There was a talk on -- there were a few talks
on having frameworks for writing manual tests.
But then we also are aware of manual tests
being very intensive and adverse task, and
it's not necessarily scalable.
Then there was discussion on actually having
random tests and testing the entire application
in a random manner.
But then this also requires a lot of testing
capabilities, and it is not necessarily scalable.
So the discussion was pushed forward.
And then we talked about tests from production
data, trying to sample things and then trying
to see if there are possible problems.
I'm going to push this even further, and then
I'm going to say, can we do targeted test
generation?
In other words, can we somehow generate tests
that will expose bugs?
In other words, I don't want to generate any
test that is not going to expose a bug.
And that is going to be the focus of this
talk.
And this talk is in the context of -- in the
context of concurrency bugs, detecting concurrency
bugs, for Java classes.
And it has broader implications and can be
applied in other contexts as well.
So we are all aware of what concurrency bugs
are and how problematic they can be.
They can be -- these are some of the main
reasons behind flaky bugs.
And we have data races, atomicity violations,
and deadlocks.
And we are also familiar that application
developers use third-party libraries to increase
their productivity, and so that they can build
reliable applications.
But when you are building a multithreaded
application and you want to use a third-party
library or a third-party class to avoid introducing
concurrency bugs in your application, one
can avoid this by trying to acquire locks
before invoking methods in these third-party
classes.
But then there is a significant problem, because
we need to be aware of what kinds of locks
need to be acquired and which method invocations
require these acquisitions.
So this is going to place an unnecessary burden
on the application developers.
So one can think of developing thread-safe
classes so that this will avoid the burden
on the application developers.
So the question is, what is a thread-safe
class.
A thread-safe class is -- as client applications
invoke methods in these classes without worrying
about concurrency issues.
It's as if they are writing sequential code.
To provide you an example, some examples include
ConcurrentHashMap, blocking queue JDK.
But then somebody has to do the heavy lifting.
How do you ensure thread safety of a class?
Testing for concurrency issues, in general,
is challenging.
I'm going to show you an example of how challenging
it is by looking at a fairly popular codebase.
So there is this library called hazelcast.
It's an open source Java library essentially
used for application in highly concurrent
multi-threaded context.
It's an actively developed library.
In the last year or so, there have been those
many commits and quite a few releases and
so on.
And if you look at one of the classes, SynchronizedWriteBehindQueue,
it is a class declared thread-safe.
Essentially, this means that clients not using
these classes need not acquire any additional
locks.
And using our analysis, using the tools that
we developed in our lab at IISc, we were able
to figure out that this class is not thread-safe.
And we were not even aware of what this class
is doing, what kind of -- what kind of product
is this.
We just did our analysis in an automated manner,
and we were able to declare that this class
is not thread-safe.
Because there is a corner case that leads
to a race.
And to manifest this race, it requires a very
complex multithreaded test.
I'll tell you how the test looks like.
To actually expose the race, one needs to
-- one needs to spawn two threads.
And these two threads need to invoke two methods.
Say in this case two invocations for RemoveFirst.
Not only that.
The invocation needs to happen on two different
objects, A and B.
Not only that.
You also need to make sure that the field
queue of these two different objects, A and
B, points to the same object as shown in the
figure.
Now, if you provide a test like this, then
you can have an assertion that says there
is a data race.
But somebody has to write a test like this.
In other words, the question is which methods
need to be invoked concurrently.
Because I can look at all possible pairs of
invocations.
But then that alone is not sufficient.
What parameters need to be passed to these
methods?
And then that becomes completely combinatorial.
Right?
And this is a hard problem.
So how do we detect thread-safety violations?
Traditional software testing is ineffective
in the context of testing multithreaded applications,
because there is varied behavior for the same
input.
It completely depends upon the schedule that
is being explored.
We need to run on multiple schedules, and
therefore the number of schedules is simply
not manageable and therefore not scalable.
There has been a lot of work on source code
analysis.
Companies like Coverity, for -- which I used
to work for some time back, they provide static
analysis tools to expose defects, comprehensive
coverage of defects.
But then they also have false positives.
In other words, a developer has to go and
then see whether this is, indeed, a true bug
or not.
And that can also be a hassle.
So what we propose here is, why not do dynamic
analysis?
What is dynamic analysis?
Dynamic analysis is, you have a class that
you want to test for a thread-safety violation.
You have a test that invokes -- you have a
multithreaded test that invokes the various
methods in this class.
And when this test is run, the dynamic analysis
engine will analyze the execution trace and
then report possibility of concurrency bugs.
And there has been a lot of work in this area
in the past decade or so to find various kinds
of concurrency bugs, traces, deadlocks, atomicity
violations, and so on.
But the key problem, most of these -- this
work has been in the academic circles, and
they all focus on trying to develop this dynamic
analysis engine, the thing that you see in
green there.
But the question is, it requires a multithreaded
test.
And writing these tests is hard, and you need
to develop a complex scenario for these analysis
engines to actually expose the bug.
For example, in the scenario that I mentioned
previously for hazelcast, these tools will
fail if the proper test is not provided.
So we asked this question.
This is Malavika Samak's dissertation work?
Can we somehow synthesize these tests automatically
that will help the dynamic analysis engines?
And this is the goal of the work and what
I am going to talk about today.
So why not do randomized test generation?
So I have a class with multiple methods, M1
through M9 and a basketful of parameters represented
by different colors to represent different
objects.
I can invoke all possible pairs of methods
from two different threads.
Not only that.
I can provide all possible combinations of
objects to these.
Right?
That alone is not sufficient.
The objects need to be in such a state that
this problem can manifest.
And that is simply not scalable, because you
may have one test somewhere sitting there
where you will find a bug.
And you may miss lots of bugs.
And so the goal is, somehow, given this class
and possible parameters, spawn two threads,
find two method invocations, and then find
the appropriate set of objects that need to
be passed to these two invocations, and then
somehow, magically, there will be a bug in
this test.
Right?
And some of you may be wondering, wait a minute,
you just said dynamic concurrency bug detection
requires effective tests.
And now you are saying test synthesis -- but
then how do I synthesize the tests in a targeted
manner?
Because I need to know where the defects are,
and I didn't know it to start with.
So this is a conundrum.
How do I solve this problem?
So this is the problem statement, how do I
synthesize multithreaded tests that expose
these concurrency bugs?
The key insight is, most of the core repositories
will have sequential tests, and writing sequential
tests is not as hard as writing multithreaded
tests.
So we can leverage this.
And we can analyze the execution traces of
sequential tests to construct these multithreaded
tests.
To provide you an overview, you just take
a class and a set of sequential tests, you
provide it to our synthesizer, and that will
output a multithreaded test, or set of multithreaded
tests.
So I'm going to -- We have done work on synthesizing
tests for exposing various kinds of concurrency
bugs.
But in this talk, I am going to give you an
instance of how we do this for detecting atomicity
violations.
So before I delve into how do we do this,
let me tell you how -- what an atomicity violation
is.
So we have two threads here, T1 and T2.
There are shared memory accesses, represented
by these cartoons.
&quot;P&quot; represents a previous access, &quot;c&quot; represents
a current memory access, &quot;r&quot; represents a
remote memory access.
There's no atomicity violation on this execution.
So I assume that this was an execution.
The remote access happened before P and C.
R happened before P and C.
There is no atomicity violation.
But then on some other case, R can happen
between P and C. And then that is a problematic
scenario.
That is an atomicity violation.
Right?
Now, you can think of just putting locks,
wrapping it around locks and then be -- assume
that it is safe.
But in many cases, it won't be safe, because
if you can find a scenario where the lock
objects are different, as represented by different
colors for these locks, yellow and green,
you still have an atomicity violation.
You have different locks, and you have interleaving,
which causes a problem.
And the goal is how to generate these tests.
And there are a number of challenges in synthesizing
multithreaded tests from sequential tests.
So let's say I have these sequential tests
T1 through Tn and each test makes a sequence
of read and write accesses.
And because these are sequential tests, there
is no notion of shared memory location.
So how do I find these access triplets, three
accesses, P, C, and R, such that this will
expose an atomicity violation?
That way, we -- some access triplet, R, R,
W, in these two sequential tests, that, when
put together, can cause a problem.
How do I identify that?
Once I -- Even if I identify that, how do
I ensure that there are accesses in my test
that will expose these accesses?
I mean, it will trace through that path; right?
Then we bring some methods, M1 and M4, through
which these accesses happen.
How do I find these methods and the paths?
Okay.
But as I said, these are different -- there
is no notion of shared memory access.
So the accesses can happen on two different
memory locations.
But the atomicity violation needs to happen
on the same shared memory location.
Now, how do I construct a scenario such that
the objects that are being passed to M1 and
M4 are such that when they go to the actual
accesses, these become the same memory location?
Right?
And then, finally, how do I generate objects
that can be legal and that can be provided
to the setter, which will pass it to the methods
and then expose these accesses?
Right?
So to summarize the challenges, we need to
identify the access triplets, identify the
APIs to be invoked concurrently, set the appropriate
context, and use legal object instances.
So I will take a simple contrived example
to explain how we do this in our tool.
So to identify access triplets, let's assume
we have an input sequential test.
The input sequential test invokes every method
in a class with random objects.
And there are tools that can do this for you,
or a developer can just write these.
And the time is going to be linear in the
number of methods.
So here we have methods evaluate, reset, and
set, invoked on objects A1, A2, and A3.
For simplicity of presentation, I have removed
the key word &quot;synchronized&quot; and replaced it
with locks and unlocks.
So there is a lock before evaluate is being
invoked on object A1, represented by the green
lock.
And then temp is equal to this.f, and then
there is temp.g not equal to null, the values
ascend to flag.
And this happens within a locked context on
a different object, represented by the yellow
color.
And then subsequently, there is a check of
if flag, assert something.
And then the lock is released.
There is another method reset.
And that has temp equal this.f and then temp.g
is equal to null.
And there is a set that will just set whatever
value is passed to it and then says this.f
is equal to F.
And there is an atomicity violation here between
invocations to evaluate and reset, just to
set the context.
Now, observe that the -- if you just take
this multi- -- if you just take the sequential
test, the objects and the locks that are happening
are completely different.
So if you just piece these two things together,
you are not going to be able to expose any
atomicity violation.
Right?
So let's see how we can identify the access
triplets.
We say we'll identify the access triplets
as follows.
It needs to access the same field.
The P and C accesses need to be consecutive
accesses.
And the P, C, R accesses should -- are such
that they need to be of the following type.
It should be a read, read, write; write, write,
read; write -- sorry, read, write, write;
and write, read, write.
These are the scenarios where the atomicity
violation can happen in reality.
Other four combinations will not cause a problem.
So in the example here, we see that if you
say P, C, and R as represented in the slide,
they access the same field, and that is this.f.
And P and C are, indeed, consecutive accesses.
And P, C, R accesses satisfy that pattern;
right?
So this is, indeed, an interesting access
triplet.
So we'll keep this.
Observe that the locks that are being acquired
around these accesses are also interesting.
So the lock that is being acquired consistently
around this.f and evaluate is only the green
lock.
The yellow lock is just held and then released
after each access.
So that is not interesting.
So only the green lock becomes interesting.
And for reset, there is only the red lock.
So we need to make sure that locks A1 and
A2, represented by green and red, should not
be the same.
If they are the same, concurrent access is
not possible.
Right?
Not only that.
We need to ensure that the location A1.f.g
needs to be the same as A2.f.g.
And only then there will be a shared memory
access.
So that's another constraint that we need
to have to ensure violation.
And if we have the object state as follows,
A1.f points to g, A2.f points to g, then we
indeed will have a problem.
Right?
Now, we need to construct a scenario like
this.
How do I identify the APIs?
I have executed the sequential test.
I know where the methods are -- what are the
methods that causes these accesses.
So I just pick these methods.
In this case, it's simply evaluate and reset.
Finally, I need to set a context.
So this is the desired object state for the
violation to happen.
And there was one interesting method sitting
right there, set F. And set F just sets this.f
is equal to F.
Now, I can take some object A1, pass it F1,
A1.set of V1, and then that will reset the
pointer of A1.f to whatever object is being
passed.
I can take another random object, call this
method, and then that will also reset it.
And this is, indeed, the object state that
I required.
Right?
I will now set the context.
Now I need legal object instances.
I can simply do this by using the sequential
test.
I can take that as an object generator.
Right?
I'll take the sequential test, and whenever
I want objects for invoking a method as parameters
or (indiscernible), I'll just execute that
sequential test up to the invocation point,
capture the objects, and then use that for
the invocation.
So in this case, I need objects for two invocations
of set and an evaluate and a reset.
So in the first case, I'll just execute the
sequential test, stop it at set get.objects.
I will do the same for another invocation
of set.
For evaluate, I'll do the same.
And for reset, I'll do the same.
So I have collected all the objects that are
required.
All I need to do is -- remember, there is
a constraint that we had.
I will just use those constraints to rearrange
the objects.
And then this will be the test that I generate.
So I -- essentially I will call 01.set of
02, 03.set of 02, and then invoke, evaluate,
and reset concurrently.
And this will, indeed, be the required test
case.
You can go back and see, there is, indeed
-- this will expose an atomicity violation
given the appropriate schedule.
So we have implemented tools for this.
So essentially we have this dynamic analysis
engine.
And that is split into two phases.
One is the test synthesis, and the second
is the defect detection and reproduction.
We have tools for deadlocks -- synthesizing
tests for exposing deadlocks for data races
and for atomicity violations.
We have also a tool for detecting and reproducing
deadlocks.
And we are also working actively on having
tools for atomicity violations and races as
well.
We have performed experiments on this.
We implemented using the SOOT bytecode analysis
framework and evaluated it on open source
Java libraries.
And for the sequential test, we just invoked
each method in the class once with random
objects.
That will be the driver.
When we tested this on 10 to 15 fairly well-tested
Java classes, some of them are, indeed, thread-safe.
Some of them are from the JDK, older versions
of the JDK, things like string buffers, synchronized
collection, and so on.
We were able to detect 187 races, and these
are harmful races.
This will cause some exception behavior, exception
behavior.
79 atomicity violations and 81 deadlocks.
And the interesting thing is the time overhead
for synthesizing these tests is very minimal.
It's less than 25 seconds per class.
And these are, indeed, real defects.
We had reported this problem to the Hazelcast
developers, and they, indeed, fixed the bug.
They fixed the bug by not changing the code
but by changing the documentation from thread-safe
to thread-unsafe.
[ Laughter ]
So the tools are available from our Web page.
And that is the link to our page.
These are variable as VM images.
All three tools are part of the same VMI as
well.
I will just show you some snapshots of our
tool.
This is the example class foo.
And this has -- when you invoke this concurrently,
it will cause an atomicity violation here.
And the sequential test that we have is given
below.
Just create an object library and then call
them at .foo.
And then included is atomicity violation engine.
And you specify the user-specified test, user-specified
test test2.test, and then run it.
It will create a summary.text test driver
0.java.
It will tell you the time it took to synthesize
the test and the number of tests integrated.
And the test driver looks something like this.
It will initialize the objects, get the objects
that are used for the test.
It will impose the necessary constraints for
the problem to manifest.
Spawns multiple threads.
Invokes the appropriate methods.
And that's it.
And that will cause a problem.
And we also have integrated with third-party
tools.
Some of them implemented by us.
Some of them that are already available and
to expose the violations.
One part is synthesizing these tests.
The second part is actually reporting bugs.
We've also done that.
So you just need to turn the detector on for
the problems to manifest.
So in this case, we generate the test and
also report the atomicity violations also.
So in summary, we have design tools for our
synthesizing multithreaded tests.
The input -- the tools required, the Java
class and the test, sequential test that invokes
each method in class with random parameters.
This has broader implications other than whatever
I have spoken here.
And we are actively -- our research group
is actively working on that.
These tools have been helpful in detecting
harmful concurrency bugs with negligible time
overhead.
And the tools are available at that link.
And last, but not the least, thank you, Google,
for generously funding our research activities.
Thank you.
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Thank you.
Oh, questions.
Do you only consider a single class?
Or can you find bugs across multiple class
APIs?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: We can, indeed,
find bugs across multiple class APIs.
The main constraint is the kinds of sequential
tests that you provide.
So if you piece together multiple APIs -- APIs
from multiple classes, our tools should be
able to handle that.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Since deadlocks are timing
specific, how do you control them in tests?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: So, indeed, deadlocks
are timing specific.
And we do not control them during the test
generation process.
We set up just a context to expose this problem.
And then we have a tool that will essentially
do some kind of fuzzing to expose the problematic
behavior and then reproduce the problematic
behavior to report the bug.
But we just need to synthesize the test.
We need to have the scenario for this problem
to happen.
And that's what we do in this work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Can the tool identify concurrency
issues by reading the source code where the
class and methods under test have been used
across multiple classes, packages, et cetera?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: By reading -- we
haven't done anything with respect to -- I
think it looks like more a question on natural
language processing and trying to integrate
that and then trying to find bugs.
Right now, our tool is not there yet.
But that's a good point for future work.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Is this open source?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: Sorry, no.
I used to work for a company that made big
business by selling program analysis tools.
So we hope that we'll be able to (indiscernible)
it at some point.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Could the tool identify locks
needed to fix issues instead of just detecting
issues?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: That's a harder
problem because of -- fixing means we need
to provide guarantees.
So rather than fixing, probably our tool can
help in giving hints to the developer so that
that can be used to actually address the problem.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Do you have any data on the
coverage of scenarios?
The tool depends on existing sequential tests.
So I assume you can only uncover multithreaded
bugs for which some tests already exist?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: Yes, the multithreaded
bugs will be exposed only if the code -- the
test already covered some region.
But there has been a lot of work on synthesizing
sequential tests itself.
There has been work since 2005 on automatically
-- doing concolic testing and then automatically
generating sequential tests.
So if these tests are not written manually,
this can also be generated automatically.
The sequential test can be generated automatically.
That is still problematic.
But we can use this, and then try to generate
the concurrent tests.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: How do you explicitly control
the scheduling of the threads to expose an
issue?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: I think this
goes back to the question on deadlocks as
well.
So, for example, there will be a dynamic analysis
engine where we can -- while executing the
program, we can maintain data structures separately.
So if I'm looking for deadlocks, I can just
try to see whether the kinds of locks I'm
acquiring will lead to a cycle in some log
graph that I maintain and that can report
a deadlock.
Therefore, it is completely independent of
the timing of the execution.
And there has been a lot of work on this.
A lot of material is available, so you can
look at that, too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: And would the and how would
the quality of sequential tests affect your
analysis?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: The quality of
the sequential test is, indeed, a critical
part of how good our analysis is.
Mainly it needs to ensure that there is good
coverage of the various axises.
As long as that is provided, our multithread
test will be able to expose the problem.
If the region itself is not touched by the
sequential test, then our analysis will not
be able to report the problem there because
it has not seen the axis to start with.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: And I believe the last question
is: Do you have plans to expand your tools
to other languages beyond Java?
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: Yes.
We are, indeed, looking at trying to develop
this tool for C/C++.
The kind of analysis that needs to happen
for C/C++ will be significantly different
from what is done for Java, so we are actively
looking at that, too.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yvette Nameth: Great.
Thank you very much.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Murali Krishna Ramanathan: Thank you very
much.
