u.s. poverty international poverty
global health microfinance and disaster
relief so if you guys have kind of you
know and we've looked a lot at the
nonprofit world so any general questions
I'm happy to answer and I will try to
leave a good amount of time for Q&amp;amp;A at
the end so give all started with just me
working at a hedge fund with a bunch of
friends all trying to figure out where
to give to charity and we want to do
accomplish as much good as possible I
think we were all just kind of used to
the paradigm where when you make a major
purchase you can google around and get a
good deal and we didn't really find that
for charity I think at that time the
main way people were evaluating
charities was illustrated by this chart
which is kind of how much of your money
is going to program expenses versus
admin and fundraising she might consider
overhead this is a metric that in some
ways is appealing it's very easy to
calculate you can calculate it equally
easily for any charity whether that be
you know education or an opera house or
a global health program or in this case
the u.s. Golf Association and that to me
is kind of the problem with that metric
is that it really is telling you nothing
about what a charity's accomplishing
it's just telling you about a very high
level accounting classification of how
they're spending their money so you know
when we were looking around we were
asking questions like what's the best
way to help inner-city kids learn is it
tutoring is it redoing the whole school
as a charter school is it may be
something outside the educational system
in the community you can't answer that
question with a chart like this and
that's always been our fundamental issue
with the way that charities have been
evaluated using these financials I'm
also happy to talk about other
weaknesses with that I mean there was a
2009 press release where basically all
of the charity valuators came together
and said this metric needs to stop
getting so much emphasis and that even
included charity navigator and the ones
that have been promoting the metric for
years so you know at that time I got
together a bunch of friends and we were
all kind of trying to figure out what's
the best charity what can we do to find
the best charity as I just
we weren't finding the ratings agencies
helpful at all the next thing we kind of
tried doing was calling foundations
because we said okay they have a lot of
money to give away they're working hard
at it they spend a lot on it let's call
them up and ask what charity should i
give to and there we also got pretty
much no answers people would tell us to
go check out Charity Navigator this goes
back to the first bullet or people would
tell us to check out their grantees
which would often be hundreds of
organizations with like one line on each
on their website so the third thing we
tried our group is we started calling
charities and that's when we really
discovered you know what we feel is a
major problem in the sector which is
that when we started calling charities
and asking what I feel are pretty basic
questions about their impact and about
their activities a lot of times we just
got treated like we were from outer
space we got you know a lot of charities
some of them were grateful they said
we've never gotten questions it's tough
some of them were hostile one charity
accused me of being undercover for
another charity but um the one common
thread I'm serious but the one common
thread was that nobody seemed to be
ready for these questions and nobody
seemed to be able to answer them and
just to be clear I mean I'm not talking
about crazy questions I'm talking about
things like you know how much money are
you spending on each geographic region
or you know what is the evidence of
effectiveness and are you concerned
about this in that methodological issue
in this study you just sent us and you
know how would you deal with that so
those are the kind of questions we were
struggling with now at that time we
weren't we still weren't sure this was a
big deal and we kind of had this as a
part-time project and one of the kind of
things in the back of my mind was well
maybe I can't give my five thousand
dollars away well but maybe this is a
problem that doesn't need solving I mean
if you added up all the five thousand
dollar donors what would it really add
up to would it be anywhere near what
gates gives away but the answer is yes
it would actually be a lot more so this
is kind of the standard giving
statistics from giving us a the picture
would get more complicated if you
started trying to take out church and
all that but there actually was a study
done with I think Center for
philanthropy at Indiana and Google
working together that got it this better
and the picture is pretty much the same
anyway you look at it which is that the
gates foundation gives away
a couple billion a year there you know
several times bigger than the next
biggest foundation and even if you add
up all the foundations they're just
nowhere near giving away as much as
individuals so when we started
discovering this stuff we started
realizing that most of the well-meaning
money is coming from people who are in
the same predicament we were in who
basically had no good way of finding
good information about where to give so
it was after about a year of this that
we started give well my friend Ellie and
I were the most passionate about the
project we were kind of finding
ourselves more interested in it than in
the hedge fund work so we left her jobs
we went to our former co-workers and my
former boss and everyone and we you know
said we needed to raise money to start
up an independent evaluator that would
try to do a better job of you know
finding great charities and publishing
the details of our analysis we've been
around for coming up on four years and
our methodology has changed a lot over
the years but the basic core elements
are that we take donations for people
who believe in our mission so we don't
solicit the general public for donations
it's usually like people who are a
little closer to us when we do talk to
the general public we tell them to give
to our top charities we track the amount
of money we direct to our top charities
and we use that as leverage to get to
talk to charities and investigate them
and we basically combine academic
literature and conversations with
charities in order to get a picture of
who's doing the most good and a really
core part of what we do is that we
publish at all so there's a lot of
foundations out there may be doing
similar work to us it still is hard for
me to tell even after getting contacts
with a lot of them but what we're really
all about is that you can go to our
website and you can follow each step of
our process and then we'll submit each
step in addition to external review when
we can from people who ought to know so
we're really about you know finding the
best charities and then publishing
everything that went into that decision
because we know it's a subjective
decision and we know there's judgment
calls and we want to make ourselves
accountable and be able to start a
public debate about this stuff which I
don't feel is happening now so the first
topic I'm going to talk about in the
main topic is disaster relief just
because this has been in the headlines
we've done a lot of work on this late
I'm going to talk about both the haiti
earthquake and the japan earthquake
which are the two kind of recent
headline-grabbing disasters and I think
there's lessons here for just general
effect of giving that are interesting so
the haiti earthquake was in January 2010
it was really severe there was obviously
anyone who's watching the news knows
there was a horrible situation down
there and a lot of suffering and in that
context one of the things that that was
a bit surprising was the slow pace of
spending so this is as of about a year
after the earthquake which is about when
we did our last sort of in-depth report
and we estimated over five billion
dollars given or pledged to earthquake
relief with less than a third of that
being spent and this is you know
definitely raises a puzzle when you
consider some of the needs on the ground
at that time they still had only about
half the people left homeless had even
been put in transitional shelters the
last rest of them were living under
tarps intense and in camps there were
just all kinds of problems on the ground
that were crying out for attention there
was even a cholera outbreak at one point
which you would definitely think that if
you could spend more money to to control
a cholera outbreak you would do so so
there were a few different theories
floating around as to why the spending
was so slow and why you know while that
money was kind of sitting there I'm
gonna go through them one at a time I
think the dominant narrative in the
media was to kind of blame the charities
for spending money to slowly and this
quote is kind of representative of other
quotes that we saw that was just kind of
what's going on here and you know don't
the poor come first why are you guys
holding on to this money I never found
this to be a very compelling explanation
for why one would spend slowly as far as
I could tell it was in charities best
interest from a PR perspective to spend
as fast as they could they usually get
pressure to spend in fact spending is
one of the only things that you can
really show it's an objective number
that can show you're doing something in
a disaster relief situation and so I
always kind of felt that if the needs on
the ground required more money and if
the charities should be spending more
money than they would have no incentive
not to but this was certainly one
explanation that was raised
another possibility is just the question
of maybe they didn't have enough money
and and they held on to that money
because they knew they were going to
need it later and I do think there's
something to this explanation there was
a lot of money raised kind of in the
context of Hades economy which is very
poor I mean if you know we kind of
divided the number the amount of money
available by the number of people
affected and it was you know several
years of income for each person but
easily could have been not enough to
really undo all the damages and do all
the reconstruction that needed to happen
so it's a little hard to say but that's
definitely a possibility that some of
that money really did need to be saved
for later but to me what what we ended
up concluding was the number one reason
that money wasn't being spent so fast
was that it couldn't be was that it
wouldn't be helpful that there were only
so many opportunities to do good and
there were certain aspects of the
situation in Haiti that really depended
on the government and on other actors
and didn't depend on how much money was
available so a key one is the rubble as
of about a year after the earthquake
only ten to fifteen percent of the
rubble was estimated to have been
cleared and this wasn't because people
couldn't afford trucks to clear the
rubble it was a lot of it had to do with
property rights issues and whose land is
this and who's allowed to work here and
whose rubble is this and that was the
reports we were reading was was really
made it look that way and in fact it's
my belief that a lot of the money given
to Haiti may have done harm not good
it's definitely been a phenomenon both
in Haiti and in past disasters that a
lot of donors when they see a disaster
what they do is they react by sending
what's called kind of in the in the a
business called stuff we don't want you
know they'll take their old clothes and
their old socks and they'll send them
over without really sorting them without
really marking them they might even send
old medicines they might send expired
medicines I think there were plenty of
nonprofits that were in the business of
taking these gifts distributing them
making people feel good and the problem
is that in a disaster situation it's not
necessarily the case that what they
really need is stuff a lot of what they
need is coordination and logistics they
need to be able to deliver the stuff
they need to be able to sort it they
need to be able to get it to the right
people and it's a very congested area I
mean especially you know in Haiti where
there was so much damage in such a
smaller
it was like hard to navigate and so this
was one of the wake-up calls to me that
if you give to the wrong organization
it's not just that you might not be
doing good you could be getting in the
way I mean there's only so much room for
people to be helping down there and if
you're not helping you're probably
hurting there were instances in both
Haiti and in the earlier asian tsunami
of medicines be incinerated because they
were you know clogging up the highways
so this is kind of how extreme it can
get when donors are paying attention to
what makes them feel good instead of
what the needs are on the ground so we
were concerned about this and in the
years since the haiti earthquake we did
our best to find out what organizations
we're doing the best work and what
organizations were really being helpful
so that next time there was a disaster
we can make a more helpful
recommendation and unfortunately what we
found is that it's obviously it's very
hard to get information on who's being
helpful on the ground in a disaster
there's all kinds of conflicting reports
and a lot of charities are just very
very vague about what they do so what
we've decided to do for the for the time
being is instead of trying to great
charities on the quality of their work
which is just too hard to assess at this
point we're starting by rating them on
transparency we went to you know about
30 big-name charities this is not all
them this is just an excerpt and we look
through their press releases and we look
through their website and we looked at
everything they had six-month report 12
months report and we just asked a simple
question which is can we tell what
they're doing can we tell how they're
spending their money most the time the
answer was pretty much know and some
charities were clearer than others so
what we ended up doing is handing out
kind of transparency ratings to say that
at least next time in a disaster at
least let us reward the charities that
were a little clearer about how they
spent the money last time and those
would be the ones at the top of this
chart doctors that borders Partners in
Health and Direct Relief international I
think there were noticeable differences
with all of them between the other
charities and and how clear they were
about their activities and we have all
the details on our website so it's easy
for you to look at it and draw your own
conclusions so then another disaster did
come along and that was this year that
was the earthquake in Japan and this was
a very different situation because it
was a much more severe
quake but it was in a much wealthier
country one of the biggest economies in
the world and so one of the interesting
aspects of the earthquake in Japan and
the relief effort was the behavior of
major funders this chart shows what the
US government was doing USA it is our
kind of official source of government
assistance to overseas and as you can
see I mean Japan is our ally and yet the
u.s. gave a lot more to Haiti in the 30
days following the disaster then gave to
Japan this is not a bureaucratic issue
this is true whatever agency or
subdivision you look at and it's
definitely you know an interesting
question why this was happening to me
the leading explanation was there was
all about perceived needs so the more we
looked on the Japan situation and we
pretty much had this viewpoint up since
three days after the quake but we've
been continuing to research it and post
updates our view is that the Japanese
government in the Japanese Red Cross
have the resources available locally to
mount the best relief in response effort
that they can and that donations from
international NGOs are not so much
needed so this is the this is the
Government of Japan you know refuse the
vast majority of offers they got even
from other governments this is a
statement from ojo that actually came
out a little late in the process but
affirmed what we had found from other
sources which is that no international
appeal had been launched for Japan
because the government did have the
resources and because the bigger problem
again in a disaster situation was
coordination so again you've got this
issue where someone just coming in doing
their own thing you've got a fuel
shortage you've got congested roads like
that's not necessarily helping and it
could be hurting despite these issues
and despite the fact that there didn't
seem to be necessarily a case for giving
to Japan disaster relief we saw
charities being very aggressive with
raising funds and I think this is an
important thing to keep in mind is that
when you work in the fundraising office
of a charity your job is to raise funds
and so a lot of charities will do that
regardless of the needs on the ground I
thought world vision was certainly an
offender in this category this is all
from days after the quake that they were
already up on google adwords and very
aggressive with them using
language implying that they were going
to be giving immediate relief and yet if
you look at their description of their
own activities they're on standby
another I think a more mild offender but
still someone that I thought was not
telling the whole story was the American
Red Cross you know I think since I think
sin in the month following the quake
they basically decided to pass their
money to the Japanese Red Cross and
that's a whole issue of you know how
helpful that's going to be that I'll get
to but certainly the days following the
quake this is what they had up and they
said on those rare occasions when
donations exceed expenses for a specific
disaster contributions are used to
prepare for and serve victims of other
disasters you know I think that
disclaimer was there and I don't think
that they were expecting this to be a
rare or unlikely occurrence I mean it
was I think was clear from day one that
Japan is not like Haiti and that there
wasn't necessarily going to be a need
for huge expenditures on the relief and
recovery effort and again that's not to
say that you know not to say that the
relief in recovery effort wasn't
expensive and challenging and important
it's just that there's limits to how
much money can do in a situation like
this so what we did recommend in the jet
in the Japan situation we had two
recommendations our top-line
recommendation was Doctors Without
Borders they're the ones who came out
kind of at the top of our transparency
rankings for Haiti and in the Japan
situation they were actually explicitly
saying that they were not raising money
for Japan so they were active in Japan
they were meeting limited needs but they
felt the needs were limited and so they
said if you want to give us money we're
going to use it on other disasters to us
this was great we said this is probably
what all the charities are doing but
doctors without borders is being
straightforward about it and they got
our top scorer on transparency for Haiti
so our basic take and it's a little bit
of a counterintuitive thing to ask a
donor to do but we said if this disaster
has kind of you know affected your
emotions and made you want to do
something for people in disasters then
give to this organization and reward
them for being kind of the most
accountable honest disaster relief
organization and let them use that money
on other disasters all over the world
and I think that was probably the most
pertinent suggestion for most owners
some people really wanted their money
spent in Japan not you know not for the
people with the diarist needs but even
on you know
even it was going to be later
reconstruction and restitution and
compensating people one of their money
spent in Japan for them we told them to
go to the Japanese Red Cross because we
felt that a they were the ones most
perceived as responsible for the relief
effort so they face a very different set
of incentives for most charities most
charities you know will get credit for
trying and will not get in any trouble
unless they fail in a very visible
miserable way the Red Cross usually gets
blamed if anything goes wrong and so we
liked the incentive structure faced by
the Japanese Red Cross and the fact that
they were responsible for coordinating
and for basically running the the
response effort the other thing we liked
about the Japanese Red Cross is that
they are actually giving out cash to
survivors or they will be and this das
was another interesting observation
about the charity's responses to the
Japan situation which is that a lot of
these charities are talking about how
they're going to be setting up you know
child mental health counseling and
vouchers to Reese emulator on ax me and
a whole host of kind of long-term
rebuilding programs that to us we don't
really understand the case for you know
I understand that if you're in a place
like Haiti the economy's arguably
dysfunctional arguably people don't know
the best way to help themselves with
money i can see you providing services
but in japan that's a functioning
economy that's the developed world those
people were self-sufficient before this
quake hit and to us i have trouble
seeing the argument for for a rebuilding
effort that doesn't simply consists in
giving cash to survivors and letting
them decide how to how to rebuild their
own lives not only do i feel that way
but but that's what the Japanese Red
Cross is planning to do and so to me
that's kind of you know that's something
that appealed to us is the best way to
respond to this disaster I think what
both of these disasters illustrate is
something that's become very core to our
process which is the room for more
funding issue which is that even if a
charity is doing very great very
important and very expensive work it
doesn't mean that more money will lead
to more of that work and you could see
this in the disaster situations that you
know there was a lot of suffering in
Haiti there's a lot that needed to be
done but it wasn't like you could put in
more money and get more results because
you had these logistical issues you had
these go
issues in Japan again a lot of suffering
a lot of money needed to be spent a lot
needed to be done but you weren't going
to make the relief and recovery effort
look different by giving more money and
a lot of that money is going to end up
being cash grants to survivors which i
think is a good thing but it's not the
same as what a lot of people had in mind
when they were wanting to go to Japan so
this is a very core part of our
viewpoint is that it's important to
understand the marginal impact of your
donation and that's one of the biggest
questions we asked charities in our
general process so with all that in mind
just to talk quickly about this kind of
issue of disaster relief versus everyday
aid I mean disaster relief tends to get
attention and emotions up in the way
that every day a doesn't and yet there
are people all over the world every day
who are suffering from treatable and
curable illnesses and it's our view for
a couple reasons that probably you're
going to be more effective as a donor
giving to help those people than trying
to respond to a disaster one of the
reasons is that in a disaster there
tends to be so much attention and so
much money that you do run quickly in
the room for more funding issues another
reason is it's easier to assess and
apply the right incentives in everyday
aid and to learn from what you're doing
into correct course and all that and
then a third issue is we've just
crunched the numbers and you know some
of these disasters where all the numbers
are in the amount spent per person has
been extraordinarily high and we think
you put that against the amount spent
per person on the everyday aid and what
results they're getting and you know we
think a donor can do a lot more good by
giving to everyday aid so with that in
mind I'm going to give like a real quick
overview of how we do think about
everyday aid and I'm not covering most
of what we've done on this but just kind
of a you know quick overview of how we
think about global health and
international aid this is a really
illustrative case to me this is the case
of play pumps a play pump is basically a
merry-go-round that pumps water and it's
a very appealing idea that kind of kids
play on this thing it pumps the water it
saves work for the women who would be
pumping the water otherwise and this was
a very popular idea that got a lot of
people excited and this is a picture of
it in action where the kids are playing
on the merry-go-round they're excited
they're having a good
time when win there was an economist in
Malawi who kind of felt something
smelled off about this he's the one who
actually took this picture and to your
him tell it he says you know this was
not a case where these kids were playing
happily on the merry-go-round where I
walked in it was more that they saw my
camera and they kind of knew what I was
expecting and they jumped to the
merry-go-round and started playing and
in fact if I walk away and take the
camera somewhere else look what happens
so it's a very different situation from
what people had kind of been picturing
this guy putting a lot of effort into
getting a picture of the well under kind
of normal conditions this is what he
said was the closest he could do you see
women operating the merry-go-round by
hand as children turn out not to play on
merry-go-rounds all day this may sound
kind of silly but the fact is that this
intervention was backed by anyone and
everyone which to me is a very scary
fact about international aid I mean just
look at the list of backers here the US
government I mean that's a big one the
Clinton Global Initiative the World Bank
I mean everyone was behind this idea
that upon reflection really seemed to be
kind of doing harm and not even failing
to do good but doing harm and one of the
things that I can't show on the
slideshow but it's a very interesting
video the same economist made a video of
his friend filling a bucket using the
merry-go-round and also using a hand
pump and it took something like five
times as long using the merry-go-round
it was also like incredibly exhausting
and demeaning and the guy was dizzy
afterward because he's like running
around the merry-go-round and he then
interviewed villagers and they were
saying that the hand pumps were taken
out to put these merry-go-rounds in and
they wanted their hand pumps back so
when you look at that whole story and
you look at who supported it it's it's a
very scary situation and to me it just
reflects the beginning of this slideshow
and where we're coming from which is
that when people don't use their brains
to give to charity and when they're
giving because of a good story or
because it sounds good or because their
friends said to give their you just get
a giant disconnect between who's good at
helping people and who's good at raising
money so this is just a list of other
you know other struggles and struggles
in international aid that have raised
similar concerns for us I mean it's it
can be pretty amazing how some of these
failures play out if you've read white
man's burden you might remember
this but there was one project that
someone kind of went and took a real
good look at and discovered that the
reason the agricultural assistance
program wasn't working is because the
people they were working with weren't
farmers they were miners it's just very
easy to miss stuff like that because
we're looking at different cultures and
you've got several layers of management
between the donors and the people on the
ground so how does give will try to deal
with this I mean what we're basically
looking for in a charity is where we're
just looking for very strong evidence of
effectiveness and that evidence of
effectiveness has a lower burden of
proof for us when they're doing a
program that has an excellent track
record on its own so what we've done is
we kind of reviewed the academic
literature there are some things that
have worked in international aid that
have worked incredibly well that have
reduced infant mortality and other
measures that certainly seem to be ends
in themselves so we've made a list of
particularly promising interventions and
we've picked out we basically gone after
as many charities as we could that were
the appropriate size and focus and us
registration and if someone was focused
on proven health activities or had
strong kind of technical reports on
their impact they got a closer look from
us and then we do these deep dives where
we'll look at a charity and we'll kind
of go very much in depth will try to ask
what do you do you know how do we trace
the money from from from me to the
activities are carrying out what is your
evidence that it works what are all the
concerns about the evidence what are
your responses to that is it
cost-effective is this a good use of
money or is this something that's that's
not one of the best options on the table
for improving lives and the room for
more funding question which I mentioned
earlier you know will really try to get
at what is the impact of the marginal
dollar if I give you more money you're
going to do more of what so it's a quick
discussion of you know what that looks
like when we find a charity that we like
this is our top rated charity village
reach village reach is a health system
logistics charity it's something that
you know it's kind of a very it's one of
the least sexy things you can do in
international aid it's it's all about
kind of trucks and logistics and
scheduling what their pilot project was
is they went into an area of Mozambique
where health centers kept running out of
health supplies such as vaccines and
they were trying to figure out why this
was happening and they kind of found
three problems one is that the
health workers were responsible for
collecting their own vaccines which
often means that you have to jump on a
motorcycle and ride it like to you know
two hours to the town and so no surprise
a lot of times they were you know
running out that they weren't keeping
stocked as well as they could so village
reach tried to address this by putting
in a dedicated logistics team basically
a few people going around in a Land
Rover and delivering all the health
supplies so the health workers could
focus on their jobs and yet always know
that they would be well stocked another
problem that village read saw was the
cold chain so they saw that fridges were
being powered by wood fires again this
is you know this is a much harder thing
to sell than merry-go-rounds of pup
water but village reach got very excited
about propane as a better way to power
fridges so they started trucking a
propane from South Mozambique they
discovered that not only could they get
it to the health centers but they could
sell it to the local hotel and so they
spun that off into a for-profit they
figured that didn't need to be supported
by donations and the third thing they
did was management information system
they just felt that the system was not
in place to track when they were running
out of vaccines when they weren't and
how they can fix it and what they can do
about it so that's all fine I mean a lot
of charities have great sounding stories
of what they fixed what really makes
village reach stand out in my mind is
there evidence this is one of the charts
from their pilot project and you know
they kind of entered around the
beginning of this chart you see that
stock outs are extremely common this is
the percentage of health centers each
month with a stock out in at least one
vaccine and that's when they run out of
the vaccine and then you can see that
you know there was a pretty drastic
difference and stock-outs actually hit
zero and then there was a time when
village reach exited and the government
kind of went back to the old model and
that's a bit of a story in itself but
this is a this is one piece of data they
also did a big survey of vaccination
coverage rates in this province and in a
nearby province and there were a lot of
other elements that are all written up
on our website what our case privilege
reaches is basically that their pilot
project did work it did save lives it's
saved lives very cost-effectively and
now they need a few million dollars to
do more of this to basically scale it up
across the rest of Mozambique and
they're not getting these million
dollars from anywhere else and so that
to us is kind of the slam dunk the
closest thing we've got into a slam-dunk
donation opportunity we've raised a
total of about a mil
and a half dollars for village reach and
they're about a two million dollar a
year organization normally so this has
made a big difference to their ability
to expand and and we've been tracking
that as well and providing quarterly
updates on them so that's what kind of a
top charity means to us and that's where
we'd like to see more donors giving and
we're currently working on finding more
top-rated charities I mean we have you
know we have multiple recommended
charities at our website and we're
always looking to find more great ones
so I'm just going to wrap up by talking
a little bit about our mission and how
we evaluate ourselves the basic idea
give well is twofold one is just to get
money to great charities and that in
itself in the short term save lives and
improves lives and the other is kind of
a second-order goal which is that if we
can start getting money to these great
charities we can start changing the game
and changing incentives because right
now if your village reach and you do all
this great evaluation in this great
programming you still don't get rewarded
unless you can tell a great story
whereas if your play pumps and your
program is fundamentally harmful but you
do tell a great story you do get
rewarded we're trying to change that
game as much as we can we track the
money that goes to our top charities as
a direct result of our recommendation so
we're pretty conservative about that
that would mean clicks that came through
our website people who explicitly said I
gave to you because of give well and
that number is you know definitely
growing and i would say that in 2010 was
the first time that it was really
significant enough to say ok this is a
number that made a big difference to a
charity if you're a charity you should
really think about getting better at
evaluation and producing more evidence
of effectiveness because you can raise
serious money to do it so that's kind of
you know how we look at ourselves and
our progress and our goals and what
we're really trying to do is we just we
want to see more donors give to these
top charities because we want to change
what charities are rewarded for and our
ultimate vision is a world in which
donors are rewarding charities you know
not just for effectiveness and telling a
story but for effectiveness and really
getting it done and improving lives so
that's a that's all got and happy to
take questions now
that's right yeah i mean i kind of have
three answers the question of how give
all scales what answers that we don't
know yet so one fundamental difference
between us and the rest of the charity
valuators is that we just we think this
is a very new sector we think nobody
really has figured out how to do
credible charity analysis and I would
say they were the closest but we're
still learning a lot and we're still
changing our methodology all the time
and we're just not at the point where we
want to systemize it and turn it into a
formula and scale it up as big as
possible well we get to that point can
you turn charities into something that
can be quantified that way I don't know
the answer to that question right now we
feel that we can't and so for now the
answer is you know we're still figuring
things out and and and that's one answer
another answer is that we kind of don't
need to scale up I mean if a few of us
are working and find great charities
that need let's say a total of a billion
dollars well I mean that's it and then
we have got the ability to move a
billion dollars to where I could do more
good so there's no necessary reason that
you need to evaluate a million charities
or have 200 employees in order to help a
billion dollars find a better home and
do more good yeah right right that was
going to be my third answer so the third
way that we scale is by setting an
example and basically saying you know
we're putting our reasoning out here
we're subjecting it to external scrutiny
and that doesn't just mean leaving it
out there we have processes for you know
definitely soliciting external scrutiny
and that's something that you can check
out on our website and when we do this
as a result our research is more
credible our brand is better and money
more money
to our top charities so hey foundations
if you were to do the same thing maybe
you'd read the same rewards this is
something that I think is a realistic
way for us to have an impact way beyond
our organization foundations are slow
entities they're slow movers so we've
been around for a few years I mean our
our brand is you know not has been
stronger the last year or two I mean the
first couple years we were really just
kind of figuring out all right along so
I you know we haven't seen any
foundation to do this yet but I do
believe that we will and I think that's
a way we can have impact beyond our
staff say it again you mean local like
Bay Area yeah yeah yeah I mean I think
local is less of a good fit for us for a
few reasons like just for our process
because one you know we're serving an
international audience if we can if we
can point to one of these great global
health charities people all over the
place will be interested we have much
more limited impact when we go local
another issue for us is you know I used
to be really focused on the u.s. myself
and I used to care about inner-city
education above all else and in the
process of doing this research I've just
changed my mind I mean I just think that
people overseas are in such a more
extreme condition of poverty that your
money can go so much further there that
I've just kind of lost interest in the
local stuff myself and that's personal
that's not something I'm saying is right
it's all about you know what your values
are and how who you want to help and why
so you know i'm not i'm not trying to
claim this as some kind of statement of
fact but give well does tend to pursue
the causes we're passionate about and
pick up an audience that shares a lot of
our personal values and to the extent we
influence other causes we expect it to
be in the way we discuss that we set a
model for transparency so local is not
something that we focus on a lot but I
think in principle those same questions
that we ask can be applied to local
organizations and we do have a section
of our website link from the front page
where will basically take any cause you
like even the ones that we've never
covered and at least give you a starting
point of critical questions to ask for
charities in that cause so i'd be
interested you know if you've got it if
you want to look at food banks we never
looked at food banks but we have a list
of critical questions for food banks and
so we'd certainly be interested in
someone taking a look at those
asking those questions seeing what
answers they get sharing their thoughts
with us yeah from the outside I mean so
what you know some of the most common
criticisms we get or that we focus too
much on what's measurable we look for
strong evidence of impact and I think
it's like it comes down to a worldview
thing I mean to me I I don't I feel that
the challenges these charities are
working on are hard enough that I feel
better with the strong evidence of
impact but we're also looking for ways
to broaden our process and we're always
learning and so we've taken some of that
criticism to heart and we've asked
things like you know how could we put a
place in our process for groups that
aren't as proven but have higher upside
if it does work or groups that just kind
of you know they don't have that they
don't have the evaluation formally but
if you go visit them then you got to
believe it's working so we're we're
trying to incorporate that I think
that's a criticism we've gotten since
day one I think the criticisms have been
ballots in staying day one and we've
known it since day one but it's kind of
you have to get more familiar with the
sector to start branching out in what
you consider evidence you know another I
mean to get more narrow I mean we we
haven't we invited one guy who had
written a paper on eight agencies of the
least early to review our work and to
kind of take ten hours to find the best
charity he could and we offered to give
twenty five hundred dollars to that
charity in exchange for his time this is
kind of a new way that we measure our
own accountability he picked a charity
that's not one of our recommended
charities he did find it on our site he
did say our site was by far the best
resource for this but it was it was
actually kind of similar he had more of
an emphasis on the upside unlike what
would this be if it worked and less on
what's proven and we had a conversation
with him we posted the transcript I mean
it's all very interesting in my view who
posted to the blog too yeah um charities
really don't like to get an argument
about effectiveness it's just not the
culture it's like what I said at the
beginning of the talk that it's almost
like you're from Mars when you start
getting critical and so it's it's a
tough road we do what we can to
facilitate it so every time we give a
charity review
tell them if you want to write a
response you can and we won't edit it we
will help you with the formatting will
put it on this charity response tab so
it's like very easy to see from our
review and some of them have taken us up
on it but very few I think generally
people of charities they don't want to
get into these arguments and there's
there's a whole lot of reasons behind
that and back sure I mean we we moved to
india like our whole staff moved to
india for four months last year it was
it was cut it wasn't really any give
well project that we did it for because
we we stayed there and we did our desk
work so we did our like normal everyday
work but it was kind of we were all
personally interested in doing it
because we coordinated it we could do it
without losing the organizational
effectiveness and we knew it would give
us an opportunity to just learn some
stuff so it was a very open-ended you
know it wasn't like there was any
particular thing we were trying to do
but we visited about twenty charities we
wrote up a lot of notes we've now
published all the notes and in the next
two weeks we're going to be making a
series of blog posts probably probably
like three blog posts that say what we
think we learned and what we thought of
the different groups and there was one
guy who gave us ten thousand dollars to
redistribute to the group of our choice
that we saw in India so we did that
process and we're going to write up our
reasoning behind that so it was kind of
experimenting with a different model of
evaluation they kind of walk around and
see how things feel model and you know
we had a lot of I mean I can talk all
day about that we're going to be
publishing a lot of content on this so I
would say just watch our blog yep
so i see that such as the degeneration
only eight thousand dollars per se yep
yep but I objection to that is that once
you save someone's life you're not done
because these type of like how you died
two weeks later right there's problems
with both metrics if you look at life
years one of the problems you have is
you start counting infants is worth way
more than teenagers what in fact studies
show that people find the death of like
teenagers and young adults to be far
more tragic than the death of infants so
you can you know you can muddle it all
up and it can get very hard to keep it
all straight basically our approach to
metrics well to answer your other point
about what if the person dies the next
day from something else that is a very
common concern that's something a lot of
people worried about that I was worried
about we have like put work and put it
right up on this exact question which is
what is the standard of living in the
developing world when you save a life
what kind of life do you save we've
collected all the information we can
generally I think that if you save a
life in the developing world those
people are usually going to live and
have like a you know not not to 80 but
to you know 60 or so 40 to 60 they have
a good chance of living to that age so
we think that the you know a the dollars
per life saved is meaningful be the life
years has problems of its own and see we
do use both so we look at the standard
metric which is dollars per disability
adjusted life year and we also look at
dollars per life saved but we're very
ballpark about it because we don't think
that this really captures the full
impact we think these estimates are very
messy and we think it's much more
important to be confident in the charity
you're giving to that they're actually
getting it done than it is to like
nitpick the cost-effectiveness which
usually the confidence intervals are
just beyond you know anything you can
imagine and the room for error so you
know we basically are looking for groups
that are that are around a thousand
dollars life saved or the equivalent in
disability just the life years averted
and we'll take those and say those are
all best-in-class we're not going to
distinguish between them then answer
question yes
he had you know you could spend say
thousand dollars and save the life ever
been loved the 60 versus some of the yes
yeah that's right I mean we just we just
haven't found the making that
distinction doesn't end up making a
difference for his charity we recommend
it would it would cause a lot of
guesswork that wouldn't ultimately lead
to a different recommendation but I do
agree with you in principle and if we
started really being able to run into
places where was clearly an issue and we
could quantify it then we would take it
into account I mean one way we take it
into account as we separate us and
developing world because in the US it's
much more expensive to help someone but
people in the US have higher quality
lives that you can enable so that's it's
all subjective and but we do at least
separate the causes by that so you can
clearly see what we're talking about
where yeah motivating nature is
transparent looking plumbers but is it
possible that some of our jawans are
actually more successful by not now
we're sorry can you explain that again
well the large charities you like to be
more transparent all right large these
flies of the very successful movies
right is it possible to buy a sniffing
or its parent their fundraising it's
possible you know i'm i'm personally
skeptical that any charities going to
lose money by being more transparent
because the dynamic that i observe in
charity is that people who don't care
about this stuff just ignore it and you
know they'll give for social reasons and
nobody's going to say well these guys
published a study and it has some
methodological issues so i'm not going
to give even though i gave when all i
had was a story so I'm pretty skeptical
that there's much for them to lose but
maybe I'm wrong maybe there is stuff for
them to lose I mean we're just we're
just trying to create a subset of
charities that is playing by rules that
are conducive to rewarding the people
who are best at helping helping others
other questions yeah so what extent is
off for material things and sometimes
for expert tell how do you measure the
amount of volunteers that they organize
given some way in amount of resource and
so open source invoker first project a
lot sure I know that volunteer effort a
community around something is often more
important than how much money is going
into yeah i mean we're trying to look at
is kind of outcomes and dollars spent I
mean just you know what did you
accomplish all in and how much did it
cost all in and so if you use volunteers
it should be reflected that metric so in
code i can see that something got a
patch transmitted or something happened
there but i don't see that a villager
another villager got health because
there was a volunteer day strain and do
something that doesn't come back to your
organization anymore so are you you're
either the volunteers working that
community might not be reporting
everything in the way that you're
looking for it right so so what you're
describing is really sounds like it's
kind of about charities under estimating
their impact yeah i mean right i mean
again if you this is one of those
reasons that i think if you focus in too
much on cost-effectiveness you're going
to make bad decisions i think what you
want to do is you want to find charities
that it's like well they're they're
clearly what they're doing is pretty
cost effective and they're really good
at it and that's you know that's who we
look for and that's hard enough to find
so i mean i completely agree with you
there's all these other issues i mean if
you if you're doing tuberculosis
treatment versus immunizations well
tuberculosis treatment is more likely to
be in urban areas so then those people
are more likely to be able to help
others after you save their life i mean
you can't quantify this stuff you
basically want to find organizations
that are just doing great cost effective
work yeah
Yeah right before answering so there's
something I just realized I forgot Brian
would you mind like passed around a
sheet of paper some people put 30 email
addresses on it Thanks okay so so how do
we I mean how do we evaluate
organizational health I mean
traditionally that's been the main thing
people look at in charity is they'll
kind of you know take organizational
health and financials as an end in
itself and when you do that across a
large scale it takes a lot of work the
way we work is by the time we get to a
charity that we feel good about their
work we've narrowed it down to such a
small number that that check on the kind
of organizational validity and on the
fact that they're you know financially
stable is usually just such a tiny part
of our process so we do we look at their
financials I mean any charity that we've
given a top score to you'll see
financial analysis that's kind of in the
same genre as the Charity Navigator
analysis on their website it's just a
very small part of the process but it's
not too hard to tell what kind of shape
of charities in I mean you just look at
how old it is how much assets it has
compared to how much expenses it has you
know if you've already established that
they're helping people and not spending
too much to do it then you're not
terribly worried about fraud and it's
more a matter of just you know are they
going to exist a year from now so that
that's something we do look at it's just
a small part of our process previously
we've said million dollars and that's
how we only looked at four hundred
organizations for our original report on
international aid now we're going
smaller because now we're basically
saying you know anyone we find that they
can give us a convincing need for more
funding and we feel good about them and
they've like done enough that we feel
like their alleged organization and not
just some kids with ideas that's
something we're going to feel good about
so I mean we're pretty we have had a
size limit but I think we're getting to
the point where it's just not as
important to us because if a charity has
accomplished something I mean that tells
you
what you need to know right right oh
yeah it's are harder to evaluate yeah
that's an area we haven't looked at yet
that's an area we want to get to
eventually I can't promise there will be
any time soon that's a very hard area to
examine other areas we haven't looked at
that we want to disease research I think
some of the biggest success stories in
philanthropy are all about funding
people to just do basic research
something that's you know very hard to
evaluate and quantify but I do think
that we are eventually going to going to
have something to say on all these
matters and for the moment you can go to
our web page and you can see our
critical questions for environmental
organizations and you know I would love
it if nobody's ever used it um so so you
know I don't know about this but I would
love it if someone went to our list of
critical questions and started calling
charities and ask him those questions
and started sharing what they found with
us yeah we do we do have a volunteer
process because we do at this point our
research is kind of sprawling and we
always need to keep it up-to-date and
then we're always soliciting more
external feedback so if there are people
who want to volunteer certainly you know
shoot us an email or play your email on
that sheet other questions three two one
okay but um if you haven't put your name
on the sheath is being passed around
please do me a favor and do put your
email on that sheet before you go do you
know where people know where it is okay
cool so anyone who hasn't gotten to it
please do that before you go I'd
appreciate it and I'll be here to answer
more questions and I'm going to lunch
with Brian anyone who wants to join us
as welcome thanks everyone
you
