guys Gary now gary is the CEO of Sesame
Workshop Sesame Street I'm sure what you
guys all grew up on was started in
nineteen sixty-nine under the premise
that kids would have a better time
learning with some fun so I think what
they called fizz and pop and in the 40
years it's actually a sesame street's
40th year anniversary this year in the
40 years since it started I think Sesame
Street's in 140 countries across six
continents and reaches a hundred million
kids and this year was the launch of the
new electric company I don't know how
many of you guys are old enough to
remember electric company but I am was
one of my favorite things growing up so
I'm very excited to have it back and
Gary's going to tell you guys a little
bit about what sesame workshop is doing
education across the world right now so
without any further ado here's Gary good
morning everyone and good morning
everyone watching you can tell I'm from
New York because I'm in a suit so but
we'll do the best we can today to give
you a little bit of a tour of the
longest street in the world google has
mapped the world as we know but we like
to think that were the contiguous avenue
that people have walked down now around
the world in 140 countries so basically
this is an organization it started 40
years ago and it was really out of the
civil rights movement in this country
when we had an era of race riots
political assassinations thank you we
had extreme challenges in terms of
educational gaps we had a unpopular war
and it was a time when President Johnson
started what was referred to at the time
the war on poverty
probably not so dissimilar to some of
the talk you're hearing in Washington
today and out of the war on poverty came
a set of federal initiatives like Head
Start there was no really organized
childcare program that was funded for
those in economically disadvantaged
neighborhoods things like vista things
like the Job Corps which were the
Americas of their time and the teach for
America's of their time I guess and even
NPR and PBS came out of that era as well
so Sesame Street was really invented at
a dinner party one night by a television
producer in New York who was a
documentarian and a foundation executive
who knew by observation that kids were
learning from television it wasn't a
question of whether they were learning
was a question of what were they
learning and that they in fact could try
to embed some educational content in an
engaging way in the same way advertising
and certain comedy and variety shows
were being produced at the time in a way
to sell letters and numbers which is
where the whole thing came from brought
to you by the letter B now I notice Vice
President Biden over the weekend was at
the gridiron dinner and he mentioned
actually in his talk that he has a new
office in the West Wing and it happens
to be right next to Rahm Emanuel and the
walls are quite paper-thin he said every
morning is like Sesame Street brought to
you by the letter F you know so we stay
relevant in the 21st century we really
addressed this mission of early
childhood education of kids most in need
and you know the show seems probably
something that you're very familiar with
but 40 years ago it was truly
revolutionary the first program to
really have a African American couple as
a role model with young child the first
program to have feature a Hispanic
couple I like to say that Luis and Maria
are the world's longest telenovela still
going on and and they're still around
and I
think gabby is probably now ready for
Social Security herself but we we have a
wonderful legacy that's gone on and the
show really connected different
ethnicities different family structures
big tall yellow Canaries and green
grouches on a common street in which
people could be interdependent and get
along and in fact the show was banned in
the state of Mississippi the first year
because it showed an integrated
neighborhood that was truly a positive
role model it was an experiment that
really worked and we brought together
educators from the Harvard Graduate
School of Education who knew nothing
about television right Louis and the
television producers who probably didn't
know a heck of a lot about education and
at the time this was really a monumental
experiment that you could embed
television for children with educational
content it seems so normal to us now but
at the time it was really revolutionary
and this whole wheel over here which was
called the CTW model at the time for the
children's television workshop combined
this idea formative testing to you know
find out children's needs to try to
adapt some approaches to those and to to
actually write to the plotline on teach
different teaching topics which I'll
show you to go in and produce those
shows and then do a full circle and
evaluate them so that you have
evaluative research from the beginning
it's probably not so dissimilar than a
lot of the work you do here at Google
and I am stuck whoops
so what most people don't know is that
Sesame Street now I'm jumping all over
Sesame Street is you know now in a
hundred and forty countries around the
world and in many of these countries we
are dealing with pretty tough to teach
topics which like HIV and AIDS in South
Africa and what we've done there is what
we have done in in South Africa is to
deal with stigmatization where you have
one in nine kids who are HIV positive
and we're able to create an hiv-positive
Muppet actually named chemie who can
deal with stigma and show kids that you
can be friends with them and play with
them and not necessarily get sick so
this is a really important role model
who's become a UNICEF champion for
children or working in Egypt around
girls education where sixty percent of
the female population is illiterate we
can create a muppet there named Coco who
is a role model who wants to grow up to
be a lawyer a doctor or work at Google
or something but it's someone who is
really a positive role model for young
children and then working in places like
Northern Ireland where we have now built
a program for the first time which can
connect children who are not exposed you
know only ten percent or so of the kids
in Northern Ireland go to so-called
integrated schools between Catholics and
Protestants and what we are able to do
in the privacy of one's own living room
is to use the power of media through
live-action films to show that a
Catholic child and a Protestant child is
probably not that different they both
get up in the morning to get up in the
morning they go to school they go to
school they go to church they go to
church they come home they have dinner
they they do their homework and all of a
sudden when you were exposed to the
other side it's much harder to hate
someone and we know through work at
Queen's University in belfast's that
children as young as three years of age
as it says are showing signs of these
emerging sectarian
attitudes and discriminating against
parties of the other side so through the
power of media we were able to juxtapose
these different ethnic groups and have a
really powerful dynamic that we've just
started there in India which has over
150 million preschoolers we're able to
develop a new show called gali gali Sim
Sim which is a hindi version of of
Sesame Street all of these are really
not driven out of New York they're
driven by local partners who are able to
develop a curriculum and and and are
able to then produce the show in this
case in delhi what you're seeing here is
one of the projects that we've done with
help from the Michael and Susan Dell
foundation who have helped us go into
slums in Mumbai and Delhi and other
cities with the program where kids might
not otherwise be exposed to it and to
show off some of the work that we're
doing through mobile vans and to take
these into crashes like you're seeing
here to drive home local lessons and
important lessons about literacy and
basic education or about health messages
as simple as basic hygiene like washing
your hands and in Bangladesh I love this
picture this is a collaboration with
Save the Children where our local
production system poor is is being
watched here on a mobile viewing
platform which is brought to a village
on a rickshaw so this is really basic
technology coming coming right home and
it doesn't get a lot more basic than
this and you can see the crowds of kids
who have gathered around to watch an
episode of system poor here and I think
it's hard for us sometimes as we live in
this highly technological environment
here in the US to imagine what some of
these things are looking like and I
would suggest that those of you who are
really changing the world through
technology and content continue to think
about applications that are going to be
Mobile in
in distribution and an effectiveness in
reaching kids in these developing
countries who are really in greatest
need that is exactly where Sesame
Workshop is going so in 1969 obviously
it was a television program and you can
see here Bert and Ernie having a good
time that sort of looks like a radio
with a TV in it but anyway it's supposed
to be a TV and now we've expanded really
in what I'd like to call an agnostic way
toward new forms of distribution
including podcasts which we're nearing
now a million downloads a week we've got
the number one preschool podcast in the
in the world in Sesame Street often
featured by your friends down the street
at Apple on their itunes store where
what we've been able to do is over the
40 years in developing new content but
also have a 4 40 year rich history of
some 4,000 plus hours of library
material where you can basically get the
best of Grover the best of cookie
monster or the best of big bird or
divvied up by different subject matters
put into a programming module that we
then distribute through our website at
PBS at Sesame Street org or through
pbskids org and we're hitting about 2.2
million unique users a month between
those two we've got a major VOD platform
with comcast in which we've launched a
channel called sprout which some of you
may may have seen which is getting about
18 million video downloads a month so
what we're seeing here is the use of
television and probably in the world in
which youtube exists this will probably
be a temporary phenomenon but the
download through the cable box right now
it's become an extremely popular way for
moms or dads who come home at six 17 in
the evening and
want to cook dinner and have their
children watch an episode of sesame
street so they've been able to do that
and then we're working in these
different capacities with people like
the V CAST platform at verizon and
others at sprint etc our website is some
really interesting features we've
created something called play safe which
is a bit of a walled garden where
parents can leave their preschoolers and
not worry about wandering and as some of
us have been talking about this
obviously the advantage of having a
preschooler on the web is their their
lack of basic literacy skills makes it a
little hard for them to type into places
that they probably don't belong so this
is a way for them to engage with their
favorite characters in a in a wonderful
way through a very very basic
interaction on on the website and move
around too many of these games that we
have launched on the web all having a
curricular approach whether it's in
literacy or numeracy or what have you
and then of course on YouTube of course
I am not supposed to say this but the
most popular video has been before he
got into trouble Chris Brown did a video
with elmo which I think the last count
on that was about 15 million YouTube
downloads and it has the capability as
you can see this is with Feist who is
also on the show and her video in just a
month or less than a month had almost a
million hits so we're looking at youtube
as you know a phenomenon which has been
able to expand Sesame Street's
educational mission in ways that we
probably could not have imagined prior
to its invention and we now have
estimated four and a half million total
downloads with the podcast and VOD and
cellphone content and the only point I'm
putting these up here is just to show
you that as we
have been traditional media producers in
creating a one-hour television program
we have now been able to follow along
and at least expand our work because the
show is originally built as a magazine
program to have our work appearing on
all of these different platforms which
are mirroring the world in which you
work in every day so that as technology
gets faster smaller and cheaper we're
able to be there wherever people are
with the characters the iconic
characters that they have begun that
they have become to love over the years
so I just want to show you a couple
other applications here this is a those
of you who who are who know something
about early education one of the
greatest gaps right now is around
vocabulary and as we and as the state of
California for instance has now
unfortunately fallen into 48th of 50
states in terms of academic achievement
in its public schools which is an
embarrassment having grown up myself as
a public school kid in California we now
know that high school graduation which
is the greatest indicator of state
staying out of poverty really can get
routed back to fourth grade achievements
and even routed back as young as birth
of a of a mom reading and speaking
rather to a newborn child to begin to
build those literacy capabilities within
that child so a vocabulary gap has now
developed over time in which poor
families as a whole there are literally
thousands of words that economically
disadvantaged households and the kids
who come from them have versus so-called
professional families and what we've
tried to do is use the power of
celebrity and to engage kids calling
creating something new called what's the
word on the
treat and we've got folks like Jack
Black and David Beckham and all these
other stars on the show to promote
different words on the street to
basically give parents a teaching tool
and an inspiration to kind of play with
words and move that thing out there and
then we're proud also to have jumped in
now to try to help second and third
graders especially d promote and give
them literacy skills through the
electric company which some of you may
remember it's big show the 1970s you can
sing the song I'm sure right and we've
got a new cast of terrific young cast
members and then we've gotten a lot of
stars and celebrities to do cameos
including people like Wyclef Jean and
Jimmy Fallon and sean kingston and and
others to come on the show and really
give an homage for instance to the
letter to the silent e at the end of at
the end of a word or finding ways to
drop and slide different letters in
different words to create word
combinations and the electric company
we're really proud of it launched on
KQED and around the country in january
and a weekly basis it will be stripped
every day starting this fall and we're
working we're going to be working in
over two dozen cities across America to
really hone in on making an impact
through after school programs and
through schools themselves to try to get
kids motivated around a love of learning
and I think I've got a little clip from
The Electric Company to show you as we
help kids make this transition from
learning to read which is what the early
years of education are to reading to
learn and we know now that if they're
not if they're not literate by the age
by the third or fourth grade the chances
of them ever catching up and going on to
graduate in high school really fall off
the map and now we know that in Los
Angeles some seventy percent of Hispanic
children not
graduating high school and how in the
world are these kids ever going to
survive in employment possibilities in
health care and energy and the other
areas that are you know potential growth
engines for this country moving forward
so we want to make an impact here and we
think the electric company is one way to
do that it's divided into phonemic
awareness vocabulary issues
comprehension of connected text but most
importantly motivation and how do we get
kids really motivated about learning and
and give teachers an extra set of tools
to really get those kids who might not
otherwise see a connection to to make
that happen the strategy is to produce
this on a broad set of platforms and
this is where I think you know things
like YouTube can come in incredibly
handy as we move from simply a
television program onto these different
platforms where kids can do mashups they
can create their own raps rhymes comic
strips we have outreach activities with
a as I mentioned with the boys and girls
clubs and the urban libraries Council
and others and of course portable media
and console games so we want to use
every technological tool that can
express the the content of the electric
company moving forward here are some of
the guest stars that I mentioned there
they're more Tiki Barber was in the
office the other day who's now an NBC
correspondent on The Today Show and he
just can't do enough for this program
because I think this is a way for a lot
of these stars to give back and to make
a difference in young children's lives
the this is the website which seems to
be growing we're on youtube and itunes
now and we're this 360-degree literacy
experiences is being promoted through a
set of materials which can be downloaded
as well as being given out in print
capabilities through some of the
national
ownerships that you see up on this board
so let's take a quick look at the
electric company get a feel
I'm going to make an eclipse here's the
moon here's here here's the Sun when the
moon crosses between the Earth and the
Sun the moon will make a shadow on the
earth and then it gets dark that message
he kept saying caravan I so if this
sneaky I snuck away
see her it's a wonderful sound it's a
wonderful letter to allows me to get
some gum when you're gone visiting
goblin down the street we are
two
now freeze
now free I hope you're gonna hear a
little of that okay so that gives you a
little idea trust me it's a lot better
with real audio but for 30 friday
afternoon on KQED and i hope kristen we
can have it piped into all of google
tomorrow so let's see what we can do so
we're excited about the electric company
and i just wanted to show you a couple
last things here to give you some idea
of what we're also doing as we move
forward we did a we've done some studies
with mobile learning and part of what we
have been able to do is to use the
mobile phone as a teaching tool to for
instance promote the alphabet as basic
literacy by distributing phones to moms
in certain economically disadvantaged
neighborhoods under the condition that
they would have their children exposed
to a different letter of the day video
through their mobile phone and some
eighty percent of those moms viewed it
as a really helpful way so you can use
these devices really as a way of
carrying new lessons for for education
to to the public and this is an example
of what we were able to do through
letter recognition activities and letter
sound activities as well and we're also
really proud of the new Joan Ganz Cooney
Center at Sesame Workshop which was
started in honor of our founder and the
executive director dr. Michael Levine is
here Michael raise your hand and anti
who works with Michael and we're happy
that thrilled actually that we will be
co hosting an event this October here at
Google to which will bring in educators
and technologists from around the world
to really talk about the power of media
and innovation to drive learning we
probably face the greatest educational
crisis in our lifetimes in this country
as we live in a interconnected world
where kids are going to need new skills
that the schools have just not been able
to build for them up to now so figuring
out a way in which we can get the best
minds of not only Silicon Valley but
people from all over the world to focus
on the use of gaming platforms to grab
the energy that's up at the moscone
center this week and to focus that
energy so we can move from a culture of
Grand Theft Auto to a culture of grand
theft Elmo perhaps we can make a big
difference and we're really really
grateful to to the folks at Google who
have welcomed us here to present that
forum this fall and I hope some of you
can join us for that Michael and his
colleagues have produced several
different studies I don't know if you
have copies of this Michael but it's
available and Anne has them these are
about mobile learning and some of the
innovations and it's really more for the
public to kind of open their eyes as
people tend to look at these
technologies and these instruments as
one or unit dimensional and what we're
trying to do is to expand people's view
and scope of them so that people can
view those as really educational tools
because we know just as the founders of
Sesame Street knew the television was a
huge magnetic attraction for young kids
we know now and any of you who have kids
know that they are more proficient on
use of these devices than then most
adults are and certainly teachers so
some of the challenges we are you know
trying to focus on here are
these that come up in mobile learning
and then we focus on opportunities at
the same time in reaching underserved
kids in improving 21st century social
interactions and extending learning
environments this is a way in which we
can really get these things launched
what we're trying to do at the center is
to move from a research and development
capacity towards a preparation and
actual implementation of a lot of what
we're doing so that we can move to
create a culture where these devices can
be used to promote learning on a much
broader scale and then finally we have a
really special birthday coming up the
40th of Sesame Street is is coming up
and it's hard to believe a November
tenth of 2009 this year we will premiere
on the first show of what we call the
40th experimental season of Sesame
Street and just as many of you here at
Google are working on all these
incredible innovations such as the ones
we just witnessed with Google Earth as
an example we like to think of ourselves
as innovators and experimenters as well
and we we literally view every season as
a new experimental season of what we're
trying to do and we would love just as
dr. Seuss and others were able to do
recently and this is for the marketing
people here um to take a look for the
40th birthday on November 10 2009 how
cool would it be to go to the home page
and see it literally as louis reminding
me the muppets googly eyes as they are I
believe described in the trademark
application so we might either have a
really great lawsuit against you guys or
which we would undoubtedly lose or
better yet we could settle it by having
a fantastic homepage on November 10 2009
and we've just mocked this up as a as
some examples so we hope that Count von
count can count you in and I just want
to close
ohs and thank you for coming today and
happy to answer any questions I want to
close to just show you one final sort of
quick two minute tour of the longest
street in the world and how Sesame
Street is approaching global challenges
and global issues to use the power of
media to help children reach their
highest potential thanks very much it's
not whether children learn from
television is what children learn from
television because everything that
children say on television is teaching
them something these days we take the
power of television for granted but back
in 1968 it took a group of visionaries
to recognize that this power could also
be used for good one of the things we
wanted was to give poor children the
same break that middle-class children
were getting in terms of arriving in
school with some preparation Sesame
Street was called nothing short of a
revolution in children's programming
today we're using the power of media
crank and the power of Muppets in more
than 140 countries partnering with local
educators and artists we are creating
programs that address the real needs of
children all over the world
already more than 5 million South
Africans are hiv-positive a champion ace
is very much a part of every tales
reality we felt that if your progeny and
a save in my picture then you have to to
take it through when we were even that
my monday for me oh she died of AIDS oh
yeah even a three year old or four year
old or five year old needs to have some
recognition or understanding of what
this thing is Jamie we know that we
cannot catch HIV just by being your
friend I have much more fun when I play
with my friend Ronnie excusing
it's pretty clear that there's a need
for preschool education in Bangladesh
because it was very little available so
i guess a little book a ticket is you
just think of the mathematics of what
we're doing 130 million people there's
one television station and has an eighty
percent reach
how can you not found it change the life
the fragile pieces Kosovo is shattered
we really believe that assessment
project could aid in the peace process I
think it would be irresponsible to be
honest not to start trying to do
something with preschool children now in
the realm of building peace and
tolerance even if sesame can't
completely convert them if you like into
into being openly accepting of each
other at least when they grow up to be
parents there'll be more tolerant than
their parents were and the next
generation will have a much better
chance our mission is to give children
everywhere the skills needed to succeed
including the emotional tools to handle
life sport difficult situations we
learned that children were suffering
from sadness confusion and anxiety and
we felt that we could create some
powerful new teaching tools to connect
soldiers and their families today we're
there for military families helping the
nearly three-quarters of a million
preschoolers cope with the challenges of
deployment are you proud of your
manteion guy yeah I'm most proud of and
with mommy and daddy too
and tomorrow tomorrow we'll be doing
whatever we can wherever we can to bring
new hope and opportunity to children
Suzumiya is striving to give every child
the right to read there are two literacy
there are two education that is that is
incredible when our producers travel
around the world they are indeed on a
mission whether they're teaching
tolerance and respect or whether they
are promoting simple lessons of literacy
they truly believe that they can make
the world a better place
you
you
you
thank you thanks Gary thanks for coming
um I didn't expect you but I'm all sort
of welled up in tears from that last
video sure you guys are too this has
been recorded so it will be on go / fish
if you guys want to send any of your
colleagues there we'd love for as many
people to see this as possible and as
Gary mentioned we're going to be hosting
an education forum here in very late
October so stay tuned for more word on
that thanks guys thanks Gary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
