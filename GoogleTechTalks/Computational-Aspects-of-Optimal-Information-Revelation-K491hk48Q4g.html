from USC today you Chang is a PhD
student at western wedding that is
interested with game theory spectral
graph theory and have some really put
the point of these topics today is going
to talk about the information revelation
so I'll just start
don't worry interrupt me at any time and
we'll start with something it's called a
1820 book leading into that game
actually those at the internet from a
from an intern from another intern I
call wheelman so he teaches a pro career
at MIT and one major tournament on yeah
he won't like to read another is overall
but now he decided to pursue a PhD and
so we we internet same summer so this is
a game I learned from him um it's a
simplified poker game there's only
through the only free card ace and King
of Queen Street only three cards back
and it's involved each put one dollar is
a lot they can play bad as empty and
Alice has the option of betting another
dollar or not okay as if she choose the
best and Bob can either colorful we're
going to look at how we will play this
poker game and then I'll tell you why
it's related to everything I want to say
today so what if you're a your Alice and
you hold an ace what would you do so you
know that Bob is either holding a king
or a queen right you would never lose to
a better $1 right dominating to try to
try to win an extra dollar from it right
okay one interesting thing is when what
is what Alice is holding a case what
will that is different when alice is
holding a king bob is either avoiding
Ace or a queen right so Bob would always
call you with eyes and Bob would never
tell you with a queen right because
higher card wins so actually when you're
holding out a king with Alice is holding
a king it doesn't make sense too bad at
all if you only get caught
you're vegan right provide the last part
is what is what it's a live recording a
queen so we know that she watch you
always bed with a she were never better
with kink what about when she's holding
your queen it's a pretend she has DHA
I'm thinking so he will bet with some
commodity depending on the payoff
structure of the game in this game
she will bet with probably 1/3 and
that's hopeless that's the ultimate
playing this game and Bob would call
with the eighth always catching her
Bluff and with a king Bubba was bored
with probably went there to call the
other situation so to take away from
this example one is that if you actually
play poker this will is one will present
example the message is you should
actually bet with your best hands or
worst hands
you bet your best hands for value and
you bet the worst hand to block the ball
when you put a middle hand you should
actually just call it not do anything
the second thing is there are many
aspects of this game that's what you
will see again again through this topic
so one is it's a game without certainty
I'll call the DA presently two people
have private information you know your
own card but you don't know you know
your opponent private information so
three is there's a this is signalling
scheme here right like that by fighting
or not betting and this is revealing
something about Burkhardt - ball this is
the setting that this talk is about this
talk is about what is the best way to
reveal information and specifically
what's the computational complexity of
reveal information this is based on
mostly two papers one you see my Fox
paper and I'm lucky to work with a lot
of people here receive guidance from
many of them and many young minds as
well and let me say this three things
again so we have first we have again
without certainty then the agents have
misaligned incentives so their choices
would depend on the information that
visible to them and you have informed
principle so here we deviate away from
the poker setting you have one party
that knows a lot more information than
everyone else and this print ball is
trying to reveal the information
carefully to reduce a desirable
equilibrium examples like this includes
poker and add options for example Google
knows a lot more about the users and the
bidders and Google is trying to reveal
partial image about that to to the
bidders maximize revenue when you use
Google Maps Google Maps know more about
the classic thing you do but you're
selfish you want to get there as fast as
possible and when you're graduating your
visor writes another with you your visor
knows better about you that the
institution that's trying to hire you so
you're going to can choose to reveal
popular information about you to help
you make it so there these are the two
major ways of influencing the behavior
of other people
one is to designing incentives that's
the field of traditional mechanism
design you promise someone for example
running a second-price option you
promise him if you bit the highest
you're going to get a item and you have
a payment rule saying you only need to
pay the second highest fit so people
will bid honestly because of the way you
design this incentives the other vision
the other way is through influencing
their beliefs and you influence their
behaviour this is what we call an
information structure design and
sometimes the tasks often referred as
signaling your persuasion this is the
optimization problem of how do you
reveal what information to people to get
a desirable outcome and so this talk is
going to cover two basic family of games
that we're out against that there are
some games then towards the end we're
going to see some ongoing work and more
applications so we'll start with network
marketing let's go back to the Google
Maps example again so let me revisit a
three point year one there's uncertainty
that's what everyone you wake up the
congestion of the eCos are going to be
different
- Google knows better than you do three
Google after Google revealed information
to you through these colorful things
you're going to take the shortest path
you just want to get word as fast as
possible it is not a good example
because going right to New York and yes
but a tricky look any further you're
getting funding they're gonna come from
it yes well variance in California is
also much higher than other places but
not high enough what we don't have how
many transportation really you have no
choice right the question of how do you
review information optimally becomes
becomes how do you review information to
minimize the latency of selfish rap so
go through two quick examples and now
then I'm going to show you the proof
outline for this word so one is let's
say you wake up in the morning curtain
for example make sure flips a coin you
either get the network on with that or
the network on the right okay Google
knows which one who was monitoring the
congestion Tigers don't know driver only
know 50-50 so what would Google do in
this case the latency functions are
constant in this case so no matter how
many people take the balancer to be
always going to be zero one in this case
with reveal full information
tell everyone go on the zero Inc and
everybody would be very happy right so
this is very intuitive this this is
usually what happens is more information
induces higher efficiency right but the
second example is slightly a bit
counterintuitive this is a variation of
the famous Brad paradox so if this
middle link has latency zero and it
incentivizes people to take the exact
path so the social optimal way to route
is actually for half of the people to
take top and has to pay bottom they each
incur a latency of 1.5 when when you
build this actual highway in your city
actually it makes everybody's life worse
and they all suffer a latency of - now
think of the middle as as a bridge right
it's a very wide bridge but half of the
time it does
and haven't I missed them when selling
use it as zero people uses a fat pad
when it's up its affinity people will go
back to social tomorrow so if your
Google you know the bridge is up or down
do you want to tell that to the drivers
if you do have the time you're getting a
zigzag so half the time you're getting
two and half of the time you're getting
1.5 that's worse than revealing no
information about this bridge just tell
the users I don't know whether the
bridge is up or down and then that's
enough to deter people away from using
this bridge and half of them with the
top half would do bottom and life is
good for everyone this is the I would
say something that put actually I don't
know like how useful is it and clearly
the Google Maps is very mysterious to me
it does a lot of things but I don't
understand
these days it has this Sigma ETA thing
but sometimes you switch you actually to
be quite different times and I think
back in the old days away it is very
public about this they would send people
to longer paths just to get a better
information on that route because you
don't know it just because you don't
have enough people driving on that route
so you don't know so this sort of
encouraged people to explore the open
about it but along looking at about
Google Maps that I don't know I know I
know one thing is if two people search
the same starting and ending point they
sometimes they get different
recommendations we have two passes of
similar naming successes very excite
right the result here the two radical
results is it's actually NP hard to get
a better approximation then finds of
anarchy and in the worst case what you
should do is just reveal for information
okay we're going to see a sketch of that
roof but we're going sorry what's the
setup the setup is that you choose the
signalling scheme and a.m. you compute
bridge from a distress signal scheme and
you went back for another get swinging
we might depress kaneki you mm reveal
information that is you can choose how
to combine these networks right and once
you reveal information players play
selfishly you compute an ash flow point
in polynomial time and you compute the
latency of that ash flow so you take the
expected latency across your signaling
scheme that is your the quality of your
solution okay and you're comparing to
the video optimal yes this will shopton
will give them to information no sorry
you're comparing to the best signal
algae and yes you're designing a typical
scheme and you're comparing against the
past couple signals so the approximation
ratio is pressed on a key of a
personality
yes if it's comparing to nashville the
national ode of your signaling scheme
and the nash flow of optimal signal
expires doing you're doing a just
lateness your makers latent yes ordering
i'm not a comic it's scary you have any
condition as you can finish lucky test
there's economic or equilibrium and you
can compute it alright so once you once
you decide on the second order scheme
the quality of that fitting on your
scheme is computable is well-defined any
computable environment is it's only you
don't know a valid move or until you
have to tell be using so you have to you
have to choose to tell them something
but remaining no information just means
give them the prior I think because they
have given up their so the construction
this is a sketch of the proof basically
you would construct the graph as a to
copy of your gimmick graph and let's
take the Brad paradox example so I'm
going to construct a graph with two copy
of Brad paradox with a super source and
super sink then let's say I design it in
a way that exactly one of these links
are broken so every day you wake up with
some probability one an exactly one of
the link is down Google knows which one
but the players should know one of them
and what is the optimal signalling
scheme
for this crack this is the optimal world
it is one of the ultimate technology if
you partition your edge into two sets
the red one and the black one and you
only tell the user which set the broken
link belongs to once the user sees you
know for example one of the red link
breaks down then he will take the green
graph which is a social optimal on the
bottom half of the graph you can tune
the probabilities so that this becomes
the network design question essentially
Google Google is facing whether or not
to reveal information about this edge
that decision corresponds to whether you
want to keep this item removed attached
and that problem is at yard it's the
network design problem which kind of
edges you want to remove from a network
that Nash so is the agency of Nash flow
is minimized and that is hard to
approximate better than forward with so
we use that as a black box
that concludes the Google Maps part and
we're going to move on to zero something
questions another is not this is like a
two three pages crew essentially
following this and tuition yes so this
is not a zero-sum game but this is a
normal phone game setting that we focus
on
so then you have a prisoner's dilemma
I'm not going to explain it I'm weather
using the only Nash equilibria in this
game is post player with the fact
unfortunately let's say now you have a
godfather in this game that likes people
to cooperate so the Godfather was uh why
should note that the Godfather just has
a mood today and you Adam you give the
player who cooperates extra theta
dollars depending on the mood of the cal
father this is a uniform number from
either Caesar to 0-2 Punisher encourage
cooperation and if you stare at this
game first thing you can see is whenever
theta is at least one you can compare
the two blue values for example what
there is at least one
not since inside the ferry to cooperate
let's say the principal's not is the
principal well I guess one order if they
cooperate and zero otherwise you are the
principal you know the exact value of
theta players only know what prior
distribution
how would you reveal with it let's try
the two very simple encoding scheme no
information for inspiration when you
reveal no information player is going to
take say that as risk neutral players
are going to take data as a try patient
that's zero they never cooperate when
you read a flow information whenever is
two because it's higher than one they
call free so you get a dollar one-third
of the time we expect to pay off the
principal is one-third I guess I didn't
quite get that
when when theta when theta is it is
uniform to 0-2 I was principal get paid
I think use whatever is only paint them
the no okay so the principal is not
paying them they're playing this game
okay I'm principal have the utility over
their actions on this cake print was
happier with a call for it so when you
say information do you mean the setting
of theta or something else
principal those data I'm probably so
that's the information revealing you can
do how to root LC Atticus okay it also
saying no there's no cause of getting
data and you don't decided it nature
decides it you just learn theta from
nature absolutely that you are you know
say nothing and tell them honestly tell
them what they do is pretty now you can
do better in this case you can tell you
can tell them when it's 0 and 2 you tell
them it's 0 order the winds - to eat
autumn is next that's the signalling
scheme you're going to use and condition
on is being 0 or 2 its expectation is
actually what when that happened
something not be incentivizing is to
cooperate so they can operate a 2/3 at
the time you get W your ties I'm happy
as before they cooperate or not this is
a sort of the game we're going to
okay Don especially the input to the
problem it's a list of normal holdings
and the principal has the option of
treating how to combine them then
receiving the information the player
will do a base update and play an a
spectrum using the expectation of theta
replaced in played a cane and the
principal has certain objectives they
want them to play the game in a certain
way so for this talk we're first going
to restrict it to zero-sum games just to
make everything similarly the Jakob
Ammann extends the general sum as well
so let's say a number of things and the
number of strategies are both ends just
to make things easier to talk about and
the prince was trying to help one of the
player thinks this think of this as
advisors trying to help a student and
students playing a zero-sum games with
the institution the upper bound says
there's a positive on number time
approximation scheme to computer as long
as you acknowledge okay I'm going to
very quickly sketch how do you do this
is a quantum on number time I know here
this problem is in NP because you can
show that or given the signal in TVs and
computers quality society Network
practices because the equilibrium and
there are some cases multiplied and has
a unique
payoff so what happens is I'm going to
draw a simplex and put three essentially
get three different games at the
vertices of this impacts and the blue
region is again in this at this point
averages the three game in a certain way
and the blue region are the region where
the expectations' of theta SS are each
one this is a region if you review a
point about Syria in the blue regions
they're going to collect cooperate the
point the question becomes how many
decomposes prior so that you get a blue
point with highest probability so the
known information scheme corresponds to
reveal the fire revealed X sub red point
so they never cooperate the full
information scheme corresponds to
Freebird always tell them exactly where
it is and you get a blue point one
period of time the optimal signal is
reveal we computed into these two
posteriors it mixes again when they're 0
and 2 so you get a blue point 2/3 of the
time and that's the best thing you can
do so essentially a public signaling
scheme in this seven any mother many
other settings corresponds the problem
of computing a convex hull of this
underlying function okay so now to show
you let's make everything form also mu 1
mu 2 are the posterior and I used I
maybe two of them and the other one I
review you complete information and the
optimal signaling F applied on a
posterior gives the principal payoff
under that posterior
the problem becomes computing a plus
example in your program so the takeaway
from curious if I can promise you the
set of posterior so that you will ever
use then you can solve it in your
program as done with it so to show you
there's a concept point over time
approximation scheme all I need to do is
to show you there's a optimal optimal
signalling scheme that only uses signals
from eponymous I've set the literal
sense what I call a noggin start signals
and these are signals that you take a
log and multiple multi set you can cover
that into a district if you think the
battery Nash this is a very similar to
that so the trick is given as if you on
the skis I use this artery posterior I'm
going to convert it to a signal assume
that when we use your sparse posterior
so what happens is given a posterior it
describes a way of mixing these things
together right for example in the our
example it should happen this is half
spring and mixes the first two games and
that is you can sample from this view
pretending as a distribution and get a
new tilde instead this mu total is log n
plus and you use standard Kelvin and
universe
to say when you simple logon times all
the entries of a mule is going to be
preserved up to epsilon and you know
that at MU is a zero-sum game as well
it's the port interior they were
something so if all entries are within
Epsom
you know the value of that game is with
the nav some of the original thing so
what you do is you take a signal if you
can convert it to another signaling
scheme of roughly the same equality but
now it only uses particles that shows
you can solve ILP and be done with it so
the result that I was more excited about
is this algorithm as simple as it is
it's actually typed for this case so
there's a matching lower bound based on
either plently conjecture or exponential
time hypothesis to show that they
required a pathological time to compute
a signal you see today I'm going to show
you a duction from seismically
conjecture just because easier to follow
and it will some of this is a good one
if you can teach them yes if you assume
it takes two to the N to the order of n
to solve 3sat
then this problem is and you can solve
it yourself I'm a secret heart and a
stronger than the other one we don't
have a topic but people people Jo na
kijiye shredder because the first place
and then you say tentatively on that
including interplanetary conjectures be
used and in a single scientific color or
like partitioning into power by covering
the graph in each one of our views that
elevated are you use the if you start
from the single one but then you reduce
it to partition - I'm not again
unearthing yes so it is a bit inside is
preferable it's just - several so
actually I'm not going to explain the
extra step I'm just going to expand
shadows construction of a key right so
to show that it's hard to reveal
information all you need to do is
construct the instance at heart so this
is a game and we're going to try to try
to construct so it's a security game
theta is a treasure of hiding somewhere
on the graph the principle knows where
exactly cos but the real and column
player only knows as a uniform nerd
autograph right and the real player
wants to be adjacent to theta whenever
it is adjacent to theta he can he
getting one point okay and you know
columns mayor wants to catch either
rover theta so the columns layer has to
hit the exact same node either R or
theta to defend that's the treasure okay
let me state this for money so whenever
there is an edge between say nine are
the row player gets one point and one
point is taken away from him remember
the defender different either played or
me yes so one point for being a distant
and minus one point for a catch either
one knows the support okay
for example if this is a this is the
outcome of the game say that is actually
here a real close your column play here
the real player will get one point
because he is adjacent to theta and none
of them are clock is realized cause but
bro is a treatment center for example
disappear so this is new or something
I'm owning to find real clear to say all
three that there was something turns out
revealing information in this game is a
very hard as hard as time to clean for
the following reason we can we can do a
sanity check over this again the two
very simple signal scheme so the
principal can reveal no information that
is the principal said I don't know where
it is used to your best guess then it's
very hard for their opener to be
adjacent to theta when the gravit is not
super dice right because row row doesn't
know where he is
they don't is a random Snowden in the
breath I'm so that's bad
the other option is you can tell most
players where they notice we reveal for
information about data that's bad too
because the defenders
that column Clarington sit on theta and
always cache the state of nature
so the real player always did something
well it's the Omega zero at what you
would choose something adjacent to theta
but the cons there catches him catches
the nature so so the discipline stay off
is what that against principles pay off
is what his role bears here so he wants
a homeroom okay I went over there
because it's a zero-sum game Social
Welfare doesn't make sense it's always
zero so if you help us okay so okay so
to show the hardness for revealing
information in this setting consider
what happens when you have a complete
mapping diagram and you are the
principal you know where the cursor is
you want to take advantage of the
symmetry than two players payoffs and
what would you reveal here I turns out
what you can do is you can tell which
side is the disaster right which side
theta is on and the row player will
choose a uniformly random node on the
other side of the graph why is this a
good situation for the real fair and
principle because there will always be a
data to each other right it's a complete
bipartite graph and they're both
randomizing over a large set of points
in this click by click is large enough
it's very hard for the contrary castrum
thank you so the payoff when you have
this K by K graph it's actually 1 minus
1 over K very close to 1 so then we're
pretty much done we're then division is
done because actual proof is actually
quite long but the intuition is at least
are good for the principle in real place
so the optimal technology in corresponds
to our partition of the given graph into
a dense sub graph and that problem you
can imagine that you're given a random
graph of G in half embedded a many
creeks in there and you want to
partition
and that's as hard as identifying just
one 20 click and then we're done
so if you know how to do a particular
name you get algorithms that review the
click in a random graph that we don't
know how to do how to be possible okay
so yes so questions wrap up the dorsum
are cool so since they're part I'm going
to reveal tell you something about other
applications in the signaling domain and
some future work when you can privately
reveal information to people you don't
have to announce publicly information
like sometimes the principle becomes
more powerful as you can get hired due
to this better outcome so here is a
breyer on Peters little brain it can
have any any pirate one but it's a
common knowledge
everybody knows the same part it doesn't
have to be uniform but but usually we
it's a saint okay so because you're on
your optimal it has an approximate
anyway you could break your school okay
they don't let it rest on it and then
matter what pride you have all the
friendships can go before the
underground works for all prior is a
lower bound we just uniform so the last
part is essentially just two examples
one is you have a bayesian second part
option so the option here is sounding a
random item it could be one of these
four again bidders don't know which one
it is but the option use exactly which
one is the option here is committed to
run a second plan option after you've
revealed information about this item so
sanity check to signal making if the
option here reveals exactly which items
it is you get zero revenue because once
I bit one every of everybody else is not
interested if it's 0 and you get 0 for
revenue and if you review a notification
tell them his grand imagine they build
up water that's their expected value for
Reza madam and you're going to use a
quarter so what's the best things you
can do here
let's get good half you can you
partition the items into three sets and
you tell them is it's the first two bits
one of the first two or one a blaster
and two of them will be half it would
compete against each other you just have
so then you can ask a question if I have
a more complicated matrix to this one
how can I extract the maximum amount of
gravity so let me denote the F again
this is a posterior so this is no
information posterior this is the
optimal one of the optimal posterior as
masted to principle suited to that case
and second pipe option is simply setting
a mu to the second largest entry of a
times view okay as this is solved by
separately by M X at all and notice
another effect but it was not open that
what is instead of knowing who exactly
my bidders are what is I only know a
distribution of them think of that as I
know the valuation of what other people
but a hundred of them is going to show
up randomly yeah to my options and what
should I be with battery so that
remained open for quite some time and
the we solved it by using the
essentially the same technique of
showing that you only need to use fire
signals and then solve I help you reason
why you need to essentially assemble
this view to preserve the value of this
function to prove to preserve value with
this function you only need to preserve
the largest entry and second larger
century so you can even get away with
not leaving the Union balance instead of
getting your content on room time
algorithms get a patent set and
essentially there's a general framework
behind
of these similar problems when you have
an options baby not if you want to run
to carry out this function we have a
raging river something you care about
this function you choose how to mix the
a is together and you carry the value of
this zero-sum game and you can design
other situations like people are voting
and you can choose what information to
tell them so they don't yes or no if you
want to maximize the number of people
who good yes okay so it turns out
there's an algorithmic framework that
samples the posterior and solve these
all these all of these problems and it's
very nice this turns into a box paper
and that's also quite a few open
problems in this theory ok so the last
example I'm going to talk about today is
what if the principal gets the privilege
of private community communicating with
each player and again we go back to the
Google Maps example I'm going to show
you that there is a case a principle to
do much better well a lot better
compared to is a case where you can only
publicly announcer we're going to look
at a variation of the tegu example this
is example that gives you the price of
Anarchy and cash flow and sort Altima
so in this case the social optimal is
for half of the people to take top half
takes the middle so but in reality
people would all take the top hats and
when we stop this you all compare all
that pass that see the edge program I'm
going to automate this with a path with
congestion affinity and I'm going to
rotate it ok so you wake up in the
morning it's one of these three networks
you don't know which one but Google does
it's ok so the Google can only announce
it something publicly then I claim the
latency is at least one every one for
example Google can reveal for
information tell you which one which
network it is and everybody would take
the X 1/2 and it gets a latency of one
if Google ever tries to mix up two of
these Network and say with them properly
here is the first one with some property
in the second one then what happens
because it's name again has infinity
people are only going to take the only
edge
that's not infinity on either side of
either one of their graphs right so if I
have a public signal analysis every
thing is to everyone then everyone will
take the same path if I ever
if I reveal full information or you buy
other type of Nixon I don't do very well
right effectively I get one which is
what I get and when I really make sure
no information - when I review for
information okay so what the private
industry you can do this I can recommend
different route to different people so
it turns out is very simple you just
signal the total movements is this is
your rat tell half the driver to go top
and half of a driver click off middle
and we're going to see why it's
incentive compatible yeah they say your
driver you receive the recommendation to
take the middle class what did you know
you know it's probably you have you're
on the first graph and we'll probably in
half you're on the second graph that's
all you look you know for sure you're
not on the third back because Google
would not recommend that to you well
that's okay you don't want to give you
because half of the time you're on this
graph and half the time you're on this
graph
if you deviated either to the top link
or the bottom link then with 50% chance
you're going to suffer a latency of
acidity and you don't like that so you
would not you will follow Google's
recommendation essentially the full
revelation scheme here is variation in
the sense of travel a players wouldn't
follow the recommendation and the gap
between public and private signal is
king is forward
that's a maximum you can achieve because
you can always review work so that
concludes my talk today to summarize
we settle the computational complexity
of revealing information optimally in
that we're running games and pages there
are some things and we see a cute
example where private system does better
than all up lick signal schemes
that's it thanks question for the zero
sum games is there just one relation of
optimality or is there a whole bunch of
them yes good question we have a dual
thumb game it's actually just one fixed
efficient because once you fix a signal
each key you can evaluate the quality of
it right you get a bunch of all the
whole numbers so so is the principle
somehow China get them to cooperate that
was one of your examples graceful yes
well it is here is something if you care
all social welfare is always zero so the
example I use you care about little
telltale
okay and that's it a accurate reveal is
taken over there it might be much more
equilibrium but the real player gets the
same payoff is any of these equilibria
ok websites fortified when you have a
general something and it's tricky
because after you reveal the information
there is a general jump game and there
are multiple equilibrium of different
results in the general something let's
say you want to maximize social welfare
the assumption we make is you can
recommend the equilibrium when you send
the signal the thing I tell you it's
either one of these two games and I
recommend you to play a little clip the
player can check that this is actually a
equilibrium and then they can play all
of that that's the optimistic view again
there's a there's robust notion as well
which is how no data together so that's
why in this talk I choose to focus on
there are some things because
equilibrium computation is unique and
canonical producer so for this auction
question yes I got an example I think
that that's relevant to like the Google
setting up or what you get signal so
dare you dare you consider this private
to this public and start about border
speaking felicitous Katie no so that's
that would be because I can't really
think of signalling buyers or exactly
they care about the boss sent extracting
the microphone please come them
differentially signal English right I
don't know um there it is there is a
paper
I think easy last year by best practice
have a temperature palace on if you want
to combine it to a problem design the
Sigma whiskey you can also design what
options you run after that then this
problem is equivalent to the authorizer
option instead of selling a random item
you're actually solving and the
different madhuri two different items
and then it's forty item auction right
okay so that is different from what
you're asking um so I don't know just
open freely is a good person to consider
with it yes well ready it's like you're
both dating a Christian definitely back
yet Christine yes well I'm not sure
would you say that a commitment to
running a second price auction
afterwards is realistic is that is that
completely one in the Y direction you
actually want to do by ourselves but
then I mean we take certain things
here's a second I can sort of relate of
storage because that's what makes
hitched us all the times will contact a
feasible then yes then I would say yeah
I don't know okay but that's very
interesting I don't know what for
example a cute example what we do you
have an example of a distance where
public signalling in the second part
variation second five options does much
worse than privacy exactly yeah and you
need to be clear I mean I'm thinking of
a setting where like the item that come
to meet is the same item right
it's then they people don't know the
features of the item that is like it's
mighty feature item and let's even think
of setting where the value is just
the inner product of the vector you have
expires a vector is a wi4 play right and
then feature is a bullet feature vector
X in a product of WI and exes like VI
value particular is the Pinner
what do you want to do like okay you
know one extreme is just looking who's
the best things for each guy but then to
do some tension there if you said the
way to formulate this problem so that
there is some tension in the problem yes
i know i like when i will also put
restrictions on like I know how this
friend you can be when you are talking
about private signals lately you can't
lie or some things like you can maybe
you get reported 0 when you can't report
a 0 to be 1 for instance and things like
that right
it may be reporter want to be I don't
know but you can't report a 0 to be 1
because that's like saying yes yeah yeah
lot of this is go down you're applying a
repeating the signaling scheme is
something the other parts the players
can verify you leave it as who will you
publish the code of how Google Maps
actually recommend suggestions you don't
have verified accurate so the 0 ones and
examples are lying did it another time
it's not um oh you can okay so it's not
more lying than the block case in the
poker game for example if if you if you
know for sure for some reason
and you're on this grant then you
actually should be did it to that X
right it can be perhaps people all that
have if you know for sure for some
reason this is the same argument as if
you know what your address is holding a
queen if you call it a key but overall
you shouldn't
well you shouldn't always call with the
king handy because sometimes you catch
and it's laughing sometime you suffer
very much you lose money so if there's a
risk neutral they will actually they
don't object it but if there's leakage
and say by knowing I'm on this graph
from some other apps then all bets are
off
um
for your question I know their work that
studies the following setting where
every player can either choose to go to
yes or no we're gonna buy item we're not
buy item and the principal just cares
about not some function say as a modular
function over the number of people who
buy the item a simple example would be I
just care the number my utility is the
number of people vote YES or any other
people who buy it there's a hardness
result if that function is so much so
the best you can do is to signal private
so this is called a I think it won't
date until you see this year but it
results not off yet click on archive and
by shouting from one of his two called a
private patient
purse which convinces come yet privately
the others and then using a new you care
about how many people's per taste idem
yes and then you are motivated to book
it therefore it's a monogram supporters
function and you want to motivate as
many people to buy it as possible and
what is the information structured like
what are you beginning you can you can
tell differences about like I thought
what is when you take the you can not
know but yes what is the information
structure like what are you laying about
them what are you say you're saying
something about this random item right
it's a random item okay the same city is
going there okay answer except instead
of caring about the second highest bid
you care about the number of people who
buy this who choose five is right okay
you can yeah so think of it as there's a
fixed price which means the number of
people who p1 has something yes that's
what we care about like I do maybe
there's only one item Freight yes one
item per to care about that not the sum
of the number of people who pick one
website yes in their telling think about
as I'm trying to sell a software a copy
of some item I actually have unlimited
but the more so I get a diminishing
return function of these
okay so essentially you suffer the one
minus one over you because you can be
running a very complicated correlate
this diplomacy and when you turn that
into independent you suffer this
correlation gap for some other functions
okay and the best you can do is organize
over all the dependent signals basically
for you I'm going to flip recording I
tell you something about the item but
that's not going to be dependent on what
information with your therapy I'm going
to flip different coins but very
dependent if you want to be bad then
this becomes M card just mid by
maximizing someone you learn just looks
pretty cool actually
it is nothing thanks I can send you the
link a bigger okay I will thank very
much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
