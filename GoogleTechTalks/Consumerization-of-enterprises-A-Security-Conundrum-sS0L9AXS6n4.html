consumerization of enterprises a
security conundrum I'm pleased to be
here today to introduce dr. chen zhi
wang who is a principal analyst with
Forrester Research primarily focused on
application and content security as well
as vulnerability management dr. Wang
earned her PhD in computer science from
the University of Virginia and spent
five years as an associate research
professor at Carnegie Mellon University
where she published numerous papers on
distributed systems and network security
she was also instrumental in the
founding of CMU's Scilab after giving up
on the academic life or transitioning
into the business world she was the
chief science officer for ksr which was
a security risk assessment service
provider here in the Bay Area and from
there she moved on to forrester I've had
the pleasure of working with dr. Wang on
several projects and so I'm very pleased
to be up here today to introduce dr.
chen zhi wang Thank You Alan thank you
guys for coming I know it really has
busy days so it's a pleasure to be here
a lot of friends who work at Google's
always fun to come visit so what are we
going to talk about today I'm
consumerization for enterprises is a hot
topic that we often talk to customers
and obviously Google as your company and
the company in the sector will be
interested in this topic as well so I'm
about the sea last year soon after
iPhone came up one of our analysts wrote
a report on how iphone is not ready for
enterprise and as soon as that report
came out his managers spent half a day
on the phone dealing with angry phone
calls from Apple and end a few other
journalists and it was it was a big
bruja at the time he made some really
good points in the in the report such as
seamless integration with enterprise
apps were not there support for calendar
syncs support for central management of
the device from the enterprise
standpoint was not there talked about
central management um remote
troubleshooting
capabilities were not there so some of
these capabilities were fixed in the
second generation iphone and this
analyst although he made a really good
point several good points he also made
one recommendation to IT organizations
do not support iphone that was his
recommendation and it was met with very
mixed reviews I although I agreed with
many of the points he made I disagreed
with his recommendation of do not
support iphone before the very reason
the iphone was in enterprises already
regardless if I T was consenting or not
so as you guys probably everyone here
I'll have an iphone right do you have
the second generation iphone know maybe
maybe you've upgraded the firmware right
okay so the point I brought up this
example is that consumer technologies
are increasingly seeping into
enterprises regardless with the consent
of IT order management we did a survey
about over 100 CIOs I think was late
last year and we asked them about
different web 2.0 technologies and we
asked them why you adopt these
technologies in your enterprise for
business purposes top one reason these
CIOs responded was it improves the
efficiency of their business and several
things in here for instance solves a
problem at our company will get into why
it provides a new platform new computing
vehicle solving problems but increasing
the efficiency of business was the
number one reason these people felt that
these web to point out and
consumerization technologies were useful
so what consumer technologies being
adopted today we are in the business as
Forrester Research we're in the business
for market research so this is what we
track things such as real-time can
nication platforms voice over IP in
unified communication information
sharing platforms not necessarily
real-time communication the last one is
interesting new business-to-business and
business-to-consumer methods things like
widgets and gadgets gives you a new
viral communication from business to
consumers business to customers we'll
get into some examples later we also did
a software survey which we do every year
on this one the Stata came out of about
850 software decision makers and North
America and Europe we asked them what
type of web 2.0 tools and technologies
your applications are you or your
employees are using at work with or
without your explicit support and the
result this is actually a fairly large
scale survey we've done some limited
surveys in limited industry sectors
which the number I she came up much
higher in 20 or 40 percent he is
somewhat smaller but it's a smaller
concerning number of employees actually
using those consumer technologies at
work for work purposes okay we also
asked in the same survey we asked about
different types of technologies people
are adopting today collaboration has
clearly become part of an enterprise
fabric we asked whether you're likely to
implement collaboration as part of your
2008 investment priority and about fifty
percent so you look at this graph the
yellow one is a priority the brown one
is critical the brown ones priority the
yellow ones critical priority are
together it's about fifty percent nearly
fifty percent of businesses we
interviewed say it's a priority for them
to implement collaboration technologies
for business in 2008
right so that is not a trivial number
another point about collaboration people
are building serious applications on top
of collaboration platforms these are not
just to a a team of developers getting
together sharing documents easyjet is
building a crew portal this is about
telling pushing real-time information
onto the porto telling them fly coos
where you're going to go which which
gate your flight is going to take off
what time these are mission critical
applications AMD is building a global
partner sites sharing information about
products about supply chains on
collaboration platform is also a
critical application to their business
XO star is a third-party collaboration
platform vendor and they host
applications for members to share many
many different design documents work a
multi company workflows I recently was
at their conference and I saw some of
the applications being share and I was I
was very surprised people are sharing
airplane design documents and cad on
graphs on top of these open
collaboration platforms and it sits in
the multipack multi to multi
collaboration configuration so i
remember one of the things we talked
earlier is it fosters new business to
business and business 22 customer
channel so think about it for a business
to reach their customers the bear with
incredibly limited today what are the
channels that your bank for instance can
get hold of you your band can send you
email which will probably get filtered
out by spam filter they can send you
snail mail which the return rate is
incredibly low they could do web portal
but how many times everybody's got a web
portal now how many times you go to your
bank's website I go poverty I don't know
twice a month to pay my bills and organ
my account but that's not a lot of time
I spent on their website the businesses
love to get a bigger channel to reach
their customers and some of the web 2.0
tools provide this capability for them
so one of the very nice examples we
found are you guys familiar with the
Random House widgets anybody here know
about them So Random House is a
publication publishing house right so
what they do is they have this either
very interesting use of widgets they
provide the switches for bookstores ok
and it tells you in real time if you
this is desktop widget toting real time
the real time is every day the
best-selling books in your zip code ok
and as a business as a bookstore owner
you can take a look at this every day
and so these are the top 10 books in my
zip code that people are buying and then
this widget as as the graph here has a
link to order books to browse books to
to browse the author's other books on
the hot-selling list so allows the
business owners real-time business
pertinent information they don't have to
go to Random House's website to
proactively poor information and the
department won't do it as often as the
real-time information push this is gives
a new viral distribution channel from
the business to their customers and it's
one of the really nice examples I've
seen as widgets being used for
information distribution they also
random house also has a very extensive
web service back end it's a very
impressive effort to digitize and
indexing their digital content in order
to provide this kind of consumer gadget
based interface this is a an example
from a publishing house to their
customers but think about it you know I
number of years ago I spent you guys
probably won't relate to this but I
spent a summer running from different
stores checking a particular Gucci
handbag that I was interested in
checking out when that particular
handbag is going to go on sale on foot
you know go from different stores I
would love to have a widget a channel
where buy a Porsche the information to
me on my desktop tells me when this
thing's going to go on sale I still
don't have this capability today you
know who's going to give me that I would
love to do that and and I'm just 11 kind
of consumer for a particular kind of
consumer goods there are many many other
examples of this so who's going to
provide this financial services firms I
talk to banks all the time they ever
they have every bank has a little team
of people are looking at these web two
point O technologies and are
investigating how they can capitalize on
this one very obvious one is they can
reach the customers in a more real-time
fashion and by using widgets or gadgets
that for instance may be embedded onto
igoogle okay or embed it on to facebook
to display account balance for instance
or perhaps the last five transactions
happened on my account our stock trading
alerts or an end they could buy display
this information also display
potentially a new financial services
offering so that is the marketing
channel that it can get to you so
perhaps when i log on to my igoogle no
this is olivia mountain view very close
to here so perhaps instead of seeing
that regular information I could see my
account balance here these are obviously
fictitious accounts but you know all
maybe there's a logging a wager that
we're logging first so but I could see
these informations right away and since
I go to iGoogle every day I'm already
there the business can get hold of this
real estate taps so essentially what
happens is the enterprise will have some
kind of proprietary data sitting in
their database and now it's being pulled
onto a web services front end which then
gets pushed onto different consumer
technologies such as iphone such as
rigid such RSS that can then channel out
to customers and these can be business
customers can be consumers so the this
channel can foster new businesses Pat
perhaps new social structures however
organizations also very wary of web 2.0
and consumers technologies being adopted
for business purposes and they tell us
the number one concern is security fear
of losing control and also they are some
for some applications or I is not
essentially clear however your employees
are increasingly asking about that
customers are increasing asking about in
the business case is starting to build
very compelling if you think about the
Random House example it's a very
compelling business case so enterprise
IT is basically pressure from both sides
ones from employee and customers and
potentially from the marketing
department the other ones from the
regulations of management wants control
so those two sides fundamentally in in
conflict the conflict arise from
security and controls a top of mind for
management and for enterprise computing
so think about enterprise apps so are
you guys what what groups are you guys
from I'm sorry enterprise so so you
probably familiar with you can probably
answer this question so if if you go to
sell and enterprise application what are
the top four things that people ask for
come on yes yes control of data
enterprises one control you know and I
want to control to you as a consumer I
want control my own dear but as an
enterprise the control issues even more
paramount so typically you want policy
enforcement in a centralized man in a
scalable manner right you don't want for
every application for every system you
have to go and configure the policy you
really want to do so in a centralized
manner scalable auditable repeatable
methods and you want to maintain control
exactly that gentleman said maintain
control over information data it has to
be kept private some datas have to be
kept confidential private and others
have to have proper access control
capable capabilities associate with it
and auditing who is accessing what data
compliance know you guys probably don't
hear about compliance a lot but I deal
with that every day because that's what
the management of companies deal with
maintain obtain visibility of activities
so many of the consumer tools today
don't offer you this because consumer to
tools at the core is designed to be
convenient flexible personable and give
you efficient interactions to do
whatever you you want to do not to give
the other side control so that is in
fundamental conflict so that is why this
is what I'm seeing when I log on to my
facebook this is my actual facebook page
and this is what I'm seeing when I'm at
work see the difference between the two
experience it's huge why do I have to
deal with this every day because that's
where the my enterprise my corporate is
using okay the experience gap though my
prediction is it will disappear it would
not happen tomorrow there's no reason
that I have to deal with this
barrett user interfaces and disparate
experiences going to use my consumer
applications versus my enterprise
applications the consumerization again
going back to the topic is definitely
happening why it will continue to happen
enterprises will benefit from the
collaboration and the increase of
productivity users will benefit from
convergence of knowledge technology and
in action methods so that's why this
trend will continue so perhaps meet the
future me well perhaps I should use a
older picture but that's that's what I
have in fact this may be a slightly
younger picture anyway so so I work with
a team of people that located around the
globe it's not like my team's actually
there I do have a distributed team but I
just picked a few places that I actually
like to go visit so these are my
distributed team members okay the way I
do business my team has a project blog
okay and each member of my team would
subscribe to this blog via is RSS so
information will get pushed out to us
our external partners our customers will
subscribe to our site via RSS and they
get to see limited information our team
meeting is conducted via web
conferencing and it's saved as a podcast
so my team member in Australia in Asia
can wake up and listen to it later they
don't have to be there in real time and
they can subscribe to the podcast
because using RSS as well our team blog
is potentially linked to Wikipedia and
every time a new document we write lots
of documents come up
are the terms that can be locked up
using Wikipedia right there I can
synchronize my calendar with remote
colleagues and my partners and customers
using my iPhone or use the office
communication service that we have all
these technologies available today we're
not doing business this way I'm
certainly not talking to my colleagues
in Australia via RSS and web
conferencing maybe but in a very ad hoc
manner there is no platform support for
this type of interaction so these are
the tools that the future Chancey will
be using instead of Outlook instead of
the archaic locking Zeebo interface that
I showed you earlier so when i log onto
igoogle for instance again instead of
seeing the bank balance which I took it
off for for for space reasons I may see
my corporate calendar okay maybe it's
one calendar that they use for my
corporate activities as well as personal
activities I may have a link to the team
blog birss and will show me that the
tunnel into the corporate cibo database
all this is doable today and obviously
we're not doing it but who else is doing
it or how soon will we actually see this
sort of thing happened my other portal
to both business applications and
personal and consumer applications is
this maybe not i Google maybe not
Facebook maybe this or maybe all three
of them so what we need to make that
vision happen what do we need is
personalized secure data delivery from
second corporate databases applications
whatever content living my corporate
network through some kind of
infrastructure that does unified of
occasion authorization and content
delivery using a personalized secure
mechanism that delivers on to whatever
application I'm using today maybe it's
Facebook maybe it's iphone maybe it's I
google maybe it's whatever Chad
information i'm using okay so this seems
to me is a vision that we could get
there pretty fast pretty soon however
perhaps okay so let me back up this is
what I think should happen perhaps this
should happen in slightly more complex
way or slightly more interesting way I
am they're using my consumer
technologies I contact a server
potentially a server that I go to an
iGoogle server or a facebook server and
I said using it using a an understood
language I want to access my enterprise
application and this I Google server
then contacts my corporate server which
they engage in in exchange they
understand each other's language and
this guy this is corporately this server
I will server will then contact some
other server to understand for instance
my stored are tagging and bookmarking
information and understand how I want
the content to be delivered okay and
that will pull information from the
backend database using the tagging and
using the bookmark information it has
acquired about me to real-time deliver
the information in the way that I would
appreciate and I will want to use
Pop's this is what should happen in your
questions so far yes no this is crap oh
this is this is pretty good oh this is a
wave already thought about this yeah yes
yes
yeah I I intentionally left it kind of
vague for the reason that I didn't want
to point to a specific set of
applications that are more amendable for
this in theory you can do this for
anything okay anything that can speak to
a web services language that you could
offer this type of data delivery now
today a lot of enterprise applications
have web front-ends so you can you can
do go to a web portal but I really don't
want to confuse this with the web
enabled sap for instance what I want to
say is this is let's just say a generic
enterprise application it could be web
enabled or maybe it's not what we want
to do is pull out the information in a
way that can be easily merged into a
consumer application to allow users or
customers to consume it okay so how far
are we to this vision to things that a
consumer using the browser based
technology or maybe other consumer
technologies to access any type of
information in a universal in a
consistent way without having to say
this is my enterprise application this
is my consumer application we will
really get there if this kind of thing
keeps happening anybody recognize this
particular incident I kind of I
apologize for the blur pneus of the the
text here this is an attack happened on
a an actual Italian banks website this
Bank this is the user login screen and
this bank's web site was compromised
oh sorry attackers exploited a
cross-site scripting error and was able
to inject an invisible iframe onto the
top of the login screen so to the users
of this website there's no visual cue
that things have changed but once they
type in their their password and use ID
that I iframe captures this information
and sense to a server in Taiwan and this
attack was went on for several months
and nobody actually knew it was ongoing
until one of the mobile users of the
bank was using mobile the mobile web to
access this website and because i framed
that the attack injected didn't
automatically resize itself for the
mobile platform the user actually saw
some frames were misaligned so this user
called into the bank and say hey you
know some the interface looks weird on
my phone what's going on because of that
complain the bank went to investigate
the application discover this injected
iframe so why do I bring up this this is
a web two point website which was was
subjected to a an attack and we're
seeing more and more this happening
because consumer technologies or if you
could call them consumer technologies or
web 2.0 technologies are being adopted
without proper consideration for
security in enterprises and the vision I
just presented will not happen if this
continues to occur and in fact we're
seeing in the last year we're seeing
more and more legitimate websites
participate in malware distribution and
even Google's own research points to
that as well so that is a discouraging
trend we also won't get there this
continues this came out of google's
research report which was published in
February this year this lists a faction
of search queries that actually resulted
in at least one malicious urls and the
time frames between March 2072 februari
2008 in march two thousand seven as you
can see 0.3% of queries resulted in at
least one malicious URL and that number
has increased to one point three percent
by februari 2008 I don't know what the
number it is today but I would be very
surprised if it's if it didn't increase
further so we won't get there if this
continue to happen we also won't get
there if this trend continue to happen
this is the normalized growth of malware
that's reported by three different
vendors from two thousand five to two
thousand seven okay and you can see a
huge increase from year to year to over
one hundred percent growth well from all
three of these vendors in fact if we
take semantics which is one of them not
so huge increased numbers semantic
reporting in 2007 every day they
discovered over 1900 new malware
instances that's a lot of malware to
deal with okay and it's not an easy
problem to solve so we would not get
there if malware or web two point O
enabled malware continue to happen so to
make the vision happen what do we need
I'm not going to go go on to the slides
without some interaction here so so give
me some give me some little bit of idea
of what we should I don't know if you
guys the security people or you guys
enterprise add people but I know at
least one security people here so I'm
going to ask some questions so what do
you think we need
to make this vision happen Adam Oh trust
in the system more specifically what do
you mean so Adam said one of the things
come down to is we need identity and
verification of information where things
come from who's accessing information
he's absolutely right so to make the
vision happen we need quite a number of
things a row of duck we have ducks we
have to line in place so he pointed out
we need identity management okay we need
to know who is doing what in a way that
is beyond traditional identity
management inside of your enterprise so
I don't imagine beyond simple corporate
boundaries what does that mean that
means today's term we need what they
call federated identities and single
sign-on okay anybody who knows what that
what those two means some some people do
right do you know how well federated
identities that concept is adopted by
the market what it's not very well what
poorly exactly it's poorly now the
concept itself is a useful concept it
basically says let's agree on a set of
languages so that I can give you an
identity from my corporate directory and
you can recognize and you can give you
can give it a set of lights right so but
it's not being adopted widely because
the the set of languages we haven't
agree on the set of language that's very
effective for us to communicate
information across corporate boundaries
so perhaps identity in tomorrow's on
this vision is an on-demand evaluation
okay and let's get a little bit more
specific here ultimate advantage means
identity materials define what the
identity materials mean perhaps its user
ID password but i would guess that's
would not be enough perhaps it's a key
material that you possess in a smart
card combined with some temple
characters time of the day your previous
transactions your previous knowledge of
what you do where you are GPS
information remember the iphone
corporate information perhaps is
available on demand based on your
identity materials we may be poor we may
be able to pull some corporate
information from you for from your
corporate server all these no I I only
listen to four categories maybe they're
more now visit more informations that
you can use um in real time to arrive to
an identity assessment that will allow
you to define brain access control to
enterprise information yeah so the
question is he said I don't see how this
can solve what the Italian banks for me
exactly exactly um he is right so he
said he doesn't see how this can solved
Italian banks problem he's right the
Italian banks problem is due to a poorly
coded program okay so because the
program the web application has a
cross-site scripting arrows so this is
what we need is only the first screen of
what we need okay there are a few others
down that you're getting ahead of me
sure sure sure
one side
but so so this gentleman point out that
the ineffectiveness of single sign on a
single sign-on if your identities is
compromised on one site it could be
compromised in many different sites
that's why I'm the slide I listed today
identity management beyond your
corporate boundary means federated
identity in single sign-on so that's
today but tomorrow perhaps identity is
evaluated on demand okay it's not
limited to just single sign-on and
federated identity rather it's whatever
the application demands how I need to
value you as an identity as somebody
who's accessing my information right now
okay it could be a single sign-on kind
of configuration it all it could be you
know I may have intelligence that the
single sign-on identity could be
compromised at some point in the past I
will want to engage in an extra
challenge and response session to get
more confidence in order to serve you
the application data ok and you exactly
right the single sign-on itself doesn't
solve the problem yes
you
I
right right right yes exactly so the
comment is that consumer market moves
very fast but the the example that we
use federated identity this whole market
moves really slow people have been
trying to do it for about 10 years now
and still hasn't gotten any way and he's
exactly right because that means that
the the federate identity was because
log of different standards were in
conflict and everybody wants to get in
on to identify the standards this is not
going to work if we're going to continue
on the consumerization trend so that's
why the on-demand evaluation where you
can get pieces of information from
existing info structure and arrive to a
real-time decision based on these
existing infrastructure information
could potentially work okay now let me
just run through how i am i doing on
time 15 minutes i just went through some
of the other high-level things we need
we need identity management in a
fine-grained in a on demand fashion and
on-demand fashion means what potentially
is identity in the cloud okay it's some
clouds in the cloud provider can give
you confidence and trust of a particular
consumer a clients identity hey how that
is exactly going to happen it's not yet
clear but but i'm putting out that
vision we also need content governance
okay what does content governance mean
eighty percent of corporate content
today is about his own and structured
okay as opposed to structure living in
database content is free to move about
different channels such as web email i
am and in all these consumer
communication channels that we talked
about that leads to different email our
bound threats that really are you if you
don't have a good way to deal with those
forget about consumerization right you
are host already this is why you need to
corporate content policies for each of
these communication channel now in the
web two point O enabled world these
communication channels even more dynamic
so you need to have policy for each
channel and you need to be confident
that those policies are enforced and for
instance Postini provides all sorts to
email security services and if I in fact
Forrester isn't a customer of postini a
Google and we need to be confident that
our corporate content policy is enforced
by posting and this is what i mean by
content governance okay now one of the
biggest things about working with for
instance in the cloud provider of these
content services is to define using
their in the face to define policies
because everybody's palace is different
and I advise corporate corporations all
the time and how to define policies that
you can you can actually articulate to
their service providers a little bit
more about content governance you need
policies to govern the entire lifecycle
of content generation we run the blog
site okay and your corporate users or
your customers are contributing content
to the blog who can contribute what
content do you even have a policy do you
have a way to monitor and enforce that
policy when you know when can they
contribute content is that a concern or
what source of the information came from
is that a concern generation of content
usage of content access modify deletion
retention of content archiving because
of compliance needs because of whatever
policy how long you have to archive who
can access is integrity of content
archive and finally retirement right so
this is an entire lifecycle of content
and you need
consider this in this life cycle view
and you need to have policies for each
cycle each stage of the life cycle so in
fact we are converging on this vision
that that that I've been talking at
different venues is the web two point oh
security for centers of gravity okay we
talked about identity management at the
high level yes yes this is actually the
question is this slide is this specific
to content archiving or is this specific
is this for content in general this is
actually for content in general ok so
for content that does not need to be
archived you simply the retention policy
is no I don't need to retain it okay so
but you still have to examine it from
the full lifecycle view just to give you
a framework to consider your policies so
the four centers of gravity is what I
put the security issues under okay one
of them content governance is we talked
about and we talked about identity
management I'm going to skip client
security today because that's more of a
corporate management piece we are more
talking about consumer technologies and
and the next thing we're going to
discuss his application security but
before I do that let me go back to that
gentleman's question earlier comment he
said we talked about identity management
that's not going to solve the italian
bank problem right what was all the
italian bank problem of these three
different centers which one which
security center of gravity would solve
the italian bank pub
application security yes see set it up
so this is the last center of gravity
we're going to go through um so just to
give you a little bit of context I put
some data from the National
vulnerability database and these are the
top for vulnerabilities in the second
quarter of third quarter of 07 so the
top reported vulnerabilities cross-site
scripting second activex in all four of
them are application level
vulnerabilities so if you look at
vulnerability historical data on in the
90s all about OS vulnerabilities and
platform level vulnerabilities now it's
about web application vulnerabilities in
fact about sixty seven percent of all
vulnerabilities disclosed in 2007 has
something to do with web applications
okay so that's why the italian bank
attack happened because there's a
cross-site scripting error so using web
two point x and consumer technology is
ass bates the risk factor because
developing applications and then
probably most of you develop code secure
ajax flash rest code is just difficult
to do secure testing is more difficult
because asynchronous nature and
multithreading nature so as security
still complex we don't yet have a good
grasp on web services security no there
people have been talking about
researching about it for a long time
there's still not a good way to deal
with so a security there's no reliable
way to understand third-party components
no xml gateways does not have not
deliver the promise that is supposed to
deliver which content screening is
extent expensive and not reliable so if
i download a quicktime movie and has a a
children in it eighty-four sometime
today I would not discover unless that
children is well known
the signatures or they've been
discovered so for application secure at
the very high level if you develop your
own application this is the picture you
should keep in mind in design
development you should do threat
modeling design review and static
analysis of your code a static analysis
for code vulnerabilities incredibly
important because 75% of vulnerabilities
arise during development rather than
other phases and doing QA testing you
should do black box testing pen testing
and security testing of your code and it
doesn't end there a lot of people talk
about development life cycle ends at the
end of release during deployment during
the live production of the application
you have to continue to do pen testing
of the code and potentially using web
web application firewall to provide you
real-time protection so some information
resources for application security some
from our firm some from others actually
open group is working on a secure
enterprise 2 point 0 working group which
is exactly talking about standards that
the community should develop for
enterprises to adopt consumer
technologies and vendors like Google
should consider joining this type of
working group because this all
user-oriented and users can tell you
what they want in terms of standards and
working no working platforms so recap
what it means for consumer facing
service providers like you guys what it
means the consumerization trend should
consider adopt open standard interfaces
will attract content providers and give
them control of application data
provisioning provide them with service
and activity visibility right and give
them the capabilities to define control
policy that's very important is you have
a language so that they can say this is
my corporate control policy and this can
be enforced by you but has to be a way
for them to define that policy and if
you can seamless integration with
corporate web services will be plus
again I I put this in because this is
one thing that I think the service
providers like yourself like Yahoo like
other companies should consider talking
to what it means for content providers
new viral channels new marketing new
revenue opportunities they should
decouple back end applications from the
web services front end to give a little
bit compartmentalization for security
purposes and adopt open standards for
web services to talk to the service
provider like yourself work with you
guys getting appropriate authentication
authorization controls and articulate
policies to service providers what it
means to IT staff this is something that
you guys may not care but a lot of my
customers do just read the rate content
governance application security we
talked about and invest in identity
management beyond Federation so this is
basically recaps what we talked about so
far just one more thing before we leave
we put CIOs and ask them if they're more
or less likely to adopt web two point
our consumer technologies if they come
in the suite rather than point products
okay overwhelmingly seventy-four percent
says we're more likely to adopt them if
they come in the suite so what that mean
what does that mean for security
professionals if the consumer technology
is going to converge
sweet of consumer technologies that
means potentially protection technology
will converge as well so you should
focus on protection stacks not
individual protection tools so with that
I conclude my presentation thank you and
do we have time for a question or two
what question yes
Yeah right so great so the question is
from the consumer standpoint consumer
goes to google for search go to a
facebook for you know social networking
and they have a set sights to go to AA
this the cio standpoint the cio says
we're going to adopt on consumerization
tools if they come in a suite so I think
what we talking about consumer consumer
tools are slightly different so there's
consumer interface experiences such as
going to google for search going to
facebook for social networking but there
are other tools consumer also use right
others who such as my phone right and
other tools such as i do i am and not
necessarily a google chat I may have AOL
right on my desktop all these tools are
considered under the consumerization the
consumer technology umbrella right
basically what the CIO is saying is that
are more likely to endorse these
technologies or these different services
being adopted in my enterprise if I
don't have to individually manage them
okay if they come in to see if they're
just giving exactly from AOL and and
Facebook is one sweet to let's say okay
sure I don't have to manage them
individually and more likely to have
them all together then then separately
so that's that's not a surprise to you
right so that's not in conflict with
what the consumers are saying okay
you have a question so very sort of rich
and fulfilling vision but yet there's a
very significant challenges ahead since
some of those challenges and will be a
you know four to five year thing or is
it going to be a 10 to 20-year thing Oh
the question is is this vision going to
be a 4 to 5-year thing or 10 to 20 years
thing it's definitely not 10 to 20 years
hopefully it's not even a four to five
years thing right so I gave you some
examples of companies already starting
to build serious applications on top of
collaboration technologies and it's
debatable whether you say collaboration
is definitely consumer to or not these
companies are not alone so we know
companies are building widgets and
gadgets like like a random house is for
serious business purposes and a lot of
companies are either on board with the
idea or they're investigating it very
proactively ok so my my vision is 18
month we're going to get to probably
three quarter of that vision ok and
perhaps no two years on we'll get to
ninety percent there but we're not going
to get there unless the security and
control issues are solved in the the
cios minds all right we don't have other
questions we can conclude
all right thank you guys very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
