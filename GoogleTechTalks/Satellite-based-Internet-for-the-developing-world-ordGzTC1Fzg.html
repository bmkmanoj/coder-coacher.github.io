the power of the Internet to the
developing roller Africa my pleasure to
introduce professor Thomas sue bukan and
some of his students from the space
mission analysis design class at the
University of Michigan and Thomas is the
director of entrepreneurial studies at
the college of engineering for
University Michigan as well as a
professor in the atmospheric and oceanic
space sciences department Thomas thanks
Ryan what we're really excited to be
here of course many of you come from
Michigan some of our best students are
here and also including Ryan and his
colleagues but also i'm excited to talk
about this project because we did this
with collaborators collaborators from
from this company and what I'd like to
talk to you is a vision and a vision
that has to do with addressing a major
need and that has to do with bringing
Internet to the world if you look at the
internet that distribution you're aware
of these plots of course you see that
it's very uneven you have areas that are
covered very high you have areas that
are there in a purple but you have one
area that's really glaringly obviously
read here and that's Africa pretty much
the entire continent of Africa is in in
the red on this on the average of course
of about seven billion inhabitants
roughly one in seven have basic access
to internet even though much of that
access is not as as good as we are used
to using and of course what we want to
talk about is not just because of the
technical aspect of internet but what we
want to talk about is the impact us
internet has and there's amples case
studies you bring internet to the people
it empowers them and what you have for
example is this case study in Zambia
where internet was introduced to an
organization link net a service focused
on rural Zambia and makka rural farming
village where a cornice a primary crop
really got transformed by that this
local farmer
turned around about son a flower farming
via the internet and just one year later
he employs 10 full-time workers you know
that's what happens to information on
this information gets to the right
people life's change another example out
of India eco Paul is a distribution of
internet kiosks that provide market
information cut out the middleman and
really provide a direct information
about pricing of agricultural services
and farming strategies all the way to
the farmer affecting thousands and
thousands of people and really changing
their lives directly so we're convinced
that if we show up with internet if if
internet is provided in Africa important
things are going to happen across the
entire continent the way we did this and
what are you going to see is a
presentation that really is due to a lot
of people something like 25 of them all
of them have different backgrounds some
of them more on the computer science
side some of them more on the aerospace
engineering site but really what we're
trying to look at is that internet
solution as a systems problem with a lot
of interactions with industry contacts
both in space type systems which of
course is one part of it but also in of
distributors on the ground so what
you're going to see is a number of
people talking about this and it's not
going to be me and in fact i'm going to
call up Joe Norman right away who is
actually managed to stop processing a
second half of the one ear project we
did so Joan coming up
so as Thomas said um you know we feel
this is a global problem so we as a
space systems design class wanna see how
can we answer this from a space aspect
so throughout this entire year we took
two approaches the first being a global
approach and in that we used a low-earth
orbit to answer that question so
basically a low-earth orbit means you're
not very high up just about you know two
to four hundred kilometers out probably
more around 400 you're moving very
quickly you can orbit the Earth in a low
Earth orbit in about an hour and a half
so what that means is if you want to
have continuous coverage of the globe
from that high up you need to have a lot
of satellites this picture here just
shows you know this I believe is the
Iridium constellation of how many they
required to have global coverage so that
was that was pretty complex so we took a
step back and we said all right what if
we have a focus region what type of
space solution would answer that so we
looked into the second half of the
semester we did a geostationary orbit
which means you're much further away
you're moving much slower you're
actually moving with the rotation of the
earth so you see one point on the
surface of the earth at all times so
literally it takes you 24 hours to orbit
the Earth one full day so in doing this
we basically saw that a global solution
is just too expensive more specifically
this was our design from last semester
we had some pretty stringent coverage
requirements which drove this the
complexity of the system but we required
around third excuse me 90 low-earth
orbiting satellites we had about 80,000
ground stations as you can see in this
picture there were four different types
of ground stations that were required in
order to distribute this data correctly
and you know it's it's clearly very
complex it was very costly about 2.4
billion dollars so while it was
technically feasible we found from a
business standpoint this just was not a
feasible approach so we took a step back
and maintaining the vision that you know
we want a system that can be distributed
in mass to small villages and tribes
throughout the world who are those
people and in who needs that
connectivity the most
right now ground infrastructure is being
implemented all throughout the globe but
that obviously takes a lot of time so as
you can see in this plot here Africa is
is the clear choice only five percent of
its population has access to the
Internet as opposed to seventy percent
of the population in North America that
does looking a little more closely into
that as of 2006 the total African
continent the bandwidth that was
available there was 28 gigabits per
second now taking that down what does
that mean for everyday users so the
average University on the continent of
Africa has the same bandwidth as an
American household yet it costs 50 times
more to have that connectivity all the
users in New York City equal more than
the entire continent of Africa so that's
pretty startling if you look in this
figure here these red lines focus around
the coastal areas represent the fiber
optic network that is currently being
implemented across the continent and
planned so we see from this that it you
know it's only focused on the the
coastal areas which means it's being
focused on the university's the highly
populated areas the urban regions if you
also look on this plot these green areas
this is a population density plot so you
can see these green areas represent the
rural population of Africa and they
clearly are not being addressed today
and are not going to be dressed in the
future as this also includes the planned
fiber optic lines so that to us drove
home that we really want to focus on
servicing these rural users and that's
just what we did this is the design for
our system this semester it consists of
a geostationary satellite as I talked
about earlier it has about 40 1600 user
stations that will be on the continent
of Africa and four hub stations that
will be placed off continent so they
will have access to fiber capacity as
drew will talk about now the way this
works is this hub station is connected
to the Internet backbone transmits that
signal up to the satellite and then the
satellite relays that back down to the
user stations in Africa so they have
connectivity to the internet will be
deploying this in a couple of phases as
it says here we will
Julie service these areas via existing
satellites over Africa so we don't have
to wait for you know a geostationary
satellite to be built since that takes
quite some time now throughout this
presentation we have some highlights
that we continue to focus on the system
is very low cost it's amenable today
it's very low risk and its support very
easy to deploy now its low cost and that
we minimize the cost of the user station
and that the Africans can actually buy
these user stations you know something
like by obtaining a microloan and then
spurring a business from that we have a
low upfront investment with our phase
deployment as I go into in a little bit
it's enfamil today and that we're using
existing technology no huge improvements
need to happen for the system to work
and and that goes along with it being
low risk as well and then it's very easy
to deploy we wanted to make sure you
know these people in the middle of the
desert or the rain forest they they
don't have connection to power so we
actually have our own power system that
is incorporated with our user stations
so you can put these you know in the
middle of the desert and it will run and
work well and they're very easy to set
up so that you don't have to have
technologically savvy people there to
set these up for you this is quickly
just our face appointment I'll go into a
little detail later but we will begin
with leasing capacity from existing
satellite then we'll deploy six pilot
programs which we'll talk about in one
minute and then make the decision to
actually build our own geostationary
satellite from that phase two will
commence with the launching of that
satellite and then depending on you know
user adoption rates etc possibly
launching a second satellite now why do
we want to have pilot programs if you
look at this figure right here this is
usually commonly used to describe user
adoption rates of businesses so we have
the early adopters in the beginning like
many of the people in this room are and
then we have the mainstream market but
you'll notice the gap here or the chasm
as many people refer to it so all
businesses are required across this
chasm in order for them to be very
successful so these pilot programs will
allow us to understand
and and better characterize the user
adoption rates what drives them what the
user needs are and then also gain
support of non-governmental
organizations that will help us cross
this chasm a little more specifically
these are six locations that we suggest
Ethiopia Kenya and Niger Senegal South
Africa and Tanzania as you can see
they're spread throughout the continent
and these three categories are something
we focused on their power source their
literacy rate and the GDP as we feel
that varying these three things will
allow us to understand exactly what
drives it user adoption rate if it is
just one looking a little closer we see
that you know this city in South Africa
is pretty dense whereas in Kenya we have
a more widespread region so this will
just also help us to understand the
impacts of the demographics on adoption
etc so now that you have a great idea of
overall view of how our system works I'm
going to pass it off to Kelly Moran
who's going to talk to you about the
satellite portion of our system and how
we're addressing that all right great
thanks Joan so for our mission the
geostationary satellites are really the
baseline for implementable internet
access in Africa now to develop such a
system to service Africa we looked into
the current market in the different
areas to decide where we should enter so
throughout this segment I will discuss
our marketing analysis and the trades
based on leasing capacity off of
currently existing assets versus
contracting to build and operate another
satellite I will also discuss our
proposed plan and implementation which
involves company collaboration along
with our two phase deployment strategy
so again here's a quick look at our
system architecture as Joan just
discussed we have our geostationary
satellite which again is able to
maintain its positioning over Africa and
again and is communicating to the ground
system so initially we will provide our
services through currently operating
satellites and once we reach phase two
we will launch up to two satellites to
achieve full capacity
so now in order to develop such an
architecture we looked at the current
market in basically the different areas
this is an example of the satellite
internet value chain and here we have
three main areas first we have the
satellite manufacturers than the
operators and of course the Internet
service providers otherwise known as
ISPs now first we look at the
manufacturers they of course build and
launch the physical satellites based on
the given requirements next we have the
satellite operators now they purchase
the manufacturers satellite and now they
have the rights to the capacity aboard
the satellite so now they can either
provide the services themselves or they
can lease the capacity to an ISP next we
have ISPs which for example i'm sure
many of you know of america online we
really don't want to end up like America
Online this is just an example so an ISP
of course purchases the capacity from
the satellite operators and then they
sell this service to its end users so
now we've looked at the different areas
we ask ourselves what is the most
cost-effective and low-risk approach so
first we look into ISPs now what's
beneficial about becoming an ISP is that
of course the capacity is available now
we could immediately launch this system
by leasing capacity off of the available
satellites also this is very efficient
use of the capacity aboard a satellite
we won't have excess capacity say by
launching a satellite right off the bat
where we might not use all this capacity
so the capacity that we purchase we will
use olive now on the other hands however
this capacity is very limited in many
areas and also it's very very expensive
for an entire mission this would result
in a cost on the order of billions of
dollars so this is not a cost-effective
approach of course for providing service
for our entire mission next we look into
becoming an operator of a satellite so
for example if we were to purchase a
satellite that was capable of providing
15 gigabits per second this will result
in a cost of two hundred million dollars
and it would take
around two years to produce this
satellite so after looking at these two
options we've decided that becoming an
operator would be the most
cost-effective approach to our mission
so now how do we actually do this what
does it take to develop and deploy the
system so for phase one in regards to
leasing capacity we would purchase tant
channels excuse me from an operator such
as Intel sat we would do so for about
two and a half years in regards to phase
two in order to develop what we need for
phase two we would work with a company
such as space systems loral or ssl where
they would manufacture our satellite now
in addition to having our satellite
manufactured we would have to work with
one of SS LS partners to obtain orbital
slots now these slots are kind of like
kind of like a real estate in space so
basically we need to see which slots are
available in which we can obtain the
rights to in addition to this we of
course need to acquire frequency so
similar to the spectrum over the United
States as I'm sure many of you are
familiar with the recent spectrum
auction that took place the spectrum
over Africa of course is regulated so we
would also need to obtain rights to the
spectrum in addition to this we also
need to obtain the landing rights for
the individual countries we need them to
give us the go-ahead to project our data
and our frequency down onto the
individual countries now also throughout
this development we would work with a
program such as connect Africa or
another NGO we would work together to
encourage our user adoption and increase
overall interest in our system now
here's an example of the type of design
that we would like to use for our own
satellites this example is IP star I P
star is a highly capable satellite
that's currently servicing Southeast
Asia and Australia now one IV star
satellite is capable of providing a data
rate of 45 gigabits per second so based
on our 30 gigabit per second requirement
this is clearly a feasible option now
the main thing I'd like to point out
about IP star is its use of spot beam
technology combined with dynamic link
assignment so the traditional satellite
uses broad or shaped beams to provide
coverage
wyd regions are provide continental
coverage now I p star uses mainly spot
beams these are satellite signals that
are highly concentrated in these
concentrated signals this allows the
satellite to transmit several different
types of data by using the same
frequency so the ability to reuse this
frequency really really makes for a very
high efficient satellite and so this is
a type of design we would like to use
for our own satellites but our two
individual satellites we'd be using in
Phase two would have a proxima
proximately on half the capacity of IP
star this is the type of design we would
use here's a quick look at our coverage
resulting from our phase deployment
beginning again with phase one where we
least Im from currently operating
satellites in red you can see where
we've launched our pilot station ground
station pilot programs and the color
depiction is an example of coverage that
would be provided from Intel set 10
which is listed as having available
capacity so this of course would allow
testing of our pilot programs and allow
them to expand when we reach phase 2 we
launch launch our first geostationary
satellite this of course continues to
provide coverage to the same regions
where we've launched our pilot programs
allowing them to expand as well and in
addition to this we would be providing
three shaped beams to to provide
coverage to the lower population density
desert regions and another one to
provide coverage until another satellite
is needed finally when additional
service is required we launch our second
satellite which will then provide
coverage to the now higher density
regions so as a result we have complete
coverage of Africa so here's a summary
of our potential collaborators that
would help us with this development in
regards to leasing capacity we first
have inmarsat which has global coverage
through 11 operating satellites
currently the majority of their capacity
has been contracted through all their
distributors however in about a year
they will be renegotiating this
distribution to allow for additional
contracts next we have Intel set which
is the world's largest fixed satellite
service provider
they again are listed currently as
having available capacity over Africa
next for manufacturing our satellite we
have space systems loral which actually
produce IP stars I described earlier
again we would use them to manufacture
our satellite and the partners would
help us to obtain our orbital orbital
slots and the spectrum that we require
for our system again we have a program
such as connect Africa which is an
information communication technology
initiative that is basically focused on
bringing companies together to provide
affordable service to the rural regions
of Africa so we would join forces and
expanding our pilot programs and
encourage our user adoption so in
summary the geostationary system is a
very low risk and cost effective
solution that has immediate
implementation again we're using the
design based on IP star heritage and
we'll be operating under Phase
deployment and collaboration which
involves leasing capacity in phase 1 and
then launching up the two satellites
when we reach phase 2 again throughout
this development we would work with an
NGO again to encourage user adoption and
work together to increase interest in
our systems so now that we have an
understanding of the geostationary
element of our mission I would like to
introduce drew hackathorn to discuss the
ground system Thank You Kelly it first
just to revisit the system architecture
slide you guys have seen a couple times
now I'm going to talk about the ground
stations in particular and we've got
four hub stations that are located off
continent mostly in Europe and then for
about 40 1600 individual user stations
and these user stations are what the
African people can actually log on to to
get on the internet first off with the
hub stations to service after at the
rate we want to service them we're going
to need about 30 point 5 gigabits per
second of total capacity and this is
going to require four hub stations each
hub station is going to have about eight
gigabits per second of capacity and
these are all going to be located in
Europe the reason for this as Joan
hinted at before is that there's only
about 28 gigabits per second of fiber
connection actually going into Africa
right now and obviously a lot of that is
already
use so we need to find a place that's
close enough that we can see it from
those geostationary satellites but that
isn't going to rob bandwidth from
applications that are already in place
and we're going to use existing fiber
lines to make sure that these things are
relatively easy to implement and can be
done on a short timeline and just to
give you an idea of the hardware that's
included in the station each station is
going to have somewhere on the order of
a three meter dish as well as all the
supporting electronics both for the
satellite communications and for the
backend networking and all the
technologies available today and that's
to the tune of about three hundred fifty
thousand dollars per station and it's it
may seem a little strange that you know
we're space systems class and you're my
entire portion of this presentation is
going to be about stuff that's on the
ground but there are a couple things
that drove us to that one of them is the
technological maturity of the satellite
assets that I p star satellite that
Kelly talked about that's already in
service it's it's working great so by
and large the challenges in space have
been solved do we have the technology
that we need to do this from a space
perspective but that sort of that frees
us up to focus on how can we actually
get these into the hands of the people
that need them and make sure that this
is a technological solution that will
meet their unique needs and a big part
of that is we need to shift as much cost
as possible away from the end user so we
got to make these stations as cheap as
possible we got to stamp them out a lot
at a time and make sure that this is
this is something that you know somebody
on a somebody on a modest income can
afford and that opens up excuse me that
opens up some new motivations for
adoption one of which is this is a great
enabling technology for low-cost laptops
such as the olpc or the Intel classmate
pc if you take those computers and give
them to a school or a hospital that's
great but if you can do that and put
these computers on the internet the
value of that technology skyrockets
another option is micro loan financing
you know much the same way that people
in developing regions now will purchase
a cell phone and turn that cell phone
into a business by charging people to
use it and then using those using that
revenue to pay for their contract and
then pocket the profits we can do the
exact same thing with one of these
stations somebody could purchase a
station operated out of their home and
charge other people in their small town
for use of it and lastly and we're not
we're not really trying to make any
money
off of this this is intended to be a no
philanthropic effort and if we can make
these user stations very low-cost it's
conceivable that somebody would step in
and just you know give them away to the
people that could use them so a few
highlights of the user station and this
it sits directly with the themes that
Joan was talking about before this is
very low cost only twenty-six thousand
twenty six hundred fifty dollars per
station and relative to competing
technologies this is this is dirt cheap
these are all implementable today using
existing technology there's no huge
technological problems that still need
to be solved it's all ready to go right
now and that in turn makes a system that
is very very low risk and we've added a
couple more things one of them is the
modular power design which allows us to
drop these stations wrap these stations
anywhere and get them powered up and
ready to go so we have you know a lot of
different options for that so we can
adapt to local climates and you know
basically harvest whatever power is
there to run this station and we've also
included a neat piece of technology
they'll talk about later that will allow
the station to be set up and configured
with no professional technical
intervention whatsoever so here's a
model of our ground station over here on
the left we have the satellite antenna
dish and the the base could have to keep
the dish very stable to maintain a good
lock on the satellite and in the
electronics enclosure we have the
satellite modem power regulation energy
storage etc and on the right here is a
solar panel which was the the mobile the
mobile power generation source that we
studied in detail so first the data
subsystem we're going to use regular
commercial off-the-shelf satellite
communications equipment as V set for a
very small aperture terminal but
basically it's exactly like what you'd
see from directv or any sort of
satellite television provider and these
stations are each going to have a data
rate of 512 kilobits per second down
from the satellite and 256 kilobits per
second up to the satellite and that's a
roughly equivalent to a DSL connection
here in the States and you were going to
use a low transmit power that has a very
very direct impact on overall station
cost and once the data is down from the
satellite we're just going to use
standard Wi-Fi hardware to distribute
this data to the end-user so you each
one of these each one of these stations
is effective
a wireless hotspot that you can drop
anywhere in the world and we also have a
cash system which will sort of mask the
effects of the fact that you're on
satellite internet and when we're using
a geostationary solution for the
satellite leg of this and that satellite
is so far away that just the time it
takes to transmit the data up to the
satellite and then back down to the
ground has a significant impact on your
quality of service by cashing that data
and storing it locally you can make this
connection behave as though it was a
regular terrestrial connection even
though you're running through a
satellite and you know again all of
these sub system components are
available today is all regular
off-the-shelf technology but the the
revolution here is that we've combined
these all in something that's very very
functional a little more is a diagram of
our data distribution so here you've got
the satellite link is going to connect
down to the user station which is here
in the center and then all of the
computers that are inside this green
circle can connect just via standard
omnidirectional Wi-Fi antenna like you
all have built into your laptops but
yeah as anybody who's been on Wi-Fi know
is the range of one particular hotspot
is not not very big and if you to put
that in the center of a village you're
going to have large regions you know
basically anywhere more than you know
say a half a kilometer away from that
aren't going to be properly connected to
it so we have a couple of options for
that one of which is a directed Wi-Fi
card and these hook up via USB and then
basically replace the omnidirectional
Wi-Fi antenna that's in your laptop with
a directed antenna so instead of
transmitting the information everywhere
it's just going to transmit it in a very
particular place and if you align it
correctly you can get hooked up to you
can get hooked up to this hotspot here
in the middle even though your three or
four kilometers away another option
that's a little beefier is you can set
up these point-to-point links here on
the bottom and you have a separate
reflector dish on each end of this
connection and it basically just relays
the Wi-Fi signal it's the same same
protocol same everything you just relay
it over this much more powerful directed
antenna link and you can push these
connections up to about a hundred
kilometers and there is some
technological heritage with this
specifically the inventio system which
I'll reference in a little bit but this
stuff is already on the ground and it's
already working and one one last thing
to note is especially if you're
incorporating some of the low cost
laptops like the OLPC is pictured here
it gives you the power to turn any
one of these computers that's outside
the green circle into another hot spot
through mesh networking so you know all
these computers that are up here on the
on the top right they're all sharing the
connection of this one computer that has
the directed Wi-Fi card and lastly you
know we mentioned the cash earlier we
hook the cash right off the main station
here and you know what that would allow
us to do is you know if somebody if this
guy is looking at a very commonly viewed
picture or video odds are good that that
video is already stored here centrally
and so he can just access that
immediately and there's no traffic
whatsoever running up over the satellite
link and that connection behaves as
though he was here in the States on a
high quality reliable connection all
right so now on to the modular power
system again we want to make these
stations it you want to give these
stations the ability to deploy anywhere
anywhere in Africa specifically but also
anywhere in the world and to do that we
want to harvest local power so that we
can make them totally independent of any
utility infrastructure the first sorry
the first thing we looked at is a solar
power unit this is feasible over you
know very large areas in Africa also
we've got wind power and this says it's
cheaper on a per watt basis than solar
but only very very small areas in Africa
are able to make use of it those are the
areas with very high system high speed
sustained winds lastly kinetic power and
this would be either you know a human on
a bicycle or you're using some sort of
pack animal to turn a crank these would
be options too but our research so far
indicates that the peak human generating
capacity especially with the kind of
crude hardware that you'd find on the
ground in Africa is just not going to
get the job done for us and here on the
bottom this modular design allows us to
adapt to local resource availability
it's totally independent you can drop it
anywhere and you don't have to redesign
the thing to make it work in multiple
places here's a map of the different
areas in which power systems we think
would be best suited for them in the
yellow regions here are have good
reliable connections to the power grid
so obviously that's a cheap easy way to
get these stations hooked up but then in
the orange regions which is where we
focus most of our design is a solar
power lastly as I mentioned before the
wind power areas you know they're mostly
coastal and they're very very small
there's there's a very small number of
areas where wind is actually a viable
option to generate enough power for the
station
and then this sort of other area here
these people are are not out of luck but
we just have not yet identified a
solution to generate power for them that
we can do at a low cost we could use
solar we could use wind but all those
installations would have to be larger
and more costly than the design that
we're specking out here right now so
here's an example of our primary power
system design as you can see it's a
solar panel we also have a battery to
store the power the panel itself is 1.4
meters squared and generates a peak
power of just under 200 watts and we've
sized a battery and see it's a standard
car battery sort of technology so if it
needed to be replaced on site there's a
much better chance of there being
another car battery around and we've
sized it to provide 10 hours of reserve
power all told this power generating
capacity and storage should be able to
power the power any station in a good
solar region for more than 12 hours a
day and it's even in the winter and
months when the weather is not ideal and
you know much the same much the same as
the data system all these components are
available today there's no big
technological leaps here this is all
stuff that's proven on the ground ready
to go so I've heard about what the
station can do and you're probably
curious about how much it's going to
cost each one of these stations has a
hardware cost of eighteen hundred and
twenty-five dollars and that includes
manufacturing the two main cost drivers
for this are the power generation
solution over here on the right and the
satellite communications in starters in
solar panels they're very expensive we
hope that they'll come down and cost but
that's that's kind of a fixed cost for
us the other aspect the satellite
communications if we attempted to make a
station that was more capable say a
station that could transmit multiple
megabits per second that drives the cost
of our satellite transmitter hardware up
dramatically and at that point it's no
longer a low-cost solution and then
competing systems I referenced before
the inventor system that system cost
fifty three hundred dollars and it can't
talk to the satellites it has to be
close enough to use one of those
point-to-point connections so that you
can link it to a regular terrestrial
internet connection and then another
system the began system this system is
able to talk to satellites but it has no
independent power generating capacity so
you that you take that twenty four
hundred dollars and you have to add back
the cost of our solar panels and our
power regulation and our batteries in
order to get a solution that has the
same capabilities as we're proposing
here
there are also some other non hardware
costs that need to be considered in
these ground stations first of which is
manufacturing which we've estimated to
be about one hundred and thirty dollars
per station and that's roughly a seven
point five percent of your component
costs additionally taxes and tariffs
total out to about six hundred fifty
five dollars per station and that's a
thirty-six percent average to compute
this number we looked at the average tax
rates over the countries where our pilot
programs are located and that came out
to about thirty six percent excuse me
but as you can see the the tax rates
vary widely over the continent so and
that cost is going to go up or down
depending on which specific country are
trying to get these stations into lastly
the the transport is about a hundred
seventy dollars per station this is a by
c standard shipping container kind of
stuff and again this is an average over
the pilot locations for transport into a
major city in that country I one other
thing that should be considered here is
there are some import and export
restrictions the the takeaway from this
is that if there's anything in the
station that can be re-engineered for
use as a weapon or something to that
effect the United States government is
not very keen on you exporting it so
obviously that should be avoided if
possible and I just give an idea of how
all these costs fit together as you can
see the the sort of secondary costs make
up about two-thirds of the total station
cost so they're not they're not
insignificant and you need to consider
them whenever you're trying to figure
out what the true cost of this station
is actually going to be and all these
costs were projected for September 2010
which is when we anticipate that the
system like this could be in full volume
production so here's here's that cool
piece of technology i was talking about
the idea here is that we've put together
a package that will allow you to set up
the antenna and get the antenna pointed
at the geostationary satellite with no
professional intervention and we call it
the visual positioning package inside of
this unit that's here on the upper left
we have a digital compass and a GPS unit
and those between those two things you
can find out the orientation of your
station north south east west as well as
its position on the earth and then it
will calculate the three parameters that
you need to point the antenna the first
one is shown here which is the elevation
that's the angle that you're going to
look at up into the sky and so you can
adjust that on the hardware here behind
the antenna
and then once that's locked in and ready
to go the the visual positioning package
will display your rotational your
azimuth excuse me the azimuth value do
you need to be at and that's your
rotating the dish around the around its
mounting post so you have it looking at
in the right direction into this guy and
once that's taken care of you need to
sort of turn the dish like a steering
wheel in order to properly align it with
the the transmitted waves that are
coming from the geostationary satellite
once the three of those parameters have
been set properly you should have some
signal from the satellite at that point
and it's just a matter of sort of
jiggling the dish around until you get
the best lock that you can and that's
soon shown by the signal meter and once
you're in the green you are on the
Internet so now I've been saying you
know there are no technological leaps
required the stuff is ready to go today
those are not just empty words we
actually have a demonstration that's
here on site it works it's fully
functional satellite communications cash
system Wi-Fi independent power the whole
nine yards and you know if we can do
this in eight weeks for three thousand
dollars we're very confident that you
know a team of paid professionals can do
this at our price point and in the near
term and you're just a couple more
statistics you total mass is reasonable
for transport and our cash system is
providing a very significant increase in
quality of service so with that now that
you and one last thing immediately
following this meeting near that I said
that station is here on campus and we
hope you'll all come down and take a
look at it I believe it's right outside
of 42 right right 41 sorry that way so
now you've heard about the both the the
satellite aspect of our system and the
ground stations I'm going to turn it
back over to Joan will give you some
more details about how we're actually
going to get this thing deployed and out
into the hands of the people that need
it great thanks true so again this is
like we've been talking about we have
our geostationary satellite and then we
have our user stations and ground to
help complete our ground system so how
exactly are we going to deploy this so
that you know it's very effective this
is our timeline taking you know each
step by step so as we've been talking
about we're for
going to least capacity of current
existing assets this is extremely
important and that it takes about two
years to build a satellite so this
allows us to provide service immediately
in concert with doing that we're also
going to deploy as i said the six pilot
programs to understand the adoption
rates etc along with those pilot
programs more will continue to be
distributed based on interest as drew
talked about kind of the big cost driver
of our ground station was the power
system and we believe that in the future
with some redesign of the components on
our user station we can really bring
that power down so this milestone
represents that redesign such that the
cost of that user station can come down
even more so this will have the redesign
here and then after that distribute more
user stations and then finally we'll
make the decision as to whether or not
to actually launch a Geo satellite based
on the performance of the stations the
adoption rates etc we really need to
make this decision and as soon as
possible since it does take two years to
build that now after we make that
decision phase two again will commence
with the launch of that satellite and at
this point we'll continue you know as
many distributing as many user stations
as possible and really watch the market
at this point because the next decision
involves whether or not we should launch
the second satellite now this is really
the attractive part of this face
appointment because if user adoption
rates for some reason are very low and
you know it's not beneficial to have a
full capacity system as we have planned
out here you can decide not to launch
the second asset and save 200 million
dollars in the process but if the
adoption rates are high then you do make
this decision and then two years later
we'll launch that second asset and have
a full capacity system now you're
probably wondering all right so how much
is this whole system cost now as far as
a company funding this if they bought
the hub stations the satellites the Lisa
kept capacity for two and a half years
that'll be about 435 million dollars now
if all the user stations are distributed
that'll come to about 100
10 million dollars bringing us to a
total of five hundred and forty five
point two million now first this might
seem pretty high if you aren't used to
you know the cost and the aerospace
market however if you look at just a
couple other examples seven Boeing 757s
costs on the order of our system same
with four f-22 Raptors and then if you
take you know a step out of aerospace
market just building a Sears Tower in
Chicago costs about 950 million so that
just gives you an idea of where we stand
with this system so overall you know
throughout this entire presentation
we've really presented a system that's
low cost low risk can be implemented
immediately start serving people now and
is very very easy to deploy now I mean
this is huge you know we can make a
large impact on thousands and excuse
millions of people's lives not just
thousands you know whether it's the
farmer who you know decides to start
growing something new and then can feed
his family and you know hire 10
full-time workers or the children who
now have a better education because they
have better access to information or the
healthcare clinic that now can treat its
patients because they have the
information of how to do so or you know
are informed of widespread outbreaks
throughout the continent you know we
really feel that this is something that
can change many many people's lives and
we've laid out a very feasible and
business approach to do so so with that
you know along with my colleagues here
and the students back in Michigan in the
University of Michigan I'd like to thank
all of you for listening today that's
all we have so if you have any questions
so I had thanks for the presentation
it's had a couple of questions how many
users do you anticipate on average would
would be using one of the user stations
so I'm trying to get a sense for the
cost per person and then the other
question is there seemed to be a big
sort of gap in the coverage around
Namibia is that just because the
population density there is so low that
you just I noticed you also skip the
Sahara but just wondering why namibia
even with the second satellite there's
no coverage there well to answer your
first question um we have it designed so
that each user station is servicing
about 150 users but that's kind of a
little bit different because each user
represents actually 50 people with the
requirements that we were given with our
system but we're also anticipating that
all 150 of these users are not using the
station at the same exact time so won't
be you know overcrowded with traffic as
far as the coverage goes let's go to
that slide we're talking about we talk
about the satellite coverage side of the
power the power coverage map the
satellite coverage
yeah Green is okay its regional beam I
didn't understand so these are lower
population I'm sorry these are lower
population density regions so that we
are actually providing coverage there
but um is it the same level of coverage
short and you're just counting on
statistically having fewer users or is
right yes it's so yeah this is just
based on the population there so we
would be you know providing like based
on our requirements and everything the
same type of coverage necessary but it's
just a lower population so that's why
we're using shaped beams for those
regions
what does it cost you're expecting for
the bandwidth you're buying an interim
until you launch a satellite so that's a
great question and probably the biggest
problem with space oh sorry the question
was what is the estimated cost of the
bandwidth of the satellites that we will
need to acquire honestly that's a
question we don't have an exact answer
to it's okay well right now we have that
set at 30 3.6 million dollars which what
goes into that number includes that's a
actual quote from a company of how much
they charge per month per day to rate
and that number is assuming we start
with six user stations and then we have
a growth of twenty percent per month of
users yeah so in your power system
analysis I noticed that you considered a
lot of alternative energies why not use
a diesel generator or guest generator it
looks like the amount of power you need
is small and small generators are cheap
I me that that's technically that's
that's certainly a feasible solution but
then you have to deliver gas to the to
the station every couple of weeks is
there not as this gas not well supplied
in a lot of these areas it's it seems
like it's a common resource in a lot of
the world it's easily accessible I've
got my I mean this is pure speculation
but my I would speculate that it would
be easier to come by then then grid
elected utility power but you know idea
here was that these stations could be
set up and sort of left alone without
having to refill the gas tank
periodically
what is
latency for geostationary internet
connections is generally 600
milliseconds plus correct
hi fantastic presentation I'm wondering
if you you presented some case studies
of who might be using this as an end
user and I think we all working at
Google understand the benefits of the
internet did you do any directed user
studies to find out who actually might
be using this and sort of get a demand
profile or did you or did you at least
look into people who may have done such
studies in the past to really look maybe
on a country by country or region by
region basis what the actual demand
might be um we've been working with a
couple of people through other schools
at the University namely the public
health school the business school etc
that helped us understand that as we're
engineers so we don't have the greatest
idea so specifically this this woman
Molly Christensen really gave us a great
idea of what people need and what's out
there as far as specifically by country
we haven't gone that close yet however
it does seem as though that is a really
focused study that needs to happen in
order for this to really take off
because you know the end user might not
want to use a laptop it might be you
know a cell phone that's actually
connected to the internet or something
like that one other aspect of that is
the locations we chose for our pilot
programs we're designed to very strongly
across the three variables as we
mentioned so if you know diff per capita
GDP or literacy rate really has a strong
correlation with adoption will find that
out with those pilot programs and be
able to target our future deployments
accordingly your power assumptions of
powering both the PC as well or just
just the actual Wi-Fi network and in the
core base station currently it's only
designed to power the the core base
station the olpc sometimes ship with
with hand cranks that can be used to
power the computer itself but it would
you know it would require minimal
minimal redesign to oversize a solar
panel and you suck some of the power of
that to power and user electronics but
it would certainly drive up station
costs
okay I guess thank you guys all for
coming today and it's one more cut our
losses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
