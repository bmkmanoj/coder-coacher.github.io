quick introduction here I met Aaron at
foo camp appropriately enough and as you
know foo is one of those words it's made
up word it was originally an acronym
that's gone on to have fame in the
computer science field as a medicine
tactic variable so Aaron is thus the
perfect person to explain what goes on
when a word goes from an invented status
to a fully accepted member of our
working society Aaron is a dictionary
evangelist she is a chief consulting
editor for the American dictionaries for
oxford university press and the editor
of verbatim the language quarterly she's
the author of four books about words the
first weird and wonderful words the
second more weird wonderful words
totally weird and wonderful words and
that's amore I recommend these books is
a delightful kaleidoscopic view of the
strange going ons of our language of the
book totally weird and wonderful words
it was written it's a whimsical
lexicographical petting zoo that's about
as fine a description as you're going to
get of any book and as Richard letter or
writes in the preface to you more in
weird and wonderful words which I just
can't help I got it I got to read this
lexicographers like mccain are not
harmless drudges rather they remind us
of the unbounded generativity of our
glorious uproarious outrageous
courageous stupendous end over India's
English language so please join me in
welcoming Aaron McCain
thank you guys so much it's really nice
to be back here at Google and well today
what are we going to do today today
we're going to see if we can coin some
words just right here why not but I
wanted to give you a couple of actually
a lot of disclaimers first of all
coining word is not a shortcut to fame
fortune new sexual partners really it
doesn't really get you anything in the
real world except the satisfaction of
having done it it's one of those things
that you really do for the love of it
anybody who goes into coining words for
tangible reward is almost always
horribly disappointed so if you feel
that if you have to get up and leave now
I understand if you were here just for
the big bucks it's okay you know Samuel
Johnson once famously said that no man
but a blockhead ever rode except for
money and nobody ever makes a word
except for love as far as I can tell
because they're not going to get very
much else out of it can anyone name for
me someone that they know coined a word
like a famous word yes yes what does
anybody ask know what a snow cone is the
the coat yes we have two people who know
what a snow clone is three people
including four five all right that is a
really high percentage of people who
know what a snow clone is so but for the
rest of you I should probably explain it
a snow clone is a phrase that has a
variables that you can replace right so
it was originally called a snow clone
because the first one that was really
discussed was Eskimos have X number of
words for snow right so if you say X X
if you take that and replace Eskimos X
and snow with something else like the
French have 12 different words for
cheese that's a snow clone and they're
always the Eskimos actually don't have
whatever number of words for snow that
you heard they had this came about
because
the language is that most people that we
call Eskimos speak are gluten ating
languages so they just shove stuff
together so whereas we would say wet
space snow they say wet snow and so to
somebody coming from a perspective of a
non agglutinating language it sounds
like they have a heck of a lot of words
for snow but they really don't and the
best place I think to go and look this
up is a book by Jeff Pullum called the
great Eskimo vocabulary hoax so I but so
but you kind of made my point for me
even though you knew a word that had
been coined you couldn't tell me the
name of the guy that coined it right a
lot of people when I talk about this
they say yeah Beyonce coin bootylicious
right but no Snoop Dogg actually
predated her but so even though you
think you know who coined a word a lot
of the time what happens is it somebody
else did it earlier so even the person
that you might think has gotten credit
doesn't often get the credit Lewis
Carroll I think did do galumph and yes
he did a lot of Jabberwocky in words
portmanteau Lewis Carroll was a one-man
coining machine basically but he wasn't
very happy which is sad so yeah so now
that I've discouraged you by saying
there's no money and you're going to be
sad so anyway so I'm hoping you'll get
this today is that a little bit of
entertainment and a little bit of
information about how words work how do
words in English actually work so but I
do want to say that my opinions today
are not necessarily those of Oxford
University Press they do pay me to give
them my opinions but sadly not on a per
opinion basis
um why I would totally clean up this out
were the case but so I am a chief
consulting editor for America
dictionaries for Oxford University Press
and sometimes people when they hear the
word oxford and lexicographer this is
really what they're expecting and i feel
like i disappoint the people who are
expecting this and in fact I I would
wear that little hat except for some
reason my Oxford issue little hat didn't
come all the other lexicographers got
one but somehow mine was lost in the
mail so as a lexicographer sometimes
people think that of course I'm
qualified to tell you what's a word and
what's not a worked but i'm not sure if
I really am for one thing I do not have
a doctorate in neologism from some Tony
European University I am I don't sell
neologism products on late-night TV um I
have never made a dime from a word I
invented myself you know lexicographers
are pretty much discouraged from
inventing words right we're told it's
kind of like if you work if you work for
the Sweepstakes you're not supposed to
enter the sweepstakes but I have to tell
you that I did make a word by accident
and this is the way a lot of words are
made I run a blog it's called address a
day I talk about dresses every day I
haven't posted yet today so if you're
going to go look it up I'm sorry but I
started talking about this one
particular style of dress it's a little
shaped like a kimono it has contrast
banding around the neck and the waist
and the sleeves I see all the guys here
zoning out but um the one that the first
one that I liked was by a designer named
duro al oh whoa he's an African he works
in England really nice guy and so I
started calling them Derulo who dresses
and then it got shortened to duro
dresses and then it got shortened to
duro and now I see a lot of instances of
the word duro referring to this style of
dress in the wild like people who are
not linking to me people who are not
referencing me in any way the word has
become disassociated from my blog and
gone out into the world now of course
it's only very small percentage of
people who are discussing these dresses
anyway and I would say I know 99% of
them but that one percent we're talking
about these dresses they got the word
for me which is wrong I shouldn't have
done that and I'm sorry but anyway why I
think that I can tell you about what
makes
Werdum under new words and so forth is
that I do get a lot of pitches from
people who want me to put their word in
the dictionary then really care which
dictionary they're like a dictionary the
dictionary just put it in because then i
will be famous and lots of people love
me and i'll get a lot of money and i can
sue anybody who uses my word in a way
that i don't like that is not what new
what you want there is a trademark so
unfortunately creating trademarks is
beyond the scope of this hour but but i
see a lot of people who want to make a
new word and i see them often making the
same mistakes over and over again so
what I'm doing right now is basically
humanitarian work I'm trying to convince
you to do it the right way to save us
all a lot of time in trouble but and the
thing is making a new word is not really
rocket science it's not really SEO it's
not really something that's difficult to
do um so some of the things I might tell
you might seem a little obvious but um I
hope that you'll bear with me um I just
like that as an example of obvious this
isn't great the sinks you can find on
flickr but so we're going to talk really
briefly about how words come into
english and then you have an index card
probably if you don't have an index card
scrap paper will work then you can make
a new word of your own if you want if
you want me to write about your new word
on my blog dictionary evangelist put
your name and email address on the back
if you don't want me to write about your
new word right please don't write about
this on it or just leave the name and
attribution blank and if you want me
when I write about your new word to link
to a web page of yours it would help if
you gave me that URL I mean sure I could
always look you guys up but it helps if
you give me the URL so so I think we
have about an a little less than an hour
so this will go very quickly which
compared to how things lexicographical
usually go is very fast but I'm sure for
some of you this will drag on
interminably and I'm sorry I'm so we're
no words come from in English right who
brings the words so oh and one more
disclaimer I'm really only talking about
English and I'm really really only
talking about American English because
that's what I speak so some of what I
say might not apply to other English's
which you may speak for example
Australian English Canadian English
British English
South African English so your mileage
may vary your English may vary employees
of the English language and their
families are not allowed to enter so
forth so where the words come from well
a lot of words we inherited right they
came from Grandma remember we're talking
about English here I'm not talking about
what was the first word that was ever
said by some kind of cartoon caveman
somewhere how do we get words in English
well you know English is from the West
Germanic subgroup with a Germanic branch
of the indo-european language family
along with german dutch and Frisian
anybody here speak Frisian nobody ever
says yes anyway so English kind of got
its start as English English about 449
in the c/e and so then from about 700 to
1100 siiii we call it old english from
1100 to 1500 we call it Middle English
and modern English's from about 1500 to
the present so for lack of a better
adjectives we can say old english is
Beowulf II the Middle English is trah
Surrey and there are lots of words that
were the same a Middle English that than
they are today write the words first me
and the of thy thought by so that I may
what be can you make a sentence from all
of those right now no I can't either
uh-oh refrigerator magnets you could so
those are words that are the same today
as they ever were we inherited those
there's no point trying to change those
people have been trying to make new
pronouns right for for the third person
singular right he and she we've still
got a gender differential there people
have been trying to make epicene
pronouns for this forever from the first
time people realized that it would be
helpful to have one that wasn't gender
specific they've been trying to make it
none of those really have much currency
in modern English so what I'm saying is
don't mess with the pronouns do you have
a question
all two little words so you they are
coming from all the Middle English words
Oh your gym teacher made a poem so if it
is to be it is up to me to do it oh
that's where it's all Middle English so
so we should probably consider those
words factory issue and not really mess
with them you you can't really coin a
new old english word you're stuck with
modern English this it's become common
all are demanding cracks to you today as
a CEO of their prison with that countess
yellow jism or just dramatic flair
where where do you draw the line between
grammatical error and that is excellent
foreshadowing so the question was how
about using they as the third person
singular I do it all the time Jane
Austen did it Shakespeare did it I
figure anything that Jade Austin and
Shakespeare both did you have to be
pretty ballsy to call wrong especially
in English so but that's really a reef
unction shift for the word they it
shifted from being plural to singular in
some context a lot of people get really
mad about the illogicality of they
because they they've grown up with it as
plural and by god they want it to stay
plural it's kind of like the people that
get really upset when someone that they
know has gender reassignment surgery
it's like dude I met you as a guy stay a
guy because it makes me really
uncomfortable now that you're female and
I think you just have to accept that
words are going to be what they want to
be and if they feel if they feels on the
inside that is really a singular at
least part of the time we should let it
express itself as a singular right so so
some words we just inherited we got them
from Grandma and some words will other
ways that ink words come into English as
we steal them um now sometimes linguist
when they talk about where it's coming
into other languages from English they
say we borrowed them but we never give
them back right we borrow them in the
same way that we borrow two cups of
sugar from a neighbor to make a cake
right you don't then disassemble the
cake and give them back the same sugar
sometimes we give other languages other
words and sometimes they take them and
sometimes they don't write French for
instance is is very they don't really
want to officially take words from
English you know you say love weekend
and French and you know sometimes they
don't want to print that in the
newspaper and so forth but we take words
from everywhere we don't care we swipe
them you know we think if it's good
enough for German if it's good enough
for Spanish if it's a good enough for
Japanese and it fills a need that
speakers of American English have we
just swipe it and we don't say thank you
really most the time we don't say please
we just take it and so we've been doing
this for web centuries just retook waves
from
I guess some of the words were forced on
us when the Normans invaded England in
the 14th century we got a lot of
vocabulary that way whether we wanted it
or not but we get tons of stuff from
other languages and we're still doing it
today this is not just a historical
thing we take words from other languages
all the time so in the 20th century
English has been shown to borrow from at
least 75 languages so French gives us a
ton of words primary donor to the
English language if it were a blood
transfusion French would be pale and
fainting and English would be ready and
Hardy right taking all those words from
French but other languages japanese
spanish italian Latin Greek German
Yiddish Russian Chinese Arabic roughly
in that order or where we've stolen lots
and lots of words so that's kind of one
way that we get words into English we
inherit them we steal them and then we
make them from parts that we have kind
of lying around white reawy Frankenstein
words together we compound them and we
ethics them so compounding is pretty
easy takes mind everybody understands
what a compound is there's putting
together two bits that had previous life
is complete words like Lego blocks so
you blackboard headhunter steamboat
these are all compounds you just shove
to complete words together boom new word
in English and so how do you know when
you have a compound and not just two
words in a in a committed relationship
right when are they married and
compounds can't usually be reversed and
keep their meaning so bored black bus
school they don't work you have to have
blackboard and school bus and compounds
aren't really separable you can't really
put things between them and have it
makes sense so steamboat but not steam
red boat you have to say red steamboat
so making words from compounding is
pretty easy people do it all the time it
kind of goes under our radar when you
see a new compound unless you're a
professional copy editor you probably
just accept it as it is you don't really
worry Oh is there space is there a
hyphen is there no space you just think
oh I understand that compound because I
understand
two parts usually the progression in
English is that a compound will get
closer and closer together like magnets
until they're stuck right so they start
off with a space between them and then
they get kind of a non-committal hyphen
and then they're together and they're
not separable anymore so that's kind of
how compounds work now I fixing an
ethics is something that you stick on to
a whole word or a word part and it's
even more like Legos so when you have
two Legos and you put them together you
have stuff that is a new shape but you
can still see the individual Lego bits
and that's true without fixing so
they're a lot there are a bunch of
different kinds of affixes and here's
here they all are bolted together so we
have suffixes they go on the end
prefixes they go on the beginning circum
fixes they go on both the beginning and
the end so one is enlighten so you have
to have both the previous part in the
end part in order to make and like 10
out of light because just in light is
not really a word right now although if
you want to make one today that's a
freebie right I've just given you that
one um the or light n means something
different from enlighten so you need
both parts in the circum fix and but the
thing the the fix that people i think
enjoy the most in english is the in fix
and it's pretty rare and it's only used
it's mostly used for emphasis so absa
damn lutely you've in fixed the damn and
so i'm sure you can all think of many
many other examples but since they're
going to put this on google video i
should probably not use the more obscene
ones so and ethics is you don't you're
not limited to one or two or even three
per root you can pile on as many as you
need to make the meaning that you want
to get across so for instance you can do
things like conventional ization right
and of course the famous
antidisestablishmentarianism but you
just compile them on like a Dagwood
sandwich until you have something that
you can't fit in your mouth
right so when you're making words by
affixing I think that's pretty much the
easiest way to make words in English
today it's though it's the way I
recommend its time-tested it's nearly
foolproof most people who are native
speakers of English know instinctively
what order to put certain ethics is in
so you really don't want to put a
conventional convention isolation
conventional that it's I can't even say
that twice in a row so you know how
things are supposed to go but there are
other words there are other ways that
words are made in English one of the
ways that you can make a word is like we
said would they you can take a word and
you can convert it into something else
internally the outside won't change the
spelling won't change you won't be
slapping any parts onto the inside or
the outside so for instance if you have
the verb run you can make that a noun go
for a run people do this all the time in
English lots of nouns want to be verb
lots of verbs want to be noun and this
also upsets people they like things to
stay the part of speech they were when
they met them but English makes this
very easy to do and I feel like if we're
going to think that there was ever any
plan behind the English language of
course there wasn't but if we were going
to assume for the sake of argument why
would English let us do this if it
didn't want it to happen right if we
think of English as having any kind of
sentence which of course it doesn't but
if we wanted to they make this so easy
in English that we do it all the time
there are very few nouns that you can
think of that don't get verb you can bag
a prize you can doctor a drink you can
soldier on you can do all sorts of
things and now some of the sources that
I saw said well you can't down something
like organized you can't say let's have
an organized because it ends in an eyes
and that's more of a verb e-type ending
but I've been seeing a lot of stuff like
that where people are doing it
facetiously because they know it doesn't
sound right they think oh it's funny
let's say okay well we're going to have
an organized at ten o'clock or and so
yeah you laugh it sounds weird but the
more people do this trying to be funny
it's like having a six-year-old repeated
joke to you over and over again right at
some point it stops being funny and
just turns into you know a standard
sentence and so the more people use
words facetiously or metaphorically
after a while the novelty wears off and
you're just left with more plain
standard English i really like verbing
things and now nning things I feel like
it's fun and I encourage people to do it
all the time because when you verb
something or when you now in something
no you know adjective eyes something do
whatever you like with this kind of
functional shift it makes people pay
attention and even if they're going to
get mad at you having a mad person's
attention is better than no attention
right that's why kids act up in class
this is the human nature you want some
kind of attention and the point of
writing and speaking a lot of times is
to get people to pay attention to your
ideas so the more creative you are with
language be you know up into a certain
point of declining returns the better an
outing and verbing is an easy way to do
that some words are formed by back
formation so you do have to change the
word to get what you want a lot of
people believe that the word edit came
first in English and then you got editor
because we do this alone we have a verb
and then we add an or ending or in
reading and then you have the person
that does the verb but actually the
English editor came first we thought
well what editors do they edit right so
that's a back formation you move
backwards along the chain that it would
normally take my favorite one is Buttle
that's what Butler's do but there's
bottle it's not yet that's another kind
of facetious way that things work hmm oh
the frivolous they frivol oh that's a
great one it's a little harder to find a
picture of frivolous liquor than a
butler um also you can blend words so
you collapse two words into one this is
a lot of what Lewis Carroll did he
portmanteau d blended words breakfast
and lunch becomes brunch electro and
execute becomes electrocute yes
right you can change tenses so well
that's kind of part of verbing so you
have a portmanteau word he portmanteau
dit he Portman told it right over the
line right that would be better so a lot
of people nowadays like to make a lot of
words by making new acronyms and
abbreviations and initialisms right and
a lot of people feel that any word that
they don't know the origin of they can
explain it by backronym an acronym into
it so for instance a lot of people think
posh is for port out starboard home it's
not there's a lot of proposed acronyms
for the F word none of those are real
either there's a great site called word
origins which debunks almost all of
these things and there's guy the guy who
runs it as Dave Wilton and he has this
great imaginary cabal which he calls the
committee to ascribe nautical origins to
everything canoe is their acronym so
anytime somebody tells you oh that word
came from Napoleon and the British Navy
and so forth well British Navy was
pretty busy fighting Napoleon they
weren't spending their time coining new
words and acronyms but the difference
between an initialism is that
initialisms are pronounced each letter
at a time like FBI and a acronym is
pronounced as a word like NASA so if
you're going to construct a word by
taking the first letters of a bunch of
other words and try it like Mothers
Against Drunk Driving you want to if you
want it to be an initialism you don't
care if the letters make a word together
or not you're just going to say FBI
you're going to say NSA that sort of
thing if you want them to be pronounced
as an acronym you have to make sure that
can happen so if the initial letters of
your organization that you want to make
a word rks cutie that's going to have to
be an initialism unless you can think of
a better way to pronounce that than I
can so clipping is another way to make
words in English a short form removing
one or more syllables kind of like we
did with edit
editor but taxi cab right you can have a
taxi you can have a cab it doesn't
matter which part you want to cut off
either way is fine was there a question
right there
yes the question was everybody uses
acronym to mean both of those yes that's
fine if you want to do that that's okay
I just thought if you I like my
philosophy is the more words the better
so I like maintaining a distinction
between initialism and acronym just so I
have two words where if I only use
acronym that I only get 10 the question
at the back
can you give me an example of an acronym
that can either be an initialism an
acronym oh yeah remember Spanish is in
language we're not talking about today I
don't know why CIA didn't become SIA I'm
assuming that the guys who founded the
CIA would have just killed you if you
said it the way that you didn't like yes
oh because you can put it so if you had
KS cutie you could say kiss cutie is
scuzzy yeah apple wanted SCSI to become
sexy and it became scuzzy and that's
true for so many things in that pattern
right you try for sexy and you just hit
scuzzy that's bad uh-huh AARP yes that
goes AARP and art I wonder if there is a
demographic boundary so that older
people say AARP and younger people say
ARP or vice versa or the more likely the
more you likely or to be a member of ARP
the more likely you are to say art
whether it's insider outsider thing that
would be interesting to discover also
probably very expensive so there are
other ways to make new words and one of
them is to take names of things and make
them into words and something that
happened is gin gin comes from Genoa so
that's where we got the word gin and I
really liked this picture on flickr
because it's from Edward Gauri's house
he drew this label and put it on a
bottle for I don't know why it was just
up on flickr with no explanation and of
course you can also make words on amount
of poetically like splash and splish and
those are ways to make words although
i'm not sure if anna manapua is played
out i don't know how many more sounds
there are that we can represent with new
strings of characters has anybody seen i
was trying to find it last night and i
couldn't there's a database of all of
the letter strings used in comic books
for the sound that you represent on the
page when you punch somebody right so if
you're reading a comic book and they
have to convey a noise to you what
strings of characters do they use to
make that noise like if you punch
something soft it has a different sound
than if you punch something hard and
it's I don't know who makes that
decision if it's the artist or the
letterer the person who wrote the script
for the comic I don't know but there's a
big database of all of these things and
there's a similar one for main
where there are representations of the
the little symbols that show you what
emotional state somebody is in and those
are also represented in a way that we
would consider writing but they're
supposed to represent sounds or emotions
but i think is fascinating the sound the
sound that a dot matrix printer makes is
pre ow so how many E's would you give
that three e's somebody was doing
research the guy who just wrote if you
find an adjective kill it he was doing
how'd she been Yagoda he was doing
research into and I think he published
this on Slate he was doing research into
how how many days did you have to put in
awe to get across the right amount of
that so cute like ah and so he was of
course this is the kind of thing you
could search you could do pretty easily
online and i forget what his upper bound
was but somebody had a high key repeat
on their keyboard but there are lots of
ways that words change in addition to
these there's we're not really talking
about semantic change so much today not
taking an existing word and molding it
into a new mental meaning shape but
changes in the word over time are pretty
significant for example this is a hen
write and so sometimes hens narrow and
broaden so hens and chickens used to be
different things and then chicken
started to include hens and you can say
oh there are a bunch of chickens and you
don't have to say what gender they are
it encompasses hens and so we can extend
that figuratively saying he's knows
she's no spring chicken and then there
are regional preferences for example in
the United States we like to call the
male bird or rooster instead of the word
that they prefer in Britain which is
censored by a lot of Internet filtering
software that's pretty stupid
so words can and probably the most
famous um well actually that's there's
also errors and there's a technical term
for an error in English depakote error
in any language that becomes real or
accepted and that word is cata Croesus
and catechesis happens it happened a lot
more when there weren't as many people
writing for instance the word apron used
to start with an n it used to be nae
proun you had a nape Rijn and then I got
reanalyzed to an apron the same thing
happened with uncle which used to be
nuncle and orange so people misheard it
and they weren't really reading a lot
for this to recognize where their error
was and so the error became a standard
this happens a lot there are words in
English where people are you there was
just a post on the oupblog by ben zimmer
where he was talking about egg corns
which are kind of the partner of snow
cones and egg cornice is an error like
this it's a cat of Croesus where someone
miss here's something and re analyzes it
to give it a better backstory in their
mind so a famous egg corn comes from
that a woman heard a corn didn't really
know what an acorn was I thought Oh egg
corn acorns are kind of egg-shaped it
may it all makes sense it made sense to
her but these are often done with
phrases so for example free rain the
rain and free reign is the kind of rain
that you use to control a horse it's not
the kind of rain that a monarch has but
we have so many fewer horses in our
lives today and we still think more
about kings so people have reanalyzed
free reign and are using the monarch our
eid n instead of the horse our ein and
keeping that going and that is an egg
cord now for something like straitlaced
where it should be st a str AIT so many
people are using straight in the sense
of not curved instead of straight
without the GH
in fact it's something it's something
ridiculous like almost two-thirds of
people use what we would consider
etymologically wrong the straight
version but so at what point does
something like that become right well
that's what catechesis is and I don't I
think for most people the point when
that becomes right is the day after they
personally die right so even I think you
think I'm gone I don't care you kids do
whatever you want but when you're
looking at it lexicographically when do
you make the call mostly right now we
just cover ourselves with lots and lots
of usage notes where we say historically
people have used this now lots and lots
of people use this you can decide for
yourself whether you want to be part of
the possibly incorrect majority or they
possibly ridiculed but etymologically
correct minority one of the worst that's
changed a lot is nice that's kind of a
really good example of how words can
change over time for example nice used
to mean foolish and stupid and then it
meant lascivious and loose and then it'd
been extravagant and strange and then it
meant effeminate or unimportant what
those words get combined all the time
effeminate unimportant that I don't like
that so much over refined then I meant
careful intricate fastidious then it
started to get closer to what we
consider to be our modern meaning some
nice dainty appetizing refined cultured
agreeable pleasant and now people are
telling me that nice means bad and that
if you can't say something nice about
something you say it's nice right
because you don't want to give it a more
positive attributes so if I describe say
a seller on ebay as nice the very fact
that i'm not using a more effusive term
means that they weren't very good at all
so anytime you describe something is
nice you don't really like it that much
right otherwise you'd say it was awesome
or stupendous are great um so probably
by now you have a lot of questions right
you want to do it yourself you want to
get going and I really recommend a
fixing and compounding is your best bet
and a couple things before we write
things down on index cards what you
don't want to make is a nonce word and
there's a great example of a nonce word
that I saw where a burger place in
Cornwall associated with the King Arthur
I created something they called the
Excalibur ger that that's not it I just
thought that was the most representative
of an Excalibur ger that I could find so
obviously that that's not a word that
has a lot of currency it was used maybe
once for a special event and that's
called a nonce word for the nonce for
once if you make a word that's so time
specific or place specific that you
don't think it's going to be used
outside of that context that's the real
danger of it becoming a nonce word a
one-time-only word and maybe you want to
do that maybe you just want to have it
flame out across the heavens like a like
a meteor but if you want it to last a
long time think about making its context
broader another thing you don't want to
make us a stunt word dr. Seuss made a
lot of stunts words right is there a
weskit in your basket a neuro in your
Bureau he put in a lot of words that
were stunts they were just there to make
something work oftentimes marketing
firms who should know better try
introduce a new word for a product
that's not a trademark but just a new
word to make something look good yes
there was a Snickers ad campaign
satisfecho lint which I thought was a
terrible word it didn't sound
satisfactory or excellent that feck
sound is not a pleasant sound in English
yes I with another example comcastic so
these are stunt words they are not
supposed to work as words they're
supposed to work on a different level so
if you want your word to work as a word
think about how it will work as a word
and not as a piece of advertising or
marketing there's a linguist at in
Illinois his name is Alan Metcalf and he
wrote a great book called predicting the
success of new words and in it he talks
about the fudge factor which he feels is
how you predict whether a word is going
to be a success or not and it's an
acronym not an initialism and fudge
stands for the frequency in which a new
word is used the unobtrusive pneus of
the new word meaning it shouldn't call
attention to itself a diversity of users
if it's just you and your best friends
that's not too diverse
the generation of other forms does it
act like an English word if you verb it
does it have all its verb parts can it
compare as an adjective and also the
gate suffix of Watergate became very
productive you had travelgate you have
all sorts of gates Iran gate so that if
something goes into English and becomes
really productive that's a good sign
that you've done well and then the
endurance of the concept so he says of
word like y2k doesn't hang around
because what it referred to went away
too quickly for the word to really get a
good foothold so whether his fudge
factors work or not it's hard to prove
but it's better to know about them too
and then not know about them I just got
sent a new word by someone and it failed
almost all of these tests it was the
word was nor well Tony I'm not even sure
if I'm saying it right because I had to
email him back and ask him how to
pronounce it and he sent it to me and I
didn't stick in my head and so it's hard
to pronounce because I can't do it not
that that's usually a good sign because
I find lots of words hard to pronounce
it's a very big handicap in my job it's
not unobtrusive it spelled oddly and 0
are ELT and ETA is not a really common
string of letters in English and it
means to have all of your bodily
functions engage at the same time right
so it's if not unobtrusive in what it
means and the reference is very rare in
fact I'm not sure if it's actually
possible and so it's it's and also it's
a little too funny lmf also says that
funny words don't make it that if a word
is too funny it functions as a joke and
not as a word and so for a funny word to
work as a word it actually has to be not
all that funny so not a haha joke but it
kind of oh yeah that's a good one kind
of joke so let couch potato is his
example of something that is just not
funny enough to be a word so that yeah
couch potato that's kind of funny but
it's not really funny enough to impede
its working as a word instead of a joke
so I'm not sure if nor Elton e works as
a word because the joke eNOS of it is so
overwhelming but you know I just set it
to ollie on maybe I'll pick it up
oh also he said he's never ever seen it
used other than the three friends of his
who made it up so there aren't really
enough people right now so what do you
want to do if you want to get your word
in the dictionary in any dictionary
probably then way not to do it is to
like email it to me over and over again
also emailing higher executives at
Oxford University Press usually has very
bad results as well not that we have a
kill file but you never know what you
really want to do is if you've thought
about all the ways that a word can work
in English you pick the one that's most
attractive to you and ideally you'll
want to have a meaning that you want to
get across to people the word is not
usually an end in itself except maybe
for the door out me guys it's it's a
word as a tool you want it to do
something what do you want it to do and
then figure out who's going to be the
user of this word and tailor the word to
them so if you're making a new if you
say I'm tired of awesome I'm tired of
cool i'm tired of great i want another
word that i can follow with an
exclamation point when something's
really fun right so if you think about
the kind of people and the situations
that they're in when they want to have a
word that means awesome if you make it
15 syllables long that's too long to say
when something cool happens right that's
not user effective that's not thinking
about the users yeah so um and on the
other hand if you if you want a new word
to describe something beautiful and
elegant you probably want to stay away
from sounds that are associated with
words that aren't beautiful and elegant
I don't want to really get into sound
symbolism here but I think most speakers
of English know that say an alt or an
aunt sound is not as happy as say a
sound that's got you or ar e in it right
because uh the more grunty sounds in the
backyard throat not as not as beautiful
somehow to our ears as the e sounds that
you know make your face smile so that's
not a couple of things to think about
but really what you want to do to make a
word succeed is just get people to use
it I don't care what you have to resort
to bribery breviary doesn't work on me
unfortunately but I'm sure it works on
your friends
but you want to try anybody you know
who's a journalist you know say hey I've
found this great new word it works
better if you don't tell them that you
made it up yourself have you say oh I've
got this great new word and you don't
really explain how you got it that works
a little bit better and just see if you
can find a place for this word where
people will want to use it want to use
it to express what you want it to mean
and to get it out there to make it viral
to see as many people will use it as you
want now of course one of the ways to
get a word is to make a really great
website that everybody wants to use and
use that word as your url I'm really
having a hard time finding examples
right now yes well depending on whether
or not that word is a trademark you
might not want to make it into a verb
right off the bat but right you might
want to have it express its its inner
verb nature but for instance I've heard
people talk about library thinking their
collections right so Library Thing
compound got verb being able to be verb
daz a good thing for a word if you
wanted to succeed as a word it's not so
good a thing if you wanted to keep being
a trademark forever in a day but so
anyway before we run out of time if you
want to create a word and have me pass
judgment on it go ahead and write it on
an index card and pass it up to me and I
was going to give a prize for the best
word but we may not have time to do that
so maybe I should just give prizes
randomly those random good for people
randoms good is it anybody's birthday
today nobody's birthday anybody's
birthday yesterday your girlfriend you
must be present to win anybody's
birthday tomorrow you see where I'm
going with us right any birthdays this
week what why your parents all do in
nine months ago what
when your birthday is this week now um
this month all right so let's see july
twenty third that's next tuesday do we
have anybody who's got a birthday sooner
than next tuesday no we're not going
back in time all right you in a book
so oh and these are copies of verbatim
for people to take if they would like
one does anybody have a word ready
already you could have come pre prepped
with words if you wanted
oh I like this one religious the degree
to which food can be enjoyed after its
initial serving or when it's reheated
lasagna is religious what are some
things that aren't religious french
fries are not religious so this is from
Kevin I like that line that is everybody
like this one religious okay now we have
another one um this is good slippage the
phenomenon of breaking up with someone
but still continuing to sleep with the
person despite multiple resolutions to
stop I think this has a really good
feature as like a chiclet word right I
can see a pink novel with shoes on the
cover being called slippage I so and
also of spreadsheet in the act of
filling out a spreadsheet manually so
that's good you verbs spreadsheet that's
excellent does anybody else have one
before we know time do you want to hand
it up oh there's one
I like this one too tanta lysing
simultaneously appealing while mocking
the viewers desire that song by the
waitresses I know what boys want right
that's a tantalizing song when do you
say um I like that one too all right I
had other prizes they're kind of dorky
prizes but I they that's what I got so I
have a dress today measuring tapes very
fancy I just got them that's why I
brought them so of religious slippage in
tantalizing I've only got two which one
should get oh you want a late entry
improvable arrogant perhaps to the
degree of being overbearing when it's
somebody who's arrogant not overbearing
do we have arrogant people who aren't
overbearing you if you're not
overbearing are you really arrogant so
improve Shabo what what's the proof
coming from
ah
so he said the word just has been
floating in his head for a long time
well that's not bad I die once I used to
say when doing this that people didn't
just wake up from a dream with a new
word in their head and then somebody did
so I couldn't say that anymore here's
what dramatized which is a new sense for
a word traumatized by an excess of
personal drama like that and whacka days
ago really really extremely
lackadaisical so is that the that's not
the wac is in wacky that's the wac is in
its so whack right yeah you think
wacky's a back formation let's find out
I can look it up
Maggie from the noun whack + y so word
serve ative a person who resists the use
of new words I'm going to use this all
the time these so word serve ative mano
al vism the doctrine or belief that
there is but one Elvis
how many people belong to the Church of
mono L vism this may have a limited use
uh this is good ma full amount so full
of food so awful you don't know what to
do or can't expel or swallow so you're
at dinner with somebody that you need to
impress and they cooked for you and you
took a big bite and you're regretting it
right and that's am awful politics bo li
t IC s self-explanatory no no politics
in Bolivia the politics of Bolivia
that's all I'm coming up with it's a
Pokemon all right beulah tix the
politics of bulimia
oh it's from bollocks I think it should
have 2 l's in that case all right galien
8 the act of excluding gay people that's
not bad a by bibby Oh phobia oh I like
that aw phobia the fear of being stuck
somewhere without a book I suffer from
that all the time in fact I downloaded a
whole bunch of like plucker bucks to my
treo so that I would never suffer from
this again yes yes I took them out just
to talk it's kind of bulgy progress'
knowledge of the action you're about to
perform will come back to haunt you I
think I have heard this one before can
somebody open a handy search engine
perhaps and look for this word because i
think i've seen it there's also prevent
which is when you get revenge on
somebody before they do something bad to
you so all right I think we have time
for like one more right that's already
yes Barbara Walrath writes a great
column for The Atlantic called word
court where people write to her and say
I have this problem and it needs a word
and people write in four ones they do
they all are a little bit funny which i
think is good for this context because
otherwise you guys would be really
really bored but some of them may be too
sniglet e to catch on you might have to
repeat them a lot and let the joke wear
off but pre gret i think i've seen two
thousand hits for pre gret now when
people come to me and say I've invented
a word it's great it's new and then i
say go to a handy search engine and look
it up okay i use the verb google they're
going to kill me for this but i do i use
the verb google all the ties it go
google it but I do intend for them to
use the google search engine um so
yes so so I tell people to google their
new words before they come back to me
and oftentimes they're really upset that
somebody else thought of it first but I
think that's actually a joyful thing
because this means that you're part of
like the communion of the English
language you and other people have this
connection you've both thought of this
word and how to use it and there's a
deep kind of human similarity between
you and this stranger thousands of miles
away that you may never have ever had
anything else in common with them except
this one word so I think you should be
happy when you come up a wave of the
word that somebody else has already come
up with and maybe you should drop that
person in email and say hey nice word
you know do something nice to celebrate
your connectedness and not say that jerk
took my word this happened to me with a
journalist in Buffalo who said he coined
this great word San tag Gnostic it's you
don't know whether or not you believe in
Santa right your ass aunt agnostic and
so um he said well google it and there
were five other people who'd used it and
I think he was depressed for the rest of
the week and I felt really bad but
better that then he find out later that
it wasn't his term when he tried to
trade market or something so I did want
to put up the URL for my blog in case
you have other questions and I am going
to put these up the ones that people
said to put up and I undid also want to
point out that i'm using a Creative
Commons images from Flickr one because
they're great and fun and people take
wonderful photographs and because I can
and because I have this hope that I will
release these presentations as creative
commons and that someone somewhere will
give a talk using all of my slides in
the same order but giving a completely
different talk this is my goal with a
Creative Commons presentation right what
the other top could you make with all
these images in this order nobody's ever
taken me up on it but I've only been
doing it for about my months so who do
we think should get the tape measures I
like a bÃ­blia phobia religious i think
is awesome
and I would give it to religious and
word serve ative is there can we do this
by show of hands do you agree yes no
yeah all right i'll take that as
grudging a cent all right so if you want
it if you want a handy pocket tape
measure oh wait you can't walk I'll
bring you yours who is word serve ative
do you want to come up and grab it all
right uh you know I was going to hand
out we didn't really have time which is
sad because dan made all these copies
for me and now I feel really bad but
this is a list of prefixes suffixes and
combining forms so if you didn't have
enough raw material in your head to make
up new words right now you should take
one of these and experiment with it it's
a nice kind of random creativity game to
select three or four of these just at
random and see what word comes out of
them if you put all the different parts
together things like RKO kakoe koyla
which is an ancient bad hernia right so
just putting those things together right
from the first page so if you want one
of these or copy of verbatim please come
up and take it and thank you guys so
much for your kind attention I really
appreciate it
you
