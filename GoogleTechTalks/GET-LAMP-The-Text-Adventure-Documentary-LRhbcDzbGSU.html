adventure games or do stuff with it
one do Don's not gonna put his hand up
but yeah exactly
well it's as the movie will go into
obviously right there's different eras
and that's us the way it works so anyway
I'll start the I'll start the thing soon
but before I do it was there anything
pre I guess a pre question somebody had
like what what is this I just sit down
and anything that comes in this room so
um I'm where's the well you'll find a
lot of fun finding the lamp in this
movie the are you seeing where's the
actual physical lamp I just could not do
I was here for two weeks I could not get
that lamp and everything else into my
suitcase I have a bunch of lamps that I
keep around you can get them very cheap
from a place in Vermont now but I
couldn't cheat them cheap when I got
them but anyway the I make historical
documentaries and so this is my latest
historical documentary I hope to do more
and I'm a little bit more about the
people than I am about the technical
stuff the technical stuff is in there
and they're definitely a geeky movie but
I believe that the hardest part to get
is the stories from the people who were
alive and what they thought about it and
everything else so you'll see there's a
very humanist view but I'm not allowed
to go delve into a little bit about code
so definitely geeky so um let's see I
guess I mean is everything working am i
people seeing me from the world of
Google elsewhere and everything else
sure does the movie have closed captions
um I can turn on closed captions okay
alright we're going to do the movie with
closed captions in point of fact every
single feature on the movie is closed
captioned yeah I am very big about that
I myself have unbalanced hearing and so
put me in a party room and I'd sound
really dumb because I can't hear you so
I was very big on closed captioning
everywhere and I want to work with some
people to do a video description version
of this because blind players play a
pretty big deal in texted
mm-hmm so so Ken who's over here did a
lot of the work on the closed captioning
that happens automatically with some
some youtubes and he's done good work on
that all right this will be recorded for
YouTube and on YouTube
if you're a logger you give five quick
facts about yourself so I'm going to
give you five quick facts about Chase
and then I'm going to let him go you
probably know the first few text files
com
he's the curator of an awesome archive
of bulletin board culture and if you
haven't gone there look at the top 100
list they're a lot of fun
number two BBS the documentary he's the
director of that documentary which was a
I don't know five years ago someone that
while ago
he's on teams of various archiving
projects things like grabbing copies of
major sites like geo cities before they
go offline his cat has more than one and
a half million followers on Twitter the
cat is named stocking tenant he might
have heard and five he was recently told
by a major American Weekly magazine that
his title of computer historian is not
an actual profession in he had to change
his profession so go to it yeah that was
People magazine I don't afraid to say
that not like I'm gonna get into that
again for anything that I would want to
be they wanted my cat in it so my cat is
in People magazine and and then he made
the yearbook because I guess he was one
of the top important events of 2010 that
is one well fed cat anyway so but but
yeah the the the the reporter came back
and said the editor really can't take
computer historian do you have anything
else and I was like historian nearly
okay
so even though a lot of us want to think
that a lot of things are finished
actually there's quite a bit ways to go
so as said my name is Jason Scott I do a
bunch of computer history I'm really big
into archiving old material and data
preservation digital heritage I'm a big
loudmouth I've set things both pro and
con Google over the years but pro and
con everyone else because I have my
things all I want is that somebody in 50
years can choose to see something that
we can see now when possible so that's
an easy way to put it but one of the
things I've discovered was in doing my
archiving was that when I was really
good at getting old things like notes
and pieces of paper and lots of photos
and stuff that doesn't really help you
much if the person who wrote the stuff
is has got no way to tell you their
story
so I started to do a documentary called
BBS documentary that was 205 interviews
it took four years and it came out as a
three DVD set so it was just I went from
there being no BBS movie to the last BBS
movie the final one and so after that I
said what else affected my life and I
thought let's do text adventures what
could possibly go wrong so here we are a
few years later and I have now done a
high-definition movie about text
adventures and this is a this has 75
interviews so it's a mere pittance
compared to the previous one and it goes
into a whole variety of things now to
explain what you're seeing here because
in some place it's going to seem a
little weird
the movie is optionally interactive
where it goes and plays you an
introduction and then lets you choose
which direction to you go but then
there's the non interactive version and
that just goes up and then steps through
the the three main parts and I think
that's a much better ideal for this
crowd because you guys are really
technically astute and there's all sorts
of interesting things about it about all
the process so again it's a it's a got a
hit it's got historical sides too it's
got the capitalist side which is so
important to some people and then it's
got the other side of like who are the
people who would play these and who are
the people who would make these and some
of them are in the audience and
authentic as'll introduced them at the
end or just mentioned so there's
old-school in the house so I'm saying
alright old school is in the house
and just whatever I do have copies here
if somebody feels like buying them just
because I brought a stack of they'll
each come with a coin a gold and silver
coin because that's the best way to be
an indie filmmaker is to make gold coins
that come with your DVD anyway so again
we're going to play this one and we're
going to play it with the subtitles on
and I hope you enjoy it it's called get
lamp let's uh put this here mute up the
mic macness that do that right
very very accessible
there is a machine that you must operate
but you have to figure out what machine
it is what its function is what it does
why you need to operate it
you have to figure out what that thing
is
what is an adventure game and what makes
it so interesting for people it's a in a
world right now we're going to graphics
a lot it seems to be basic based in
words you interact with the computer in
words and the computer spits words back
out at you and so there are no pictures
at all except the ones in your head
which are the best now these are the
kind of games that well mostly I guess
kids play with and they they go through
different branching schemes and every
point you get a chance to go north south
east and west and so forth so these are
these games getting more sophisticated
now who's writing them are they being
written by authors away they're
definitely getting more sophisticated
and I wouldn't even say that they're
mostly played by children anymore you
can talk to other characters you can ask
fairly complicated questions like where
were you on the night of the murder the
thing that really interests me about
text adventures is that they explore the
power of words in an interactive context
you're looking at a story told through
text on the computer it's a virtual
reality that exists in words interactive
digital rhetoric that describes an
experience it really was more like
playing a book than playing a game I say
to them here's a form of literature you
may or may not have seen before
typically what I end up having to do is
I fumble around and talk about for a
little while and I say here sit down for
a sec let me show you something and
demonstrate
for me this adventure has gone on for a
lifetime
it's working on a problem that's bigger
than you are it's one you can't solve in
five minutes or ten minutes
I started caving in the late 60s and
then got involved in organized caving in
the late 70s I definitely had been
caving and surveying caves before I
latched on to the idea that there was
this game out there that so closely
related to to the caves and and and
described in a manner that would appeal
to a caver
well I knew well white before the game
existed and I do know that my son Tom
Becker spent several weeks down here
with Will Crowder his wife at the time
they were intensely looking at the cave
called bed-quilt caved a very confusing
part of the cave we have something like
10 lineal miles of cave within one
square mile of land bed growth is one of
the highest density of cave passages
that you find anywhere in the whole case
system for fascinated with how tightly
twisted and three-dimensional bed cave
turned out to be and it was even more
tightly twisted than appears to a casual
person just passing through it it's just
really fun to discover in big rock caves
these places where you can squeeze up
through something and end up somewhere
else it's just filled with places like
that that I know is the origin of the
game adventure that will subsequently
invented the walls really started
tumbling down for me and I really
started learning a lot more when I
started shifting going into the cave
research foundation learning what I
learned about it reading Rucker and
Watson is the longest cave they would
use their compass readings and their
bearings they would start from a known
position and they would take the
distance and bearing and measure from
one place to another along the whole
process they would be taking notes about
the shape of the tunnels the the shape
of the size features in the tunnel
they'd be mapping while they were going
so there is a sort of a I don't call it
decorative but the artistic atmospheric
recording along with the scientific
coding of exactly where something is in
relation to something else and what you
need to do to get from one place to the
other
I think if they were able to compare our
maps and the game on one level it would
be completely dissimilar but on another
there's a certain similarity the general
directions east-west north-south
up-down all hold generally true as you
go through the part the Crowther Road I
know others have added little touches to
it now and then but the genius was his
in working out a diagram of the
passageways in the bed quote I don't
think it was really promoted as a as a
cavers game although I was really proud
that will it could have made adventure
go any direction it wanted to but to sit
there and we what better way to take a
real cave and have real north-south
east-west up/down directions that
actually were based in reality but one
of his daughters said to me that to her
will crowler is just her dad and it's
surprising to her that he's the JD
Salinger of interactive fiction he's
chosen to make it speak for himself and
he hasn't tried to um leverage it or
anything so I just you got to respect
somebody like that
so I was at Stanford my first year as
grad student there one of the other
first-year grad students had a job at
the Stanford Medical Center as John
Gilbert and he came across this program
that had somehow migrated onto the
computer there I managed to get a copy
of it from that system onto really
Stanford AI lab machine where I had an
account so I began having lots of ideas
for ways to modify it and make it a more
cohesive or just have more stuff to do
in it
but in terms of the layout of the cave
the items you could find the goals you
had I kept all of that I didn't realize
at the time that this was going to be
starting a new genre and I sort of
realized it was unlike anything I had
encountered up to that point and so you
know maybe subconsciously I would favor
I asked I would have realized yeah this
is something new still I wouldn't have
guessed it was going to catch on so much
I was it was 1979 and a friend of mine
had just come back from Sierra College
going nuts saying oh my god there's
games up at the college and they're free
everybody was talking about it for a
period there in 1978 it it came out of
nowhere and it get copied all over the
place in our dorm there was a computer
room which had two old deck line printer
terminals and they said there's this
game you've got to try out it's called
adventure it's really great they had all
these incredibly cool Lisp machines with
big gorgeous displays and a bunch of
people are huddled around a machine
that's got text yeah you'd sit there
with a little 300 baud telephone modem
and type in a line you know get lamp and
wait a minute two minutes and then shhh
you know they would type the thing out
so adventure took us over to the lab
over consumed everyone for a while the
game by Crowther in Woods was uh was a
sensation I had to sign in as JQ public
and the password was take you public and
everybody was playing it and then nobody
got any work done for a week as the
legend goes and it's absolutely true all
productivity ceased for about a week
as people attempted to solve it you know
that's something that in the 70s to be
able to type commands to a computer in
something that looked like English and
to have it responds to you with lines of
text telling you what happens next
that's um captivated people we got down
to the point finally where Bruce went in
with a binary debugger to get the last
couple of points
I was working at stromberg-carlson
just outside of Orlando and they had a
deck mainframe there and one of the guys
in the IT department said hey we got a
really neat game on the mainframe but
we've been playing and you might want to
take a look at it and it was colossal
caves so I got permission or to have to
get on to the game I would come in every
morning before work for an hour or two
and then I would stay for an hour after
work so I could play the game and I
played it for about a week and I was
just blown away by it it was a lot of
fun this was about the same time that I
had gotten my first appliance computer
to me appliance computer was when I
didn't have to build from a kit which
was kind of unique when it was a trs-80
model one this adventure game was really
fun I've been trying to think of a good
game to write adventure seemed wow this
is perfect the fellows in the IT
department said well you want to take a
look at the source code for this game as
a no I'm I'm not really interested in
that I just like the concept I said well
this thing runs on the mainframe there's
no way you're going to get it into a 16k
trs-80 model one and that was
Adventureland this was back in 1978 and
that's where it all started Adventure
National played adventure games
literally we were the first as far as I
know in the world first computer gaming
company that was selling computer games
primarily that was it that was what we
were doing we're selling computer games
and we were doing it to a mass-market
it just came up last night I was
watching a movie from the early 80s
because we thought maybe the kids would
enjoy that and my wife was telling the
girls you know what time this was it's a
long time ago is before we were married
it was when daddy was doing Zork and
those things and and my seven-year-old
said what's Zork I think there were two
products that sold more computers to
anything else visicalc
and Zork
we would go after school to this store
and play whatever games were available
type games in and I remember Zork coming
out and playing it on an apple too and
we were just completely blown away
people would cease work and they go I
got to have me one of them that's all
who do I beg to check out to you have
someone who helped on adventure played a
little bit of his orc and in his comment
was that you don't go into Zork to play
you go to his orc to do battle oh I
actually completed zerk and that was
probably in itself like the biggest
accomplishment I made you know
and the company was literally founded
and named before we had any idea what
kind of products we were doing so by
definition you want a name that can
pretty much go anywhere so infocomm
sounded like it could be a
billion-dollar company you have no idea
what it did but it sounds substantially
the people who formed infocomm these
were very talented folks from the
computer science department at MIT if
you know what the word schlump means I
don't think there were any at the at the
company there were no average people in
if you had some technical knowledge and
some understanding of what the disk
capacity was and you care to count
characters you wondered how is it
possible that they got so much text on a
disk exam I time
fundal diversions and then I head in for
 so like wow this is really really
good very professionally done so I knew
that every time an infocomm game came
out it was going to be extremely high
quality you know it's it was really kind
of the Renaissance for as far as game
packaging design because they put out
some really gorgeous looking packages
that really we have not seen anything
like since then keep in mind these were
not collector's editions these were the
standard versions of the packaging you
know all the other games were kind of
crappy package everything but they're on
the Shelf was this one game which was
like in a dossier with this detective
thing going on it was deadline and I saw
that and I found out it was like a
technology at ex verge of a really
advanced tech special I saw that I said
oh this is it I got to do this I think I
felt lucky at the time I definitely you
know
looking back now 20 years later you know
feel really really lucky when you were a
programmer you wrote payroll packages I
mean you you know you wrote software for
scientific instruments I was working on
a fertilizer mixing system in basic you
know something like that or you did some
kind of research but this idea that you
could somehow make a living doing what
we were doing well you know the fun
you're having making games and
everything it's ridiculous it's a job
that didn't exist when I first started
my working life and in a sense it
doesn't exist anymore now talking about
how wonderful it was and it it really
was I mean I can say for me it was a sad
truth that it was the best job I've ever
had and and a job I don't think I could
ever get again I remember telling
friends that if I could have any job at
all I think would be this one there's a
fun factory you know and they put in the
play-doh and they we press the button
and outcome all these interesting things
but they didn't know how that process
worked at all not a job it was an
amazing creative experience with an
amazing creative group and I do think it
was something very special and unusual
you would hear conversations there at
infocomm and other game companies that
you never hear would hear anywhere else
in your life one day we were talking
about the properties of bakwin oh and in
the middle of it we stopped and said no
one's gonna believe we're actually
discussed this at work you know so
you're walking down the hall and out of
somebody's office is going well you know
the elf is drunk but I've given him the
wand of disappearing and we called an
interactive fiction not text adventures
and you know part of that is being a
little bit grand about the medium and
its possibilities but part of it was I
think it was a more accurate term I
think there was a time period probably
80 to 84 sort of range where for a lot
of the machines
compared to anything else out there
there was just nothing that compared we
have three or four games in the top 20
of soft-sell all-time in 83 84 85 we
were we were definitely one of the more
important publishers and possibly one of
the most respected all the other games
companies back then had adventure games
those came from the Texas Adventure era
so you know a lot of people owe
everything to Texas adventures when I
started the goal was to push to get
envelope the goal was to create
something different new and exciting
something nobody had ever seen or
experienced before we were able to
compress things in ways that delivered
so much more than anything else you felt
like you're you're joining us like a
special brainy Club by buying these
products and you know I put my
star-crossed poster up on the wall and
sat there with all my accessories around
me and I was happy as a clam people were
allowed to buy it when they saw those
kids when they when they found how much
they got how many hours of entertainment
they got out of those games the whole
feel of it the marketing everything has
just had this very friendly smart people
feel about it know how to put it without
sounding snobby but it just it was for
it was for literate people was for
people who like to read
Cathy I guess you know as well as I do
that most people at one time or another
have played the space invader type games
on their computers but have you ever
thought of a game in which you sort of
match wits with a computer kind of a
whodunit situation in which what you do
dictates the outcome of the game sounds
interesting yes
and what you're doing is allowing the
person to essentially be Raymond
Chandler and and program their way
through to the end maybe the other
that's exactly right in some ways it's
like a book in some ways it's like a
game
we wrap ourselves in a game and become a
participant
a new type of story in which your
decisions and your active participation
affects the outcome
what will they think of next
this is the kind of thing that we're
going to be playing with into the 21st
century
um certainly I think I speak for you
know all of us when you know when I say
that we definitely didn't Oh
spend enough time kind of thinking about
how lucky we were at that time you know
we kind of assumed oh well this is what
it's always going to be like this is
going to go on forever you know much
like youth itself you know there wasn't
much reflection on oh this is you know
this is just a you know a star and in a
year and three years it'll all be gone
the thing that I was so taken by was
this idea you were literally stepping
into a world it's as if the player and I
are in a room together it's me in him
and it's what are you going to try and
how am I going to respond you can make a
choice and your choices have
ramifications and you think about that I
think as a kid you don't get to make a
lot of choices about your life you know
you don't get to choose where you live
you don't get to choose where you go to
school you don't get to choose your
classes even exploring discovery seeing
what's around the next corner for a kid
it's really appealing to be able to you
know in this fantasy world essentially
make your own choices in life that level
of dynamic interaction and that number
of tree branches was unheard of
the idea of coming up with these huge
worlds where there's so much that you
can see and do when I play dork I felt
like I was in that world and the
computer screen disappeared and it was
it was like reading a book only even
cooler than reading a book in certain
ways because I could do things in that
world it lets you see other people's
points of view I think you get to see
the worlds that other people live in
they had such a craft to them they
really sat down and did this the way the
game worked is it drew your mind into
the game completely but the flip side of
that is it took an investment of time on
your part to get into the game because
it wasn't just simple I mean you know
there were things that took 20 steps to
solve a problem and yet to figure out
every one of those 20 steps it was all
you thought about for a month you know
while you were working on this thing
right you know in some in some cases it
would take you like a year to finish one
of these it was really it was this
communal sense of let's see if we can
tackle this thing and the puzzles were
just so numerous and so massive it
almost felt like you needed to have
someone helping and when someone would
have a big breakthrough we'd go rushing
down and say oh I think we have to do
this and you know it would work or not
work and the maps would come out and
notes would get made because they you
know there wasn't the internet for the
instant hints and all that so you
actually had to sit down and bash your
head against it yourself and zorkin the
radio shut you couldn't play along
because you had three guys your shoulder
no dude you know you the focus plastic
yeah you know so uh
solitaire and it was a team sport too
most people would not imagine that it
could be Saturday's at 7:00 in the
morning was when everybody came up to
the college to watch this guy play
adventure so that was where I basically
got my exposure was watching somebody
else played it wasn't able to actually
play it myself so it was a long process
it wasn't kind of like a week's worth of
gaming we said oh that was kind of cool
I wonder what's next I think most people
who are working on the games thought
that the most special thing about them
was the obsessive nature of puzzle
solving and how you could be you know
playing the game and trying things
nothing's working and you're tearing
your hair out and trying to be like give
up and you turn the computer off and you
go stomping away and the next day you're
at work and not even thinking about it
and suddenly oh my god and then you
can't like wait to get home to like try
what you just thought of you know and
you go like running in and you turn on
the computer and you try it and it
worked
it's very rarely that I find myself
playing a game of if' without taking
notes you couldn't hold the map in your
head you had to map it out there's lots
and lots of objects you had to make
notes of where everything was and what
was - used for and what you hadn't
figured out yet personally I like taking
notes I like having my own little you
know notch on the bedpost as where that
I figured this out of opposites sort of
like my own little personal progress bar
has to have been able to accomplish in
these games and I think gain adventure
games probably appealed to people who
are very methodical and very logical in
the way they do things because mapping
is a huge part of playing any adventure
text adventure like colossal cave was
relatively straightforward and that if
you left a room from the north you would
then exit that room again to the south
and you'd wind up where you started but
Zork had these passages that apparently
went out of the room to the north and
then you twisted and turn and spun and
such that it going south again might get
you two entirely different room mappings
was quite time-consuming and we were
working out in a huge line printer paper
from the original 14 inches wide 15
inches wide that comes off those high
speed line printers and even that we had
several sheets taped together by the
time we were done I mean it was it was a
big complex environment that they put
together I can draw a map that not only
tells me how things are connected in
space but also where objects were that I
have picked up you can note on the map
where you got them you can note where it
seems like there's a some obstacle and
you can start thinking about puzzles as
well
this parallel is exactly the de mapping
of a large cave system and it's only
when you do that you begin to comprehend
what the pattern is in caving you try to
find the pattern once you know the
pattern you know the process that
created the cave and you can see the
missing parts of the pattern
aneesa's are sort of a special case in
if' like people have a pathological
aversion to mazes which is you know like
you I don't know you you like ring a
bell then like you kick a dog a bunch of
times and like it starts like crying
after you ring the bell a couple times
so that's how people in the if'
community feel about mazes
oh my god amazed kill me now
and there's there's nothing there's
nothing intrinsically wrong about mazes
but people have like a built-in aversion
to them by now so that's that's kind of
a special case III thought mazes were
old-school from the beginning myself
mazes were a staple of early interactive
fiction it seems as though virtually
every story had at least one or two
mazes that you had to somehow map your
way around in and figure your way out of
the ultimate adventure game cliche is a
maze
so there was always a like you know
another base oh please or you know this
one is too ridiculous when you're
encountering something for the first
time it seems really cool um when I
played orc I was like oh this maze what
a brilliant idea and then 50,000
iterations later it just does not seem
so brilliant if' is actually pretty
crummy at literal spatial mazes 3d
graphics do that much better you can
create enormous immersive expansive
environments that are highly confusing
that you wander around in and you do all
your wandering visually and physically
typing go north go east go south go east
go north go east at a certain point you
start to long for a joystick the worst
thing you can ask a player to do is sit
down with a pad of paper dropping items
in each room so they can keep track of
what these different rooms are and then
be able to put all the little lines
together essentially it just becomes
tedium and it takes you out of that
immersion into the world my goal
whenever I wrote a game that had amazing
it was to produce a maze that if you got
the trick became trivial there may be
limits to what mazes can do I don't
think they can impress on us you know
powerful new ideas about the world
old-style mazes in 3d games and console
games and
in and I have always will work to burn
more hours and create more kind of
consumable playtime but if you're not
understanding the way the author is
thinking and having insights what's the
point if you sit down in front of a text
adventure for the first time the first
thing that is going to happen is you're
going to type something and the
computer's not going to understand it
that's a real experience
the misconception is that that's the
intended interaction of the game and
that's what the author has spent office
time thinking about the truth is of
course that the author has this huge set
of assumptions about what you know the
author thinks that your you've got a
good grounding and how most of these
games work and he spent office time
thinking about how he can make this
well-known text adventure interface
unique and interesting for his situation
which is great for our community because
we're all familiar with it it's a total
failure for newcomers I wish I had the
fantastic story to tell you about how
I've solved this problem I do not
people I think misunderstand the nature
of interactivity thinking that it
requires giving the player absolute
freedom like if you're an inexperienced
player you might think that you can be
able to write just take over Kingdom and
have it work something is mentioned just
because it adds a distinctive flavor to
the room but the players response is oh
you mentioned rocks here let me try and
pick up a rock
someone's gonna type examine son and if
you haven't implemented the son as a
separate object they're gonna you know
say haha that's a mistake this sucks
because the more freedom you give the
player the more the player has the power
to do things you did not anticipate and
to do things you did not want it means
like a you know like a funhouse ride or
you know at the amusement park you're on
Rails you really are on Rails and you
know to a large part and you can sort of
travel off to these tributaries but
you're still ultimately on Rails a
player and the author have an illusion
of interacting it is just an illusion
but you know when we go to the movies
and we watch a movie we don't think
we're really in the place where the
movie is representing there's all kinds
of illusions the willing suspension of
disbelief happens everywhere it's like a
Wisie it's like a lies you get an answer
but has nothing to do with what you're
doing and at some point you realize it's
a fake you know frankly we couldn't as
implementers we couldn't anticipate
well not only could we not anticipate
everything we couldn't anticipate half
of what was expected so what happens is
the worlds get bigger and as you open up
the vocabularies they get sparser
because there's less real information
and it's mostly noise it's just there to
convince you that the world is there and
that was mostly not because the
implementers weren't smart about it
it was because of the severe limitations
on the number of just the sheer
vocabulary you could have in the game
the total text in a typical infocomm
game maybe would equal like a 30 page
novella I mean Zork the size of a Zork
game is that I think around 88 K or
something like a total it's very tiny it
only didn't even use all of our children
and and whispering our bank right up
against that 128 K limit that the
original system had it was very hard to
do any kind of deep exploration of the
subject because you just not room for
the text you can't handle everything but
somebody might try what you want to do
is you want to handle the most common
things that people will try and the most
interesting things that people will try
as a player of interactive fiction it's
very easy to not appreciate the work
that went into it
you just come across one error message
or one response that the designer didn't
think of and you think oh well forget
this game after you've actually gone
through and had to think of all those
things and code them and write to
yourself your perspective really changes
and how much of the very limited
resources that you have do you want to
expend on letting the player go down in
that direction so in a lot of cases what
we just did in that case is just kill
the player
yeah it's almost what is what is left
unsaid unrevealed in a lot of cases you
don't know exactly what that dragon
would look like and I never would anyway
but to you know to have that gap where
you fill in your conception of a dragon
it will be your ultimate dragon you take
stock of your positions you're wearing a
head you have ones open a financial
mythic here's on your keyboard by the
way you can check the amount of cash
you're holding at any time with the cash
command or just like another followed by
return by G's appear to the wing it's
like you would pretend you would have
magic right but you don't know what it's
really like I mean you don't really know
what it's like to have magic I mean you
could read a lot about what's you can
read science fiction and sort of put
yourself in the place of a telepathic or
magical character but you really don't
know what it's like and I think that's
sort of the same it's like playing two
beasts at you I'm playing at being cited
as weird it's funny playing games like I
actually if did that actually does trip
me out sometimes I have to you know in
games you have to have like a lantern or
a flashlight or something to provide a
source of light I don't think about that
it's like you go do it's like it's pitch
black you can't see it I'm like okay if
you play something like zorg everything
is described and sighted people don't
always do that so you not only here get
a sense of place and how places work and
how you move through them but you also
get a sense of objects you can examine
you know every pretty much everything
you pick up in that game and it'll have
a description so it's very helpful the
thing about text adventures is they
really help you build mental Maps
especially if you don't cheat and write
anything down and I know that the more I
played text adventures the more
effective I wasn't navigating a strange
place that's it
there aren't limits you can explore a
world with all your senses I think for
the Bunge it's actually really
liberating because you can't explore
world with site for instance haunted
theater I played that in university and
I never would have realized that so much
you know location was involved so many
different areas were involved in the
notes
eyal movie theater my last game I
deliberately put in a section the game
that allows a blind player to play it
it's screen scraper friendly so that it
would read out loud the game to them and
allow them to play and that was done
because I was approached by blind
players asking me to do that that was a
kind of a an eye-opener for me to make
me think about the necessity of doing
that get me to meeting about the
Allegiant all the same the first time
that we went to the Consumer Electronics
Show in Chicago I was finishing work on
C Stalker and working in our booth on
the floor got a chance to give a short
demo for a group of school teachers who
were there and after just the source
demo ever given they said oh this is
wonderful this is just where our
students need it's on their level
they'll be interested to learn from it
and I felt really good about that I
started teaching in 1968 this last year
is my 38th year teaching with
interactive fiction poses some real
really significant challenges for
teachers it's not an easy technique it's
a wonderfully powerful technique it's
great for helping heads to solve
problems outstanding for improving kids
reading comprehension unique in its
power to help kids read with greater
fluency writing for interactive
environments is a class looking at the
traditional story structure and then
discussing also how it takes place in
games drawing analogies to film and
other popular media I give them two
weeks at the start of the two weeks
they've never before seen a piece of
interactive fiction it maybe have never
played a text adventure and they've
certainly never programmed inform and at
the end they have to turn something in
so that's the experience
so our first things we do in that
classes we work on what are good
characters and then what a good settings
for stories and the house interactive
one another then we talk about things
like puzzle structures what's a good
puzzle it's a good riddle in my case
when I'm using if' in teaching it's not
really for the if' it's not for the
interactive fiction at all it's in its
memories for the idea of simulating
space and also just to give my students
some weird environment that they've
never worked in usually they become very
interested very quickly and will ask to
try some more of that story the next day
or very soon thereafter write a
character but write in four different
ways show me him from the perspective of
his father show me him from the
perspective of his friend who hates him
now because they had an altercation in
the past I mean this is the only form of
literature that has built into it
aesthetically designed pauses in the
process of reading that are that are
perfect from a teacher's point of view
you know among my students who like
interactive fiction the least a certain
number complained that it made them
think too hard and I really don't mind
if people complain that I make them
think actually learn a new form of
literature and it along with many of the
other challenges that go with teaching
in the current era it you know it makes
it difficult for for teachers to work
even if they have one another to support
for them the real challenge is getting
them to actually sit down and read a
serial linear closed narrative for them
reading is a chore it's and that I find
that it's funny I put myself both ways
Mike about it's heartbreaking that they
think that reading is a dead thing but
at the same time they're writing for a
world where they're going to have to
craft these broken up chopped up sliced
and diced narratives for different
mediums and they're going to have to
to adapt broken up chopped up sliced and
diced narratives chopped up broken up
and they're going to have to learn to
that my doctorate is officially in
English literature my field is new media
no discipline has been extremely excited
about owning text adventure games
they've found academic safe harbor in
whatever individual was most passionate
about them but I mean of course Maryanne
buckles doctrine and German literature
right I think that topic
unfortunately chose me
they were just so happy it looked like
they were having a great time
that's what I remember of the first my
first contact with adventure that oh
these people love this they are totally
involved in it if you stood at the
beginning of films if you stood at the
beginning of radio if you stood at that
moment and you knew this is important
this isn't just something to toss aside
this is really really important
could you go back and write about Georg
taka in his in his poetry about purple
beasts I mean it's beautiful poetry and
I loved I loved that poetry but that's
unimportant if this topic was important
someday there is going to be a genius
and absolute genius who writes something
so brilliant so involving so magnificent
that you'll just weep for joy doing
these games because they make you
involved in the story that's just so
different than than anything else that
we've ever had I don't know if my fate
will be to be left in some sort of
academic dustbin of history or if this
will be a brilliant coup that will
become the cornerstone of a voluminous
career but I do know that it was time
well spent and that when I look at what
I've done I think even if not me I hope
somebody comes along and builds on this
they were having so much it was a moment
when people were having so much fun it
was a ball that was really fun that was
really and I thought oh if everybody
were doing this all of society would be
better because we'd all be happier we'd
all play with each other a little bit
more it'd be you know like being kids
again
- now go away
but if you actually solve adventure no I
never did I never did
I'm never dude let's let's have a little
thought experiment here right you're
playing in a virtual world it's got
these pictures and they're looking
pretty good
anything oh that's pretty good no no I
these pictures are nice right pretty oh
yeah they're only I'm it's a 3d world
but I'm only seeing 2d on the screen so
maybe if I got like the little headset
on and put down and now I can see in 3d
but if I move my head a bit too much oh
well maybe we put little sensors also I
can move my head I and now I can see it
properly I yes it's all hearing and but
still only seeing things and maybe I
could have maybe some feeling as well so
I'll put the data clip on oh yes always
feels warm over that's good but I'm
still I'm not hearing things over the
goggles on art and I've got this sense
of being in a place and maybe I want to
be able to move so I tell you well let's
get these big like copying things and
fill them full of these gels that'll
take up all my clothes and put on all
these different devices and lay down it
and then it put these little electric
currents through and make it feel hard
or soft so gives me the impression that
I'm actually walking through grass
because it's generating and now now
begin to feel I mean really in one of
these places but it costs really what's
all that's happening here is the term
and my senses are being fooled into this
what what happen if I was maybe just cut
out the whole business with the finger
let's take a little jack in the back of
your head and it goes right into the
spinal cord and you're talking straight
to the brain there
all the senses that come into your brain
they're all filtered in there and they
use to create a world model inside your
head in your imagination but if you
could talk straight to that imagination
and cut out all the senses then you it
would be impossible to ignore it you
couldn't say oh that's just an image of
a dragon that would be a dragon if there
was some kind of technology which could
enable you to talk straight to the
imagination
well there is it's called text and it's
been around several thousand years and I
have seen people leap out of their
chairs when this line is said in front
of them there is an immense
fire-breathing dragon here and when
you're typing the output that you're
typing is in words the same as the input
there's no shift it's not that you're
looking at a picture and then typing in
words looking at picture moving or at
the mouse road it's the same environment
it's all words it's all thoughts all the
mites all the imagination so when you're
dealing with text it's really for people
who have got strong imaginations and the
tragedy is that many people have strong
imaginations or just they never get to
play the text because they went for the
graphics first
where we always have text we will always
have text will always be inferior
graphics well in terms of player numbers
yes in terms of player experience no
because no matter how far you take
graphics eventually the farthest you can
get is text
so rap-rap for you excellent
I'm not one for click and much lemma
games I can't get on with them I think
it's best up here it's the best computer
you can get it's your brain you know I
think people's minds have changed over
27 years and we may not be satisfied
anymore with text and get knife and kill
troll but when you play it to me anyway
it's still as mentally engrossing as it
ever was when you're reading the prose
it's like you hear it in your head and
you're forming your own picture of it a
picture which is a personal thing to you
and not not someone art directors idea
of what Gollum looks like or what he
sounds like
people would much rather look at
pictures than read as a rule there's you
know sort of a there's a subculture of
people who love to read and are
passionate about reading and passionate
about books but it's not a majority of
the public text is lost because people
just expect computer games to have
graphics and if you want them to play a
game that doesn't have graphics then you
have to give them a very good reason not
to what the greatest of literature the
greatest of all it does is that it
resonates back to yourself and you know
a side-scrolling shooter where you're
just endlessly blowing up identical
spacecraft is not going to do that but
text adventures gave us the possibility
that a story could have meaningful
consequences of both internally and for
the reader for the player in a way that
had never been seen before there's
something that needs to be refined we've
lost something we need to find it again
the prevailing opinion is no one will go
to their computer and sit there and read
to play something they want to see the
visuals they want to play with the Xbox
or something like that
but in fact what's happened since then
now we all have the internet and we what
do people do with computers most of the
time that they're sitting on the
computer they're on the internet and
they're reading and they read a page and
then they type something in maybe they
type the new address and they go to that
next address they click on the next
thing to go to the next page and we read
for hours and hours on our computers now
and they didn't believe that we would do
that anyway now we're back to it we're
all reading on computers I don't think
that there if we just put it out there
and say here's a text game and we'll put
it in book shops and put it in computer
stores I think it's an easy sell
case one what's happenin if you like
solving puzzles like interactive fiction
I mean it's there are puzzles and and
some of them are doozies the interactive
fiction required you to look at a set of
objects a set of characters and
situations you have to explore an
environment and you have to try to see
what's going on and then you have to
figure out what the right course of
action is what to do and then somehow
pop outside of your frame of reference
so that you can see it in a different
way and get the solution and figure out
how to get through that door it's up to
you to solve it after I've done all my
moves
so Graham Nelson said that interactive
fiction was like a story at war with a
crossword puzzle
there was this aspect of narrative
reading and the type of enjoyment we get
from literature and then just puzzle
solving it's like building an obstacle
course in real life and having people
run through it
you would introduce bugs into your story
you know places where you know you you
can't get there from here and you have
to or there's some linkage that's
missing you have to pick up this object
to go to this room so you can get
through that door except you can't carry
this large thing through there there's a
strange system there's this environment
with its own strange physical laws and
you have to figure out what they are
what does this mean
it's really kind of weird right you've
got a story and either to get more of
the story or to see stuff I mean whether
or not it's puzzle you have to keep
poking at it that's that doesn't seem
like it should be very entertaining does
it but it works for me there is a real
real pleasure to working on a puzzle for
a while not looking at the hints and
then having it come to you in a flash of
insight that is just a great feeling
puzzles in if' are serve an outgrowth of
previous challenges between people
certainly even before computers and
adventure games there have been people
whose job it was to come up with puzzles
where you know eventually you figure out
and have the aha moment which is so
satisfying and you solve it you're done
I think the riddle provides a special
power and understanding what's happening
there because in a riddle you have
language that you use who describe often
very ordinary things so you have to read
and you have to figure it thing out
systems of thinking that are slightly
off from the everyday
solving or resolving the things that you
read the world that you're in riddles
give that to us and also interactive
fiction and it provides something that
the text of a riddle doesn't a way that
you can test your answer the sorts of
puzzles you could come up with was
open-ended is the the game designer got
to think of what it was you were trying
to do instead of it being well come up
with a set of rules and then there's
just random elements that make the
puzzle different each time if you're
right you find out yes you were right
you understand something about this
unusual system there was no limit on
what you could include in the game it's
just a small matter of programming as
they say so there should always be
something for the player to do of the
whether it's and traditionally that's
solving puzzles for the game where
you're trying to create a narrative
there's there's a there's a push you're
trying to push the player into into a in
a certain direction but the trick is to
put puzzles in there in such a way that
they seem like they're part of the
natural flow of the story rather than
being what they really are which is the
locked gate you have to get through to
get the next chunk of prose you had to
appeal to their sense of overcoming the
odds and figuring things out as an
author you have to have the faith that
the player you have to have your player
think especially when you're going
through puzzles that the problem is with
them these are the rooms that I'm going
to follow and I'm always going to stick
by the rules
now you don't know what's going to
happen in this game you don't know all
the rules in this game uncovering the
rules is part of the fun from my point
of view I could have all the fun of
coming up with more puzzles whereas
other people if they saw
the puzzles they were done I was never
done I could always come up with pulses
here is something some action that the
player can do which is not obvious and
not insane it's surprisingly clever and
I mean that a very specific criteria
when the player thinks of it he'll be
surprised at how clever he is puzzles
work best when they're integrated with
all the other elements of the game and
not just something that's laid on the
same way that story works best when it's
you know kind of integrated with the
other components of the game and not
something that you just lay on at the
end for me like the ideal if' game would
be one which is winnable on the first
turn but you don't know what the command
is to win it until you've gone all the
way through the game and solved it
you're simultaneously designing
everything leading up to that puzzle all
the interactions with that object up
until then all the uses of that verb
that slightly obscure verb up until then
the process of the game then would be
the process of teaching the player how
to win and then once you've taught them
how to win the actual act of winning is
trivial
the vision that a whore had that made
him look up some highbrow poet who was
teaching at Berkeley was an impulse to
put more art more intellectual content
something more like literature into the
interactive computer electronic theater
I was interested in the kind of hybrid
way art moves along I was interested in
something new and it was clear to me
from my small experience of adventure
the description of Zork the stuff I saw
in these monochrome monitors that this
was largely about the quest plot which
is one of the basic plots of great works
the Gilgamesh epic is a quest for the
nature of immortality the nature of
death nature of mortality and killed
dwarf gets sword etc was completely in
that line indeed the imagery was very
traditional the closest I came to any
conflict or anxiety was their constant
pressure to put puzzles in the thing and
I just wanted to keep imagining and they
said you know the guys who pay money for
this will be very disappointed if they
can get from A to Z in an hour let alone
ten minutes they want a week or two of
agony of course they were right a lot of
our we call them arguments a lot of our
discussions the dialectic was between I
wanted to think of some new goofy thing
and they wanted to be sure that it would
be hard to figure out there would be a
strong puzzle aspect to it
I have never been very enthusiastic
about puzzles
I suck at puzzles I suck at solving
puzzles and I suck at creating puzzles
puzzles don't really permit much rich
interaction basically either you get it
wrong in which case you're frustrated
and confused and angry or you get it
right in which case you're bored once
the player realizes that I was doing
everything right it's just that the
parser didn't understand the synonym I
was trying to use it's really tough to
get the player back there's a right and
a wrong and the right is the author's
version of right and you have to find
his right way of doing it but from the
player's perspective is not any more
valid than any of the other hundreds of
possible solutions they see beforehand
hunger puzzles light source puzzles
there there were all these hallmarks of
old-school if' that actually created at
least in my experience mostly
aggravation you ate the bread here so
now you don't have it later on so now
you starve to death or you starve to
death here or you didn't do this in time
and so now too late the game has been
made unwinnable and aquila sort of takes
over the world they were more in there
to make things take a long time than to
really bring you into the world or help
you have fun it's easy to write puzzles
that are just impossible to solve well
if I stand in the 15th room in the
eastern corner holding a purple saucer
and I say Shazam you have things which
make no sense at all you have a monster
you kill in the woods and it drops a
golden bracelet what was it doing with
the golden bracelet we really don't know
it's never explained so when somebody
complains about an old trope in a
dungeon or something like that what
they're really I think saying is oh my
god this means that we're going to see
the puzzle with like a five cup measure
and a three cup measure and you need to
get four cups of while
like no one wants to see the old puzzles
again because we've already solved the
old puzzles like when you solve a puzzle
you you've you've drained all the juice
out of it I don't know anybody who are
racist crossword puzzles to fill them in
again I really don't I you know do you
overall puzzle space I think was largely
played out in the mid 80s in terms of
what is done in text adventures every
softened someone comes up with neat
variations on it or neat ways of
subverting things so what you thought
was one sort of a puzzle turns into
another sword this black and white
approach doesn't work very well and
again that was what held back has always
held back interactive fiction Pacheco's
Guide to the galaxy I make all the
students play that game and if they
can't beat the Babel Fish puzzle which
everybody use plate that windows I'm
talking about if they can't beat that
when they get C in that assignment to
them it's silly and childish and
primitive and it still kicks their ass I
can't get past it there's no shame in
looking at the hints I've decided
because you get to see the end of the
story and and for me the story is the
thing that I'm the most interested in
anyway but if you're a game designer and
you're looking at somebody else's game
and you see these things you think
that's pretty good though cleaner but
the players wouldn't think that but
because you as a designer have seen it
thinking oh that's pretty good
you're not playing the game anymore
you're playing I'm a designer looking at
something which is good adventure games
are not like real life there are
solutions and so whenever you feel like
well I'm stuck there is no this puzzles
impossible they're always possible it's
not like again there always is an object
to be found somewhere it's not like a
key you might lose and it's gone the key
is in the dump somewhere at some
landfill 9 miles away you're never going
to find in the adventure game the key
will be found okay and if it's not a key
for that door then there is another
solution
and when you bear that in mind that
there is a solution the games become
easier to play more fun you know when we
were milking them initially we often
talked about the fact that this this is
a genre that could last for centuries
you know we looked at you know we would
compare it to the book and say well I
know yes technology has changed and
there you know phonographs came along
and radios and televisions and all these
other technologies but you know the book
is still the book and it still sells
just because other kinds of games are
possible or fancy graphics are possible
or whatever doesn't mean that there's no
room for a text adventure so we were
fairly convinced that that is that was a
genre that could continue you know I
honestly I think we might have been
kidding ourselves in terms of being you
know big enough to sustain you know a
company but obviously it's continued in
terms of hobbyists doing it
it started on a group of Usenet
newsgroups records in fiction and wreck
games in fiction that were originally
talking about hypertext and things like
that but slowly discussion of infocomm
games came to dominate it in the early
90s I rediscovered interactive fiction
through the online communities that had
been around for quite a while and so
there was this nucleus of people who
were interested in interactive fiction
and talking about it and doing reverse
engineering of info coms story format
and all that kind of thing
everything was tied in and as soon as
you find the outer edge of the web
everything funnels in towards the center
and you find this interconnected group
of people you had some more artistic
types who were interested in the medium
and the academics who later were
studying it as an art form and so all of
these people sort of accumulated around
this news group it's kind of blows my
mind that we have this group of people
that is willing to put in all of this
work for free knowing that they'll never
be compensated anyway besides people's
attention and praise and their creating
these amazing pieces of work we're
talking about a community that has been
around you know we're coming up really
on 20 years worth of community if you go
back to the early internet days I've
been following the amateur scene fairly
closely over the decades and you know
they've got all the basics down this
really really talented people any one of
them could have succeeded at infocomm as
well as any of us I think there's some
really bright people out there doing
these things
I guess my reaction was um that you know
that I thought this was very nice that
the genre even though it had died as a
commercial medium you know was was
continuing to live on as an artistic
medium
and feeling you know almost almost a
sense of relief that you know that it
would continue to live on in this new
form in terms of the real real
enthusiasts it seems like everybody
who's who's interested in playing them
is interested in writing them they're
not expecting to sell or hoping to sell
a hundred thousand copies at 30 or 40
dollars a piece
people are writing if' when they get off
work or they're writing if' while
they're at work if they have a job that
enables them to do that they're hoping
to make a literary or intellectual
statement of some kind or even just to
explore something that they think it's
funny and they they may be the only ones
who think it's funny but they're having
a good time anyway just for like art
films you know there are people who live
for those films but they're not going to
be commercial success you won't show
them in the main theaters to the masses
because the masses don't don't want to
see that sort of thing
they don't want to think that way they
don't you know they're there to be
entertained they're not there to go
marvel if oh yeah well that's a
different way of looking at it we know
what this model looks like it doesn't
look like the films industry it doesn't
look like the games industry it looks
like Faulkner at his security job with
his typewriter in a little Hut you know
if your audience is mostly people who
write these games it's it's it's really
the perfect thing it looks like writing
novels
that's really exciting to me I have
writers are awfully pure in my limited
experience but you know that's the
impression I have is that they they do
this thing because they deeply love it
and it's impossible at least for me not
to admire that
and so then the question at what age
should people write if' might be a lot
like the question Oh at what age should
people write let them let them write
badly as early as possible and let them
write more and better later interactive
fiction is something that you can do
yourself you know you don't need a group
of 40 people and you don't need a panel
of advisors it's a it's a real personal
way to write a game and when I'm doing
that I'm not really thinking about the
audience the audience is me then when
I'm finished I want to share that I
think it was a control thing I think
ultimately maybe not for everybody who
creates these games but I think there's
a profound sense of power in control and
this is something that I love and I'm
creating this game because this is the
sort of game that I would love to play
it's the the realization of being a god
a creator creating a world that these
lesser mortals I don't think people
consciously think of it that way but the
idea that these other people are going
to have to buy into your world that this
world can be full it can be the vision
that you have in mind
Kevin Wilson created the competition and
ran it for a couple of years and Kevin
asked David I'd to take over and after
that first year I think because of a
number of things going on David's like
yeah this is not really something I want
to do that much and so he turned to me
and said you know I think you'd do a
pretty decent job of running it are you
willing to take it and so I thought
about it for a little while I was like
yeah sure you know I'll do this for a
couple of years and I can hand it off
this was Kevin's intent in the first
place lots of people said oh I'd love to
write it came but man infocomm games
were huge curses is huge I can't do
anything that big and Kevin said well
how about he just do a tiny little game
that'd be fine
it could be one room to be one puzzle
we'll accept it and a lot of people said
mmm
including me a lot of people said yes I
could do something small wouldn't take
that long my best guess is you've got a
thousand to 2,000 people who will
download it and try at least one or two
games and then out of that about 250
people who play enough play it within
the timeframe and then enter their boats
I tend to think that if we didn't have
the competition as something that the
community can accrete around we'd
probably be a lot more scattered and
dissipated than we are it's easier to
write a shorter game so that you can get
out there faster you can get feedback
faster and if it turns out to crash and
burn and go well that was three or four
months of my life instead of that was my
two-year masterpiece every interactive
fiction competition has excellent games
entered into it and so the the bar is
very high that they that you have to
meet and so coming in in eighth place I
just felt like hey that's pretty good
considering the things that we're ahead
of me the bottom 10 games would just be
horrible they'd you know one room
there's no puzzle it doesn't work you
know it takes you two seconds to
recognize what it is and to close your
you know interpreter some people whose
approach to grading the games and
reviewing them sort of like they take
points away from the games like ripping
wings off of flies you start out at a 10
and then you've got a spelling error so
now you're at 9 and this command doesn't
work here at an 8 you know just ripping
of one by one thankfully not everybody
is like that
part of the reason people tend to enter
the competition is they're guaranteed
that audience which is good because it
does tend to focus attention but it's
also bad because I think in some cases
people say well yeah it's kind of crappy
yeah I didn't finish it or get a beta
tested but let me enter it anyway and
see what people think the if' comm
started as a way to get people writing
games which was immensely successful now
the I have comp is in some sense is the
only way to write a game that's not a
that's not a good outcome but better
than writing no games at all they tend
to be this black hole that sucks all of
the creativity of the community every
year into this one this this one time
when everyone releases their games
people have tried different things to
you know get some of the spotlight off
the if' comp and they have been
partially successful and I think because
of those arguments some other
competitions have sprung up actually I
created one and so did Adam counter he
created the spring thing you know
instead of continually attacking the
annual comp we've just gone and created
our own because I have to I have to
admit that I do miss the long games the
the short games tend to have their you
know a few really good games come out of
the comp every year but there's there's
something different about the long games
the short games the the short games
don't have that that way of involving
you for a month and kind of an obsessive
activity I also think that's actually
probably a pretty good description of
why a lot of really bad if' writing is
really bad is that people imagine it
though as being what they later
discovered 3d graphics simulations
actually were they imagined that as
being just a way of recreating the world
around them in computer form what should
we write about well but we're either
going to write about our own College
this is you know or some thinly veiled
version of it here's my I F
ask and hear my I F papers and my I F
cup and I'll drink out of it and so
after a while you know maybe you had
patience for somebody starting you out
asleep in your bedroom like tons and
tons of other games and then after a
while you're like okay people you get a
lot of earnest tries but the coding
isn't quite there the ideas aren't fully
formed I think there's a huge problem
with interactive fiction games right now
being written for the authors I think if
you look at the comps you see a lot of
people trying self-consciously
to be artistic there's there's
definitely which I love a wing of modern
if' that is really out there and trying
very weird things boundary-pushing games
are not necessarily going to be the best
games they lay groundwork for the best
games I would say advancing the state of
accessibility of if' is not really seen
by the current community as being a
priority because I think well the people
who are here now you know are the ones
who like it whether or not it's going to
be the right direction ultimately who
knows but he'll what's the right
direction when it's 200 of us writing
games and giving them only to each other
in 98 as early as 98 when I was working
on spider and web I was thinking I would
be awfully nice if I could publish a
game and get money for it there's a lot
of people that would like to see um if'
go commercial the question of a company
publishing AF into the greater market
man I hope that works now a lot of
people some people think that there is
some way to crack the market and sell
these games to people who would be
instead of reading books though they'll
play interactive fiction games it's fun
to go make physical manifestations of
your game it's nice to have something up
on the mantle you can look at and say
yeah you know what I did that it's not
just a bunch of code on the computer
this is something that I can I can I can
put in my hands yeah now the piece that
I didn't really take into account is
that I'm a horrible salesman right
our sales good uh we the the type of
person that spends four years coding a
computer game is probably maybe usually
not the same type of person that can go
out and sell that game very effectively
so sales are all right considering
they've dumped it on the internet for
free I was actually really happy with it
I would
I'm ADA copies of necrotic drift we were
able to sell them all through the
website I think I threw the last few on
eBay
although it's really only been available
in maybe a dozen shops those shops
continue to sell it even it's been three
years now since I first started selling
it and they they still sell light bulb
Bing let's let's make brand new games in
the infocomm tradition and sell them to
people who want them
and when she was born the the way to get
interactive fiction out to more people
beyond our community and other
communities is marketing the perception
is from a lot of people's point of view
is what is it and I think I've spent
more time and resources trying to write
marketing facts what is it what is it
how do you what is it it's going to
require a serious effort to market the
product to audiences in a way where that
audience is going to say yeah I really
want to play that if I'm going to walk
over to a kid who's playing halo 2 when
his xbox 360 and say hey kid I'm gonna
try a new game sure what do you got
pintar The Apprentice what's it about
well this is young wizard in a Wizards
guild that he's you know his master is
captured during his final exams to
become a true sorcerer and you have to
go rescue him and then you have to go to
this evil dark city of mages and conquer
an evil queen sounds great we have tried
it and they sit down with keyboard hated
a crash the game is moderated by a
computer and where there's not as much
throwing of dice and statistics and so
forth and that's that seems I don't know
I don't know how successful that
explanation is as currently conceived
it's just not marketable under a games
industry idea of what you're buying
because the games industry idea would
always say
you're going to have to add more mazes
or you're going to have to add
unlockable cards that you find and
they're going to have to be 50 of them
so that we can layer enough extra stuff
on there to keep the interactor busy for
an extra 12 hours otherwise they're
going to feel cheated when they're done
we'd go to we went to a couple of
computer game conferences you know we
talked to people and we'd tell them a
little bit about what we were doing and
everyone we talked to you know that we
would get these kind of stunned blank
stares they'd say text adventures what
what does that have to do with
commercial games anymore that was a
Speirs ago I had great hopes for the
Michael Bruin cascade mountain attempt
that was what 99 I wish that had worked
that didn't work at all I would say that
the commercial market for interactive
fiction is so small that it doesn't
warrant an investment of any financial
magnitude at all I think if you want to
do it as a home hobbyist or you want to
do it as an artist or you want to do it
to prove a point or you want to do it to
muse your friends and relatives that's
great but don't ask me to invest any
money in it because I did that and it
was a total abject failure I guess since
the first couple of horribly failed
attempts my opinion has been you know
prove that you have a working company
and you're actually going to make some
kind of a profit and I will write you
games from now until the cows come home
I would love to switch into doing that
full-time clearly if you're going to
make something you have to make sure
that there are enough people who are
going to buy it to justify your
investment and we didn't do that
well enough or at all so I don't believe
there's market but does that stop me
pretty much I'm not desperate to find
new commercial opportunities for IAF
that's that's an understatement I'm not
you know really really interested in
what the marketplace can do for I F
myself but I think there's advantages to
the forum having been through this
commercial phase there's things that can
be learned from what businesses did
ultimately it's the same audience that
literature has which is everyone who can
read you know young people old people
people from everywhere and one of these
days someone's gonna figure out how to
put games in front of those people and
maybe it'll be for free and then lots of
people will start playing them that'll
be great maybe it'll be for money in
which case a lot of people start paying
them and I'll get some money and that
will also be great there's a huge
untapped audience of mainly people who
are not regular gamers who could get
into if' if it was made available to
them infocom I know sold a lot of games
to older people who are viewed as being
outside of the current demographic
people in their 50s and 60s and a lot of
those people are in the news groups now
playing games but there's millions of
them who if they knew this stuff existed
would love to play at least for me it's
much more fun to know that people are
playing it and sort of enjoying it then
that I get you know a couple nice
dinners out every year from the proceeds
of my games and I find it hard to
believe that text adventures are going
to sell the kids but you know like if
someone wants to do it and they they
succeed good luck doing
I'm playing in multiplayer online games
which was again this is something I
didn't do until a few years ago and I
said some friends and I was considering
starting one up and I didn't actually
have any experience with multiplayer
online games and so well I just start
playing one just to find out what they
were like because I'm like trying to
design one would be useful to know what
there is you have a preference indeed
zuwanie prefer tea I mostly play a
request you know cuz I've been away from
it for you know for so many years I I
really didn't know until a few years ago
how much of this was still around it was
just maybe at a trade show or something
and someone whipped at an early PDA you
know and said look at this and it was
running planetfall or Hitchhiker's Guide
or something pretty dumbfounded actually
the biggest confusion I get nowadays is
you right Gilbert don't you that's a
different Scott Adams I think it's great
I mean you know I I'm certainly not
losing any royalty on it I didn't have a
royalty interest in any of the games I
was just a you know on straight salary
for infocomm so you know as far as I'm
concerned the more people who can play
those games the better we're starting to
get into that stage where without people
who are in the computer industry and
haven't heard of adventure let alone had
it been the seminal point of their
career
Scot was putting out a newsletter and
then today he said there's another Scott
Adams out there that wrote adventure
games way back in the dawn of history
and if anybody knows him please let me
know because I'm getting a bunch of his
mail and he was getting my fan mail I
still get his fan mail so do you have
much case where you're playing EverQuest
and someone figures out they're playing
against the guy who invented the genre
no hasn't come up it'll be interesting
when we finish up here
as I have a my guild has a raid at 6
o'clock and I intend to just sort of
mention at some point that what I spent
my afternoon doing and see whether it
leads to any conversation I don't know
that I even fully understand what what
keeps me in it the hardest thing is
people saying why the hell would you
want to do that it's a genre that died
in the late 80s it's it's a hobby for me
and not a moral cause you know I think
some people are you know hope in some
corner of their hearts that that if'
will be big again
although nobody knows how or why I would
be sad if people stopped making them but
the cost of entry for making an if' game
is very low so I don't expect that to be
the case with so many people now getting
online you know and that number is going
to continue to increase you just could
have a lot more people to draw from and
get into its I don't think it's it's
ever going to go away art forms are
never replaced they're never replaced
they're just added to you know that's
one of the Articles that comes out every
day everything every eight months you
know why are the guesstimated games I
why why did not just text fringe games
why did the adventure game done to say
text adventure games are dead is like
the same kind of people who say write
books are dead right because the movies
are so emotional so much more popular it
doesn't it makes no sense you know the
truth is text adventure games never died
if you define the interactive fiction
medium as text adventures then you can
say brief flash in the pan
if you define the medium as one that
like every other medium evolves over
time and through the collaboration and
recombination of things from a variety
of creators that medium never died what
I knew that it was possible to make text
games I've never looked back
it's something I want to do for my whole
life
it was an itch that I didn't know that I
had until I started scratching it now
won't go away it's a rash I guess
so that was the long version of get lamb
the like I said see there's an
interactive version where you would have
had each of those that's why it feels
kind of like a sort of ending it had to
be an ending and not quite enough
these are the two people who I interview
scheduled with who I lost before I got a
chance to
okay so yeah it's a 2 DVD set there's
actually a full episode on nothing but
infocomm which actually I really like
and it's it's more what people think of
as a standard documentary but if you saw
you'd be like oh that's great you told
the story of infocomm what about the
rest of text adventure so that's what
that one is so um and I do have them for
Sailor if people want to pick up a copy
with the to DVD and all the rest of the
stuff it's I like it and of course I you
saw it's fully subtitled I got a thing
about that I get angry if it's not
subtitled nowadays because it's like
it's free essentially if anybody has any
questions or comments I do want to
mention that I'm not going to stand up
here but mr. blank and mr. woods are
here in the audience too and I really
appreciate that I haven't seen mr. blank
since I interviewed him something like
four years ago so that's great so if
anyone has any questions or comments or
whatever I'll answer yes
and I'll try to take the microphone if
your questions more than ten words
people would really appreciate yeah
absolutely
so one of the in the film one of the
participants mentioned that he was happy
to see infocomm games still being played
and symptoms become is bankrupt did
somebody pick up the IP for that and is
no that's not on I guess there's no
whatever well yeah okay well oh that's
terrible
how will I get by with my latte the okay
so currently infocomm IP is owned by
Activision the in certain infocom
trademarks are owned by a guy named Pete
who is up if somebody wants to write
infocomm games and call them infocomm
he'll license it to you but they
actually have lapsed some of the
trademarks so Zork lapsed but leather
goddess is a foe boast they renewed I
don't get it either I'm sorry whatever
but it Activision owns it right
Activision licensed it to something
called I think it was legends of Zork
which was like a click-through adventure
game that you can play now arm so they
still own it they'll still defend it um
they'll still get cranky if you send out
copies regardless of what Steve tells
you Steve's all behind it but Steve's
not going to be your final sign-off so
then yes did they ever move over this I
thought
um there's a lot of contemporary space
things that are not mentioned in this
movie because then it would be two hours
long and I figured the hardest part of
the movie was trying to get AB you know
like I like I said there was no text
adventure movie now I've made the last
point and the thing is is it's it's
saddled with several major vectors that
are a problem it has to flow reasonably
well it also has to cover subjects that
are ethereal and mental and it has to
kind of feel like it gave justice to
older subjects and the problem is is for
instance it doesn't really mention MMOs
except for hilariously right and it
doesn't mention augmented reality games
or alternate reality games or any of
that stuff because a I didn't have Jane
McGonigal's home number yet and also I
just thought that it was like I felt
like you'll notice this movie this movie
really gives you a lot of credit as a
viewer the more I've watched I'm like
wow like when you watch a lot of like
documentaries like like on Discovery
it's like dude was attacked by a bear
here's the bear this is the guy there's
the bear again the guys doing this thing
the bit we're gonna break to a
commercial we come back the guy is being
attacked by a bear and you're like wow I
can watch it with the sound off and get
it right this film blink it and you miss
it you are you are you are in the woods
you're literally in the woods with
cavers and so there's like there's a lot
of that and so one of the things I did
that didn't take it for granted was you
might then go knowing all this I will
now move into contemporary space and I
will understand from this where this all
comes from I'll have a better grip of it
I didn't feel like I needed to finally
connect the dots
that's only reason why because now there
are so many gaming documentaries that
are just in contemporary and I was like
nobody's really you know tracked down
the infocomm guys and Scott Adams and
put them all together in a movie so at
least we can see what their take on
things worse that's what that was the
thinking yes in the back I'll just
repeat question forts
you have text adventures anything next
yeah um okay sorry
yeah you're right okay
I've done bulletin board systems I've
done text adventures am I gonna do
anything next yes um I'm actually
relatively poor although this movie does
pay for my current existence which is
pretty hilarious in the scheme of
independent film that makes me feel Berk
um but uh but I I'd like to do three at
once next stick with me the there are
three technical documentaries I found
making these previous ones each one took
about four years and the biggest thing
was travel so I'm doing a Kickstarter
very shortly for a hundred thousand
dollars which will already get some
attention I'm sure and it's going to be
three films and I've been kind of
leaking it to QA for a while so I'll
just tell you the first one would be on
tape and in the same scheme as bulletin
board systems and techno text adventures
the next question is how could that
possibly be interesting and I like that
challenge that means nobody else is
doing it so this would be about audio
video and magnetic tape and it's meaning
in our history and the loss of memory
and the the cultures that lived on tape
and so on so that's tape tape is the big
one uh the one that I am also looking to
do is one on arcades and that would be a
podcast series those would be little
tiny ten to fifteen minute arcade esque
documentaries because because we do
stuff about the games we have all seen
pac-man moving slowly on a screen while
someone tells you video games were fun
but there's not a whole lot of things
about those places and the fact that you
know people are like well what would
your arcade documentary podcast series
think of er and I'm like well it would
start at 17th century automaton lounges
at this point they're like what
up through to maim so I'm like you know
just this idea that for years for
hundreds of years we have willingly
moved into small rooms and paid somebody
to let us have fun with machines why why
do we do that
so that would be arcade my own arcade
documentary calm and the third one would
be on the 6502 chip ah yeah I'm at
Google um so welcome to Google what yeah
um so yeah programmers ass em I want to
make a movie that actually makes
assembly language makes sense that's its
challenge and talk to people like you
know bill budge in John Romero who used
to do 6502 programming about the unique
nature's of that and jeri ellsworth
who's a friend and talk who does yes I
know he works here I was trying to
follow him at the Game Developers
Conference and I decided it was too
creepy I figured I'd wait where is he um
he you know it's a good question I don't
know where he is but this is why I want
to get the funding very soon and go talk
to chuck very soon um because I have a
little problem with my movies um but
anyway so those the three and I would
put them together because it's easier
for me to sometimes interview somebody
about portions of both because I could
talk to an arcade game programmer who
could tell me about arcade spaces but he
also told me about programming perhaps
not as much as about tape but maybe
anyway so there you go now you know
those are my three because I feel like I
don't know how many more years I want to
do this and I'd rather just do one big
mega film crazyness ones I will not do
people wanted me to ham-radio
know um demo scene no there was a few
that were kind of weird a few people are
unhappy because they want me to cover
their software company like I covered
these software companies and uh no but
that's the life that you gotta live when
you make a choice I'm these are all done
by one guy right this is one guy made
this film so it's it I'm the sound
I'm the lighting I'm the questioner I'm
the editor I'm the package designer I'm
the QA answerer you know I'm everything
you can imagine so it's that's you know
you know people like you should have
gone more to Europe
I'm like maybe you should have gone more
to Europe I was I happen to be called in
for a speech that I gave in England and
that's why I could interview Richard
Bartle you know girls like hey mr.
Bartel could come over and otherwise I
would have never gotten Richard Bartle
and he willingly came which was nice of
him all right any other question yes yes
I tried to interview Graham Nelson and
Emily short for anybody who cares about
that
uh-uh this is being streamed um Emily
short said no oh I'm not afraid to say
this I guess Emily short said no I said
okay how about if I send you written
questions you submit me written answers
and you appear on a screen answering
them no Graham Nelson didn't even bother
to respond through proxy even will
Crowther responded through proxies uh
and said now um before anyone goes why
did will Crowther not go in this and the
answer is Wil crowler does not look back
at this literally it's like saying dude
how'd you like kindergarten and it ain't
you know he's just just doesn't see you
know he's good he created the friggin
ARPANET and people are like remember
that little screensaver you're
programmed when you were in high school
it feels like that to him and so when
his all of his interviews about it he'll
he'll talk about it but he doesn't go
crazy talking about that time so I I
said you know what I'm not gonna show up
at this guy's house you know you know
what this movie did not need blurry
footage of him running to his car
I like to think this is my general
approach I like to think I can have
dinner with pretty much everyone in the
movie and have them feel comfortable
eating dinner with me because they feel
like I did right by them I don't think
that a movie like this especially this
should not use people like there's
something so yeah so there's a few
people who declined like Emily short
Graham Nelson one of the couple of the
akan people didn't have the time or just
things didn't work out and so on so
there's you know it happens um so before
you you to crowd there at the end II
yeah I thank will Crowder yeah he made
adventure yeah thanks man high five high
- um yeah I mean that was it it was like
thanks people craft her for doing it
basically and for not getting ticked off
that I still stuck a picture in there
I made sure that picture was as obscure
as old as possible I mean I have new
pictures of him and I have pictures of
him from when he was a caver but I
thought you know if he's not comfortable
with being in this movie I'm not going
to make really personal identifiable
photos of the guy so you know I just
said you know I'm gonna thank him
because he did this like I thank you for
do also doing it the coins are numbered
individually and I have coin number two
because I gave mr. woods coin number one
I figured he deserved it more there was
another question yeah yeah
do you have any idea how popular the
interactive games were let's say Chinese
dream in India or Spanish or anything
questions about alternate scenes of
other languages of interactive fiction
and I have spoken with the Spanish I F
click some level of German some level of
well here's the thing English right
British English there's a whole scene
there that I only somewhat cover because
I just didn't think I could do them
justice I'd rather do this and someone
go it's like that but we did this in
this I'd rather be a difference a delta
and so there are these other scenes and
they also have it there's also this
awesome adult interactive fiction group
that's been around for like 15 years and
the only one who would talk to me at all
from it was the really the beautifully
cynical Adam who's in there he's the
balding guy who every time it just it's
cut this way every time you see him he
says something cynical and depressing
about text adventure so he's the one
who's like mazes kill me now or yeah why
would I sell it I could maybe make money
for a dinner and everything else and you
know he's made all these legitimate well
you know I'm saying legitimate you know
safe for work text adventures but he's
also the creator of stiffy McCain in the
undiscovered country but the rest of
them were like good work keep going keep
going keep on Rebecca so that's this a
bit there's a bit of that going on
so okay missed that scene too so it's
like this but little different into the
questions yes
okay just okay I've been asked a lot of
stuff about like text adventures as a
business which is what you're asking
like is there models and stuff that
might work for text adventures and this
middle you know it's a puzzler and the
thing is it the biggest problem with
with it is that in the bear in mind
again I'm an outside observer
technically I was embedded with text
adventures for four years but I also
wanna make clear I'm outsider in many
ways first of all I want to say that
Andrew Plotkin who's that dude with the
huge glasses and the furry hair did a
Kickstarter last year she say let me
stop working and I will create a new
text adventure for the iPhone and I will
release the toolkit I'm developing to
make it and I will release it for sale
on the iPhone and he asked for I think
it was I want to say he asked for twenty
thousand or fifteen thousand dollars for
this and he got thirty one thousand so
he's doing that full-time right now so
he's doing it right he's living the
dream and his take was iPhone text
adventure right that was his approach
but in the whole on the whole bear in
mind also Andrew Plotkin is a friggin
master right he's like the best of the
best in terms of contemporary
interactive fiction authors absolutely
the best so this is a big deal he has a
huge following both in and out of the
community so he was able to do this
the problem with text adventures is that
there is a galactically huge sized
massive fully playable archive of them
that is every bit as compelling and
well-made as anything you would get now
it is absolutely the case that you can
play these fantastic games that come out
for free every year that are as good as
anything and the amount of work to make
it a little better or reach a little
more is really a huge burden and that's
what's killing that idea to which as you
might have hopefully cleaned from that
some of them are perfectly fine with
they're delighted they're like whatever
whatever I don't need that anymore I
don't need people lying to sell me text
adventures
go ahead and play them so like on the
iPad you can download frauds and frauds
comes with like 30 games that are going
to eat your month that are great in
every single way I mean and that's their
problem their problem is the old product
is good it's like selling oranges and
the oranges from forever just as great
okay all right all right so we can go
either way
um right and so was there any other yeah
inside joke about technical writing um
all right is there yes sir a subgenre
text adventure text adventures that
started his vote did you do any did I
just that I did I cover graphical text
adventure so did I do any interviewing I
certainly intro there's a hundred and
twenty hours of raw footage right which
became this movie certainly some people
would go a little bit into graphical
adventures or discuss Sierra Sierra is a
really big one but I really felt I
wanted to cover text adventures
strongest um I will release all of the
raw footage checking it for somebody
saying something really truly awful you
know on to archive.org so I always do
that anyway the movies are creative
commons-licensed anyway right I had a I
had a group rip it and put it on the
Pirate Bay and they did it wrong like
they cuz it's that interactive thing
it's multiple chapters they got the
order wrong so I wrote a big note about
like thanks but you got it wrong here's
the actual chapter order could you rip
in that way instead and they went oh my
god I'm sorry and they ripped it again
and released the repack and everything
else and and this totally made the
torrent community flip out and I sold
like dozens and dozens in like two days
they're like oh my god this guy oh my
god uh and the nfo is really really
positive it's like Jason you know it's
got the greatest phrase ever because
bear in mind right this is my second big
movie right ever I mean previously that
was student films
and it says in the thing as is typical
with Jason Scott productions it um good
trend management and yes you had one one
of the savings level people are making
for that like I have games now and
pretty much made five two hundred
authors and released to the two hundred
dollars
that's one cynical person's response is
that they are two hundred two hundred
otters making games for two hundred
authors that's not quite true
um what I tried to do there is I try to
do whenever I do these things right I
mean there's always that balance between
my narrative voice and my avocations and
what the group thinks so there's also
documenting here's the various opinions
on that you can see some people like
nobody pays attention to us and other
people like these are incredible
everyone loves us well I think what it
comes down to is that maybe once every
year really hungry areas like Reddit and
stuff somebody will link to it and
they'll gain just enough passers-by to
go whoa adventure games and they go to
it and they play it whoa these are
bullymail made whoa and so that happens
and uh I think that it's a tough sell I
think I always think adventure games are
a tough sell right I mean but they're
some of the modern ones are really
really well made and some of them are
really unusual for instance if you're
like well Jason what's a good modern one
do that right this to that I always
recommend to people the first one is
called photo pia came out in 1999 it
takes about an hour and a half to play
and when you finish it you are
emotionally affected you you can't not
win right you play it an hour and a half
and you're like oh you have to close
your door on your yurt and then there's
a lost pig which one like a year and a
half two years ago your nay you are in
you are in orc and you've lost your Pig
and the pig has gone down into this cave
and now you're in the kit you fell in
the cave to get the pig now you have to
get the pig so it takes you like a
typical adventure game forever
to figure out
how to rescue yourself and the pig
during which this is the brilliant part
first of all it talks to you like a orc
so it's like see thing with light not
sure where that go is kind of scary very
strange you poor thing and thing moves
other thing now thing goes away thing
can go now
and so you've got to negotiate what this
guy is saying and I think what the best
part to me is the pig is always there
like if you try to grab it it slips out
of your way but the pig follows you the
whole time you're trying to rest to get
the pig in fact not too much minor
spoiler but at one point the pig helps
you like the pigs like and that helps
you move on to the next thing
so there's lost pig and this is a
contemporary game that came out two
years ago that I think is just brilliant
it won these dizzy awards which are the
they just had them them the the yearly
awards to who have made the best games
of the past year which they give away
and they're really amazing so anyway I'm
saying it's still vibrant but it's tough
I mean a lot of people start the game up
and they're like this is awesome and
about 15 minutes later they're like oh
look at this YouTube video and the story
is over and you know so that's a problem
but I think there's I think that's I
mean I was I'm you know the question is
that one might have is are you happy I
spent four years on this absolutely
absolutely this is like this is like I
get to carry Zeus's water on his way to
the podium to like send off some
lightning bolts I'm like oh yeah this is
great I'm a roadie for Zeus so that's
for me it's like all those wonderful
people who affected me I'm owning only
40 which means that you know I mean I
played this thing with my cousin when I
was you know 11 or 12 I played adventure
with my cousin and so for me this is yay
anyway but I think we're pretty much out
of time so wonderful thank you so much
