John
inter from quick launch who's going to
be talking about how to make space guns
okay hi guys
yeah I'm John hunter this is Harry
Cartland he's one of the founders and
Rick two kids with me also worked for
quick launch and what we're gonna
present to you folks is a technology
that actually enables significant man's
plays to exploration beyond what Rockets
ordinarily afford you so what you're
seeing there on the front page sort of
something out of Jules firm but in fact
that's a 11 100 meter long tube with
hydrogen at the aft section that drives
a payload that that when it gets into
orbit weighs about a thousand pounds so
this will launch the thousand pounds of
propellant per launch every couple of
hours and at basically 5% of the current
launch costs and it's not science
fiction we all actually come from
scientific disciplines where we build
things like this and Harry and I ran
project super harp back in the 90s so if
you look in the National Enquirer and
tabloids back then you'll see probably
see pictures of us running around with
giant guns and it actually happened we
ran it a significant number of shots for
the Air Force and other clients and
we've managed to blow their gun up once
super super hard was blown up once Ric
saved Rick my boss at the time saved me
he wrote a nice report that said it
wasn't all bad we established the
project so I'm gonna walk you guys
through why hydrogen gas guns are the
way to access space and go to space
affordably next so once you see on the
left the top left slide is a picture of
sharp that was a 425 footlong gun we
built in the 90s and ran it through the
90s doing shots for various clients and
the interesting part about that it was
used hydrogen you guys are familiar with
the stuff that cops and robbers all use
bullets that have nitrocellulose for
gunpowder black powder in the old days
but hydrogen has a molecular weight of
two and so it turns out hydrogen can
shoot things up to 11 kilometers per
second which coincidentally is the
escape velocity for earth 11.2 which is
the world record for gas pens is also
the exact escape velocity for Earth and
so it's well matched to the requirements
of orbital speeds now you can see
the bottom-left it's actually firing
this is one of our shots we did this for
the Air Force and those in those days we
were launching hypersonic scramjet for
the Air Force
these were Mach 9 vehicles they were
fueled by hydrogen this if you guys were
aeronautical how many background to sort
of need because this was during the NASP
era and no one has got anything to fly a
sustained flight above Mach 5 we were
shooting things at Mach 9 and between
Mach 5 and Mach 9 in those days and it
would come out of the gun it would turn
on and burn for about a hundred yards
and it would bei per eyes when I hit a
sandpit we're launching such high speeds
and we never recovered any part of the
projectile they were so they were so
fast that when they stagnated on the
sand in the target area it would it was
vaporized he would never recover
anything but the speeds of hydrogen or
what make it make it perfectly matched
for a launching thing to this space and
what the point of this whole story is
that Jules Verne was right he was a
couple hundred years ahead of his time
but he was right he just had to pick the
right fluid in the right there correct
fluid is hydrogen it's not gunpowder so
you'll see on the top right that's
that's a picture from mounted AG Jack I
was in the Aleutian Islands just before
9/11 I was there like this five days
before 9/11
getting ready to destruct this project
then and I took that snapshot we
superimpose a solidworks of a system on
that island that would be launching
payloads due east and that would be
those would coincide with a propellant
Depot that would that would help the the
current ISS the International Space
Station then down the lower right is the
mobile version the sea launch version
and the benefit of that system is that
it's not fixed you can take this to the
equator and you could launch to any
inclination you want to in any elevation
you want to so for example you could you
had a client that wanted say 100 tons
propellant at 28 and a half degrees
inclination like a lot of the Americans
do it's extremely ad file it could it
can turn on a dime and it can launch to
any elevation and inclination you need
next now this is the payoff here
ordinarily when you have a multi-stage
rocket you know Rockets typically or
triple staged in order to get out of the
gravity well and you will have about a
1/2 to 2% payload fraction if you look
the vertical axis is what you should pay
attention
- here in that boxed area you see those
little four curves running through that
with the those are those rippers at one
of two stage Rockets either low
performance solid rockets or a fairly
modest performance liquid rockets and so
I would pick the top two curves those
are liquid rockets with the ISP of 320
seconds that just means it's got a lot
of impulse like lot so it would be like
a lobster rp1 mixture and you can see
it's a 25% efficient wente 5% payload
fraction and the high very high end and
the horizontal axis is what's called
drive traction which only needs some of
the rocket guys now that just means
basically how much of your actual
vehicle is made out of solid material
that does not burn okay like your casing
for your rocket your your Aero shell
that sort of stuff
so you want that to be a small number if
you can but in fact since for G
hardening these things that launch them
out of a gun it's probably going to be
somewhere between 10 and 25% that's why
I put that window there okay so but the
bottom line is you're getting above 20%
payload fracture you're getting 10 times
as much payload per vehicle weight as
you do with the conventional rocket
system for delivering to or supplies
into low-earth orbit next ok another
picture of the super system this is
1,100 meters if you look at the D app
section down there at the bottom that's
500 meters deep but this would be at the
equatorial location so it's 500 meters
deep the pressure is around 700 psi
external pressure the guns running
internally at 15,000 psi so that's not a
big deal for us we're used to working at
real high pressures then you have a long
longitudinal thousand meters long so if
you stuck a person next to that it would
it would be only about half the diameter
of that thank you
of that giant tube that goes up there
and the doughnuts are there to stiffen
it there they provide stiffness so you
can align the barrel because this is
such a high speed system you have to
have exquisite barrel alignment unlike
conventional powder guns where you can
be off by a fuse a milliradian or so in
the steel you have to have really really
good alignment with your steel barrels
and the other thing that doughnuts do is
they provide buoyancy so for example
let's say you want to have this thing
launch things into geosync it's going to
have an elevation as closer to 8 to 90
degrees and this one shown here so you
in that case you
inflate that you would inflate the
donuts in the forward area and you kill
the other ones with water so the thing
which would do this would tilt up and
then of course you have like an oil
servicing platform there in the middle
this is very reminiscent of Sea Launch
which is what Boeing put together with
some partners and they were doing zina
two launches out of the Equator for some
years they went bankrupt they're trying
to recover right now but we used the
same technology for servicing oil
platforms and oil rigs as we would for
servicing this big tube next this shows
the business into the system and that we
don't put all the flames and the smoke
and the noise in here this is a real
simple little JPEG but it shows that
coming out and you can see that's a
basically a that's a three meter
diameter tube there at the muffler end
you know what what is not shown
internally is there's is this is a
classic silencer where you actually try
and capture the gas the stuff on TV they
don't actually capture the gas they have
it go through some things which which to
look down but in this case we want to
capture all the hydrogen that we can
because we want to recycle the hydrogen
every shot you don't have to go and pay
for more hydrogen each shot we have
built things like this it'll recover 97
percent of the hydrogen no problem so
it's easy to build a muffler that can
capture the hydrogen and it's been done
we've done it ourselves next okay this
is what it's going to look like as it
goes through the sky we have run
ablation codes on this with the help of
Sandia National Laboratory they ran the
everies code and it said that it's six
kilometers per second we're losing about
five inches of carbon carbon on the nose
and so if you look closely at the
vehicle I'm going to show you in a
minute you'll see a little arrow spike
to stick that up at about a foot like a
welding rod and so that's going to take
the lion's share of the thermal thermal
of Q dot in the parlance okay and it'll
it'll it'll a blade off but you'll still
have everything else protected next okay
so now this is at 100 kilometer altitude
this thing is left the muzzle at 6
kilometers per second because it uses
hydrogen ordinary guns can come would
come out maybe in two kilometers per
second or 6 kilometers per second so
we're two-thirds of the way there in
terms of velocities the orbital speed
you need is about seven point six but
when you subtract off the gravity losses
in the atmospheric losses in reality you
need about nine clicks nine kilometers
per second velocity to get into a nice
500 kilometer leo orbit and so this is
this shows it at a hundred kilometer
altitude and we've blown off the
aeroshell the earth shell that's that
heat shield that shields that during the
egress through the atmosphere and then
the base comes off and once you see
there is two canisters that contain
fluids and they contain fluids for two
reasons this is actually a single stage
rocket so it's going to have probably an
RP 1 lakhs mixture there to provide a
decent ISP it's a liquid rocket and the
second reason is one of those containers
is going to contain the payload because
where our job is to make money by
delivering payloads to a space Depot
next okay so now now this is a classic
plug nozzle it looks like maybe unlike
to some of the rocket nozzles you've
seen it's a perimeter nozzle basically
and it's got some benefits when you're
under high G's you don't want to have
things stick out really far because
they'll break off they'll crumple so
this is a plug nozzle which is quite
short but it's circumferential around
the body of the vehicle and there's an
attitude control system I've not shown
you here as well but it's very simple
and so this thing is birdie now we're
approaching 500 kilometer altitude next
now this is the space the space station
but it's really just a Depot now you may
have someone you guys can follow this
stuff in literature you'll see there's
now been a resurgence in people who want
to want to put depots in space for
providing propellant for going to the
moon and going to Mars makes a total it
makes a lot of sense
all the explorers had Depot's ahead of
them like the guys who did the north and
south poles had these big people ahead
of them they would get to the depots and
refill with dog food and food and they
would go onto the North Pole well so you
do need depots in space in the orbit but
the nice thing about this one the novel
feature about this Depot is there are no
storage containers except the ones we
launch up there okay that one's the
classic ones you'll see in the
literature all have these massive it
takes about about seven Falcon 9
launches to this to launch the
containers up by themselves okay we have
none of that
all we have is a manifold we have a
manifold a smart vehicle and you
know that basically the smarts required
to drive this thing into that hole are
barely more than you would use at
RadioShack you drive one of your kids
cars okay so it's not a complicated deal
to do docking and so the manifold is all
we launched up with the Falcon nine for
example that's the thing in the center
and then these injecting and they
they'll go and we have an animation that
was that we may be able to get to work
with you guys but we'll see here but
this will go ahead and dock with those
in those little holes there and then the
manifold will extract the fluid when a
customer comes up and puts his credit
card in per se you can you can extract
the fluid it's like you with a local gas
station next it's a pretty view I've
snagged off some NASA web side of the
earth 500 clicks next okay now now we'll
see if this thing will run here and see
if you can get it to go now if it
doesn't quit well this we're just gonna
fast-forward past this I'll show you the
JPEGs what do you think Kerry okay go
ahead to go to the next one so yeah okay
is this gonna run along here yeah okay
okay this is this is us we actually this
is the real awesome and so that's us I
was on mana dak dak dak no1 this before
9/11 this is he rented a solar project
this is Rick drinking margaritas
somewhere the Bahamas so next okay these
are quotes the sort of current coats you
know Mike Griffin was the was they had a
NASA for a number of years and Mike
believe it or not actually gave me half
a million bucks back in the 80s ladies
just when I started a super heart and he
was one of the first mountain guys that
gave us some cash he says John if he
liked the project he says if you ever
need more money come back to me he was
SDIO in those days so I didn't of course
always needed more money so I went back
to him about a year later he was gone he
would left and gone to NASA
unfortunately but the proper sad truth
of all the NASA administrators is they
inherit a giant legacy of job programs
they had to fulfill for their
congressmen so they have all these
things that I got to do very little of
what they actually have left is related
to what you and I would be interested in
which is probably manned space
exploration they just want to keep these
congressmen happening you've got to
build this
got a bill that you want to make this
thing expensive so we can employ a bunch
of people so a real cynical appraisal of
NASA would say it's turned in for a
wonderful endeavor and then in the 60s
and 70s to have become a jobs program
and I know a lot of NASA guys are good
guys but that's from an outsider's point
of view they've unfortunately become a
dropped program so but these are the
quotes Mike Griffin these guys all want
fuel depots I think that's a natural
natural candidate for our venture
most recently the Augustine report they
all they all understand the need for a
fuel depot but in fact they need more
than that they need cheap fuel the depot
they don't just need a fuel depot
because anyone can launch them fuel but
it's going to cost him between five and
ten thousand per pound that's the
current delivery price for propellant in
orbit so we will we will deliver it for
one four five percent of that number and
it all depends on you know in reality
when you have these these sort of
revolutionary changes you never see a
giant shock in the system you never see
you know we go from $1 a pound to 3
cents a pound right you know and the
reason is there's always middleman that
will sort of massage that curve and make
it more smooth right so you see shocks
what are called shocks in the physics
world where you have discontinuities but
you never see that in the real world in
pricing and stuff but what will happen
is even though our internal prices will
be $200 a pound approximately we will
probably end up charging more than that
because we can okay we're not going to
be the usual capitalist weasels but
there is we have to pay some folks back
so there'll be a payback involved but we
assure you it's not going to be the
5,000 a pound that you will see right
now or the 10,000 you'll see right now
but you'll see way under a thousand a
pound near-term and then we hope to ask
them toed out where we can make the
space extremely affordable where we're
actually charging only say two or three
hundred bucks a pound next these are the
classic curves
now I haven't haven't tried to put in
any exotica here the claim is that
Falcon 9 is going to come in at some
point when it gets gets working is going
to come in about two thousand dollars
per pound to Leo
and the conventional cost they claim or
five thousand in reality they're closer
to ten thousand but I'm giving them the
benefit of the doubt and so we're
comparing ourselves
now obviously our green curve is far
superior to the other curves but this is
hypothetical of course but what happens
the the flavor of the green curve is
that after a few about 50 tons of 50
tons of launch per year you've amortized
this system so we amortized the entire
gun we pay off the gun so it's like
being off your house you can live in the
house for free after that and the
analogous thing would be a falcon 9 had
the first two stages paid for and they
were free okay which they're not Rockets
will always have those first two pages
that are gonna be expensive I'll call
you back sorry excuse me
during Hitler widget so basically uh
where was I anyways so the point is you
got a need of the curve around fifty
tons per year and this is assuming
20-year amortization I didn't go through
all the exotic as far as internal rates
of return and buy and sell and all that
stuff but anyone can do that with the
spread seat but you get the flavor of
this which is that we we amortize the
gun the gun for performance the first
two stages for the rocket we do launch a
rocket but it's a single stage rocket
and that's why this thing is so
affordable it's at least ten times if
not 20 times more more efficient than a
classic three-stage rocket next now this
is something we did back in the 90s on a
really quick thing for DARPA because
everyone says well can you launch
electronics what could you guys really
launch right so we said well we can
launch the satellite no big deal so the
DARPA gave us 40,000 bucks we spent
about a month and a half at Largo
Florida at international test systems I
didn't even use prints we actually
designed this thing sort of on a
blackboard built with it was help of a
machinist they're pretty quick like we
had a GPS on it we had store-and-forward
with cell phones we hit those are
photovoltaics when I taught the Dan
Goldin who was the other day
administrator I knew he said Jonathan
sounds wonderful but I don't think you
can launch photovoltaics
well we launched photovoltaics day in
and day out photovoltaics are the
easiest things to launch because they're
so slim and so we launched photovoltaics
we launched a GPS system like I said we
had NiCad batteries at a Radio Shack for
a power supply for this thing we did
this whole thing in two months for
$40,000 and moved out okay we did 20
test shots 32 of energy's worked like a
charm in fact I
actually I canvassed seven or eight
experts in the field of G hardening and
this is classic I went to the JPL guy he
says well you what you've got to do
you've got to buy the high salt ninety
three oh nine you've got to pop this
it's gonna weigh night you're going to
increase the weight by a factor of ten
okay it's gonna be you're gonna really
jacked the weight up so I talked another
guy Livermore he wanted to charge me
three hundred bucks an hour since you've
got to do these special little micro
balloons and do this and pay me 300
bucks an hour and I'll advise you then I
called me in a call to a Picatinny
Arsenal an older gentleman this is John
let's guess is what they're doing here's
what you do you just go to Walmart you
buy some bison epoxied Walmart's got
five psi tensile on it you know what
solder bond strength is - ksi or the
solder constant this is all served from
an electronics is really small you will
discover your safety factors for an
excess of a hundred on every part on
your cell phone I discovered that when
you drop your cell phone which I want to
do periodically you can't break it it's
hard to break a modern cell phone
because it's rated for a couple thousand
G's they do drop tests on them so
automatically most surface mount
electronics was already G hard this gold
guy says by the way here's advice was
free he says the only problem you gonna
have his transformers okay on your cell
phone things like that you're going to
find little pieces of metal that are
sticking out that are fairly large and
this do the calculation the stress is
equal to the density times the height of
the object times the Gila right you know
what the G that's gonna be you know the
density object take a druggist scale to
your hotel room which the Harriet I did
we took a druggist scale look like a
bunch of cocaine dealers and there's
thinking this electronics apart weighed
each little part and then we then we
used epoxy out of Walmart and we put up
along the sides or the things that look
like they were dubious didn't have
safety factors over a hundred okay again
so we plotted everything that was
necessary we increase the weight of the
whole thing by two percent it was a two
percent penalty as opposed to the JPL
guy will Livermore guy all the expensive
guys were wrong there would have been
this guy who done this for a living for
twenty years
it's a no-brainer thing yeah okay so
that's just an exercise and who you
hired for one thing but but if the point
is G hardening it's very very easy to do
we did not harden any significant optics
I'll admit that we had a small TV camera
on the front which survived beautifully
no words but we haven't even tried to
harden not because I suspect we could do
it and I suspect we would go to things
like for nail optics if necessary
which you could spread out and because
you don't wanna have extended structures
but I don't think that would be too bad
yeah but everything else we can hard
until the cows come home so one thing we
do besides launch propellant will be to
launch satellites responsibly because a
lot of guys need satellites on short
notice but it takes them literally
months to get them in the the queue and
get the delivered and then it's many
many millions of dollars next so here's
the rubber meets the road right now we
de started this little sojourn to raise
money and we started off going to Boston
to the sis space Investment symposium
7:00 and then there was an article as a
result of that that was a New Scientist
and now popular scientists do an article
that's coming out this next month so
we're starting to get a little bit of
publicity and first thing we're going to
do is we're going to break the world
record for altitude it's a two million
dollar phase one and that's with the
supergun that we ran at Livermore we're
going to rent it in a different
configuration this is a very vanilla
shot for us we're the differences we're
going to be shooting up and so I can
show you the configuration but that's a
debts on a scale of 10 that's about a
four and level of difficulty it's very
easy for us to do that's a one-year
project the second phase is to do the
orbital project that's on a scale of 10
about an 8 it's much harder it's going
to take us a couple years it's going to
require 10 million because I've got a
we've got to find some really good
rocket scientists because most of us are
this sort of fake rocket scientists and
bill this bill the vehicle up that will
inject into orbit so we need to orbit
one-kilo our goal they're faced with
orbit 1 kilo 10 million dollars and of
course once that's successful we've
raised a big money which is the next
one's 50 million dollars for phase 3 and
that's professed launching 100-pound
payloads day in day out with one of the
systems like the ones you saw only much
smaller than once you saw there and then
is since I used to be a physicist I
always try to look at the extreme of
things and look look at map units to the
future we want to build a thousand pound
launcher one that launches actually
thousand pounds of AP for our RP eight
or whatever RP one whatever the guys
want xenon I suspect it's going to be a
lot of hydrocarbons and lox we movie my
guess but we want to do that
that's a three-year project half a
billion dollars so that's the real
that's the bounty and if you wanted a
real you can build even bigger bigger
ones if you wanted to that's a two meter
diameter tube it's a kilometer long so
if we can build big long tubes we can do
that and we have to heat the hydrogen up
but that's really pretty much it and I
wanted to tell you one more thing I used
to be a particle physicist when I was a
kid and this is so much easier than that
okay my discipline back in the days when
they're getting into string theory and
stuff you know you were lucky if you
could calculate the mass of the proton
within a factor of two or three or
something and no one never could okay
and they still can't do it
and because in the math would get
extremely arcane and esoteric and all
those weird words and so when you go
into one dimensional gas dynamics you're
shocked how well things work it's it's
incredible I first gascan I built is
that was a theoretician till I was 30
years old first guess kind of built
working within 1% of my code predictions
1% it was a shocker you know and usually
you're happy with it be within 20 to 30
percent or even two in particle physics
so it's very reassuring that the
classical the classical physics is so
easy to understand and this is not this
is not mentally challenging this is the
challenge here is to get the right team
together and raise the cash and do this
in a timely fashion while we're still
young are we still young Rick okay so
anyways next you got Harry gas run
background I could show you guys a bunch
of physics but I didn't have a lot of
time last night so I just whip this out
okay basically they have the world
record for speed that's eleven point two
kilometers per second that is
identically the same as escape velocity
from the earth by coincidence that's
purely because of the low molecular
weight of hydrogen molecular wave two
electric guns everyone likes electric
guns I was hired at Livermore to build
electric guns because I had a background
in magnets and QCD and all sorts of
weird things with magnetic fields it
turns out they'd ever they never panned
out like they were supposed to for a
number of reasons which I could go into
but fundamentally they spent a few
hundred million dollars and they're
still spinning them but maybe still
spending a lot of money on electric guns
because there's this thing that because
there's this fascination with
electricity but in fact real guns well
they have ten or twenty names because
every one time one fails they'll rename
it okay so so the you know the real gun
is a classic one you may have heard of
coil guns you may have heard of
reconnection gun
squinch guns the snow gun the coaxial
gun the post induction gun basically
they're all B equals AI they're
basically involve inductances and
capacitances and switching times and an
energy storage in power conditioning
okay
fundamentally it turns out they're just
expensive as heck and I was one of the
guys if you wanted to build a real gun I
would build a real gun for you guys it
would work but it would top out at two
and a half clicks per second basically
like the Navy is getting right now the
world record they ever got was five and
a half clicks Ivan had kilometers per
second and they spent at least two
hundred million dollars in the era I was
involved in back in the eighties they've
spent more since then so gas guns
basically it's a tube you put some
hydrogen interview heat the hydrogen it
up gets to a hot enough temperature you
can look at the Sound speed let's
release the thing
okay that's basically it now you can do
it in fancier ways like you can inject
along the sides if you want to set
that's sort of a nice thing a nice
nuanced way to do it or you can increase
the pressure by having some clever
clever or switches in the ash section of
the gun but fundamentally you're just
letting a gas expanding it will work it
does work and you try not to keep make
the gas so hot that it melts the
interior of the barrel so typically six
kilometers per second is a good number
for us for several reasons one of them
is the hydrogen never gets above 1700
Kelvin and when you do that the the heat
exchange with the barrel interior it
turns out it's a few hundred Kelvin
below the melt temperature of steel
steel melts around 1700 k so that's why
six kilometers per second is good
another reason six kilometers per second
is good for the muzzle velocities
because the ablation penalties go like
the velocity squared okay so you're
gonna the amount of national blade off
the Q dot in the nose goes like V cubed
but the time of flight feels like one of
our V so the amount of mass you lose
goes like V squared basically the side
load is gonna like V squared so all
these things tend to be high powers of
velocity so six kilometers per second
looks like a really good compromise
number for us we still get 20 percent
payload fraction and we don't have too
many penalties as we egress the
atmosphere so electric guns I hope I
didn't beat up too many electric gun
guys they hate me in that community
because we took all the world records
electric gun guys but gunpowder
gunpowder has been used by some people
you may have read some of the more
colorful books about this guy Jarrell
who is working for Saddam back in the
first Iraq war and he was killed by the
Mossad according to his books for his
work with powder guns and he was an
interesting guy he came out of Canada
and very dynamic individual apparently
was able to get the job done he went to
Barbados and he put together a couple of
Navy's 16-inch guns and called a project
HAARP that was the high altitude
research project and they were able to
launch sounding sounding projectiles up
into the ionosphere things like that
but what happened was mr. Boies he sort
went to the dark side because there was
a lot of money in weapons and he was he
was jailed by our guys for like six
months he became very embittered went to
went to Brussels Belgium started selling
weapons on the international market I
was going to call him just before he got
killed and one of my consultants told me
not to talk to him because he was
dealing weapons so I didn't call him and
he got killed about a month later and
then sort they stuck me in all the books
it's the evil evil follow one guy but
those are exaggerated I'm not really
that evil so gunpowder's a poor
candidate three kilometers per second is
not what you want to get things into
orbit and typically an odd six like it's
already got six ones you guys familiar
with only shoots around 3,000 feet per
second on a good day so it's maybe a
kilometer per second or a little bit
less on a good day so gunpowder is not
what you want you do want to go at
hydrogen helium wouldn't be too bad but
it turns out since helium's monatomic it
has to be have to rent it a lot hotter
than hydrogen to get the same
performance so you end up burned the
marelok with helium so the two light
gases you pick few pick hydrogen every
time and you deal with hydrogen is
relatively safe you just have to know
you know when it escapes it floats up
and it's actually a lot safer than
people give it credit for it's safer
than for example a lot of the pooling
hydrocarbons like propane that will pool
on you or and in confirm explosions in a
confined space but so we've never had an
issue with hydrogen orbital velocity 7.6
so it's perfectly match from the
physicists point of view hydrogen is
matched to the problem we're in a deep
gravity well turns out because GMM over
R swear it is so large we have to we
have to have a lot of juice on the
projectile and the only way to get that
is with the lowest molecular weights you
gas you can buy what's
hydrogen next the picture of shark back
in the 90s next if you guys want to see
this he's probably on the Internet they
did a bunch of stuff with web pages
where they showed the constructional it
was an l-shaped gun it had a 209 60 foot
long pump tube which is 14 inches
diameter made out of you know really
good steel then we drove a one-ton
piston down it at high speeds 300 meters
per second towards that area there where
they're putting in a high pressure
section this is Declan it was being
build it would compress the hydrogen to
about 6,000 psi and then a release thing
would pop and when their release thing
popped the other secondary vehicle would
travel up the other tube which was a
right angles like my thumb is traveling
and we go down there and this was this
was the business into the system so that
anyway get these scramjets for the air
force coming out at Mach 9 or so we
could have gone to Mach 18 with that
system but the Air Force never wanted
they were happy between Mach 7 and Mach
9 in those days next this is an
interesting piece of the project we had
to deal with some heavy metal parts that
inner part is the world's biggest
forging of a of 1410 @a of 1410 is a
super steel they used on arresting hooks
for jet aircraft it's 14th precinct
cobalt 2 nickel and that was the biggest
forging and we shrink fitted him
together so in order to have favorable
tensile stresses at the interior so that
they wouldn't come apart during a shot
we had to
that's a blanket where we'd actually
heat out the heat the outer shell up and
drop the inner shell II and then after
30 minutes we go clink it would lock in
and put compressive stresses on the
inner part we did that three times
because we had I think we had four
shells and so the other shells were made
out of really good gun steel next couple
the guys as Paul has been Lou Bertolini
basically getting the gun ready for a
shot you can see this is in a sort of a
shielded area where they've got concrete
blocks around everything and they assert
the scramjet from back here this is one
of the reaction mask Pistons we had a
hundred tons on each side of the gun it
was like a big big Rube Goldberg device
for you know I didn't want the gun to
recoil so so to make the gun recoilless
I stuck inserted masses on both the back
section and the forward section and this
piston would go from one to the other
and it would transfer momentum from one
to the other so that these big Hunter
ton masses would move on
we had my three road cars it would kick
the cars back and forth and again was
immobile and it was extremely quiescent
the gun did not move during the shots we
actually could major locations or things
in the barrel with strain gauges because
it was so quiet in terms of terms of
sending ripples down the tubes you don't
want to do that with a gas gun so this
is loading the system up to getting
ready for shot next this is one of our
first shots scramjets this was an
interesting part of science or if you
guys follow this little nuance of
hypersonics but you know back in the day
they were trying to get aircrafts of go
from here to Australia in a few hours or
so I've been mocked in aircraft even
they were even talking about plenty I
told the guys well before you get to
Mach 20 why don't you start at the
intermediate Mach numbers just because
it's be careful and they never did they
all is they burned through a couple of
billion dollars worth of money but
supporting one program and we were and
we did help a little bit with our with
our tests of the scram just in fact we
were reprimanded for doing this area me
by some guy says well you know you guys
are all playing entrepreneurial because
we were launching in scramjets at Mach 9
he free flight tests in the world they
didn't do a single free flight test for
two billion dollars he got mad at us for
doing that okay because we're sort of
getting ahead of the guys we're getting
big bucks for doing basically studies
this was a stand Jets we filled it with
hydrogen at six ksi we stuck it in the
gun we had some things which we would
release items in at a certain time he
would compress the air as this thing
runs through the air sea level density
air would stagnate the air and it would
it would process the air so the air was
really hot when they got in the interior
you know what Auto ignite when the
hydrogen hit it so then it would just
but you know what a ramjet is this is
it's a supersonic version of a ramjet
basically all the kinetics and stuff
would work out and the thing would burn
and provide thrust so we launched the
number of these for the air force next
there's one of them in flight you know
these were taking with real high-speed
camera so that's probably like it I
don't know microsecond type camera we
had all nanosecond to microsecond
cameras I'd lost track of the track of
the prefixes next now it's a little bit
of a Arcana this for those of you who
aren't rocket scientists this is the
first guy that really wrote down the
rocket equation it was a Russian dude
and he was a deaf guy and he's
self-educated he was high school teacher
in Russia
and he wrote down the you know m dv/dt
is Rho V squared blah blah blah the
standard stuff and he integrated Det he
gets out this rocket equation in the
rocket equation tells you that your
payload fraction depends very strongly
on what kind of propellant you have what
kind of rocket fuel
hey that's Constantine some soul cos t
then of course during the the v2 project
in Germany that's on the far right here
there is Verna von Braun who was a Nazi
of course and we ran slaves when they
built the v2 s and bombed London
basically sent about a thousand B v2 s
into London and so we of course captured
him and as part of Project Paperclip
took him in about a hundred guys and
made them work on our space program and
the Russians got about a hundred guys
also they captured about a hundred
former Nazi scientist also and took them
in mated their guys and as a result they
beat us and they beat us into space so
Yuri Gagarin got the first orbit in back
in 61 and John Glenn who Harry's on a
committee with John Glenn right now so
but John Glenn got the came in second
didn't he hearing don't tell him that so
okay and her personally the crowning
glory for all of us I think was was I
remember where I was when this happened
I was in a I was fishing in Idaho for
trout with one of my brothers I remember
this scene though in 1969 and Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the
moon right and get some really good
quips and quotes in there the other guy
has to work but around him for a couple
of times so this is the history of
rocketry and I claim nothing really
significance happened since then okay
without being too cruel next now on gun
launch there's an interesting background
on guns because the first guy that
talked about using guns to go to orbit
was Isaac Newton the guy that had
erratically invented calculus and so he
has this little thought experiment where
the guys on a hill he shoots the gun out
and shoots the gun faster and faster
faster of course it they didn't have
guns they didn't have gas guns until
1946 but theoretically I would
high-performance gun you could launch
things into orbit
you had nope no air resistance near on a
hill so he was the first guy then Jules
Verne in 1865 wrote this book call from
the earth to the moon where they were
going to launch three guys to the moon
with his giant thing called the Columbia
and the book was a success and it was
one of his best sellers and along with
the 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and
around the earth in 80 days and then of
course one of my favorite authors was
High Line High Line came along in 66 he
was going to use a in induction gun on
the moon to launch the rocks with the
earth during one of his books and that
was that would have been in 2075 that
would have been a post induction system
and I by the way you know I worked on
those things I don't know how to build
pulse induction guns they're not not a
big deal you just have a coil drive a
current through it and it repels another
coil
this one's it's five magnetism lenses
law problem is the energy energy storage
costs would kill you on the thing and
then stability and a bunch of other
issues so the putting gas in a tube is
actually much much more effective and
cheaper but Heinlein had this idea and
then of course Gerard O'Neill who was
the guy that invented the synchrotron
incidentally he's really interesting guy
and had sort of an unusual haircut but
basically he was a brilliant brilliant
guy who's a particle physicist and he
invented the mass driver with a guy at
MIT called Henry calm and they were
gonna build this thing and they built
some models they never got above a few
hundred meters per second okay because
we've had in a bunch of magnets and
graduate students winding the magnets
and stuff putting him in epoxy and
trying to rub singing down a track it
ever got very fast but he had his heart
in the right place
he wanted to supply my ass from the moon
to l5 a colony on elf I've and that's
one of the garage stable the garage
points and so these are sort of the guys
who were who were popularizers of using
guns to do things regarding space so
there's a little bit of history but none
of them really seized on hydrogen gas
guns next now so so now it towards the
end of this talk here's our first phase
this is just a SolidWorks rendition of
part of the super heart so it turns out
if you take the the pump tube of super
heart which is 240 feet long and you
fill a couple of tubes with hydrogen it
at 15 ksi and a little over a thousand
Kelvin you'll bust the world record
immediately okay we'll get it within a
few shots and so we're gonna we're set
up to do a phase one which would be a 20
phase test at a white sands and that's
just with the current tubes we have
storage in San Diego so we have partial
ownership of that system with the Air
Force right now that is quick-launch has
partial ownership and you can see a
little little sounding Rockets we stick
in there just with some retroreflectors
so you can be attractive make sure you
really pick the record up and so that's
a pretty manila system that's hooves
only 14 inches ID and it's about 17 OD
for the the parts except for the first
couple it's only it's only this big
around basically and it's a few hundred
feet long I think is 240 feet long total
so it's you know on a fairly vanilla
gantry and you just take take hydrogen
and heat it up mildly this is not a real
hotshot
you get this world record you don't have
to run it very hot at all you get six
kilometers per second you've got to get
the hydrogen fairly hot and there's a
heat exchanger for that system we have
we have to build but that's that's a
pretty nice nice easy shot
that's cherry so summary what I want to
convince you if I'm the best I can is
that hydrogen gas guns are well suited
physically for delivering and payloads
into low orbit and we claim it'll be 5%
of rocket costs just fundamentally
because you get rid of the first two
stages of the rocket amortize the gun is
an amortized bull first stage and then
if you look at the numbers you ought to
go back if you guys are interested in
its go back and look at the amount of
propellant they used to go to send guys
to the moon turns out what I came up
with is metrics was the it takes a
hundred thousand pounds to propellant in
low orbit 100 thousand pounds to send
one person to the moon and back paper is
return ticket that's what we actually
spent we spent a little bit more than
that on the Apollo project and if you
analyze I did that was real data so I'd
look related from the six or seven
launches to the moon a hundred thousand
more than it was actually 96 percent of
the mass was per comments wasn't ninety
percent of 96 percent so propellant is
the big item now you say you want to go
to Mars well it turns out I've looked at
a couple studies one by von Braun and
the other one was by Boeing and that one
looked one was using Nerva technology
would not had a second isps von braun's
was very conservative with two eighty to
eighty second storable liquids and I
ever those numbers when I came up with
about a million pounds you need a
million pounds
of propelling in low orbit to send one
guy to Mars and back a million okay
there's no getting around that
okay that's just the laws of physics and
so you need propellant in Leo gas
parties far more than you'll ever need
people or computers or anything else
it's it's going to be the elixir of
space so what we're proposing here is
that rockets plus quick launchers will
revitalize manned exploration in the
21st century of space and that's what
we're going after right now so Dec we're
on our way to see a venture capitalist
and your neck of the woods in about two
hours we wanted to drop off here and say
hi to you guys first okay tell me why do
you have those three colors what's the
with the three colors I don't know I
just use Google as a search engine but
why is it it's red and anyone know I
like them I think it's great but okay
any questions guys go ahead sir I'll go
okay great
how much do you lose by lunching from
sea level as opposed to like on a
mountainside it depends on what size
object if you're talking 100 kilo object
for example you're gonna lose about half
a kilometer per second just to
atmospheric okay drag if and if you went
of course if you were at Mauna Kea you'd
probably lose about 200 meters per
second so it does make a little
difference if you're if you're a much
bigger vehicle like we're proposing with
the big system it's almost non-existent
it just goes through that and I can show
you the curve but once you kid past ten
kilos you get out you will get the
object will get out into space okay if
you launch it if it's pointy enough and
this is a hypersonic regime in a
hypersonic regime the drag is very easy
to calculate just twice a sine squared
of the angle okay of the gizmo you got a
little bit of base drag which is 1 over
gamma M squared where M Samak number
okay so the drag is trivial to calculate
once you're above Mach 5 okay bottom
line is anything about 10 kilos gets out
okay but the penalty is smaller for
small objects it is smaller excuse me
piddly the bigger small objects right
just like on a football field you know
you they get hit
mister
I hate to bring this up but can you talk
about like the competition with space
elevator
well actually I know those guys I like
the space elevator guys they bought me a
beer last time I saw them
no ice probably Keef lobstermen those
people and I actually I tend to be this
little bit disdainful of people that I
don't consider serious because this has
got to be done while we're still alive
basically but but I actually like those
guys but let's put it this way I spent
two years to an environmental assessment
for our project for super-hard it could
fall down and crush the town of
Philadelphia okay if you built a space
elevator I could wonder they're talking
about aside from the issues actually can
you build it you're going to have
massive environmental issues to deal
with and the physics I'm sure most of
the physics holes together you know
because those guys know their physics I
talked too about the electricity
magnetism and all this stuff they know
the physics it's fine and they probably
found some good high tensile materials
like spectra to hold things together
which have you know high yield and
they're looking for course we're all
looking for unobtainium but but so I
like the people that I don't consider
them competitors okay let's put into
that way after we've got two questions
one is the small satellite you showed
that could withstand 3200 G's what
actual testing did you do on that yeah
we took it to a place called national
test systems in Largo Florida and what
they did was they had a gas gun of a
different sort
they had a helium gun which had a piston
it would it would drive this piston
towards towards the target which in our
case was the satellite okay and it would
provide an impulse and there was a
little bit of helium between the piston
and the thing so it was sort of the
impulse would spike up like this okay
and you look it on us put a scope trace
on it you get a couple scope traces to
see what the g-loads were and so then it
would kick this thing off like like a
like a pool ball okay towards one of the
pockets and they would recover it at the
end of the gun so maybe 200 feet down
they would recover it would run into
some telephone books and stuff like in
their capture area and we recover it and
we would take it apart and sure enough
it would work the other one was said a
couple times that this was ten or twenty
times more efficient than a chemical
rocket and then you had a graph that was
showing a couple different kinds of
chemical
if I understood it but I don't yeah I
didn't understand what you meant by this
being more efficient and I'll explain
that a little yeah what I meant was it
the payload fraction is the bottom line
for us in other words you've got to
build us you've got to build a gizmo
right it's gonna be at Istomin you throw
away you never will not gonna recover
this this rocket more than likely maybe
you can do that's we're not arguing that
case okay with it with the conventional
rocket as you know you rarely recover a
conventional rocket like the Falcon ones
or Falcon nines and so the the figure of
Merit is is how much payload do you have
divided by the total mass of the rocket
in our case that's 20 over 20 percent in
the case of Pegasus Pegasus is 1 you may
be familiar with it's launched off a
b-52 it's 1.4 percent so if we're at 20
we're 28 percent here 1.4 were 20 times
better
assuming everything costs the same on a
per pound basis if you did
supid make that a quick assumption which
is not strictly true if you assume that
then you can see why we're at a 20 to
one advantage so those graphs we were
showing were your device with different
possible final stages actually no those
those those graphs were that the first
graph was was the conventional was
$5,000 per pound Oh Steve Munro talking
about that raft the earlier graph with
the boxer right there with yeah there
was actually six curved Ford report
proof area workers okay the top the top
two curves were for a specific impulse
liquid rocket with a specific impulse at
320 seconds that would probably LOX
looking on the final stage of your
system correct
that's correct yeah okay for ours and
then the second curve was more like a
solid rocket more vanilla but I don't
want to launch him because if they
detonate in the gun and we lose the gun
we're down for six months on the guide
so I don't want a lot of solids in the
gun okay look what's your my paper to
launch you talked a little bit about a
the front side heat shields you also
need a backside heat shield right I'm
not significantly you know because your
heating rate goes like the density and
so you know your q dot with its the so
called eating rate for these things
we've run analysis in it and both both
with codes with fluent and scaled
composites the guys that you know the
guys that just did the they're going for
the what's what's the call here that is
the X PRIZE yeah we work with those guys
back in the late 90s they had to run
codes for us and there's there's very
modest heating on the backside from the
hydrogen don't know from the odor in the
magma during a launch right yeah it's
only in bore for less than a second okay
it's only in work for less than a second
and if you can see the nice thing about
this is you can go to a blackboard and
show you the thermal diffusion time and
in less than a second is probably less
than a millimeter on almost any material
okay except for diamond okay so and how
cool can you keep the payload I mean
it's oh we're good when we blow the
aeroshell off within a minute
so that aerosol which was like an inch
thick gets blown off within a minute
it's it's basically it's it's soaking up
heat but it's also insulating from your
pay tub okay so there will be a little
air gap and then you lose the heat
shield entirely is just gone okay so
then then you're coasting to remaining
five or six minutes till you get to the
depot and you should be cool you
shouldn't you shouldn't have any any
heat issues are there issues with
hydrogen embrittlement and your steel
barrel and your hydrogen yeah there were
I spent about three months going through
that issue back in the 90s with when we
rebuilt super harp because the relevant
concerns so the trick is you pick a
metal a steel which is typically has a
decent amount of COBOL stainless you try
to be sort of stainless heat and then
you also try to keep your the time that
the system is hot down and you try to
keep the pressure down that turns out
for a lot of these systems like this
two-stage got into super harp we only
had a hydrogen there for less than a
second so there was no embrittlement
issues but we did have to analyze it
quite a quite a bit but then it turns
out if you have sustained temperature in
pressure okay then you do have to worry
and so the on the on the aft section of
this tube along the kilometers long
gizmo there's about a hundred meters we
have to be concerned about that
so we'll probably stick a stainless
alloy like you know in bar or in bar or
Hastelloy will be one of our liners on
that part of the system to keep it from
being briteling
and one thing we don't talk about is we
have significant intellectual property
on this thing but what you'll promise
you some of this stuff in the popular
science article but we're going to make
it out of composites so the liner will
be steel in the red in the outer part is
going to be
composite in a graphite by couturier 740
for example sporting-goods graphite and
the benefit of that for the SI launched
version is that the thing is neutrally
buoyant so it's not going to sink to the
bottom if we made it out of pure steel
it would sink like I can handle to the
bottom of the ocean you'd have to really
suspend it but if you can make it out of
composites you can dial the densities
trivially to make it neutrally buoyant
and that's what we want for these Sea
Launch version the nice thing about that
is when you build really big structures
they tend to have a gravitational sag
you know that's Galileo discovered that
that phenomena right that's why
elephants have really big ankles right
and so uh so basically you might put it
in the ocean and it makes it a neutrally
buoyant we get around that we have no
gravitational sag so the barrels can be
very straight no problems with water
currents changing the shape of the tube
well it turns out that the that's more
of a global thing so so that the things
you're talking about like you're talking
about there are currents in the ocean
they're typically about a tenth of a
meter per second in many cases down near
the equator which is our favorite
location and but those were over you
know tens of miles mile scales so when
you when you do the math on that it
turns out that's not an issue two
questions for you one once you've fired
the object into space could you tell us
a little bit more about how that's going
to be propelled over and navigated in to
docking station right and then secondly
the foil that you showed there with the
gun suspended under the water there was
a picture of the ocean above that I've
seen the ocean look like that once more
often than not it doesn't look like
right right it all depends on what part
of the ocean area that's the Atlantic if
it's a perfect storm you're in trouble
right well but the good news about the
ocean is that basically after you've
gone down a few meters 10 meters or so
it's pretty quiet and all the actions
the first 10 meters and this is a real
stiff system so I don't anticipate at
issues there also the equatorial climbs
tend to be a lot balmy er than the stuff
that you saw with George Clooney and
stuff being being drown in that movie
okay so I don't anticipate that being a
problem what was your other question
oh yeah yeah basically this thing is
going to have some smarts on board okay
and there will be obviously be these sub
communications with the depot as well
and there's a thing called an attitude
control system for rockets ACS is what
they call them and that that tells you
okay I want to go towards that star and
make a jog towards Neptune okay little
star seekers and things like that or
detectors things like that and of course
these days you have GPS that would work
as well for us get us within a few
meters so we have all the smarts the
smarts all this much you can imagine
you're buying for your wife this
Christmas basically okay oh yeah
as far as the what you saw there in that
little that little picture a peg was
basically in rp1 locks system okay at
three and twenty second ISP so once
cryogenic and one's not the the fuel of
the arm you want is not cryogenics just
ordinary it's basic kerosene and you
burn that you have any couple igniters
on that thing it only burns for a
hundred seconds and then the whole thing
is there's there's some IP here but
basically we spin this and I have I have
a toy company too okay you've noticed
but I have a toy company called stars
for it so we specialize and things that
fly and if you look on the net and go to
go twos iclone type to type in cyclone
you'll see one of my gizmos that we
license to zinc and it's basically a
flying ring you know Larina is a lifting
body you take the wedding ring off like
this you spin it okay
it's a lifting body and it will it will
fly because it's got to look to drag
relationship ten to one frisbees at that
form okay it's true or three times
better than it is B so what so I tend to
work on things that spin and and so in
fact that's one of the issues we came up
with we're gonna spin this with this
body and then it turns that you can
drive procession with a single ACS
thruster everyone else uses six
thrusters so you know in the god bless
NASA but I mean the more guys they can
stack on a problem to make it expensive
the better right and we go the other way
we want to make this wall we're still
young right Rick still in our 80s
so that's the goal we want to make this
affordable and quick as in quick launch
did you have a question yes sir you guys
all good okay you shorter here
you ready to get here this is the the
opening switch you can back can you back
it up anyways a conditional gas cow
gaskets have a diaphragm and it blows
fractures like this four petals go out
this is a more subtle one so it allows
Eisen to get behind the vehicle in this
case I may have misled you no sharp the
supergun that we have now has a piston
in it the one you're seeing here the
quick launch does not have a piston
there's no piston pistons tend to be
they have a lot of momentum associated
with it so it causes problem engineering
issues so what we're going to do in this
area to the right we have a heat
exchanger that's not shown there so we
send it hydrogen in it about two to
three ksi so a conventional hydrogen you
can buy hydrogen not from the welder
supply at 3 ksi if you want to okay
you're injected into the base section
and then we use liquid natural gas which
we gasify mix with the air float in
there and it drives the heat exchanger
so it heats the heat exchanger up so
this whole thing rises in temperature
and pressure
so the temperature goes from 300 Kelvin
to somebody hundred Kelvin and the
pressure goes from say 2600 psi to 15
psi and then at that point you're ready
to release the release the hounds okay
it's about 10 minutes yeah it's because
we got to burn a lot of our gala burn a
lot of natural gas this thing is huge I
mean this is not a small system you
can't tell if there's no there's no
people in it for scale but it's that's a
over a kilometer long that tube there
the base section is four meter so it's
like 15 feet and over here it's 2 meters
two and a half meters you know so that's
approaching yeah it turns out if you do
the trick where you just take hydrogen
you burn it with with oxygen it turns
out you top out about three to four
kilometers per second
because like you said your molecular
weight goes up and now you have steam
and so it's
it's not the best but if you only want
to get to say three or four kilometers
per second that's the fastest way to get
there and that was called a steam gun
they did a bunch of stuff with that in
the 60s again named Lord did it much
work with steam guns we go in you bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
