coming my name is Alan Hutchison i'll be
your host for the next few days and I
really appreciate everyone making effort
to get here today and be here so early
in the morning or at least if your
google persons and early in morning
we've got a lot of people flown in from
out of town it's great to see you I
really am glad that you were able to
make it you're going to hear a lot from
me later but right now I've got the
special pleasure of introducing Shannon
mar he is the engineering director for
the office here in London and he just
has a few words of welcome so Jen
good morning everybody i do right you
want to say good morning i die i echo
allen stars it's a great scene or much
returning it i paralyzed i look at the
the agenda that you guys have there's a
very good set of people giving
presentations I as part of my
responsibilities agata to talk to you
about 15 minutes of what we do here and
welcome and what I'm an engineering
director site director for that what my
perspective on the testing problems that
we have at escalation punk we have till
Monday specifically I'm responsible for
Google's worldwide for the young our
mobile activities so I will obviously
have a mobile pin I tell anybody who
works going to give a presentation there
that the toll for that presentation is
for me to talk about mobile I hope it's
not a high school so let's see top ones
so welcome
Ltd on the gentle are getting i'll talk
about testing google i think some people
may have some preconceived notions
involved what testing the google is all
about it in when google's own natural
inclinations towards testing is about
because of some products in somewhere
history would like to go through that if
it's subnets interested in some of
there's definitely two main and then
talk to you about some of the challenges
of the mobile world and there are
significant challenges i did notice and
the medical people that will also be
talking about this abyss with same topic
later on the agenda so testing in poop
what do you guys think about when you
think about testing in google you maybe
think about gmail gmail beta ji mo betta
that was initially introduced as beta on
april first and on spacious day 2004 and
is still in beta does that sort of ring
a bell what do you think about what i
consider be maybe the coolest product
that we have out there google earth but
even we understand that with that that
we had a little bit of reputation on
what you can see this but if this is
what is the coolest t-shirt that we have
google is all about food and t-shirts
but it says google earth 4.7 billion
years and still in beta and so that's
the age of the earth we expect that at
some point less than 4.7 billion years
will get out of beta for gene if you
consider some of the background of
google maybe you can see where we get a
perspective and also going this a little
bit further but super 1997 that is eight
half years
though a backrub which would be capable
was an academic quad project at Stanford
so the company has a deacons very deep
roots in the academic world and if
actually the company is actually very
very know intense in the sense of just
longevity years which is which has led
to a couple of interesting so what we
have here that's a picture of the Google
Data Center in 1997 and again you can
maybe draw some inferences of what we
thought about it but you ain't testing
back then and as we try to develop very
good very effective search technologies
in what's happened as being able forward
to 2060 couple year old picture of one
of our data centers these two thousand
for such a full generational but one of
the things I point out is that the
difference between these two pictures is
part of where we get our emphasis
reconsider total quality deployed of our
technologies to be the measure not just
not necessarily the number of all
removed Bob's ability of frequency of
occurrence rated modes those kinds of
metrics so we spend a lot of time
looking at things from different
perspectives and what does that mean
what we took kind of pride ourselves on
when trying to be innovative when
solving all performs what their
technology problems our development
problems quite a global problems and our
QA and testing needs and we do try to
take a first-principles approach
so just look at a couple examples of
this what we do at Google if you think
of the whole concept that we are
serviced probably the most used service
in the world these days with one we
believe one of the largest data centers
behind us to the systems of data centers
what happens when you have a component
that were component or system failure
well you get this there's two funnel
fundamental ways to an engineer around
that problem one is what I say is the
standard approach here which is just
part really expensive stuff and make
sure it's all tolerant and so the
example here is using great equipment
for the data that you need to be
redundant so that when one when one
spindle fails you have redundancy well
our approach actually at a fundamental
level is to this problem is much
different it's to develop fault
tolerance software to deploy multiple
data centers and to ensure that the
whole system using normal standard
products cheap as a matter of fact that
you miss components we can get that fit
our needs needs are high the whole
system's level where we're form elements
not necessarily an individual component
level it's a very different way of
looking fence similarly if you look at
the problem of a system returning what
you might consider the wrong answer so
standard approach would be to try to
debug you try the two did you try to
force ticked up algorithmically to get
the right answer little bit but our
approach is very different we r e SQ
individual tuning that doesn't that
doesn't mean we don't do it but that
means that's not our first line of
defense what we've rather do is develop
that will take advantage of a massive
amounts of data the mask amount of use
that will get over time within the
machine learning or some similar type of
approach tune in the right answer so try
to try to speed back from a whole system
to get the right answer that doesn't
mean we can't begin the time of movie
but we have to get that first obviously
but again both the systemic approach we
take is to try to use our machine
resources to solve the poem and
referring back to the last slide I
talked about if you look at the problem
of the existence of a market we are
trying to create lots of components and
many of these products it's problematic
whether there is even a market for these
in Christ and this is where we get the
the what is beta mean the Google
question we do we absolutely do try to
get on it into people's hands really
users hands as quickly as possible which
means it may not have a complete full
feature set that we may expect for the
future but we want to get user feedback
as we had you'll approach and you see
this with google apps that we have lots
and lots of new files to Google with
lots of announcements we want to make
sure that things we're doing a catchy or
subtraction rather than have it have a
deep long live development paths so when
it comes to the question testing and QA
why should I approach any differently we
also that is where my star approach in
terms of fundamentally how we approach
it and we still won't take an innovative
first-principles approach to
and with open Alan and others talk about
that I know we have a couple of our
people on the agenda now I know you got
to pay the toll now you get here about
mobile but I'm perhaps i would like what
i want is anybody walking outta here
wanting to solve mobile QA problems
because they are real they're extremely
they're very interesting one of the
reasons I've been immobile for ten years
one of the reasons I've stated because
the challenges are so real so the first
question should always be why do you
care and for our from our perspective
this is a global mission is pretty well
known to organize the world's
information make it universally
accessible and useful there's no better
way to do this then via mobile phone
especially if I were universally
accessible that's the thing that you
carried with your most edge of
communications device it is likely we
all believe yet people it's likely to be
the motives for accessing information in
the future most standard way and if you
look at the size of the market mobile
subscribers are about to boss times the
size of internet users these are mobile
voice subscribers right now but we're at
about 2.2 2.4 billion depending Clayton
County mobile subscribers today Internet
users are about half I'm not sure you
can see this asserts its small one right
here the very interesting thing is and
one
we have development center here in
London that's focused on mobile is that
we are at greater than one hundred
percent penetration and mobile in many
highly penetrate markets including most
of Western Europe what that means is you
can almost assure yourself that anybody
over the age of about nine rooms and
these days as at least the very high
probability of being accessible via
mobile phone and it changes the way the
people people communicate that's the US
but by contrast is more like 75 to 80
percent and it just hasn't crossed that
very word but it is certainly a well and
often used modality for the medication
but it is not the method of
communication that's a very different
social aspect to that again that's one
of the reasons why we spent time here
and in Japan with developing around the
world from local the mobile phone mark
is about four times the size on an
annual basis of the pc market this
market changes and the new product gets
delivered and gets into people's hands
very quickly that means that new
capabilities and we believe that there's
going to be a normal distribution future
there'll be people only use mobile
phones to access data in whatever the
internet y Argentines so i won't go
through all this but this is this is the
sciences google google mobile today's
sort of because i took a slide that
already existed and it's already on a
date these are properties that we
deliver in mobile now there are a number
of them to search mobile maps which is
award winning winning java app search i
think you know if you've heard of google
searching water mobile a personal home
Dec
customized for individual use gmail all
these products were in the process of
rainy mobile and a number of new
products as well so we have a wide
portfolio but then I talked a little bit
about the challenge what do we do with
this stuff and how do we get in the it's
a mobile world and how do we test it in
particular again anybody who comes up
with with some of the right answers here
that are there are prizes but we'll work
the problems the whole platform which in
which to me means the whole delivery
mechanism vehicle a whole value chain is
incredibly fragmented we have far as
opposed to the wire internet where
companies like Google used to spilling I
filled with other appearance in or
someplace and just having it show up at
the users of desktop magic happens
that's good magic for us we have to
engage much more deeply in the
connectivity when you talk about mobile
so connectivity mechanisms of not only
IP but SMS in witness where might push
is a TP other other mechanisms of
connecting to mobile devices some of
them proprietor you guys don't see this
in Europe you lucky but there is several
different fundamental airline
technologies and that advocates on how
we go by the connectivity but also if I
bifurcates a lot of the a lot of devices
so in the States there's at least four
there's some old stuff there's some in
your lamps and those times when the
states there's there's cdma is a very
big later work in China Japan there were
two others in the States even has
something nextel had a non-proprietary
early technology
there are many different relevant markup
languages so content formatted for
mobile maybe format in one of three or
four markup languages and HTML is still
important that is where we've got in our
case a huge index of data that we'd like
to push to mobile so bottom of this
about Morris Mobile's importantly you
wind up having three of three to six
carriers in the country in the US with
many more to 50 or 60 depending on how
you count them in each one of those has
productivity issues even it's still a
very juvenile space with incomplete
adherence to specs and particularly sake
is one of the things we'd like to do but
that lifts the specters I can't just
vote nobody follows it completely and
those who fall completely probably
completely different ways between them
the handset plan for themselves are very
very incompatible between symbian
microsoft all one of the things that
Microsoft did for us on the pc world is
create a uniform platform which for all
that Microsoft Microsoft apologist I did
I did live in red in Washington 20 years
ago I didn't want for ransom but but
that is a great thing that enabled us to
target really one powerful one time I'm
going to move on forward but rather than
spending our time trying to create
abstraction layers and delivered
multiply multiple platforms as the pc
world was maturing there was one there
was really one specification we don't
have that goal and this is this is the
number that i use a goal people wait it
turns out that if you want to create
browse technology on mobile devices
there are over 11,000 user agents that
we have tracked and we have preferred
the capabilities tables of that we may
have to respond to when we go to request
for search
that's pretty daunting that means that
if so Alan early it will be back there's
a charge of the mobile testing that
means if we want to test each one of us
and not use automation not use any
reasonable techniques we have a lot of
fingers pressing a lot of homes with a
lot of networks so the savior of bolton
was going to be java terms of job itself
is very very is very fragmented there
have been over a thousand j srs which
are mutations to java filed in is not
over thought about a thousand number
numbers Jenks are Muhammad is actually
made it when I actually asked my java
guys how many tapes ours Loretha mobile
theater was very telling it was I don't
know so even the guys who spend their
time doing Java don't know how many GS
are important for mobile we came up with
a number of about 85 I'll be about 20 of
which I'm really so if you do the math
and they realize these are all this all
piled on top pitcher than a
combinatorial the the individual paths
through this this mess is pretty
daunting and it requires some really
good thinking so a couple other things
that really feature into the end of the
space is that the whole value chain is
different and the value chain is
influenced by many different people it's
not the case that you can like.the pc
the one player can interact with the
user get their product in front of the
user and dessert right directly dealing
with an application provider or a
service provider carriers is there's
OEMs and the content providers as well
as multiplex into the browser and navy
academy portal so for that reason we
spend a lot of time partner partnering
with both the device o Williams the
operators in isp so the the software
vendors that
and that has very respectable patients
for how you do tests when you deliver a
mass-market product win a weigh-in were
to a Vodafone you spend a lot more time
especially with people with multi
billion dollar OEMs or carriers that are
used to dealing with hundreds of
millions of subscribers you can't be
quite as ad hoc making a bunch of more
disappointing ways maybe that good may
be bad but certainly won't disappoint
ways of certifying the product and as a
vendor way or provided by google we have
to be within facebook that's a challenge
the challenge fail to work with great
partners like that so the issues call
for a specific comprehensive testing
strategy not explain what that is but
they they get some of the questions I
think you'll be asking today there's a
good reason acha tell you what that is I
don't think we've got it all figured out
it's very hard but you need systematic
best friends but you need them to be
able to move quickly to adapt to what
what you're focusing which had covered
the complexities and to do some sort of
separation of variable sum of all these
things and do that in a reasonable way
and do them a way that's that's analytic
and that give immediate debate with
partners with something like I said
that's it that's hard so again the
favorite aggressive syllable is here
there are promises it does require
automation notices testing automation I
wanted to sort of get a map perspective
on the testing but there's no way with
these kinds of numbers with the 2.2 to
2.4 billion with a hundreds of carriers
with the tens of thousands of phone
devices maybe family target a hundred
lives there's no way we can be effective
in this space without pain without being
automated but device automation and
mobile automation itself is just just as
for basic testing is not straightforward
you don't have control of that devices
programmable it's not necessarily
something that you can fix you easily so
that that's got its own no it's all
little problems I'll leave you with a
couple slides just sort of going forward
it's a more the reason that we want to
get this face get involved and continue
to interact with all the players is that
we believe will be concerned providing
fairly immersive and very rich
experiences and we're proving that out
some of our partners right now so we may
need to be good at the basics and then
start delivering even better better
experiences this is not to this is the
sliders not to say that we're going at
the desktop in your pocket but that we
do believe that we can deliver forms at
desktop we take this huge HTML
repositories that we have our index HTML
and deliver fundamental with the parts
of that information that you want and
need to your phone for chance of
transporting other capabilities it then
in the future like I said have been
immobile for 10 years but the future the
real desire the real need for a company
like ours and for the whole space is to
start its then standing and being able
to make the phone to more things these
are some of the places that we've all
been talking about for years some of
them becoming through mobile payment is
one of those things that I refer it was
a zero billion dollar market it's been
around ideas have been around since 2000
1999-2000 one that is the next big thing
headquarters has location-based things
another zero building normal markets or
like artificial intelligence when is it
going to hit it started to there are
lots of people doing good things and it
will it will be there about the issues
that i told you about school japan
chemicals are clearly very important
and I think that's really all I had said
just wanted to give you an idea what I
hope will look like for mobile air and
turn it back over to all right so we
have to put switch over here and that
will give it to you okay right so as I
said before if you came in late my name
is Alan Hutchison I'm your host for the
google test automation conference here
at london this is the first time that
google has ever done a technical
conference like this with an emphasis on
testing and i'm really pleased that
we've had a great turnout and so many
people here who are eager to talk about
the subject of test and test automation
by way of a brief introduction as i said
i'm the host for the conference if you
have any problems concerns come find me
you can email me at a th at google com
I'm the manager for one of our testing
groups here at Google my teams are
responsible for mobile testing as
Shannon talked about I'm also
responsible for all of our testing teams
in Europe my interest in automation
testing goes back a long way I started
in this field at Indiana University in
the 90s working on next generation
networking platforms I started
automating testing there because it's
really hard to set up a hundred routers
at a time I moved from Indiana
University to cisco systems and did
automation platforms there for several
years I did a couple of startups in the
Silicon Valley mostly around Wi-Fi and
came to Google about two years ago
and since I've been here at Google I've
been doing automation work in a couple
of different fields so all kinds of fun
things and if you're interested more i'm
sure we'll get a chance to chat later so
welcome why are we here I think the
number one question that I got as we
were starting to put this conference
together is why would we have a
conference on test automation a group so
the real answer is this is a
housewarming back in November we started
an engineering office here in London our
first test people came on in Zurich and
London in March and January we haven't
done testing in Europe before so I moved
out here in May to leave the testing
herbs here in Europe and I started
thinking about the we need some money to
introduce the google test team to the
wider community and there were a lot of
ideas we could have a barbecue we could
you know have a dance
good but the idea I liked the most was
we can have a testing conference and the
best part of it is I've always thought
that the test conferences were not quite
technical enough they didn't have the
right depth of technical content that I
really want to see a depressing
conference well what I've learned is the
cool thing is if you put on your own
conference it has exactly what you want
to see so one reason we're doing a
testing conferences because I feel that
the community really needs to have much
more technical test conferences and this
conference is an example of the way to
do that or at least a suggestion of the
kind of Content that I personally would
like to see in a test conference going
forward it's also a way to help the
community you know we didn't charge
anybody to come here the participants
only had to pay their travel expenses if
they had them to come to the conference
this is one of the only large free test
conferences happening in this area so
that's pretty cool Google is providing
the facility and I'm really thankful to
Shannon for letting us kick the entire
office out of their lunch room for two
days so that we could take it over and
press conference here this is the start
of an ongoing conversation the agenda
topics for this conference well the
things that I'm very interested in there
also thinks that the community as a
whole is very interested in one of the
things that we did that was really
different from a lot of conferences is
that we asked people to write an essay
in order to attend a lot of people
thought this was kind of weird and I
grade this kind of weird because most
people just say give us a check and show
up but
I'm trying to differentiate this
conference from others that you might
have been to you know if you pay a few
hundred dollars and go to Disneyland for
five days you know you'll learn some
things but you don't necessarily have a
group of people who are passionate about
test automation everyone here is here
because they have an interest in
automation so it was great we asked
people to write a short essay about why
they want to become we went through all
of these responses and pulled out some
interesting interesting thoughts that
people had and I want to keep these in
mind as we go through the next two days
because I think it's really telling
where the audience is coming from where
the people who are watching these talks
are coming from and frankly this is
really telling for the people who are
going to watch these talks later as many
of you know we're actually video
recording all these thoughts you can see
the band with a very large camera back
there and we're going to post all of
these talks on google video as soon as
we can after the conference it's my
sincere hope that we have them all up by
the end of next week that means that not
only are we having a conference with
people here in this room but we're
having a discussion with people from all
over the world people who couldn't make
it to London but are very interested in
the topic people who in some cases our
students or some cases our instructors
who unfortunately especially here in the
UK have go back to school this week so I
think if this is as I said it a start to
a dialogue we've designed the conference
and the schedule for the conference to
allow for a lot of interaction so you'll
see that each talk is about 45 to 60
minutes long there's a formal question
and answer period at the end of each
talk and then there's a 15 min
break you'll see in a lot in a lot of
conferences where you kind of do six
sessions and then you have lunch and you
kind of it's kind of like going back to
school right you take your comforts bag
and your stuff and you do you go from
room to room to room and we get to see
all these come from all these talks but
you don't really get a chance to talk to
anybody I hope that you take the
opportunity to chat with your fellow
participants and speakers over the next
couple of days I think that the most
interesting parts of this conference are
going to come out of those discussions
so what are some people interested in
how to calculate the return on
investment for test automation testing
for scalability integration testing
tools tools versus you know homegrown
tools open source tools versus
off-the-shelf tools automation obviously
how to test JavaScript and AJAX there's
a really interesting presentation coming
up on that topic test driven development
how does that play into the larger QA
cycle how are the agile technologies how
our test driven development methodology
is related to QA where is automated
testing going how do we maintain high
availability web services how do we load
test massively distributed data centers
web services
are we scale test frameworks and one of
the things that I was most happy to see
is a couple of people put in their essay
i am especially interested in sharing
experience with my peers so what are you
especially interested in we've seen a
list of quotes that came out of the
essays for participants we saw some
things that I'm interested in you've got
the list of speakers and their topics
but what are you interested in I
encourage everyone to take a minute grab
your badge out of the little plastic
sleeve and write a one or two-word topic
that you're interested look for people
who are interested in the same thing or
look for people who are interested in
something completely different find
people who are interested in topics that
you have never heard of
a couple of schedule updates and
conference managers that they've asked
me to make sure to let you know first of
all the toilets are that way go out to
the Orion came in in and you turn left
just before you exit secondly there's no
smoking here or on the balcony there is
smoking downstairs at the lower lobby
just outside the back and look for
people with google badges like these
they can direct you to where ever you
need to do where you need to go or
answer your questions if you have some
we've had one scheduled update the
testing Metro Wi-Fi talk on Friday that
was originally scheduled for 515 has
been moved to 2 45 and we've also
created a session for lightning talks
I'm sure a lot of you have seen
lightning talks another conference if
raise your hand if you're familiar of
this kind of idea all right so like this
half of the room cool so light you talk
is a short five-minute talk that you
give on the spot the idea here is that
you can share insights from the
conference present an idea maybe
something that you want to write a talk
about in the future but haven't had a
chance or something that just struck you
in the next couple of days share an
experience if you have something that
you think other people here would like
to hear about that makes an excellent
subject for lightning talk the format is
five minutes per speaker and that is
strictly observed we will pull you off
the stage at the end of your five
minutes that means we have ten slots
Harry Robinson is going to be the
facilitator for this where's Harry there
is Harry's I got over there so if you
have an idea make sure to talk to Harry
you can email him at Harry are at google
com and he will set up your slots kind
of on a first-come first-served basis so
there 10 available right now
if you are going to do slides which are
not required make sure to send them to
Harry by a bunch tomorrow we'll have
them all on a single computer so that we
can get through all the talks at the
time we're going to do some follow-up
from this conference I can follow up is
going to be really important for the
kind of conference we're doing here so
first of all when you all go home you're
going to get an email from us at asked
how we did what you thought of the
conference what went well what didn't go
so well what you thought of the speakers
and if you have comments or suggestions
on how we can improve this format I'm
going to read all of that I'm really
