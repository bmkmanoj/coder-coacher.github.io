digital Copyright registries and similar
animals we are really grateful to have
seven panelists with us this afternoon
from different organizations doing
registries of some sort and this is mike
source set the context for this earlier
talking about the different approaches
whether it's built and they will come or
providing as a side benefit is a side
effect of doing something else so each
one of them is going to talk a little
bit about what they're doing and five to
10 ish minutes please and and then we'll
have time for questions and then after
this panel will have a plenary session
where we can also continue to discuss
these sort of questions about registries
etc that might come up during these
talks so I'm going to turn it over to
Devin copeley from know Mike media hi
folks so I got them all wireless here so
I figure I'll wander around the room a
little bit I don't know how many of you
have heard of no ink so I just want to
provide a little bit of an introduction
to what we're doing and how we are
coming to the whole the problem of
registries so noak media is a company
that was spun off from the Berkman
Center at Harvard Law about a year and a
half ago it's based on the work that
Terry Fisher and some of his colleagues
have been doing on the what's become
known as the alternative compensation
model so that's basically finding
another way to locate some revenue for
owners of digital content so my name is
Devon Copley I'm the CTO of the company
and I'm just going to go as quickly as
possible through some of the technology
and the technological challenges and how
we're involved with this whole registry
thing so first let me get to the the
model noak is formed to essentially try
to solve the problem of
how creators of media can get paid in a
post piracy era so currently one of the
biggest way that people get content is
through p2p systems of course on
licensed p2p systems everybody knows
this problem but one of the things that
that we recognize and that I want to
point out is that nobody really wins in
the unlicensed p2p world consumers may
get a bunch of free content but they
don't get the quality or the
authenticity of the content they're
looking for content that isn't very
popular is very difficult to find on p2p
networks because there's no incentive
for users to make it or for content
owners to make it available download
performance is poor because ISPs are
restricting bandwidth utilization of p2p
programs because they're not making any
revenue off it there's a lot of stuff on
this slide I don't need to go through
all of them but for the other players in
them in this system here end-users
creators and publishers and Internet
service providers the the status quo
just isn't working for anybody obviously
creators and publishers can't get paid
and ISPs are liable for copyright
liability they've got bandwidth costs
for p2p traffic and we feel like there
is an opportunity here for essentially a
bargain between these three these three
stakeholders that will provide benefits
to all of them and that is essentially
that's the basis of our model it's a
model wherein end users as a group pay a
license to isps or other gatekeepers and
in return they get content creators and
publishers have to give up their drm and
they have to give up the idea of having
pricing control and retail control over
their content but in return they get
money and the ISPs receive the licenses
in technology that are required in order
to enable them to increase the
efficiency of their network with with
caching so that's the basic framework of
the deal and it's called you know this
is not something that's totally new and
something that's been discussed for a
number years now it's got
some people call it the alternative
compensation model some people call it
blanket licensing well we're actually
trying to to build it so this is a sorry
this slide is that it's possible to
actually do smaller scale versions of
this of this kind of a deal you don't
necessarily need an ISP involved ideally
you can have blanket licensing with
other smaller middle men such as device
manufacturers educational institutions
interest groups anyone who who wants to
connect users with content so what we're
doing is we're trying to develop a
blanket licensing engine a technological
platform that will support these sorts
of deals support these sorts of blanket
licensing deals we're in a pile of
content is paid for by one by one or
more intermediary parties on behalf of a
group of consumers and the goals are to
bundle the content with things that
people are used to paying for make the
content feel free to users and and
distribute the proceeds on a pro-rata
basis based on the usage of content so
I'm moving so quickly through this stuff
obviously the implications and the
problems of this sort of a model are
well outside the scope of what we're
talking about today I'm happy to talk to
anybody you know buttonholed in the hall
after after we're done here so joi Ito
is just talking about the continuum of
different sorts of Rights and that's a
really useful concept I think and we see
ourselves as falling on that continuum
so if you can see over on the copyleft
side you've got the open extreme and the
free and is in beer extreme of content
which includes share-alike sorts of
licenses and then as you move you know
further to the copyright side you get
towards the CC plus concept and which
you know requires some sort of separate
negotiation for commercial licenses and
then on the far right you've got the
clothes retail sales model that is
dominant has been dominant until
recently and we see the noank blanket
licensing model as filling that
middle space there between CC plus + and
full on copyright so the vision is to
create a general-purpose engine to
enable this this this these sorts of
deals Nathan how am i doing on time oh
alright well I got a lot of slides to
get through so i'll skip real quick the
technology that we've got consists of a
number of major subsystems the there is
a registry for storing metadata about
content there is a modified p2p network
for distributing content it's
essentially a modification of BitTorrent
which I won't talk about because we want
of time there's a subsystem for
monitoring usage and tracking usage and
being able to distribute royalties but
on proportional usage and then there's
the user interface components so we'll
just focus quickly on the registry
there's the block diagram of the whole
thing the registry being the red stuff
up in the upper right-hand corner so
we'll focus on what we've been building
for the registry essentially it's a
restful api with an XML representation
that allows users to obtain metadata
about content that's registered in the
system to determine what sort of
licenses are available and when I say
what sort of licenses are available
we're talking about we've designed to be
able to handle licenses in any sort of
media in any territory across across the
world and to be able to handle multiple
different sorts of Licensing for the
same piece of content in different
contexts so among the kinds of licenses
we can support in our data model is CC
licenses and public domain licenses but
then also our our licenses which have
additional terms so CC license of course
you know once you grant of CC license is
essentially irrevocable but our our
license terms for this essentially
commercial service have expert eights
and all sorts of other
parameters as well that we keep track of
the data model that we're building or
that we've largely built is really
focused on licensing data we don't see
ourselves as an IMDb or musicbrainz
we're not really trying to you know
collect metadata about the user
experience although we do have to
present some of that sort of thing we
are really focused on being an accurate
and reliable indicator of the licensing
terms for content that has been
registered with us as i said we support
CC noak and public domain and our
licenses are considerably more
complicated than CC licenses ownership
can be split and we do store basic
social networking data to allow users of
our system to be able to communicate
things like favoritism so all that's a
little bit out of scope this is way out
of scope this is our erd for the
database which gives you an idea of
general ideas and this is some notes on
our API so we are trying to be as Webbie
as possible we're presenting entities as
URLs that are essentially permanent we
have four major classes of entities
which correspond to copyrighted works
collections of works agents who are
essentially people or companies and
groups sorry tags and groups and then
those resources which are relevant to
any one of those major categories like
an item which would be a copyrighted
work are subordinate so an item like
stairway to heaven might have any number
of separate recordings in various
formats those formats are instances
which are located in URLs that are
subordinate to the top-level URL for the
work so there's a lot of detail to the
to the rest interface design but we
really tried to stay two essential web
two point of sorts of principles
what we did wind up doing though is
rolling our own xml so this was after a
lot of time evaluating the options that
were available and at that point we we
actually did some prototyping in rdfa
but it was a little bit early for rdfa
and we wound up coming up with it with a
separate human readable representation
and machine readable representation
obviously we see the promise of rdfa as
an ideal to aspire to and we're very
excited to take park in in that process
I think I should probably pretty much
wrap up their here here's an example
this is this is some of our hand rolled
API as you can see we have a unique URL
for this particular audio item which is
a speech from the Berkman Center from
the beyond broadcast 2007 conference and
we have some metadata very sorts tagging
descriptions and it's available in
multiple languages and I don't think
I've time to go in any more detail than
that so I'll leave it there and move on
to the next next verse thanks Devon us
up next we have Rob K okay who is going
slide lists you yes no need to bore you
guys with more slides alright I'm Robert
K from musicbrainz how many of you guys
are familiar with musicbrainz raise your
hand oh wow that's cool thank you so in
that case I'll keep the introduction
relatively short because it seems like
most people know what's going on the
originally started off with me being
pissed off at gracenote gracenote took a
project that I contributed several
hundred CBS 2 I took a private they
started charging people money for it and
started throwing lots of lawyers at it
and got really ugly really quickly I
just like that and I said what's the
open source alternative to this and I
started my own one called the CD index
was very quickly shown that that was a
bit simplistic in the thinking not much
thought about communities went into it
and in two thousand I actually went and
said all right CDs are dead it's all
about actually creating information for
music and about mp3's so let's actually
create this a new project with proper
structure called music frightens the
idea is basically that we have we know
which artists exists what they've
released when they've released it where
they released it we're starting to
gather information about who performed
what of which album which type of vocals
we also have minimal support for
figuring out if there is music that's
released under Creative Commons license
and you can search for that information
and so forth unfortunately on the
creative common stuff we haven't had too
much uptake yet but I think hopefully as
a result of some of the discussions
today we'll see more of that uptake and
more cooperation closer cooperation with
the creative comments the musicbrainz in
Creative Commons have actually shared a
bit of history in the past they pulled
me in the early in the beginning and
said hey we need partners that would
like to use our data or use our licenses
and it was ironic right about the time
that I was starting to get into the
project I realized that Wow some of my
data is not copyrightable in this
country European laws are a little bit
different I don't really know what's
going on it's very complicated I'm not a
lawyer and I need it licensed and I need
it not just one license but multiple
licenses that gave me a lot of
flexibility and then the Creative
Commons came in and gave me literally a
boom here's a set of licenses to work
with and it was literally my salvation
they saved me a lot of trouble a lot of
hassle and inadvertently actually
completely gave rise to my business
model which I'll explain later won't
take time for it right now but I think
it might have inadvertently created the
first one hundred percent profit
nonprofit business model it's a mouthful
it's a little interesting but thank you
creative comments it's really cool I
don't actually do anything to fulfill
the needs for my customers all I need to
do is put the check in the bank it's
really good system i recommended
alright so early in the beginning one of
the things I was really excited about
what the creative comments was a
copyright registry how can you have
these licenses without a copyright
registries what I said and because it's
so important to actually find the
content unfortunately there were no
offense of the creative commons folks
but too many lawyers involved with the
Creative Commons and the issues of
liability were brought up very quickly
and the idea was just killed and that
really kind of bugged me a lot so you
know I went off my corner and I worked
on music rains continued working on that
and not so much you know worried about
working on a copyright registry with the
creative commons now why is musicbrainz
really relevant in this discussion well
I've learned a few things number one
musicbrainz is all about metadata and
metadata is a fine ability if you don't
have good metadata you can find the
content it doesn't exist I think we're
all implicitly know this that you know
look at flickr there's millions and
millions of pictures of flickr they
don't have tags they don't have actual
descriptions you can find them they
don't exist right so if you don't have
good metadata the data doesn't exist so
how do you come up with good metadata
and that's actually surprisingly hard to
do and as Mike pointed out in his slide
you don't do it right you end up with
meta crap which is almost worse than no
metadata and I can get you in liability
issues in lots of hot water really
quickly so what do we do that actually
works best with musicbrainz well
musicbrainz is not about software it's
not about hardware it's not about me
it's about the community it's a whole
bunch of people that are working on the
data that manicuring data so why are
people interested in manicuring this
this metadata base that we that were
working on well the key and I think this
is this is an important lesson that
everybody should walk away with today is
that we provide a value proposition that
makes sense people come in and using our
taggers or using third-party taggers
that are musicbrainz enabled they can
run through their music collection and
their music collection as a part of it
well then get cleaned up has clean
metadata tags it's organized properly on
the directory and the directory
structure on your machine you can
actually find this so we have a lot of
people that come to us and said hey I
hi pot it's supposed to be the greatest
thing since sliced bread and well I
can't find my music this is crap I can't
find us on well what's going on well you
have a metadata problem so once they
actually run their collection through
the musicbrainz taggers and whatnot they
can find their music metadata and
they're really happy well part of that
value proposition of them getting their
music metadata cleaned up is that we
don't allow them to actually clean up
their metadata without making fixes to
the database so if you find something
that's missing if you find something
that that needs adding or something
that's wrong we give the power to the
people to actually go clean that up
couple that with a peer review system
and this value proposition gives people
a lot of value back for doing a little
bit of work it's like Wikipedia but it
actually has much more tangible benefits
to the user in the form of your music
collection your music enjoyment will
actually go up when you have clean or
metadata there's lots of people that
recognize the value proposition and
start participating in it and as an end
result we see musicbrainz there are
music metadata is actually getting
better every day and keeps getting
better and better in the beginning we
had a lot of people settings i l
musicbrainz is a bunch of crap that was
about four or five years ago and now if
you actually start looking for searches
on musicbrainz data quality the pendulum
is swinging to the opposite side there
were some people now claiming that
musicbrainz has the best music metadata
out there i'm not sure if we arrived
there yet but hopefully at some point we
can it's all it's certainly a indicator
that we're doing something right and
we're moving in the right direction so
ultimately this is like we figured out
how to do metadata and any kind of
copyright registry the key is to get the
metadata right because if you don't have
the metadata right you can't find the
content so I've got lots more thoughts
on how we can actually take a take some
of these concepts that musicbrainz
developed and take some of these
concepts and some of the existing
registries and existing projects that we
can hear about in a minute and hopefully
tie these together to actually become
part of the web of data rather than the
creative comments are operating one
copyright registry so hope we'll get
into some of those discussions as part
of this panel thank you
thank you thanks so up next is a job
info from registered Commons and I don't
know Joe may actually be buying for the
award for like furthest traveled for the
tech summit so invested I'm back for
this okay so Joe bento thank you yeah so
I have traveled a long way my name is
Joe been so from registered Commons it's
good to be back in the US registered
Commons is actually based in Austria
pretty nice location near the Swiss and
Austrian Alps actually close to the
Google Zurich headquarters so it's a
nice place to work and I've been
spending the last year working with
registered Commons and an organization
organization called OS alliance that
operates registered Commons out of
Austria and I lived a little bit in
California so it's nice to be back down
in a sunny state my focus mainly with
register Commons is more on the business
development side of things and not
necessarily the technical development
side of things so I'll try to address
any techno technical issues as much as
as much as I can but to give you a
little bit of a quick background and a
brief overview of what registered
Commons does we are registry system we
launched as an early adopter I guess
you'd say in there in the registry field
space in 2006 at the Wizards of open
source conference in Berlin with the
support of I Commons and Heather Ford
for my Cummins had some good support it
was successful launch there and we saw a
need for a need for verification treta
stration especially for users who need
an assurance of trust from content that
they use content that they need to
license for example companies that need
to license works for commercial
use and I'll get in a little bit later
detail about where we're headed in that
field so we feel that the the actual
commercial use of content let's just use
the example of music as a as a model
that work we hope to work with for
future development so our organizational
structure is is unique and I think
ideally suited for registry and that we
have a transparent governance structure
were operated by a public-private
partnership through universities in
Austria as well as an alliance of IT
organizations and media companies mostly
European based companies that operated
as a co-op and anybody can become a
cooperative member to the organization
and have a voter's share so we operate
with transparency and we feel that this
is important for content registries like
ours to be able to earn the trust of
users and to succeed in this field so
what we provide currently then the
features anybody can register for free
by the way it's a free service to
register works of any type and as users
upload their work what we automatically
do as a result of their upload is we
keep a backup of that content on our
servers okay and so we provide also a
timestamp service that is provided by a
company called a cert so there is should
buy a legally the issue certificates and
eyes certificate provider so a cert was
chosen
for us to use so we you can obtain the
timestamp online and in real time and
it's offered for download and can be
validated by a corresponding client it's
used in in governments and in large
organizations across Europe and so we
decided to go with a cert as the secured
time stamping Authority see cert is
another verification process that we
verify users identities through to gain
trust levels of who is actually
uploading the work who owns this work
are they who they who they say they are
so we have different levels of trust
verification the first and least I guess
least strong level of verification is
through email we verify the users email
address and users can then go on to
verify their identity through a stronger
verification process see a cert is an
Australian based organization
community-based organization that
essentially has users obtain a
certificate to by presenting documents
that are corroborated by at least two
other see a cert members so actual proof
physical identity is essential for
verifying this person and so that that
would be the highest level of trust
involved and so once the levels of trust
increase for a user we feel that users
are then able to use their works in
different in different ways especially
for commercial purposes when companies
need to make sure they are licensing the
work from the from the person they say
their licensing it from so we're already
compatible with CC licensing scheme
we promote CC licenses actively and we
are using the metadata RDF scheme and
you're just a quick couple snapshots
we're using the Creative Commons API for
users to choose their licenses and they
can put in the their information about
their work and we issue them or
certificate which they can then link to
on on their page link back to their work
users can also determine beforehand if
they want the work to be visible or
invisible so if you upload an mp3 but
you don't want that work to be streamed
or downloaded you can just link back to
the meted metadata of the work and the
information of the license another thing
that the licenses we provide a field
where the users can include moral rights
so for example if if somebody license is
their work under Creative Commons they
can attribute another factor into that
by saying well you can use it but we
don't want you to use it in a fascist
book or something even though that might
fall within the realm of what the
license provides so the moral rights is
something that we thought was important
for us to offer to the to the users as
well some of the challenges that we see
going ahead in this in this space
especially as more registries emerge in
the field and and the fact that it
there's there's not any standards set
forth yet right now in terms of policies
or best practices in this field so to
determine what those best use practices
are establishing policies for registries
and possibly if the approach is to go
towards a registration authority of some
sort what would that look like and how
would that incorporate new and emerging
registry
is and and others and would with these
registries necessarily have to promote
Creative Commons licenses and also new
business models around a registration
system so register Commons is still a
small organization with the intention of
growing so provides services for new
business models and so one of the one of
the models that we found some interest
for comes by way of the Austrian Chamber
of Commerce that we we hope could
provide a model for other City Chambers
of Commerce either in Europe are also in
the States and so what they're doing is
the creative this creative sector
promotes or promotes their creative
sector the Austrian Chamber of Commerce
by purchasing registrations vouchers
from registered comments so we're going
to be moving into a limited paid
registration service as well and our
focus is primarily right now for
universities and against cities chambers
of commerce to to purchase the
registrations for their users beforehand
and then offer these offer their users
or the creative community vouchers to go
ahead and register register their works
through registered Commons so we're also
going to be incorporating CC plus soon
by the way the this branded version of
RC is called creative Depot that's the
the Austrian Chamber of Commerce
creative service that I just mentioned
CC plus is is also on the horizon where
we we believe that by using this and
also allowing third-party businesses
content clearing services to use the
services of red
your comments to register their work and
then offering commercial commercial use
on top of a trusted registration so one
one example that we're moving forward on
right now within this organization that
operates registered Commons as a project
called pod perfect where what we're
doing is is it is based on a user
collaboration community similar to
probably ccmixter where we register the
works from the users and give the the
artists and the users the the option to
form agreements between each other and
license their work for commercial use
and allow commercial entities to come in
and and efficiently in and streamlined
process license this worked from from
the artists in the community and
register commons would be the basis for
the trusted registration providing a
secure way for these commercial
companies to know that the content that
they're getting the count they're going
to pay for is content that comes from
the original author the original source
and so that's where we're going so thank
you thanks Joe so up next we have a
Javier show me your last name raw is it
profeta I'm terrible with American names
so um from safe creative who's they are
also doing it running a registry service
at this time they got talked a little
about what they're doing well thanks for
inviting us such pleasure to hear i'm
going to talk about a great leighs
registry of copyrighted works similar
for resisted comments well why safe
creative lawyers are living happy days
because integral properties may maybe
one of the most important now issues now
an Internet so as a space where users
like to create and share the works
worldwide the first legal steps are may
be done as we have many license systems
and platforms to allow the exploitation
of copyrighted works for advanced so but
with your firm problems as this
encircled to establish the rice did
other shows many other programs and so
that's why we think a register could be
a solution for example Joseph II points
how can I use her demonstrate licking me
yeah okay how can a user demonstrate
that he used one work according to
license so when in a context that the
Creator can change this license easily
or change the content of the work so you
need some kind of pool and one thing
that someone in Benavidez talk has
pointed out is how can I created they
must say that he is the author of a work
or the copyright holder in a context
that where a work has shared freely and
anyone could claim an authorship of a
comparative work so within the register
has two functions maybe both proof of
how to ship and a proof of the light
them copyright rights copyright licenses
well link it to the to the content so
how it works safe katie provides a
worldwide online easy neutral and
fiercest with cysts in the in the Specht
of neutrality because once you upload or
save
the work on our servers you can choose
between many well we can define your
copyright policy choosing between
copyright or secretly Commons licenses
or GNU licenses so I GPL lgpl sdl for
example and so it is no time this ends
free because it's have no cost everyone
asked why is our business model but i
don't think i'm going to talk about it
so it's a platform of cell management of
exploitation rights in the sense so
technology i think i'm going to be a big
quickly but our platform is developing
developing a advantage the
identification system from a simple
email to digital certificates we
identify creators as they log in our
system so certificates also if are more
accurate the more tip the more
confidence of the identification process
so the quality of the certificates are
related to an author's attitude Oh
communications between loading process
in sign up or in the platform actions
our profile are encrypted so verisign so
it's a warranty of quality also our
databases are storage complies with i
saw i think it's 27001 I'll are audited
every six months that's the maybe the
more important question once the work is
uploaded and say with all the servers
the system obtains to hash functions two
different have
forum every single work that we link to
document metadata our authors
identification a type of work title of
world dispersion of work type of license
and we are playing time stamping of all
the hash functions on metadata and after
that a certification of the contest will
be provided digitally signed advice safe
creative so you see the process well
resisted tools we are continuing
development these these facilities one
of most use its bull market well I think
you could see we have divided to ball
markers for internet explorer from
firefox so you can upload content easily
on blogger or wordpress so you are you
have your day that will mark later on on
the on the navigator toolbar and so an
indian a station site of wordpress you
can click the button and the content is
uploaded to the server so you can see
continued saw on the right side to cut
choose between the license but I the
title description etc and after that in
the right side you can see our register
labels very simple from desktop you also
put upload works like drag and drop
systems so you can you have to sign in
so creative enable our futures because
maybe is now where we are developing on
testing now to works but we have to
check people
you have to choose bulk resisting and
you have to accept an applet and you can
upload context more more quickly and all
time well more than one work in a big
chance ctrl we now include ctrl in our
web pages this web page soft of reach
the reward you see the number the code
name is an example but this now complies
Israel as you can see and register
levels also comply with ctrl C the code
in in this sense we'd like to we think
this could be a good opportunity to add
attributes of registers on ctrl anything
would be a good opportunity to find out
us set my well registered comments to
find our standards out policies for
registry so I think it could be very
useful share content and to provide more
facilities to find out where one work is
the resisted and which are the license
selected so that's all thank you very
much if you have any questions
thanks Javier thanks so we have a couple
more presenters are going to do quick
presentations and then we will have time
for questions for everybody as a group
so up next is rich pearson from a
tribute calm and in contrast to last
couple presenters attribute is building
a registry at my perception elisas thats
building a registry as a side effect of
the other work they're doing so I'm
interested in hearing what rich has to
say so Nathan's right in that what a
tribute er really is is we're at GPS for
your content and we've started with
let's say that the higher-end publishers
where large companies who are publishing
a lot of data we are rapidly moving to
where anyone who publishes data from
your blogger to your individual
photographer can register their content
with us and to speak to nathan specific
point we have a few structure that's
based on monitoring the content so
essentially based on the amount of
content that you want to perform and if
you want to take an action ever on this
content then then there's a monthly
subscription fee so that's kind of the
pitch I've got a couple slides on how we
do that and then we can get two
questions because I think that's the
most interesting part so this is a
charter on how we identify content as
you look up we have a lot of iron that's
doing the crawling and specifically
we've got very dedicated crawls we're
going against blogs or going against the
new site if we have a customer vertical
that we need to do very well at will
we'll use that and then also just the
general web and then our customers
typically provide us some type of RSS
feed but we can also crawl sites as well
and we have a number of small publisher
sites that were in beta right now where
we're just crawling their site there's a
lot of challenges in that in terms of
making sure that we extract the
important bits not the footer text so
we've got a lot of template cleaner
issues but
that's a that's an ongoing process and
then we're essentially a giant database
matching service so we find matches and
we provide the cod the context of
matches and that's what's interesting
from the Creative Commons perspective
will detect attribution will detect if
there's ads on the page will also detect
what percentage was copied so you can
make your decisions if they're following
your licenses this is definitely not to
scale but just just just a point a and
on how we how we have frequently recrawl
and you can look at you know from the
general web to a topic specific we're
getting a pretty good feel for building
heuristic kind of you know site
reputation type crawling behavior where
if a certain site has done something in
the past whether to licensee or
unlicensed site what we may we may go
back there more frequently and obviously
customers and users drive drive what
we're doing from a user perspective this
this is another way of looking at it so
you plug in your content we match it and
then you decide what you want to do with
it and there's four actions identified
right there that we can enable directly
from our client from our service we're
increasingly trying to get publishers to
treat this as an absolute last resort
option there was news this week with the
AP where that wasn't a last resort
option for them so we're in a gnostic
platform and it's going to surface a lot
of issues and we think that by
supporting the transparency that the
Commons is about we can hopefully help
solve some of them and educate the
publishers at the same time clearly an
opinion based slide here but we believe
that the registry has to be an
interoperable I think Mike send that
earlier and a disjointed collection of
micro registries won't work it's got to
be open to all registered rights holders
of all sizes and and we believe it
should be free and we will support a
free
registry service the monitoring up to a
certain level arts also be free once you
go beyond that and if you want to take
actions that's that's how we make money
so that's clearly our focus we support
multiple multiple licensing standards we
will support the commons and normalize
against their rules so a customer who
has their content in or a user can see
if their content licenses and their
commons licenses are being followed and
then particularly on that photo side
there's a lot of agencies involved we
believe to make these registries
queryable and using a combination of
metadata as it's been discussed is
probably the best approach that's it for
me thank you uh so up next we have Aaron
Swartz from open library and this is
aaron TF slides or anything you need to
do ok so I'll turn it over to air and
then thanks so yeah we're getting late
in the panel so I'll just skip slides
and try and be somewhat interesting open
library was a project created and funded
by the internet archive to try and build
a website that had a page for every book
ever published and so if you think about
what it takes to build a website with a
page for every book ever published you
really need a lot of help from other
partners so we've partnered with people
like the wikimedia foundation and
creative commons we've partnered with
publishers and libraries we've tried to
get as much data as possible from as
many different sources import it all
into one big website and then we made it
into a wiki so that anyone in the public
can go and edit it you can go see it now
it's at openlibrary org there are 20
million books in it each one has a full
web page with all the data we've been
able to collect from all these various
sources mostly from people like the
Library of Congress and the various
publishing companies and there's an edit
link on every page that you can go and
add more details at table of contents or
descriptions or images whatever you want
it's all available through an API so
partners who want book data can query it
libraries you want to put cover images
on their websites can reuse those and we
in partnership with Ben Creative Commons
have been trying to add copyright data
so that we can calculate based on the
date
the book was published or whether you
say it has a copyright notice or not or
whether it was renewed try and calculate
the current copyright status of a book
so you can see if it's in the public
domain or if it's still in copyright or
if it's under a Creative Commons license
or anything like that for many of the
books in the public domain about half a
million of them we've scanned them and
digitize them the full text is online
their pictures you can flip through the
books and we're encouraging people to
kind of upload new books upload anything
that they've got right now we're working
in partnership with the wikimedia
foundation to integrate support with
wikipedia so that when you see the
citations at a bottom of a page we can
replace those with links to open library
and use that as kind of the back end
storage for all the citation data and
all the discussion that goes around
citations on wikipedia so we're really
trying to create this big open community
platform for metadata you know and want
it to be available through API is
through data dumbs through web pages
through whatever formats we can so that
everybody who wants information about
you know published works whether it's
copyright information or simply
bibliographical information or even the
full-text can get it easily and through
one simple place thanks and finally we
have a peer Gerard from jamendo okay i'm
from jamendo mpa one of the three
founders of jamendo jamendo is a one of
the biggest online free music community
we are surely the first one in Europe
today jamendo and these brand news
because we are reaching today ten
thousand albums available online for
free on the recipie license you are
growing up of from about 300 new albums
per week and we have we are offering
more than 150,000 tracks music is coming
from 60 countries so you coming from
around the world we are located in
Luxembourg and part of the team is in
Paris we are 25 and you have been funded
by mon grove who was the only baker of
skype
quickly jamendo for user is you can
discover music for free you can download
it you can share it you can invite your
friends can you of course with you and
integrate in your blog is a brand new
widget if you are happy with the music
you can also make a donation and you say
pay if you if your you wish the nation
it is at least 5 euro or five dollars so
it's cheaper in the law and we are only
keeping 50 cent deal for artists is to
can it's free we're lost in the music
for free they just have to choose a
Creative Commons license and to accept
our terms of usage for them the deal is
a quite cool because you are sharing
fifty percent of our advertising revenue
with them it's not a lot today but it's
always growing up we have it's also a
way to get coverage because visit for
jamendo is for example the labor via mp3
devices like Oscars and we are really
working on the partnership to to try to
build an individual right management on
jamendo so if we are able to let say
sell music from an artisan jamendo we
want really to pay him and to share more
than 50 persons with the review they say
like direct license for him current
project is music recommendation because
ten ten thousand albums are very very
long process to browse and two recent to
all of them so musical commendation
means that you just type bands that you
like for example right where you had and
we will lead you to samsara this stuff
is working today and then from this band
to find all those band on jamendo we
also working on official playlist and a
new feature for artists to build like a
parnassus birds of Center and to get
more interaction between them and the
fund of course we
working and trying to integrate if you
place in the coming month so
certification is a problem as many said
before we need to know with the right
right order of the music that is online
on jamendo sometimes they don't really
understand what is a Creative Commons
license they don't know is impossible
for them to choose a Creative Commons
license because they are already member
of a collecting society in Europe for
example so we need to rock on so the new
project from next week's and next month
to know more to get more information for
them if you want to share money with
them of course we really need to know
that the right guy so we are thinking
about the level of confidence of the
certification the music is available via
BitTorrent and via HTTP download for
full album so now also available via
straight HTTP download you can stream
music it's very very easy with our
object player for example and you can
also integrate our widget and the widget
is a showing the license of any a
playlist of intro of the song that these
are played of course with the link to
description on the CC website we are
opening our data with the API is that a
developer the German would come is very
easy to access to our catalog and you
can get a lot of information about
artists name cover art type of license
and it returns a lot of different
formats but people like for example to
get all the specific license for Germany
in UK or the album's we can very easy to
just send viewer URL and you get
information with the right format also
get the license for a specific album
just extend the album ID
and you get also the links in the
description or firm of the lessons so
the freshest ever listen to jamendo is
it's my last slide
Thanks so we also obvious have a lot of
different approaches to the registry
question at this time we'd like to open
up for questions and discussion with
their panel and we have about 25 minutes
so plenty of time for that if you have a
question please come to the mic so we
sobre can hear what they are and so we
can get these on on the record or
whatever so I was curious actually for
Rob and Aaron both since you're running
sort of media specific registries or
metadata repositories have you had any
interest from like mainstream publishers
or creators like giving you data up
front like with musicbrainz for example
giving you yeah sort of feeding into as
part of a production process there's a
little bit of delay when they come on
musicbrainz specifically hasn't we've
had actually sort of the reverse
happened we've had a lot of people come
to us and say hey why don't you guys go
talk to the labels and get data from the
labels and with the exception of jamendo
and and magnitude that's essentially a
pointless exercise because a lot of the
labels have absolutely crappy data case
in point back in the Napster case the
judge basically said provide us with
lists of information a list of content
that we should block and they provided
the judge lists of content that
contained stuff from other people stuff
that they didn't have copyright for and
they emitted large chunks of their own
content ergo they don't really know what
they have in their own repositories and
they don't really have the computer
scientists and the geeks working on this
type of stuff they're musicians and
businesspeople and so forth so their
data keeping practices are pretty poor
so my community wouldn't want that data
the world in the in the book industry
there's actually a lot better that
publishers seem to have real data
because they supply it to places like
Amazon and Barnes and Noble and Powell's
so there is an incentive to actually get
it right and in fact we've been working
with them and so they have this XML
format called onyx and every week they
send us a new XML file with all the new
books that have come out full covers and
blurbs and about the author and all of
that so we've been importing that as it
comes in and that's been very useful
we're hoping at some point to branch out
beyond books and kind of cover other
kinds of things in libraries but it's
been much easier in the book world you
know for a lot of the reasons Robert
talks about where there's you know a
long history of librarians going and
cataloging things in particular ways and
coming up with standards and formats
that makes everything a whole lot easier
solve them coming through the back
channel IRC room so I got a question
okay while we're waiting I actually the
question for rich I think in your
application one of the things that seems
like it maybe isn't happening now but
it's something that would be ideal is to
have the content creators be able to
specify commercial license terms and I'm
wondering if there's standards or
dictionaries or things that you're
looking at is being a viable means of
expressing that kind of information so
absolutely in addition to the commons
license we will be supporting several
we're not going to come up with our own
our job is not to come up with our own
our job is to build the back end so we
can show you where it is so we are
opened and actually actively courting
license standards that we can that we
can use yeah I'm really curious too I
mean I really believe in that sort of
continuum and then try to establish that
continuum so I kind of I'm trying to
find out what what happens with with CC
CC rel you know if that sort of general
framework can be extended to commercial
licenses I don't know Nathan if you want
to Oh Sue Ellen commercial licenses yeah
yes so there's not
well I museum thing about in two
different two different approaches with
it one of them is just describing it
license using ctrl using some bud
vocabulary just talking right so I mean
so obvious anybody can describe a lot
any license using the vocabulary we put
together and can extend it with their
own you know like Ben was talking about
with their own scheme and that kind of
thing and the other actual you know sort
of hook that's in there is this more
permissions attribute which lets you
just say here's a URL you can go to
there's what we've been caught we kind
of calling CC plus and which is if you
you're making it available under CC
license and there's some other licensed
that you can either place you can go to
purchase different a myriad of rights or
some particular license available right
but right now it's like here's the URL
for commercial rights and there be
dragons we don't we don't have any way
well sure so that's so you what you
could do is you could that could
actually point to a web page where they
had embedded metadata describing what it
was and so then you could use a machine
readable software agent to to kind of
traverse that URL and look for the look
for the CC rel described license and you
know provide that to the information to
the user so that would be that way to do
it but the CCL vocabulary right now
isn't capable of describing those kinds
of licenses uh well I'm not sure it's um
it's not targeted at it and so you could
use the parts of it and you pregnant in
otherwise yeah right so we have
questions from the audience my question
is for a tribute or in the area of
academics there's a big problem of
trying to find out who's downloading and
who's using certain articles so that you
can report back to attend your committee
or something like that there's a lot of
resistance to post anywhere but ssrn
which tracks downloads have you worked
with the academic community at all to
try to find identify that information
and report back useful statistics on
those things the short answer is no not
yet we we crawl the public web very well
as you know within the academic
communities we need permission
and there's little incentive for one
University to say crawl us without
everyone banding together so we're
hoping that a community and a standard
emerges and we can take advantage of
that but very open to it if anyone has
contacts or knows those folks who are
trying to do that we'd be very open to
work with them thank you hey Wendy
Seltzer from Berkman Center and saw the
level of confidence come up in a few of
the presentations and I was wondering
whether any of you are offering
insurance or bonding type functions to
assure people of the level of confidence
that you assert about a the works posted
there or the copyright status doing a
clearance function the same for
everybody do wait what is your regular
confidence you can give to wound I can
give to Madonna for example because
she's downloaded every day with you
bittorrent so we have the same we can
offer only what the other kind of
first-degree are now to manage well the
music is played for example it can be
online can be offline these are the
question I am also a the word mission I
was started thinking about for people
who want to reuse works we hear
sometimes particularly from commercial
reuse errs or those who have to go
through intermediaries like broadcasters
we want to know where this comes from
and we want you to indemnify us against
the damages if somebody Sue's us for
using it does any of you have take on
that liability usually for a fee of we
will do the investigation and assure you
that if you're sued for using this
content we will pick that up we pass on
that liability to the people who
with us I can take a stab at registered
Commons are you asking a bit about the
authenticity of the the author and the
ownership of their work whether or not
we can provide full trust as to whether
that the authors are who they are they
and they own the work that they do or
rather that we if there's fraudulent
claims of ownership that we go ahead and
step in and offer some sort of legal
service or be an intermediary between
the court system and and the law they're
more the first question and it might be
a service that you choose not to offer
which would be fine to know I was just
curious whether it was a service that
any of you had heard demand for I think
from our standpoint we just allow the
the copyright laws to speak for
themselves if somebody wants to make a
fraudulent claim that's that's you know
their business for committing that crime
mmm we can offer just trust it trusted
levels up to a certain point as the
author is who they say they are and we
have physically been able to verify
their identity and that they they
actually own that content so we haven't
found that there's there's really too
many problems with questions of user
identity especially when we get into the
higher levels of trust verification but
yeah so you don't validate the claim
itself you validate the fact that this
identified person is making this claim
yeah and it's up to them if well we do
we do actually have a system in place
where that the CA sert verifies you know
this person is the physical person who
they say they are and we actually make a
physical connection between that and
you'd have to be so dash of the file and
the hash of the file as well yeah we
have heard this from ad agencies
particularly
our image business ad agencies look for
this type of liability or protection we
do not offer it I don't think we will we
would prefer not to offer that if it
becomes a must-have perhaps but right
now according to legal capacity or
personality of the user we did there are
different state levels of karma accuracy
according to our email or digital
certificates vindication but if I don't
think if you're you're talking about
users attitude of he or well if he's
really after the author or the copyright
holder or not I think any riches he can
control these things well in signing
safe creative you accept the terms of
you where you declare that you are the
earther all you have the copyrights but
don't think
I think is a really important question
because I think without a sufficient
answer the question we're going to have
ad agencies and what not look at this
and go oh we can't use it you can't use
it you can't identify it so therefore
we're not going to use and especially
with the light of the fiasco with virgin
australia I mean that's that's a sticky
situation and it's not about to get any
better unless somebody can offer
something like that but I'm looking and
down the table and I don't think anybody
wants to offer that because I wouldn't
want to offer that so it's uh doesn't
smell good things for commercial use of
Creative Commons content hi I'm emriana
pfefferkorn from wilson sonsini goodrich
&amp;amp; Rosati and i wanted to ask you about
death what happens or what contingency
plan do you have if heaven forfend one
of the registry companies should fold it
seems like at best we're talking about
situation where all of the registry data
would be lost in that sorry at worst
that would happen at best you're talking
about having to sell off your registry
information as an asset during
liquidation along with the tables and
chairs and computers and this brings up
issues of whether you know transferring
these registries would exceed the scope
of consent that you made in your user
agreements when people signed up with
you finding your clients to let them
know that the other information is
switching hands whether you can get
other other registries users to trust
the new the new registry in their
authentication especially what happens
if a free registry moves to a paid
registry whether people would have to
re-register but they would have to pay
and so I was just wondering what your
contingency plans are I can first week
on that and as far as registered Commons
is concerned for example the new project
that we have with the City Chamber of
Commerce in Austria there is a
contingency plan in case our servers
fail or anything goes down that we at
least keep a record of the certificate
on file a paper record so we are also
operated by
a public-private partnership so we don't
foresee any you know selling of the
companies right now university of
applied science and doorman austria is
make is running the the IT
infrastructure at this moment so i think
that our transparency on that level i
think is is kind of the first defense
against that now musicbrainz isn't
obviously a registry but our answer for
longevity or what should happen if I get
hit by a bus and the servers go down and
whatnot our data is replicated literally
all over the globe and so you'll be able
to download the core data pretty much
from OSU OSL for instance and other
people's machines so our data is fairly
well replicated but it doesn't quite
have this sticky situation that the
copyright registries do jamendo viana to
victory but of course we can now dump
dump out the Tibet is very easy via the
API for example to get a lot of
information coming from a database and
it's only your 20 gigs them so um yeah
of course if we are going further in the
registration for e3 process we will
increase its level of confidence and
level of security but now we are open up
Lautenberg open door so hopeless
hopeless today so such like a
proprietary system where everything is
closed our solution is kind of similar
we provide dumps of the entire database
and since we're part of the internet
archive you know we put them on the
archive servers they get automatically
backed up they make a copy at Amsterdam
they make a copy in the library of
alexandria and hopefully you know
there's enough data in the internet
archive that someone is going to keep it
running even if you know the current
organization fails or the people running
it go away so that we don't lose the
entire archive of the web and television
and it's six hundred thousand books that
were scanned and all of that I think
there's probably a pretty strong
incentive to keep that data going
hi I'm brand vapor from the week media
foundation and one things that we'd love
to be able to do with copyright
registries is to be able to take persons
uploaded files that are being put on say
we community of commons and be able to
verify them against existing registries
of files that are either known for
certain to be under a Creative Commons
or other kind of license or perhaps are
known for certain not to be but then you
run into the basic problem that files
may change dramatically everything's
using lossy formats if it's been resized
recompressed you can't necessarily just
use a sha-1 file content hash so just
kind of curious about what the
feasibility is on some kind of standard
method of doing these content-based
lookups for photographs music video etc
kind of files sure all oh let's take
that because some you know content-based
fingerprinting of content is something
that we've you know done it's part of
our system and I think just as a fact of
the state of the art of the technology
right now the best algorithms for that
sort of stuff are all proprietary and
they're backed by proprietary databases
of you know the hashes that are
generated by those those fingerprint
algorithms I don't know you know maybe
if others know about really I know
there's been a couple of attempts at
open sourced particularly for audio
fingerprinting but they just don't
compete with the proprietary ones as far
as I know so there's not being widely
used but I think over time we're going
to see you know open-source
fingerprinting algorithms being the
solution of that problem to follow up
with that that's pretty much a spot on
there been a lot of public
implementations opens our
implementations of at least in my space
the acoustic fingerprint analysis type
of algorithms the problem is in order to
actually make an algorithm robust like
that you actually
have to have a large database of music
and then there's a few people that
obviously have a large database of music
but every time you come around to them
so hey can I use your music you get a
very much' cold shoulder so as this
unfortunately is not very suited of a
area of expertise for open source
development because the resources are
simply lacking and or some of the rights
for accessing those resources are
lacking so unfortunately a lot of
information a lot of tools like that are
locked up in proprietary systems and
unfortunately that's even the case for
musicbrainz cool next that's sort of a
 I mean I've had that question was
listening to both Joe and Javier about
whether I if I had a piece of content i
got from somebody is there a facility i
can give you guys the fingerprint I mean
just a sha-1 even and ask if you have it
in your database with your API or is
that a service you get I mean I is that
a service that's offered by either of
you or any of ya will allow that yeah
but you're it's not much use well right
yeah me it's obviously the very limited
I but it wasn't clear to me what like
how the how the data could come out of
the system so that's why i was asking
other questions for amongst each other
or from the from the audience one of the
registry folks i'm now sort of blanking
on which one joe i think it was you was
talking about a moral rights field in
your database well could you elaborate
on that a couple of us were having
problems figuring out how that would
work both with Creative Commons licenses
in general and in terms of
interoperability license proliferation
that kind of thing I think essentially
what this could be thought of as kind of
similar to what the CC plus is doing and
no probably not no no no okay well the
idea is to allow the author or the
owners of the work to just attribute
another set of rules for how the work
could be used and when we we say say
this is as moral rights so if somebody
in Austria licenses their work under
Creative Commons
and there's some fascist magazine that
wants to open source web log that needs
that wants to use it that we we provide
the artists to say well it's not this
work is not used cannot be used for any
any government ideologies or anything to
that matter that doesn't fit within what
they you know their moral rights I guess
for what they want to be used for i
think if i understand correctly because
when i was talking to Roland about this
a little bit they're a bunch of related
rights for instance with photography you
have liked to you put it in a more
American context you have model rights
and privacy rights and things like that
and I think what you're providing is a
field where you can say I have the model
release form here and I've got the
privacy rights there and here's the part
of so because when you have a Creative
Commons license you really don't have
the right to use the photograph without
all the other rights and when you go to
Europe you have all kinds of weird
writes that the Creative Commons license
really doesn't address at all week we
say explicitly we have nothing we say
nothing about those things and so where
you can actually get so if you think
about it rather than thinking about it
as a restriction but to think about it
more as a permission right because
without anything what you're saying is
that the author can come back and say I
have moral rights I will exert it now
but if you have the author although it's
actually it's hard to waive these rights
so it's a little bit more complicated
and I'm not a lawyer but you can you
could have the authors say at least
normatively that that this is kind of
what I'm sensitive about and this is
what I'm not sensitive about you you've
given them extra information and so it's
easier to use for instance i'm doing a
portrait book right now but I'm getting
model release forms from everybody in
the book and attaching it to the
Creative Commons license so it would be
kind of interesting to have a field in
the registry where I have the model
release form attached along with the
crate of Commons license I think that
would be in that application right now
thank you I I don't think that in the
license should be moral rights because
they are not
transferable according to european law
well they're not know sir no so I don't
think if or stop what you if you're
saying this yeah so it's not it's not a
legal thing it's kind of like the the
museum public domain assertions that
we're making where you're saying you
don't have to by law give me any credit
for having scan this public domain thing
it would it would be nice so similarly
you can say i do not have the right to
waive my mole right but by the way this
is the thing that i would sue you for so
you you clearly would not use this if
you're a fascist magazine but but it's
so again it's just because a lot of what
Creative Commons is not about the law by
the way it's about conveying the intent
of the Creator to the intent of the user
or the intent of the Creator to the user
and so insofar as you're expressing more
information about how you would like or
not like your work to be used that's
additional information that could be
useful and and it wouldn't fit inside
the contract but we would fit inside of
a field somewhere else alongside is I
think what when it would be useful but
and with respect to the CC plus thing
you mentioned you know the cz Plus I
think it can be kind of confusing
because it's not intended to be any kind
of restriction upon the CC license it's
a completely separate offer that may or
may not be you know that we're not at
all so yeah so we're like mad at our
time which is good for being on schedule
if there are no more questions we're go
ahead and take a short 15-minute break
and then would come back here for sort
of a wrap-up plenary thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
