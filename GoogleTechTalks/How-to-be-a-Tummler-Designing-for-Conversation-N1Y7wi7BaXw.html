marks what an introduction I've never
been introduced like that before okay um
if anyone's not familiar with me or my
work of a comedian and it's so and I'm
gonna breaking right now one of the
first things I want to teach you all
which is never use a lectern I'm serious
they didn't have a laugh but it's I
maybe if you the sound will still pick
me up mark you're recording well it
still record me if I talk over you okay
okay so step um hi how's your lunch fine
is anyone's not gotten food are you
hungry and you're here anyway okay I
know here's the thing I thought you'd
all be eating generally I like to bring
baked goods give them to other people
i've a show or baked 24,000 chocolate
chip cookies with people and i'm a big
believer in baked goods between that and
the word tumble you might have guessed
that i'm a jew anybody else here one one
person two three that's it Google man's
manages to run itself without news there
when they're all working i was gonna say
what happened to the media conspiracy i
thought we we were supposed to be in
charge of everything it's it's a relief
to know because we think we have to take
care of everything so to know that you
guys have it covered without us is
actually a great relief tamil is a
Yiddish word that I heard Kevin use and
I think it's a great word to describe
some of what I do which I've had a hard
time describing I do interactive comedy
I do a lot of shows where I perform with
audiences and run conversations and try
to make them really authentic and
energized and involve everybody so the
first thing I'd like to ask everyone to
do if you can handle it is to unplug the
crack from your arm and see if you can
close the laptop and see if I can earn
it for the hour not if you open it up
all know what's going on that's fun
but to see if you try and see if your
maybe even want to come closer to me
because one of the things that I want to
encourage you to do is to never make fun
of anyone it's one of the little
inversions of comedy I've been
practicing for 10 years so I don't mock
anybody you're heckle you know cut
anyone down if you like because I like
you and if I had a lab I'd be probably
you're lucky cuz i'd be like running up
talking to you right now on the couch
what's your name Simon how's it feel
over there yeah it's is it like a touch
decision to be over there okay these
chairs do he should be fine okay so
comfort also very important when you
want to design for conversation which is
the language i usually use when i'm
explaining this because business people
sometimes need business language to
understand what you're talking about as
much comfort as possible and not
physically if you're having a meeting or
if you're performing you're having a
party or if you guys are interested in
running any kind of community or website
or anything virtual you want as much
comfort as possible that's because what
we're gonna get into today is mostly
emotional ah I'm sure you spend a lot of
time at Google worrying about emotions
you want to give people a sense that
they're you want to do everything you
can to help people feel like they can be
themselves because the best way to tamil
is to be yourself to be a very big
version of yourself as big as yourself
as you can as you can comfortably do
tunnel means to make noise to help
people kind of bring the noiz anyone has
seen dirty dancing one to one they have
want a few women my age no yes nobody
puts Baby in a corner let's get that out
of the way at the beginning of the talk
it's a great movie if you're a woman of
a certain age if not you might still
enjoy it it's about the Borscht Belt era
in in the Catskills in New York where
most of the great stand-up comics that I
look up to kind of got their start
including Mel Brooks and most of them
were tumblers so part of what you're
doing is performing high like I can
jokes he'll probably do some jokes over
here the part of it is involved having
all of you getting all of you to be
involved not just sitting and listening
or ideally not even um surfing but
getting to know each other I mean do you
all know each other this is really hard
to do behind it can I even pick this up
now okay do challenge okay so Simon is
over this time and woody where are you
from you grew up in San Francisco are
you the only one it wasn't like really
it is it a good place to grow up cuz I
only know as a good place to go to you
know what we have invert inverted
experiences because i have um I grew up
in a place that's good to leave that's
famous to go to actually I grew up in
niagara falls canada it's a famous place
where many people go has anyone gone
there a lot tense walking by man what's
your name Jeff how long did you go for
Jeff you had the optimal Niagara Falls
experience yeah okay 19 years in a place
designed for half a day that Jeff had
maximized the experience of it was
designed for a heterosexual people to go
have intercourse and call themselves
honeymooners and the entire city
experience I'm trying to be all I know
if I was making that a joke I'd use
different language but I figure I'm like
Google I'm not supposed to say thing
that you all know what I mean so the
place is designed for that experience
and I you know it's a little bit like
growing up on the strip in vegas with a
little pittsburgh on the side niagara
falls it's a very bizarre place that you
kind of want to leave but I grew up in a
very small Jewish community within agri
falls in the last remaining shtetl in
the world and for the majority of you
who now have told me are not Jews and
apparently you've never watched Seinfeld
I will translate okay shtetl is ghetto
without the bling it's a place where a
lot of Jews white skin Jews the now live
in the u.s. their families are all from
and that part of that experience taught
me about tumbling which is if you're
happy I'm happy that's the basics is
that
simple we want everyone to be happy and
the number one you're gonna do that is
to care about everybody and notice them
especially the people who don't seem
that involved like I don't know his name
he's wearing a red v-neck sweater he's
got a button down and he's seems pretty
earnest guys in the back row what's your
name Patrick what point did you think I
was mentioning you was it the sweater it
was it yeah where you from sweet
Bienvenue another Canadian yes you grew
up there do you speak French do you wish
you were speaking French all the all the
francophones I met everyone I met in
Quebec was all very hardcore about the
French so you're not at francophone
European parents so you know how to
translate sort of between cultures
you're not sure you must you spoke more
than one language right so everybody
speaks different languages not just
languages like French and English but
emotionally everyone communicates
completely differently so most of the
time what you're focusing on if you're
trying to I'm guessing many of you might
be interested in this topic because you
run communities or you want have a party
that's great or you want to have
meetings that are great or you want to
in the business you're running what
people have more connection with each
other and be more involved unless bored
out of their skulls and disconnected
from one another and what creates
community anesthetist owned this from
being in a community of 40 people I
learned and from performance stage for
10 years everyone has to be involved in
the most important people do involve to
the ones in the edge like Patrick didn't
seem so interested maybe little interest
is here but he's got something else
going on he's cutting on the edge and he
seems like his energy seems a little bit
unrestrained a little bit quiet maybes a
little bit shy maybe I'll be introverted
no I'm guessing yeah no sure ok so I'm
noticing all of that
while I'm looking at everybody and if I
can involve Patrick a little bit I'm
much more likely to involve more of you
faster than if I pick the person in the
front row with their arm up which was
you know which was me in high school so
I have complete you no compassion for
anyone who's got that kind of energy but
one of the techniques that will pull
everyone in is to go to the fringes go
to the people who seem on the end who
seem like they have lower status in
whatever your community is not by lower
status I don't mean that is a moral
judgment I mean compared to everyone
else they speak less they seem less
involved they're more nervous they know
fewer people and go up to them and when
you have the floor when you have the
energy tumbling is it all about really
energy Direction community tools are
only so as as good as our emotions and
our ways of socializing will allow us to
be and everybody wants to connect that's
a fundamental driving life so the goal
of your goal when you're when you're
tumbling or when you're running any kind
of part of your conversation is the
togetherness and togetherness isn't as a
feeling so I'm aiming for a feeling it's
a little bit odd to be talking about it
as I'm trying to do it because I would
have if I'd had a laugh I just go do it
and then I deconstruct it after but
we're gonna try and do both at the same
time um it's one thing for me to be
really entertaining write and tell you a
lot more jokes and that gets a lot of
attention for me but if I do that to
hold focus to show that I'm worthy of
your attention and this is true with
whoever's hosting a conversation or is
the main moderator of your list serve or
your site whoever's the community
manager or the CEO Evers in a position
of I'm going to be an object of focus
that gives you a certain amount of
authority and I think the best way to
create the bonds is in among your the
community rivers there is to then give
some of it up as much of it up as you
can while still taking care in
containing the room so I'm still
noticing Patrick and Simon and Simon
this point will more engaged and I'm
also what i'm doing is i'm naming
exactly what's going on so it is not of
that tricky a thing this is the thing
comics do all the time
um it's a little bit weird it's like
talk explaining a magic trick or it's a
but would say dancing about architecture
it's a little bizarre to deconstruct
some comedic stuff but tension is what
son named the stuff you assume sometimes
what's really uncomfortable to talk
about religion sex these are all great
places to make comedy how much money you
make is anyone getting laid off stuff
people might want to avoid that they
care about the reason it's powerful
because you care about it and it's the
caring that forms the energy in the in
the room and that lets you really tunnel
or anyone who started any discussion or
any minor community if it's a small
group on flickr or you run a you know
metafilter it's because you care you
care about something and you hopefully
care about people and it's that the
energy of that caring that's gonna help
you allow you to contain everyone and
and pull them in together so um what's
your name in the strike yep alejandro
where you from Mexico where logico
Mexico City and have you do manage
communities is that something that you
do in America developer communities and
so on when the communities you're
talking with our communicating with one
another how personal are they with each
other or how and how problem-focused are
they
you want more togetherness and are you
doing are you problem solving
successfully together yes I mean I think
the reason is oh yeah it's there's sort
of a couple elements that go on when
people communicate one is a data which
you guys know a little something about
right basic information there's nothing
I'm gonna tell anyone at Google about
how information basically works on a
here's the sentence kind of level but
the whole emotional layer of
communication actually from my
experience affects people much more than
what you're saying it's why really good
comic can say blueberry and it's laughs
it doesn't matter what they're saying
almost it's really not the language it's
the timing it's the energy it's the kits
it's an emotional substrate so a lot of
geeks are not always myself included
aren't always great socially it's
sometimes a skill we have to almost
intellectually learn but you naturally
have those skills I don't have time in
today's talk to go into my theory about
why we maybe lose lose track of them but
you're born with them you're born with
knowing does this person have a nice are
they not nice it's kind of that simple
do you like me do you not like me are
you really listening to me are you not
listening to me you can tell you can
tell and that's a lot of what you're
playing with so dude someone's talking
to you like Alejandra here I saw your
energy totally changed and you're
talking to me you got your eyes got more
open your voice got a little bit louder
you um we're able to tell me part of why
you care now I know part of why you're
here so why you're invested in this
which is you have a bunch of people you
have a problem yourself which is we're
doing sort of a certain kind of problem
solving together developer community
Latin America but everyone's really
restrained and also culturally probably
that's that's a factor to overcoming
personal restraints one of the ways you
can do that is by being more personal
yourself so one of the first things I
would say and just let you know I've got
all this information on them the key the
key tricks that I'm going to tell you
all are on a one sheet to sheet that
I'll show you where to download and
Heather gold calm I don't believe in
tons of power point because I'll lose
your focus and it's my job to contain
you and when you're tumbling or holding
the attention of a community that's your
responsibility and if you want to defer
that to a tool or PowerPoint slide
you're giving away all of your strength
which is you and your personal energy
which is way more interesting I mean
Patrick you cutting your finger is way
more interesting to someone who cares
about you then you solving your cancer
kind of thing it's your emotional
personal way of being in the world that
gets attention so when basic premise I
want to be able to show people here oops
how do I now that we're on JPEGs do this
way arrow okay often I'm an awesome
visual artist okay this is the
difference between presentation and
conversation which might be intuitive to
you but I find it helpful to have an
image sometimes so most communication
the the is formally that we're used to
is on the left television is mostly
pretty much that immediate most meetings
anyone without most of your tech talks
almost every tech talk I've watched is
mostly that is slides and listen to me I
know something you don't know um
conversation you play a different role
it's more of a hub and the thing that
sits in the problem is in the center is
you as a person who's going to contain
it emotionally and the question itself
or the problem itself you want to name
whatever the issue is because nothing is
an insight of Sarah lil turnbull's who's
a mentor of mine who created fitted
sheets and industrial design that
nothing brings people together like a
shared problem so the thing that yet
that we're focusing on when you're going
to deal community management or tumbling
or building a party or in my opinion
building probably company this is what
holds people together is each other part
of the reason we've solved problems
isn't just to build the bridge to get
across the river it's because the
feeling of doing it together is awesome
that's probably one of the best feelings
we have in life is all doing being
something together being in a great
concert being at a party we're all there
being on the same page in the same
conversation knowing where for some
people it's a religious experience that
is just a transcendent human experience
and so your goal is the feel
if you focus on the feeling a lot of the
other information stuff will happen this
isn't much this is something people pay
less attention to the people who tend to
pay a lot attention to it are women
especially at least the ones i know a
lot of Jewish mothers with this this is
one of their favorite tricks which is
high want some chocolate cake sure well
you know you feel a little loved you
feel cared about if she made it herself
you feel a little more loved not if
someone else brought it and it was like
pepperidge farm and and you're gonna
give something before you get something
so I'm going to be vulnerable I'm gonna
share something like alejandro you could
share something about yourself you could
go go first number one principle go
first it's your responsibility and be
vulnerable the most people you may think
that getting listen to is because you're
important it's kind of a strange
inversion you already are important you
forgot that you're important and if you
treat yourself as such and you share
vulnerably every other person around you
will will give you more attention and
then what you do in tunneling is you
play with the attention you basically
help redirect the attention so does
anybody else managed a community other
than Alejandro in here now well we
what's your name you're damn what what
are you managing
opensocial and you guys do stuff where
you get together in person and how
important is that to getting anything
else accomplished well so seriously it's
important to help make things happen
more quickly but we do everything online
or to be official for it to be official
so what happens when you get together in
person echo posle do you actually talk
about your life with anyone even for two
seconds yeah and do you make friends and
does the group work better when you guys
are friends I'm just trying to add a
little analysis to emotion because I'm
translating just like the French to
English for Patrick right the constantly
asking yourself what is I know for
Goulding or people learn to really into
GTD and overland did a great talk here
like what is the point what am I trying
to accomplish what's my next action it's
a comfortable place to think well
emotionally ask yourself the same thing
what is the goal it's almost always
together pneus it will help anything
else happen always it will always help
things happen because you'll have more
people and more energy um have you found
any tricks that work to help open people
up cake you tried cake food feels good
um personal story telling really good uh
the best freest thing you could possibly
do now I'm super comfortable doing it
I've done it a ton but you've all done
it a lot to you just haven't done it in
public but you do it all the time you
have a sister or mother brother a friend
parents somebody you're telling about
your life those are the people who care
about you all you're doing on stage is
you're just doing that big time it's
like let me I'll tell you you know
what's going on in my life and I'm
perfectly comfortable with you all
hearing that but the fact that I'm going
first makes other people a little less
afraid cuz I'm gonna be potentially
laughed at or or um are not laughed at
then it's important to remember that you
can be imperfect that's even better
don't think you have to be like you know
I'm you know like I'm just Eve Dobbs and
I've you know analyzed everything
apparently people thank god i wish i
could present like steve jobs you know
who k I mean he's good at lots of stuff
but do you really care about the man do
you know him does he told you anything
about himself think you can so quickly
get the attention ever in that room dan
if you told everybody about the day your
child is born if your child was born or
first a fall in love something really
emotionally resident or the reason this
problem matters to you if you probably
go underneath whatever problem you're
working on I don't care technically what
it is alejandro it's there's a reason
you're doing it why do you have this job
you could have another job you could be
a mechanic or you could be building
bridges you can be doing million other
things there's something in it that for
you from your point of view it makes it
meaningful and if you acknowledge that
people will go to the level of meaning
and emotion much faster so for me I was
a complete outsider and outcast growing
up outside of my little shuttle I was a
complete nerd some of you may may not
relate to this is if I I coped with life
through books there was no laptop then
and I didn't have anything that's
portable and lights to carry around with
me it's like a little security blanket
let's acknowledge that it does a lot of
cool stuff but part of the reason we get
so excited to tell their people about
all the awesome stuff they can do
their little machine is because the
machine makes us happy sometimes it
gives us a place to feel comfortable to
feel contained so part when you're when
you're tumbling when you're running
community when you're managing it in my
mind if you're going to be good CEO
you're a container you're an emotional
container it's a little psych term I
picked up from a therapist once if we
got a better term I'm totally open for
it but you're basically going to form
the kind of conversation we're gonna
have by being willing to handle
everything that comes up Jeff walks
through the room a Honda has a bit of an
accent so I'm gonna work to understand
his accent and try to acknowledge where
he's from Patrick's a little shy so I
won't acknowledge of it I make him too
uncomfortable I don't have a lab so I'm
gonna find a way to be as personal you
gotta take whatever comes to you which
means some people will be mad at you
some people will be Schmucks some people
will talk want to talk a lot you have to
let all of that be okay tools and rules
will never ever do as good a job as your
confidence that you can handle anything
it's very time consuming to run through
50 rules in your mind it's not so time
consuming to just be there and say it's
okay and most people i mean if i don't
find one has a particular problem they
might want to bring up where there's
someone giving them a hard time and you
guys are really very attentive although
i know i just met you from BBC from
mashable camp adrianna you're taking
notes yeah dr no I already took no true
just just letting you know twittering
tweeting are your live tweeting that's
sweet okay so you're sharing while
you're experiencing and is it so you and
are you sharing partially because you're
kind of excited about your learning or
cuz you're really bored out of your head
they're totally fine you can totally
tell me a few times if I'm suckin the
art of the room connectivity addiction
cuz you feel like you're with a lot more
people do you want to be with us you can
totally be with them it's very important
not to make anyone do anything making
try thinking you can make someone do
something as a complete self delusion it
doesn't really work so it's totally up
to you but I'm
working on in here I've got a little bit
more people or most Simon's laptop is
closed look at him and he's totally with
me sweet it's not even as painful as a
childhood in San Francisco with hippies
and bad Guatemalan fests and too much
purple and two haircuts in one it must
have been ugly yeah aesthetically
challenging I would think to say yeah I
know it's it's own little world it is
everybody has their own little world but
then you've learned what they really
mean when they say lot like you that's
part of the translate i think i'm
talking about when someone says
something what I really getting at like
you're saying i'm twittering well why
cuz i really want to be with i and part
of as the neck grows and what people are
building at Google part of what we're
getting is that sensation a lot when
we're online I get it a lot you feel
like we're all now on the same
wavelength and we're all kind of surfing
it's kind of a flowy feeling it's really
cool that's driving go ahead
yeah it's totally certain kind of
attention that's right so for you it's
totally working but in terms of tumbling
here's what happens if someone isn't it
which isn't and again it's totally it's
my responsibility to make it worth your
while and it's totally fine if you don't
want I'm not going to mention it again
to make you uncomfortable if you want to
but it works but energetically
emotionally for the room it what happens
is if someone feels like well I'm more
comfortable here alone because my little
emotional container that's better for me
than you is this which is true a lot of
times I mean I know the best for me the
best reason to have this is I have to go
for a ride with my parents somewhere I
mean this is like better than heroin
right or whatever my other option is
going to be lying that's another one
complete repression so part of the
circle and the oh I'm going to go back
here part of the the difference here is
is in the side words that the one too
many it's ironic you know L we're so
interactive yet every conference we go
to is a one-to-many PowerPoint
presentation there's nothing interactive
about it which is why people Twitter
their heads off because you're not no
one's noticing you why cuz we don't
spend time learning to do what I'm doing
right now which is mostly what a lot of
artists and actors learn to do which is
I'm making a lot of eye contact and i'm
reading energetically the room
constantly it's like a constant feedback
loop for me and i'm reading based on
who's who's involved who's not involved
why not and then I try to give as much
energy to the to the edges as much as
possible and ideally what I would be
sometimes do and shows and what I'd
really recommend you guys do with the
commune's you manage is give someone
else a lot of attention because you guys
hear what I drown I was saying about why
be on a laptop know a little bit can you
say it a little bit louder or you can
come up here and say it here if you want
so what was it doing for you
this is mine that's fine right it makes
me pay more attention because I have to
pass it on to other people so actually
we made far more dish what it does
that's just me the point is above you
right to the intellectual level it's
that's right there's a way in which
you're translating and what you're doing
is you're giving your energy to
everybody or with on Twitter so you're
with them and you're totally with them
and they'd feel feel that and Italy go
I'd Rihanna said this cool thing and
maybe they're adding her back going well
blah blah blah it's going back and forth
back and forth but in the room I lose we
lose a little bit because she's a little
bit less of her is here but if I can
help um could you hear this time blue
stripe t-shirt yeah what's your name Tom
okay you can hear okay so if I can have
helped her give her the floor and I've
didn't sort of tumbling without moving
which has been an interesting experience
for me and without baked goods both of
which are very important to me um then
I'm say okay let's pay attention Adriana
and then it's like kindling it's like
building a fire and she has a little
different flavor and it's a little bit
also because you're I can tell you're
maybe a little bit of a shy person
you're not a big you don't verbalize her
at least until you maybe know people
better or a smaller group you're you
know and that actually helps this is an
interesting thing people think oh we
just have to be big loud to get a lot of
attention no actually sometimes you get
more impact by going to someone who
seems less likely in fact usually and
the more difference in the room it's
kind of someone can explain to me if
this works in physics because I'm very
interested in seeing the things I know
emotionally if they're true in the
physical world if the more difference
the more the energy builds the faster so
what I usually like to do like if I was
gonna do this talk show style we didn't
have time to do it i would say have
Adriana and maybe Patrick and maybe
Simon come up you'd be my little guests
we'd have this conversation about how
you run meetings I'd ask Alejandro for
his input you guys seem a little bit
differently you come from different
backgrounds have different personalities
you're different genders ideally try to
have different races as much difference
as you can possibly get does it matter
because
giving points of entry that's part of
the reason things grow virally
emotionally online it's not just that
the data transfers its that you can
relate to whoever it is who's talking to
you because you care because they speak
from your point of view and therefore
you have access to the larger
conversation if no one speaks to you if
you can't hear you and you can't hear
them it doesn't matter how much someone
else wants to tell you how important the
thing is this happens and say marriage
all the time it's a nightmare if you're
not the same that's speaking the same
language you've got to find some way to
meta translate so I'm trying to do a lot
of that too i'm gonna tell you what
shtetl is I'm gonna try and say and all
this is just going what is the what do I
mean was the point and noticing are you
engaged you're more engaged now I'll
hundreds a little less engaged maybe
think he's got thinking face on and
Simon's still pretty pretty here and Tom
is more interested than he was the
beginning of this I'm just so this is
just I'm sort of explaining what I'm
doing as I'm doing I'm trying to go
controlled scrimmage it's a little meta
but you guys are super smart so I know
you can follow it it's like I'm gonna
Duke explain comedy while I try to do it
um one of the things that I think is
happening culturally is it just a very
big idea is that before we had one too
many we had sort of villages of small
groups like the shuttle I'm talking
about but you had a lot of repression
people are the same your fan whatever
culture you come from people is probably
a certain way to be and there's only so
many things you can say and if you kind
of step outside those lines you know you
kind of socially smacked and one way to
deal with that is to say well this group
doesn't hold me very much but this will
so I'll go over here and this is just
the way to get to other people who hear
you people want to be heard and noticed
so what I think we're moving into a
really profound time because then we
went to one tomato to sort of urban life
right where we have sort of like Oprah
era of communication we have experts we
still deal with a lot of experts I'm not
a fan of just one expert that's why I
like open stuff and and in that kind of
one too many domain you end up with the
attention all going into whoever the big
leader is whoever's
front of the room and then we think
they're special because we've all given
them their attention our attention and
then they get more attention for more
people and they do more book tours and
more speaking they think aren't they
important don't they know something we
don't know well that's kind of changing
is you guys know if you're part of the
web culture people like I actually know
something I refuse to forget that I know
something the truth is the goal of the
one-to-many you'll never connect
everybody the same way except through
one or two people who are standing in
for you and it's not quite the same
experience we're going all the way back
like with this kind of conversational
hub model it's kind of like the shuttle
except without the repression how can we
all be together and be ourselves and be
different and that's why containment is
so important and also so tricky because
I have to accept that someone here might
want to yell at me argue with me tell me
I'm full of crap tell me I make no sense
to them not pay attention to what you
know not get involved which is basically
voting by saying I don't care as much
you know and and so to me this is a this
is a big a big place that we're at and
why my opinion people are community
managers or the CEOs of tomorrow I think
it's the most important skill in
business because the only we're going to
get more ideas is to have more people
involved and only way to more people
involved is to listen to more people and
the only way to listen to more people is
to learn to see them and hear them and
that's a major emotional translation
issue and you've got to put out to get
them you've got to go out to let them
know they matter there's no escaping the
emotional footwork of letting people
know that they matter that they're there
thanks Dan for your participation that's
all right I really appreciate it um so
does any there there any any particular
questions or problems you want to you
want to pose with this or things that
you're facing that you'd like to figure
out how to approach better or I could
just do mitts jokes for the rest of the
hour which I'm happy to do what's your
name
Tyler hey I find like this whole like
online community things like really
important to me like I don't understand
how to connect to it all of it and like
realize like I pull again to connect
people and have conversations um and I
guess I'm wondering from people the
audience like who are involved in our
communities what is it that gets you
connected because i think that there's
like a huge like bunch of people like me
or Elijah okay who could be reached
right i mean like i have like one like
knitting that i actually awesome online
anyway right yeah Mon 1 i'm researching
stuff all day there so i could benefit
i'm hanging out and there's in the cafe
but no one's talked you know i'm not
really talking anyone it's like found
the cafe like is your internet a cafe in
that metaphor yeah but the cafe and like
I don't even know how to like start
countries anybody want to say what they
explain what they get out of any of the
communities they belong to in line or
why they bother participating other than
its they're paid to do it if anyone does
Kevin you want to shop at it or I'm not
there to go there what it is for me is
finding people who have something to say
we're interested and then follow
following that so I find someone like my
head or Adriano
will write something online and I can
read that again right what you can watch
that and it's the other people react to
that and a lot of it is following the
connections between people because
people are people didn't do something
you don't expect but once you find
someone who is interesting there though
he points your new interesting things
and then you can respond back in with
just a great or you considered response
or something else but that point you
find a connection yes attire how are you
learning new ideas I guess your email
list you know like they very focused and
like I know my time is being wasted it's
like work email lists I have a couple of
email lists that I'm on with various
groups of involved so that's already
really directed that you think you've
filtered to be like I know I like this
information so there's not a lot of room
for the unexpected yeah it so I guess
I'm wondering like haha like from an
engineer protection I really like inject
that unexpected in people like me who
are looking for the unexpected and yet
benefit like you just do something cuz
if you like it it's a little different
doesn't really matter to tell you the
truth what it is could be you you could
just do something like you knit do you
think they'll expect you to knit do they
know that you knit right like so
contrast that go saying difference this
is bizarre to be so bent over because
it's mike the difference is is the best
part that's what I'm all that comedy
comes from it's just going here's what
you say and here's what you do and
they're totally different or you dick
like I wore lipstick and a tie cuz I
really like a lot of difference all the
time but energy gets released more the
more difference there is ain't no
Mormons and gay people now oh boy
there's a lot of energy going on the
country if any of your falling prop
eight I wanted to also drop in a major
thank you to ever know Google for
speaking up for my marriage so thank you
that for the company supporting that but
so there's this major difference and the
more different the differences the more
intense it is now in the in the
one-to-many model what we've had in most
media is will have a debate well have
two people disagree with each other and
they'll verbally punch each other in the
nose now it totally releases tons of
energy and it's a fun
spectacle to watch for a lot of people
but it doesn't always involve you
necessarily so the main thing is what
are you what are you trying to find out
and you might find it from other people
um you know not just from the people
through like so the list is containing
Ulysses are safe because you know it's
relevant you know your time won't be
wasted this is the thing about an
emotional plane is it's going to feel if
you're if you were used to filtering
life completely on an intellectual eyes
basis it will feel like time wasted
you're gonna that's one feeling you
might have but if there's enough feeling
of connection and fun or playfulness
they'll usually make up for that to make
you more comfortable because that gives
you room for things that feel less
connected because for me part of what's
fun is is connection discovery they're
like kevin i just love figuring out like
in the prime but we have 15 more minutes
and it would be really cool to find out
if like you and Tom and Simon have
something else in common that we didn't
know like that is just I love those
those moments of connection and the
elastics you know looking for an answer
to problem is one thing but offering
something about yourself is the fastest
way for people to meet you so an email
list isn't always the easiest place to
do it but it depends if people are you
just tweak the rules a little you just
say ham actually you just what if you
posted about some other knitting problem
I mean some people might think it's
bizarre but three other people might
might do it might might have an answer
and then you might talk and the purpose
of the talking isn't just to find out
the answer to the problem this is the
thing people it took me a long time to
realize people don't just go to the
concert because they like the music they
don't just talk about the problem
because we want the problem solved we
want the act of the togetherness in fact
maybe we do all these other things only
in order to have it togetherness I don't
know that's not an answer i have but ok
this is no longer different enough did
um did that make sense as anyone else
have a an online Adriana
I can't do that offer oh that's so wrong
I'm here to tell you please please be
yourself all freakin day long positions
by our identity whatever is online you
can actually how you think it will take
me off my music be years and years of
talking to my best friends for them
fully understand how I think online I
publish my well thank you to get an
aggregate of who I am in a much more
distributed manner and a much more
convenient lab here are emotionally safe
if I want to be emotionally that I guess
it
but I'm driving my own identity so I go
to that world because I can every time I
do something i'm adding to go i am in a
way that I can't do I'm fine there's no
there's no way I can distribute it yeah
it's just it's just features and more
autonomous online denial
oh is that resonate for anyone the idea
that you feel more yourself online than
in the this I'm not alike meet its so
did feel more empowered to be I got
actually expressing you can express
yourself more online that way i did i do
my good shape yeah you can change our
identity more in line shape it actually
so I ok see eventually i'm getting
closer to understanding what you mean it
takes a while sometimes to know what
some would beans all i have to do is ask
it's really simple a little tricky rules
here ask people it still may take me a
while to totally get it on a feeling
level that's where we get connection
from that's where the vibe is we're all
laughing it's team jacob what's your
name of sharon is ok it's gonna ask i
drown i'm just doing that so it'll pick
up on it like i see the two of you
talking interactive she keeps trying to
reflect back at you what she thinks
you're staying with Shango so now to
hear more because Orosco that all these
people were repeating about you are not
just making if their own think it out
for conservation right here Sharon said
just so everyone can participate in this
Sharon's asking Adriana how do you know
everyone actually is getting you they
might not be getting you just like
you're saying it's taking heather a
while to try to understand your meaning
right now not because you're so special
I think for any of us to communicate
it's a process not that you're not
especially not that you're there's
something wrong with you it's not
everyone I don't care
secondly early days when you got other
people sent a mask if there was no
comments in the early days to just get
emails from people who say I'm so glad
you're saying this this is really
interesting I came the same thing and
I'd never I thought I was the only
person who wanted to thinking that later
on the comments then there was I am than
there were social networking Facebook
and knows I mean all the connectivity
that you lovely people is the feedback
it's the pings back from people who
might get you or might be part of work
so one of the things if you're trying to
do this in person obviously like to do
it but I try to do it online too which
is it's totally about feedback and
giving a lot of it and one of the ways
to try to get closer is to make someone
feel safer contain the more and one of
the best ways do that is mirror them and
you described me doing it Sharon really
well I'm trying to I'm doing what people
do with children which we all need
basically our whole lives which is it's
a more affirmative way of figuring out
some with someone thinks than arguing
with them doesn't mean you agree with
them I don't even know I'm I just know I
don't yet know what Adriana meets but
holding that mental place if you're
really trying to contain room whether
it's as an entertainer or a host or CEO
it's that mindset I guess a Buddhist
called beginner's mind it's been quite
empty kind of like Merlin would say with
inbox zero it's just not knowing staying
that place if not knowing is a lot
easier requires a lot less work than a
lot of other stuff acquires emotional
work because you might have a reaction
what you might say something she has a
look on her face like she's angry that I
don't get her and like I could say oh my
god she doesn't like me than a five
issues around that I mean I'm not here
to do therapy but it's available from
other people and that's where you learn
how to deal with that but if you could
just notice that that's about her not
about you and that's a major skill set
you need to do this I find it easier to
do on stage than personally with people
but it is helping me personal
relationships so just to help kind of
deconstruct a love what we're doing here
so I still I know Adriana feels much
more strongly that she's really heard
and connects with more people who really
get her on
faster it seems in a way that they your
I'm trying to sort of mirror back a
mimic you know in Arthur in my own
language say what I thought I heard you
saying and you but the one thing I know
for sure forget describing it is you
care about it a lot and you probably all
could see that because she was being
more adamant your voice went up your
energy was I know it's a touchy feely
word energy someone find me a scientific
explanation for why I get to say energy
but you're you're more engaged you're
more like no you don't get this is
because I so you care I know you care
about this and and that is the critical
thing in bringing everyone together does
it it's a little bit of a subtle point
of making hear what she's saying almost
matters a little bit let not that it
doesn't matter to you that understand
what you're saying the amount you care
matters effects over us the most and
that's true for all of us is that you
Salerno you want to tell me I'm did that
make sense to you okay had more like I'm
saying
and you say they're now Luther that
they're more into your energy he doesn't
not be a lot actually because I won't
I'm passionate because without the idea
is and you want them to understand also
come across that as an issue where you
feel like people are distracted by
emotion and rather than reason they
don't care enough about yours they don't
it's um that's I think it's probably bit
of a geek issue but an important an
important one to address and certainly
one that matters for you but more people
more frequently God knows you've been
probably do enough conferences where
people had more about information and
less passion or they had the passion and
they didn't let themselves convey it so
I mean if there's one thing I can leave
you with in the next few minutes is
please first of all don't stand behind a
lectern please God don't if you have an
option please don't use a whole
powerpoint presentation to explain to
people what you already know have a
conversation it is just with Adrian I
had all these points I could have stood
here and gone through them but I did
them in conversation with people in the
room which helped me more and made sure
it was relevant to and I could see your
faces that you cared right that I was on
the money if you decide to contain
yourself with your tool whatever it is a
most late gear your laptop or the
presentation or it's a good one I'm
going to look at the screen while I talk
to you for an hour I don't have any tech
talks end up like that you lose the the
juice now you're you're fortunate
Adriana that you're comfortable being
passionate publicly i think that's
that's that's a challenge for some some
people and i'm happy to talk to people
after if you want to ask me or email me
that's another talk for me to address or
another practice um I mean practicing is
a good beginning just practicing doing
it and and for me it would tip that
helped me with stand up and I watch a
lot of people do it badly and then I
told myself I was allowed to be as bad
as them so you know just because someone
is really social and comfortable and
they speak just know okay that means you
get to do it too
and it'll only be a little bit better
and every time you do it'll be a little
bit better so that's that's the key the
key thing about a passionate views only
five more minutes not to make sure if
there's any other big issues before I
wind up or questions or or things you
really want to know about things you
wish we talked about Tyler did we
address well enough your do I want to be
part of an online community or not
really my question actually is less do I
want to be part of the community and
more as a software engineer and it's a
letter type like how can we address the
issue where people don't get engaged
because they don't have that oh I'm
curious or oh I want to explore or and
yet I think the community of learners
could benefit from more often as you're
saying between soaring write down what
they care about I've done instead of
actually connecting
yeah maybe
I'm service ruining your goatee could
you might repeat so I can say for the
tape wandering people are focused on
getting the job done instead of
connecting because that is it yeah I'm
refocus are you focus more on supposedly
being what's called productive in terms
of your work and output that leads to a
national GDP then you are on act of
connecting because we're sort of told it
doesn't it's been privatized and that
top-down model I gave you right you're
talking about a whole lot of years where
women connected privately we were in
charge of social connection and men went
out and worked visit ages ago right and
and is all about productivity now
hopefully we're integrating and we need
to bring all those skills around
connection because they're really
critical to getting things done and
certainly deforming longer term bonds so
you're going to keep solving problems or
actually finding an information you
don't already know they they sort of
support one another ideally so anyway
that's my little commentary what do you
think Tyler about Hugo's question is it
do you think cuz people are focused on
productivity and not connection like a
told like you know if you look at 100 of
the time to get something done really
ten percent of that time I was actually
doing in the other ninety percent was
the unquantifiable unexplainable to your
boss you know creativity interacting
whatever and so I guess my the room my
how do we foster that and how do we make
that valuable and does that their
formula well people participate in the
creativity part which is the connection
this is how do we make this happen well
I'm happy to help anyone who needs more
help with this or give you know do this
more next time for other people with
even a handheld mic so we can have a
little more involvement with everybody
getting together in person is really
great but you can see I mean I can do
this kind of conversation personally for
a thousand people so it's it's a
scalable thing and I really believe
emotionally can scale online too you do
there's there's not enough first time to
address exactly how but most of the
pieces we've addressed you do it through
other people and then some of these
other techniques you don't talk
literally to each person but that's just
like house a gmail grows right you know
Google isn't going to personally contact
each person who gets a gmail account you
make a contact that matters with some
and they and so on and you there's a way
to do that in a room but you just have
to know that you are emotionally
responsible for the caring and then
trying to tap in where other people care
to mean that's the thing is you find out
that there's tons of energy and lots of
people that's completely unused I mean
part of the reason you probably all work
at Google's I mean you get to be more
you dress more like yourself I mean fact
the valleys totally changed business
culture in the u.s. wire would you
address casually because you're more
yourself and it's a little bit one
little step towards more connection in a
small example in the past so I think
it's the next major frontier I know
people might think community management
is like a chick thing it's really soft
skills and you just have to listen to
people's problems and that sucks but
when you when you approach in an
integrated level and you real and you
realize that that's part of how you're
going to solve the problem it's it's as
valuable as anything else sometimes more
because people will stay connected
together because they have relationships
sometimes without even a problem to
solve just for fun imagine that okay so
I want to make sure we leave in time for
the next speaker I want to thank all of
you guys so much for being here and
thanks participating simon and tyler and
sharon and adriana and patrick left us
and
anyone else who didn't want Tom left but
anybody else who Kevin for bringing me
and as you can see is Sharon okay I've
done it many many times and part of it
is that I make a point to do it and
partly to make a point to do it is
because i don't recommend doing that
like find out something about the person
when you make contact with them it makes
just even for a moment i mean i do some
of this stuff i'm describing i do very
quickly I mean to be fair I read people
now at this point right brain very fast
and that's why I can do a shroom of a
thousand people in a conversation live
and I can explain more of that later but
no way that I could convey to you make
sure you do something where I go I'm
talking just to you I see you something
about you where you're from your cookie
whatever people in sales do it but they
do it in order to make a sale I'm doing
it because I want to know you and then
if I want to refer back to you i can see
well Sharon cited that and that gives
you an opening your another point of
entry for you to talk again for you to
take the floor for you to have the
attention and as I and as I get some
attention and I give it to you it kind
of grows faster in the room I don't know
if you guys can feel it but I certainly
feel a room that is much more connected
and then when I first stood here it
would be easier for you to talk to each
other right now it would probably be
most easy to talk to makes I talk the
most and I'm the most vulnerable and I'm
obviously willing to talk to anybody but
the more like Tyler now it's easier to
talk to you because you've shared
something about what you want to know
when people know your name and and so
that's that that's just the quick answer
it's not um you just do it but you care
there's really nothing under law
underlying caring it's probably what
makes businesses and products great it's
what makes relationships it's a very
central thing I want to know I want to
treat people though I wanted to be
treated I mean if it 10 it all comes
down to it all comes down to a very
geeky nerdy adolescents that wasn't so
comfortable and I wanted to figure out
how to make it different than how I
experienced it so that's what I work on
so thank you very much my sights Heather
goal com there's a link there for two
pages of this stuff about with a bunch
of notes little tricks and and I really
