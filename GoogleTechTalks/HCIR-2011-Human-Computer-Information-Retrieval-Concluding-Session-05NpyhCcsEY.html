okay but it is certainly not Christine
it's a usable system but when you start
looking in here there are some problems
such as yeah we've got you know
ninety-seven percent of the articles had
a title on them but you know if you're
looking for page number issue or volume
and number you know then the percentages
are quite a bit less so there were some
other things you have dates you know
roughly two-thirds of the articles had
some data information ranging from minus
seventeen thousand BC to you know 2942
or something okay so we did do some
cleanup on the data we did some I'm
sorry we did some data additions meaning
that we looked at the the articles
looked at their bibliographies looked at
the Articles that cited them and
inferred a date for them and that got us
from about sixty six percent having a
date to about ninety percent having a
date we did some spelling Corrections
you know these things start off as OCR
and so you see lots of words like in tow
duction and instead of introduction
that's matt's favorite example so Keith
did a lot of work looking for
low-frequency terms that for a very
small levenshtein distance away from
high frequency terms and then the low
frequency term was still in there still
index that way but it was also indexed
with the high frequency word which is
presumably a correct spelling of it Tony
did some noun phrase extraction I did
some categorization of this by ASEAN
categories because you know 30,000 of
them had already been categorized with
the ACM stuff so that seems like a good
enough training set to apply to the rest
of the 1.4 million okay so I'm going to
do a quick overview of the user
interface the things that are in here
the first thing to notice here is there
is no result set list right here okay
there is a result set list but it is not
the focus of the work okay what you
start off with top panel is your total
query what's going on and in the bottom
panel we start building the query
component by component in seeing what
the effects of these components are
you can start off by entering query
terms down in here there or together we
also getting some count information or
we can take away some of these
components that are order together their
phrase queries then we can add the new
term filter and bring in another set of
queries that will be ended on to these
and you can have any number of those you
can turn them on and off should you want
to you can browse the daisy ministry
thing when you do a query you get
information about the result sets sighs
you also get information about the
change in result set sighs having done
this most recent action so for example
here we're seeing two queries latent
semantic indexing and principal
components analysis I should say or
principal component and over there date
filter we've got an end date of 1995 put
in there for the heck of it okay so that
dropped off twenty thousand items from
our result set when we put in that date
filter leading us with the total
resultant set size of 117 okay there's
noun phrase work that's been on here you
know we noun phrases were extracted
beforehand and added to the index so
whatever the common noun phrases are in
the result set shows up there in the
bottom it's whatever the common noun
phrases are in your currently current
query component okay timeline shows up
here this is the total query for latent
semantic indexing or principal
components analysis and then this part
is bitten before 1995 and white whiter
part is a you know what's been excluded
by the date filter and then within the
component itself there's a similar sort
of timeline that shows you know the
yellow one is what came from latent
semantic indexing and the red one is
what showed up from principal components
analysis and the blue is the total of
them and if you were to hover over the
down phrases on the side them a new
line would get drawn in here you can see
oh well if I hover over something like
covariance matrix or dimensionality
reduction you know I can see what would
happen to that result set before I
actually do that okay so that's kind of
the UI overview this is all on the query
page there's other things up here you
know the results page or a document page
that shows you the text of the document
and highlighted search within that go on
local but this is really built for a
motive search where you start off you do
some searches you bring in drag and drop
terms from the noun phrases or filter
things by the ACM tree build up your
results that shrink it down take a look
at you know how big this thing is and
then you start looking at the results
okay oh yes and then there is the magic
preceding work button and you will talk
about that we will talk about that very
soon okay so task 5 the HCI arm it a
challenge this is an area where I have
sort of limited domain knowledge i mean
you know none of you have seen me at an
HDI event before some of you may have
seen me at taxonomy related so in the
challenge there were these various
workshops mentioned that we're
proceeding the HDI our workshops and so
the question is well is this a complete
list of the HDI are relevant workshops
well you know let's find out and so what
I did you remember there was a search in
here like you know sig I our work shop
let's try faceted
search so we put that in a and we've got
you know a few papers here you know and
we can add on another query here that I
stored away the workshop on information
retrieval in context and so this is
added 15 documents to our results set
and you know the normal cooking show
thing of you know here's a query I
prepared earlier which is basically just
the or of all of those workshop names
okay that's all that's in here are those
you know you workshop names we've got 47
results there okay well so what we do
then is say well you know the question
here is what came before okay and what
we what we have in our current results
that our documents that mention these
workshop names maybe it's because they
were presented at the workshop more
likely it's that they are citing
something that was presented at that
workshop so we do analyze preceding work
and this looks at the citation
information in the current results set
basically take our current result set
you get the union of all of the things
cited by the material in the current
result set minus the current results set
so that we don't see you know anything
from the workshop that was excited
layers this is all stuff preceding
things in those workshops are cited you
know by works that cite those workshops
etc okay well that goes on for you know
a number of years here largely this
working because its preceding work we
don't see a bunch of stuff you know in
2008 because these workshops will pretty
much all before two thousand six but
there are a few things in there where
there might be date errors and so we can
you know limit this down to just the
things that are before 2006 okay and so
now we've got two hundred and twenty
some odd results here well what can we
do to trim that down a little bit and I
thought well you know make sure that
there's you know kind of a good name in
here like workshop maybe that'll things
thin things down a bit and that gave us
104 documents you know half of those
documents didn't cite
something that said workshop you know we
could have expanded this query to say
conference or whatever this is just what
I did the first time through now I took
a look at the results set okay so here's
our result set listing and the second
one and the result set this tool a
visual tool for querying relational
databases let to me sounds kind of like
HCI and I are although some purists
might debate whether databases or IR or
not but I think most of us would be
charitably inclined towards that
position so we take a look at that and
you know we've got a you hear the
various metadata for this we could look
at the article itself if we wanted to
but let's look at what this thing sites
because what we really care about is you
know are there workshops that preceded
the HCI are ones and looking at the
first sighted we have the third
international workshop on interfaces to
databases sounds like HCI and I are to
me okay and based on this you know
roughly in a few minutes of work it
wasn't quite this fast when I did it but
this is this is exactly the path that I
took in answering this question I can
say it seems highly highly unlikely that
the list of workshops is complete the
end okay this is good enough and even if
you want to fit he even if you want to
say well you know databases and I are
you know come on the probability is
vanishingly small the list is complete
so that's that all right so and i'll
leave it to Matt and Keith to take up
the next one okay will do the five
minute version the full videos of all
five questions resolves and there are
all right so basically we want to do
test two faceted search in the 80s by
Giorgio Marchetti and Nicholas Belkin
okay so what we're going to do is jump
into the UI and generate faceted search
and do night in and search limits in
nineteen
and we're going to go and check the
results and they'll be one okay and this
is the symbol of paper that we're trying
to describe is does this cover the
entire thing so we go and we'll do that
and show that and and we have pre cooked
all of the text we're going to do but
not of them rely so each thing we can
turn on and off and will show what that
means so oh you need to turn off all
your filters okay so as oh ok so these
are all the filters that we're going to
do and you have five interesting okay
cash to ya test who's a better task okay
let's get a page which no you got to go
test to it'll leave this page will
explain why he's doing this the the
concept of going and finding what you're
doing could be very involved could
include lots and lots of steps as you're
doing that you may only just do it and
better or worse better worse going to
the eye doctor you like you know so
that's what our system supposed to do so
returns on the first one we're looking
at faceted search there's 159 results
they'll go and limit this to nineteen
ninety office rendering different here
and one result we can click on the one
we could have clicked on the minus 150
to see what the left is that but you
know and there's the paper okay but
we're not satisfied you can go back to
the slide deck um one result okay 99
they were the first to mention those two
words together in this corpus okay but
we want to find out what were the core
components so yeah it's fine Oh No okay
so this is what its papers on every
noses okay basically the progressive
development iterative refinement having
an inverted index bullying queries and
and Ords living again okay next slide
okay okay so we want to find out
separately what's this what's that and
did any of these combinations exist
before nineteen ninety okay next slide
okay so faceted hmm okay well these are
three good ones okay next okay so here's
the you know some of the terms we're
going to use we're gonna use query
construction into feedback okay boom
let's go to the system okay
so we're gonna try to do is think of
this as a multi-dimensional search where
we might be considering you know Anne's
in some cases or than others we can
expand it or contract it and if he turns
on filter to fix their this is faceted
whatever okay look 29 years old 12 we
can take the d filter honor ah ok turns
off filter two clicks on filters three
to see it and then turn on query
construction and as he clicks if the
system respond for and show you that
that's iterative and feedback have to
make it active and then five shows that
one we're Interactive's not just a
database and in me thierry but actually
working with some of these things
together okay so what happens is now
he's actually looking at there so we're
saying we have 12 documents okay all
right good enough okay let's turn those
off and let's take a look at five six
and seven to see if you know maybe if
you search this way and found this kind
of stuff thinking that this is what your
queries on maybe you found you know
facet and classification good enough
okay or this together okay great boom
and then over to boolean search and
maybe add inverted index I have whatever
same thing I keep going okay so then you
take and you look at that search in 28
documents right 28 okay well let's see
what happens if you turn on four five
and six which are sort of like a man
over to the knack interactive and mmm
two documents all right well well Honan
in here is this complete well let's
bring on facet whatever you click on
this earth so for some reason when you
look at faceted whatever with iterative
interactive so if all the components are
put together and so just looking for
faceted search pre-1990 we also looked
at faceted search 1990 proceeding
scratches reference the papers that did
it so we went ok well let's break it
down into components and see what might
be there so we've read the paper about a
hundred times highlighted gone up down
left and right what some people said we
shouldn't do but you know we're indexing
guys and we had to throw you I on it so
this is what we came up with other
things we could do is let's say we go
over to booleanquery 007 what you could
do with the system is on any of these
things you can click on one or more and
see the impact of what it might do
before you go over there you know like
hmm hmm
yeah yeah and you can look at like
what's coming and going and let's just
say you did this some say what you do
and you say well there's a pretty
complicated won't we save where we're at
so then you go to settings because
remember if we leave the page we said
who you've been doing all this work
you'll want to save this before you go
cuz we haven't kept anything it's all
been live and interactive and you know
better or worse better or worse better
or worse I doctor um so if you save it
it's a URL that you can go back to and
there's your save session and like other
papers when you when you're
collaborating we found it very painful
with five of us I wouldn't do it that
way I do it this way so we're done yeah
so so there was no pre ceding work hi
max of two questions and everybody's
good oh oh you guys can pick your
question okay
Oh have you seen the corpus um we didn't
mention things like um we you know when
you're going to get coffee and someone
secretly placed your words with folders
you know what we did was we took the
index and overlaid upsampled so it was
one of our larger indices 10.4 million
terms amid even after yeah they're quite
a few documents that still have rather
erroneous feels yeah yeah the cjk was
basically diamonds with question marks
we didn't know how to linguistically
wash that into soil right and and
actually one of the things we consider
doing which is we didn't show up but if
you click on settings we can actually
search what you gave us we can do an
exact search and we don't do any
stemming we don't do any you know neat
stuff we don't secretly replace what
you've asked for with something else we
just say fine that's it so on if you
notice we said faceted whatever it could
have been faceting and faster than Matt
we don't care close enough gifts keep
going it's about recall we want stuff to
come back first
and one thing we did was spelling as
well as I mentioned that we the word
that we're cycling this spell has very
low current more likely and although
that might increase for precision other
search our goal here was to try and
think all of our index we just ended
things up or more likely so that have
like all the challengers to come up here
everybody else get some big round of
applause okay and and now is the part
where you get to actively participate ah
gary is responsible for tallying votes
and as I have instructed him I this has
to be one winner so the he is clearance
to use a process he sees fit but what I
recommended is if necessary we um runoff
voting to establish that winner if it's
highly contentious so with that I'm
going to take the challengers out for a
well deserved beer and Gary will tell me
when the envelope is ready again a round
of applause for his guys guys don't get
the vote oh so this is what the room
looks like they didn't tell me what the
criteria were so don't ask they're all
winners write a great job but I think
what we have to do is we'll do simple
show hands get to vote for one and we'll
just go in the order in which they were
presented so the first one
if we see best da DB pussy on the screen
second one was Jean we're 30 million and
the third one sister sister and the last
one it's pretty a big amazing I have to
take a minute to say that we are really
going back to like the 70 all this yeah
you really have to know what you're
doing you have to actually think and
plan it's kind of cool all right so all
in favor of number one of the Yogi's
second one was Miriam
the third one was there
and the latter would be elsevier
III is well so so shall we have a a
runoff here actually only a three
different so run off or no so all right
so we don't need to tell them go
retrieve them
did you find him all right good good
well done are you ready okay oh it's a
very close vote I'm going to say that
this audience has been much impressed
with a really good work that we all did
in this challenge but one group was bit
ahead and that was here iam okay so we
ran a little over apologize for that but
I really appreciate having all the the
time to for the challenge grants of the
challenge grants the challenge groups
we're working on for next year so just
to take just a couple of minutes to wrap
up close up you guys need some down if
you'd like that thank you and there's
one thing that we that we hope to have
time to talk about we're not going to
have time to get into discussion tonight
but we want to leave you with some
closing thoughts some closing requests
and then ask you to follow up on that
over the past few years we've always
tried to have a little bit of time at
the end of the session to think about
where next what next year and this year
one of the one of the things one of the
themes that the steering committee has
been thinking about and has come up over
then suggested at times is you know do
we want to try to grow this workshop is
it's been very effective I think as a
one-day workshop
but there's always this question of this
repeatedly this question comes up do we
want to try to expand it to two days
perhaps keeping the current model where
we have the short talks discussions
posters keep that very interactive but
also perhaps add some more time to get
into full research papers that fairly
steering okay so that's sort of the
question that we're looking to get
feedback on obviously we'll look for any
other other sort of feedback that you
can offer to us oh and what we will do
rather than keeping you tonight is we'll
send you an evaluation survey and in the
mail you'll be in the mail and ask you
to take a few minutes and reflect on
what are they useful what aspects of HCI
are are really useful for you and where
would you like to see it go if you had a
chance to share your vision of where it
should go next year also I want to
remind you to submit for the IPM special
issue we we're very looking forward to
that and I just want to close and say
thank you to a number of groups i'm sure
i got everybody on this list certainly
our sponsors Google MSR in deca and
state response particularly thank Dan
Russell for his
haven't won also thank all the industry
participants that came because I think
it's it's really great to have that kind
of interaction something we've been
hooking towards we've had some solid
industry participation over the years
and I'm glad to see see more this year
and I hope you come back next year any
other final things during committee
Daniel I you know the the workshop is
about to formally end but it's a
tradition of these workshops that a
bunch of us go out to find a place to
have dinner some drinks and we talked
about going to Zhan downtown mountain
view but perhaps the tied house let's
depending on how many people are in will
find an appropriate venue so if you're
interested this is not the end but but
just the beginning also I think also you
know the the just to reiterate the you
know the look at that look at the
special issue obviously if you're if
you're interested in participating there
you know just a plus I really really
want to thank everyone I those who've
come over the years but especially new
folks this year it's really it's really
gratifying that something that was uh we
did almost on a whim four years ago as
turned into such a force in the
community so thank you all again thanks
especially to Dan and Google for hosting
this honoring a commitment that I'm very
very impressed so thank and thank thank
