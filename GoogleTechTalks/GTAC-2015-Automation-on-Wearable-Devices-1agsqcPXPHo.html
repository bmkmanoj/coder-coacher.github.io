talking about testing wearable devices
good afternoon everybody I am an Iraq I
work for Intel i work for a team called
test analyst we focus on all kind of
functional and non-functional automation
on mobile products so now today I'm here
to speak on automation on wearable
devices smartwatches now thank you
google for the selection and as we all
know with the rise of the technology of
this variable technology in both
business and personal use all the
companies which have a solid space in
the Android or iOS world have switched
their focus to this variable
technologies and have developed their
apps or support for this smart watches
so this increases the effort of testing
on those devices hence automation comes
into picture to reduce the effort and
increase efficiency now let's see so
basically this smart watches that kind
of three kinds of scenario connections
one would be on an actual device and on
an actual variable or a SmartWatch the
second scenario would be actual real
device and a emulator Android wear
emulator and third would be both the
things would be emulator so now let's
see how we can establish debugging
sessions with the smart watches on the
phones so that we can start writing our
test scripts and do the automation let's
go to the first scenario here is the
device where both the things of the real
devices on the real emulator so for this
what we need to do first we need to have
a device of android for 42 and above we
supports Android wear we need to install
the underwear application on that then
we enable
bluetooth debugging on the Android wear
app and as well as on the variables then
we connect the variable device to the
phone are using the Android wear app
after we do the connection we open up
command prompt and run the following
command okay so this is a port
forwarding command which will allow the
Android wear device to list up in the
Samsung list up in the ADB devices list
once we do that in the Android wear app
if you go to the settings there are two
things hast connected and target
connected so both the status of this
horse and target should be connected or
else the Android watch or the SmartWatch
doesn't soap in show up in the ADB
devices list so then we can see here
once this is done you can see the top
one is the smartphone and the second one
local apps folder for is the device or
the SmartWatch device so once you get
the context of this then we can rebel to
write any automation scripts or your
automation code on this watches now the
second thing is the actual device and
the word emulator this is my favorite
thing for doing the automation because
it is pretty stable so now here what we
do first we create a emulator device for
an Android wear as shown in the image so
as we see here we need to select the
device and as Android wear there are
different kind of sizes available for
the target but you can select any of
them then you need to select the target
API 21 or above then your Android wear
of SmartWatch emulator is ready then you
go to the command prompt again and do a
port forwarding again so you run this
command then your SmartWatch would show
up in the android list
android devices list and then you can
you have to go to the Android wear app
on the device and you need to just click
on select the option connect to emulator
instead of connected device option now
you see here the for this is for our
application we get this thing connected
now the third scenario is a device
emulator and the where emulator here as
you see the arrows here this is the
problem which I fails which has only a
one-way communication which means the
notifications from device emulator would
appear on the wear but not the vice
versa for an example if you're an app
which is doing something which can which
you can send a command from the your
watch to the device that scenario I was
not able to test it due to some
limitations that command doesn't go from
the watch to the wear so anyway we need
to see how we can connect it here we
need to create a emulator here note that
we need to create a google api image
while creating the device simulator we
need to select the google api image as
shown here not the google image which
this has the support for this variable
devices then we create a SmartWatch
emulator then we need to connect to the
telnet port of the device and we need to
do a portrait direction again so as you
see we can run this command here and do
the port reduction once you get the
status ok then you can get this emulator
connected now we are good to go for
automation but they are the problem
would be only the features one way
features can be tested now the second
now we have our the context of the
watches on our code then we can start
writing our automation thing you can use
any tool but here the example is with
the APM so here a PM on multiple devices
the same time if you want to execute or
write a test case you need to have
multiple sessions which each session is
tied to a particular device and while
studying each session of the server you
need to mention the override option as
true so that it can use the existing
station instead of creating a new
session every time then this is a code
snippet where you start the APM servers
for the different port numbers for both
devices here is the pseudocode to get
the driver 1 this driver is for the
smart phone and here is the driver for
the SmartWatch so here you see we have
to give the parameters as a device name
with the device IDs of the SmartWatch
and here is the device ID of the
variable then here once we get this
drivers we can write our clicks drags
drops anything you want so this is a
kind of framework what we have for our
automation part here we have the APM
thing sitting which all the sessions of
the servers are connected and we have
the smart watches or the emulators
connected to the phones and here's the
driver which runs are all automation so
here is a video of which shows are to
automation execution of two features one
is from the phone there is a
notification the SmartWatch there is a
command which will go to the phone and
you execute some steps on the phone then
again we install one application
alicious application on the phone and we
get the notification on the watch and we
then we can open that particular
notification on the phone itself
and you see the notification has been
open in the phone so this is a both way
communication from device to the
SmartWatch and smartwatch to the device
yes a few things are to the problem
areas what we faced the problem first
problem area is when we have actual
device and a actual variable once we
establish this USB debugging Bluetooth
debugging session so on the SmartWatch
there is a sticky notification which
appears Bluetooth a debugging enabled
which doesn't go off it's always stay in
the screen so one when we want to test
the actual notification we should pop up
on the SmartWatch as it is a critical
notification from the phone so that
always lies beneath the Bluetooth
notification debugging ruth notification
so you need to either flick it or do
something to see the next one it appears
but you will not be able to test the
scenario that it should always top up on
any other notification as is the system
modification that is one of the issue
the other issue as i said is with our
emulator both been both other emulators
this one-way communication happens these
are the two issues which is currently we
have but the actual device and the real
at emulator where is a the best one till
now yeah so that's it from my side yeah
you can have some questions one think
y'all so do you have a similar solution
for iOS devices this is from past three
months so when we started with this
android thing so is probably we should
be able to do that but we haven't deep
dive into the iOS stuff yet I was smart
watches because very costly to get it
for testing
um how did you trust the Intel Edison
are we don't test into addition of us
all I don't know what Intel addition is
but I I test on this product called
mcafee mobile security which we have in
the last release we had this variable
feature coming into picture like
whatever notification we have like virus
notification or if there is an Wi-Fi
attack on your connected network to your
phone you get all those alerts on the
devices so we started testing the
automation of that because this is a
little big feature to do that and
automation was really helping why did
you use a PM instead of UI Automator
this is I said we can use any tool this
is a PM is just a pseudocode like how we
can use the automation here for android
devices the main thing was here how to
get the context and how to establish the
USB debugging session once that is done
any tool you can use to do that it's not
not a p.m. or anything anything you can
use so that's the main thing is once it
get listed in the debugging session USB
debugging or group with debugging
session um is the use of emulator slow
yes I had the same question I think to
the uber team there they suggested like
the really slow but some gionee or some
new thing but there which is really
gionee motion was visually paid again
but yeah the demo letters are really
slow that will be the Google API image
for a thing it is again very slow than
the kill one hey and somebody is asking
isn't testing notifications on a
SmartWatch the same as testing the
SmartWatch itself no here we are testing
the features of the application which
has to appear on the watch it may happen
there a watch is working Lee working
perfectly fine but the you notification
does not appear on the phone or we had
it that kind of thing with our listeners
in her before are released with this we
found out that kind of thing where the a
notification was not appearing the phone
um and that is all the questions for you
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
