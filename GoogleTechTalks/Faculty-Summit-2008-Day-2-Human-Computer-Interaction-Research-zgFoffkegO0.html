ads quality metrics group but I'm a I'm
sort of in that particular group I'm
their token HCI person and I'm going to
tell you a little bit about a variety of
things going on at Google in the HCI
area this at this point so where is our
research on HCI so we're kind of spread
out all over which is fairly typical for
google we don't just sort of put the the
research in one place and expect others
to come to us we distribute the people
in lots of different places so in Google
research itself we're sort of gathering
a critical mass we've got some work and
activity-based computing that I'll talk
a little bit about today some stuff
looking at our you know we have this
large book scanning project and how
would you allow users to sort of follow
the threat of an idea across multiple
books and different perspectives on it
some things on very large scale social
networks oh pardon oh that yes that's
the problem with this very large scale
social networking models mobile and
social search and some very nascent work
on 3d for the web in search quality and
ads quality we're very interested in how
people search and how they interact with
search results pages so we don't see ads
is kind of a separate thing we see it as
part of the searching experience and
hopefully positive part of the searching
experience and again you'll hear
something from from that area about
search and then we have a fairly large
user experience group that's primarily
working on products but you know partly
through the 20-percent project idea
partly just through things we decide to
invest in there are things that spin off
that may become sort of research worthy
so we've done some work in new methods
new approaches for gathering data about
users interaction patterns and trying to
validate the value of them and a fair
amount of ethnographic we're kind of
looking at either existing customers or
potential customers of Google and what
kind of things they're doing in their
life that that we could satisfy those
needs and that will be one of the ones
i'll talk to you about potential google
users in uganda
so as I said it's sort of a whirlwind
tour of three projects the first one is
what's an expert searcher the next one
is how how can google search make a
difference in Uganda and then how can we
support extended complex information
finding activities okay so what makes
someone an expert searcher so this is
primarily the work of Dan Russell who's
sitting back there and who's going to
take all the questions on this topic
thank you haha and so on ders Erickson
who's spent his career studying
expertise in a variety of areas talks
about how people ramp up in this
expertise level till they reach what
they think of as an acceptable level
they think they're good enough and then
beyond that further improvements are
really unpredictable and some people
just never get past the good enough
stage and some people become the world
class whatever it is that you're
thinking about and this does not seem to
be just number of years of practice
there seem to be particular things you
have to do so thought I'd start by
asking you some questions so one of the
skills you need to know to be a good
searcher is to know what's out there you
know is it worth your time even
searching for something so I'll ask you
if you'd raise your hand to see if you
believe you could find the answer to
these questions so do you think you
could find a picture of Terry Winograd
all right oh good we start with an easy
but ok can you find a picture of Rula
lenska did all right to give you a clue
she's a British actress who's also a
Polish countess and you may have seen
her and just flaming red hair you may
have seen her in here commercials oh all
right can you find a picture of your
grandmother all right can you find a
picture of my grandmother okay if I told
you that there was a picture of my
grandmother on the web do you think you
could find it can you find a picture of
Ted are a video of Ted Williams hitting
a home run okay so
okay and can you find a video of my
grandmother so there were things you
were pretty confident that you couldn't
find and probably because you believe
they weren't out there and then there
were others that you know there actually
was quite a variation in this group
about what you thought you'd be able to
find so that kind of knowledge both
about what is out there and what skills
you have for finding them is an example
of the kind of expertise that we've been
looking at so what we discover about
people is that by and large they don't
really have a very good model of how
Google works week we asked a question
sort of like you know there's that box
on the homepage you type something in
there and you press return and then you
get a page of results what happens
between the time you press return you
see those results and it's really hard I
mean to get anything coherent out of
people anything that that we and it
certainly doesn't look like well there's
an index of all these words and it's
found in these particular ways and that
people because they don't have that
model they don't have anything they can
use to predict what will happen I mean
their predictions are not based on any
kind of an underlying model and so
surprising things happen to them all the
time and they just cope it doesn't stop
them from using it but we found that
this is true both our work has been with
kind of average searchers asking these
kinds of questions David Henry's work
has done something very similar with
first year computer science students and
they're not significantly different in
their imaginative models you know then a
miracle happens is kind of the nature
them oh yeah if you can either go to the
thing or I can repeat the question if
it's going to be a short run but I mean
people don't have functional models of
how a counter work what people don't
know how anything works but do you know
anything
car most popular different Frank it will
might not be able to explain colors are
changing behind Google words yet they
might have a mental model but pages yeah
well well no it's even more so than that
so yeah they do they they if you can get
them to talk about any kind of a model
it may not be that the terms have to
appear up here on the pages and things
like that they may have a as you'll see
in at least one or two examples I think
you'll see that the terms they're using
are not terms that they would
necessarily expect to appear on the page
that would resolve clearly it is related
to the idea that yes with a car you know
you know that the gas pedal makes the
car go and that brake pedal makes the
car stopped and your model isn't much
deeper than that or at least I don't
know about your model but there are
people who drive cars successfully with
a model that isn't much deeper than that
but at least in terms of articulating
the models we don't even get kind of you
know this is go this is stop kind of
models and there's certainly our
behaviors that would suggest that they
haven't thought it through even enough
to have models at that level of
complexity but they're getting along
just the way the person that only knows
that you push the accelerator or the
brake pedal gets along just fine driving
until of course they're stranded on the
freeway with a something wrong so what
might be the behavioral mole hallmarks
of an expert searcher so we've looked at
a variety of things that might represent
to you know the might distinguish those
who are more successful from those that
aren't you know time till their first
click time to result first result or
final result ability to handle the
long-term or multiple searches or keep
track of state and things like that and
those while they are you know we see
those kinds of behaviors they're not as
good at separating out the the experts
from the average searchers as you might
think an ala who is now at Google but
this is what should have her
dissertation
found in looking at expertise and among
current population that speed of query
iteration query length obviously more
experts use longer queries that's been a
consistent finding how precise their
queries are and how quickly they can
evaluate the results were the kinds of
things that she saw as consistent
differences and expert so I'm going to
tell you a little bit about a couple of
studies we've done and then how that led
to the model that we're trying to use to
continue our work and figure out how
this can impact cert so this is
something we looked at 23 searchers they
all work for Google and because of their
jobs we had reason to believe that they
ought to qualify as expert searchers and
we collected a lot of data from them
just one measure these people are doing
about eight searches a day the average
google user does about eight to nine
searches a week so at least in terms of
the amount of time they're spending
searching that's there they're clearly
serious searchers one of the things we
found is the kinds of tasks that they do
are different from the average searcher
so we have this way of classifying tasks
into categories and they're kind of what
you'd think those words would mean we
typically find that find simple and
navigate are the most common they kind
of fight for which ones on top when we
look at broader populations but these
people are you know primarily doing
these fine complex there's a single
answer but it's going to take more than
just visiting one page and finding one
sentence to get to it and the number of
explore learn is a lot higher than we
see in other samples but when you look
at the length of their searches this
curve I could produce an almost
identical curve involving average
searchers that is they're getting
they're doing more complex searches but
they're getting to the answer in about
the same amount of steps as the people
doing the simpler searches so it's that
kind of ability to focus in and get to
the answer quickly that's at least one
hallmark of their expertise
so informed by kind of some of this
stuff we went out and did a series of
field interviews with expert searchers
and so there are 27 of these people with
half of them we showed up about a week
early and we installed some software and
their computer that logged all their
searches and then part of the interview
was to go back over that week's worth of
data and have them tell us about what
they were doing what their experiences
were and then for everybody we asked
them about their typical experiences
about particularly challenging searches
they had dealt with and we gave them
some sort of tasks we've found have been
given us interesting information about
how people approach searching we
recruited them based on their describing
themselves as an expert searcher so we
went out and said we're looking for
expert searchers you think you're an
expert come talk to us we got librarians
we got people who do searching and
finding for a living so they might be
someone who does research for you know a
publication of some sort or for a law
firm or it might be one of them was
someone who was a professional organizer
and the things she had to find were
container like things for her clients
than and things to hold different types
of tchotchkes and stuff like that and so
she could find those sort of everywhere
and one example was someone who was a
you know marathon bargain hunter was not
willing to pay more than an extra five
cents for anything she bought and she
could find the lowest price on the web
anywhere an interesting thing is all
these people showed some evidence of
expert behavior things where we would go
wow you know that's impressive mixed in
with evidence of what I'll call amateur
behavior that they looked
indistinguishable from we've done a lot
of interviews before with sort of more
average searchers so there was nobody we
encountered that was sort of
consistently always looking expert and
it was kind of inside their comfort zone
they were very expert when you move them
outside of it they kind of lost some of
these skills so to give you two examples
this is from an average search or it's a
previous study so she's a schoolteacher
they're doing a unit on astronomy and
she says I need to find out where the
planets are going to be in the night sky
tonight for my class we want to be able
to find Jupiter and Mars if we can and
she types in constellations and and then
she when she looks at it oh this doesn't
seem to have anything about planets on
it so her expectation about what's going
to get her to useful pages is obviously
from her results not consistent with how
Google works now our experts search her
on the other hand I want to find an mp3
or some kind of a song for beatles to
your attendance so this isn't obviously
not somebody doing this for her day job
she's learned this in some other context
so what she's doing there is that she's
looking for pages that are directory
listings and she knows that those will
have index of as part of the title so
she's the in title attribute to look for
index of she then says I want them to be
mp3s or mp4 s or AV eyes but I don't
want HTML HTML PHP files and and then
Beatles because that's the topic she's
looking for you know this is a pattern
that she has learned but you know she's
learned it through a lot of trial and
error and has gotten good and of course
it whoa there's lots of stuff in here
she gets exactly what she's looking for
so those were kind of the the kinds of
variations we saw in people in terms of
a variety of these abilities and so this
has led to this kind of a model where
we're sort of looking at both how we can
better serve these expert users and how
we can help average users to behave like
expert users because we're giving them a
little more scaffolding so there's your
pure engine technique that's what we saw
in this last searcher you know how to
use these various operators you know
when you use double quotes you know when
to use minus there's information mapping
how do i what do i use to translate from
the way I'm currently thinking about
things to where the answer is going to
be knowing about the concept of a
reverse dictionary knowing things like
you know you may or may not
wikipedia in this domain but it's really
handy to go and learn the vocabulary and
you may find that the word you're using
that there's a synonym that's going to
produce a lot more results knowing what
kinds of things are likely to be out
there as we talked about earlier then
then there's the domain knowledge you
know what do you know about a particular
domain we had one searcher who was in
the medical field I've sort of forgotten
what is actual whether it was a doctor
or medical researcher when he was
searching on medical topics you know he
was just amazing when we gave him some
of our problems that were outside the
medical domain he just sort of seemed to
lose all those skills and wasn't able to
apply them in new topics search strategy
so this is really kind of metacognitive
skills when do you you know give up home
on strategy and shift to another when
you sort of casting a wide net when you
focus and narrow down how do you figure
out you might as well give up the
information doesn't seem to be there
assessing what you get isn't believable
there's a lot of crap out there on the
internet and how do you know whether
you've found the accurate answer to what
you're looking for how does it relate to
the thing June is it contradict what you
already know how to how do you build up
a entire coherent to answer as you get
different pieces and then there are a
lot of things around site specific
knowledge when you get to Amazon how do
you find the reviews there are various
sites will allow you to you know give
you long lists of things but you can
filter or sort them in ways that will be
more useful to you and and those are
important to know so that leads to this
as the current model that we're working
on
so the next project is this ethnography
and rapid prototyping of mobile
information services in Uganda and
that's Sean tons of Townsend and Charles
Warren where the primary people in this
one so Africa you know it's a really
different place in terms of
infrastructure particularly computing
and data infrastructure is very limited
bandwidth on the west coast of Africa
there are some undersea cables that will
actually give them access to the rest of
the world but on the East Coast they
don't even have that and the
availability of land lines and you know
just lines going from point A to point B
is very limited so both for voice and
data Mobile is really what they've got
and this is a little broader than Africa
but you know 61 percent of the mobile
phone users are in developing countries
as compared to ten percent of the
Internet users on the planet so they're
a world that's really for the
foreseeable future going to be driven by
mobile and they may be leading the way
for all of us to be doing things I'm oh
so Google puts as our mission organize
the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful and
this is sort of working on the
universally part this project actually
was primarily sean's twenty percent
projects so this is her attempt to she
did it in collaboration with google.org
and to to take a chance to do a really
interesting project that was going to
make a difference in the world or at
least so we hope so what they did they
trained 12 researchers to locals and
sent them off to 17 different locations
in Uganda trying to look for sort of
extreme locations and locations where
they might find people who the fir this
would be useful they interviewed over
200 people in four days so it was
definitely a marathon activity and they
have these people use the phone to make
queries so they interview them about
their information needs what they did
with phones and things if they had a
mobile phone of their own they asked
them to use their own phone
if they didn't because in a lot of ganda
people rent a phone for a call there's
you know somebody in the neighborhood
who has a phone and you can go and use
it for a charge then they had a phone
that they would lend to these people and
they could make queries about the
weather about agriculture or about
health those are the three categories
that they use and they got 286 queries
and this was a wizard of oz simulation
so if you're not familiar with that it's
sort of there's a man behind the curtain
this the idea and these are the men
behind the curtain the queries were real
SMS queries but they went into a station
where there are these guys and if you
see they've each got their two computers
one of which is where the SMS message is
coming in another one is they're madly
doing research where they were given a
set of sources particularly useful for
the local situation and then they type
back the answer carefully making it fit
in 160 character limit and things like
that so that's how we dealt with you
know there were no algorithms were
harmed in the doing of this experiment
it was all human being so so really
fascinating things of a list of queries
so what do i do after a snake bite you
know I have a headache and constipation
what can I do so people had lots of
really you know important questions that
they wanted to ask here are some
examples of kind of the situations and
the kinds of queries so this one they
wanted to know the weather in ginga and
the answer is second of februari hot
sunny intervals five-day forecast hot
chance of evening rain showers this one
is what like to know how Ebola is spread
in Uganda Ebola is spread through bodily
fluid contact with infected patients
dead people in primates the outbreak in
Uganda has been contained this is
actually my favorite tomato wilt I'm a
gardener I thought maybe I could learn
something about what to do about my
tomatoes and clearly a local solution to
control pests on tomatoes get human
urine ferment for two weeks add water at
a ratio of one to two mash cabbage
leaves and add to the
so that's why your tomatoes aren't doing
to help it and I'd like to know why some
people's foots are smelling yet they are
clean if your feet are still smelling
after they've been washed you may have a
fungal infection or your socks may be
dirtier damn so a wide range of
questions that we got from this and
there were a lot of insights here so
we're at the you know what are we going
to do about it stage and no products
have been released so I can't tell you
that but there was a lot of what kinds
of things were they asking that they
weren't just asking these kind of
rhetorical questions like you know when
should I get my next tetanus shot they
were asking questions that were really
immediate kinds of medical or
agricultural question questions of
immediate importance to them even in
this situation where you know they were
just a stranger comes up and says would
you like to ask the computer a question
the perceived privacy of the mobile
phone was clearly a very important asset
that they can do this in a context where
you know they wouldn't have to broadcast
it to a lot of other people we found
that there wasn't a lot of experience
with SMS even among the people who own
mobile phones that they're pretty much
because you're often calling someone who
doesn't have a mobile phone there's this
kind of you know arrangement to make
sure both of you have a phone at a
particular time that's a lot easier to
do in the voice domain than the text
domain and so they just weren't using
SMS as much there were a literacy
illiteracy is going to be an important
challenge here not all of these people
were literate particularly in English
and they spoke multiple languages
English is a second language for a lot
of them and these were the kinds of
questions that were a lot more
comfortable asking in their native
language so those were some of the
findings it was really clear that this
would be very valuable to people that
there was this was information that they
couldn't easily get by other sources
that were local to them so we're really
interested in trying to figure out what
we can do to make this available to
people
so the last project is our user activity
research so it's peter hong deepak kumar
jha hulu and ellen peterson are the
group doing this work so what they want
to do is improve the user experience by
incorporating context and in a variety
of ways so this is sort of a research
program a lot of which is just getting
started using things like relationships
between objects to help you with you
know find the things that are important
to your current tax task deal with
distractions you know there's a lot of
data that suggests we're getting
distracted multiple times a minute well
how do you turn those into something
that's useful particularly when you need
the information later on and then
looking at different ways of allocating
the workload between the computer in the
human and basing that on sort of some of
the recent neuroplasticity neuroscience
models of human memory and perception so
to sort of set the stage a typical
computer layout for probably for many of
us so this user is searching there IM
inc their blogging they're listening to
music and they just answered the phone
and google at least and probably any you
know things that we're trying to capture
information be useful as yell user
recognizes the search click but there's
all this other stuff that's going on so
how could we get a better sense of this
person's activity so as to be able to
help them either in the moment now or
later on when they're trying to figure
out what was that what was that blog
poster well that stuff i was searching
for when i was doing that blog entry or
something with that sort so the first
category is this use of these
relationships to help you find things
either that you've seen before that that
other people have seen so the data
suggests that about thirty percent of
the objects you touch are you know
electronic objects our objects you've
touched before so there's a lot of
possibility if we can figure out which
of those objects you're interested in
based on
patterns in the in the things you're
doing right now that we could be very
useful to you so they're actually paper
from the most recent I you I conference
and the recall workshop on using these
related objects and how that can be
useful to people another is relatedness
across users so using a lot of things
about your activity not to predict what
kind of news you're likely to twenty use
so it's not just in classic recommender
systems where well if you like Britney
Spears articles here are the other
people like Britney Spears articles and
what they like it's based on maybe
things like videos you watched or other
kinds of activities that you did on the
internet can we predict what kind of
news that you'll be most interested in
then the the the difference between
distraction and serendipity so when you
do get interrupted how do we help you
get back to what you're doing and how do
we help you not lose in the semantics
you know the mental sense the
information you have during the
distraction and this started from some
user research looking at what happens to
people and how they get distracted and
and what their paths through an activity
look like and so we found there was a
lot of complexity in these paths where
they looked around got a distraction
came back did worked on the same thing
distracted again which led to this
distraction which led to this
distraction I love the phrase cereal
distractions the similarity the serial
killer does not go and a lot of these
distractions are kind of outside what
the computer has access to so you may
get a phone call that's that but they
usually leave some sort of a trace on in
the activity trail so you may get a
phone call that asks what's the address
of the restaurant we're going to have
dinner tonight and you go to the website
of the the restaurant or two maps or
something like that and find
so you know if you needed to come back
and find out about that restaurant a
week later there's something there that
we could be helpful the problem is how
do we separate that out because if it
just gets sort of attached to whatever
task you were doing before then then we
just have noisier data about that task
but if we can segment it correctly we
can do something useful with that and
then another thing that's clear was
there most people set up their
workstations so they're doing one thing
at a time so every time they get
distracted they kind of have to shut
down that stuff close those windows and
open up another set of windows and is
there some way to enable the that was
kind of more graceful transitions
between them so the current project here
is called playlist and it's sort of
taking streams of events that are sort
of associated with a particular task
even though they may not be contiguous
in time and using the objects and things
that were used with that is kind of a
peripheral awareness that you could look
over and saying that this event was
related to what you're doing now and
here are some of the objects in them if
you need access to those what would you
find useful so what we'd like to be able
to do is this you know multi tasking
user here is to be able to capture all
of that information and help them be
able to do a better job so another
aspect of the same work as kind of the
approach so they're they're trying to do
this in a fairly disciplined way where
it's a multidisciplinary team of user
researchers designers and developers and
they do something that elin is calling a
collaboration contract of deciding you
know what what's the value for the user
that they're working on and then rather
than kind of being three separate mini
projects where everybody goes off with
by themselves or with other people in
their discipline and does things there
you know trying to keep it very tightly
multidisciplinary but choices of
priorities of what they're going to you
know how they're going to do things are
sort of always done with their eye on
that prize of what is it we're trying to
do for the user and that keeps everybody
focused in the same direction so the
research
are bringing ethnographic methods to
discover what the potential
opportunities are the design is sort of
being done from looking at extreme cases
that are discovered by the researchers
and you know what could we do in those
extreme cases but also starting from
fairly minimal prototypes and iterating
into something richer the developers are
committed to creating prototypes that
can be deployed in these minimalist and
iterative things so we actually actually
get user feedback at each step of the
way there things that someone could
actually use and then that's used by
everybody to help them iterate and come
up with new things in their area so the
the projects are sort of as much a test
of this methodology as they are of the
actual areas that they want to explore
so that was my whirlwind tour for you
and I can take any questions or
questions about other aspects of HCI at
Google Alyssa okay that they're there a
lot more things going on but obviously
this was as this was fairly whirlwind
can you maybe we can bring it yeah could
you bring it to her that might be the
easiest thank you sick clarification I
really like the Uganda project I thought
was really fascinating I'm you the
people who did the study divided the
topics the people could ask questions
about into agriculture health and what
was the weather was weather and do you
have a feel for which one most people
asked was it mostly health health got a
really large amount because it sort of
everybody had health questions I mean
farmers tended to have weather questions
I mean agriculture questions and weather
turned out to be an interesting thing it
really turned out to be a subtopic of
agriculture because you don't need to
ask what's the temperature going to be
like tomorrow the temperature tomorrow
is going to be the same as it was today
and six months from now it'll be the
same as it was today but rain and
extreme weather things were really
important and they're particularly
important in agricultural type settings
so that but health everybody is impacted
by healthiest
hi this is this is about the expert
versus naive users I think people are
actually very motivated to become expert
searchers and if you go to the Google
site now there's actually almost no
information on how to become an expert
searcher so I thought that's something
that could really use some research is
just how you give people some good
examples good tutorial even if you go to
the advanced search button there's very
few examples of oh here's good ideas for
you know how to think about your problem
and become an expert searcher and I know
a lot of people in the tech industry
think well no one ever reads user
manuals but that's actually not true if
you look at the statistics people over
time actually do get around to being
motivated a lot of problems to become
good and then they tell their friends
and so on so I think there's yeah I'm
not or tunity not just look at the
software but to essentially look at the
documentation and I we agree i mean that
was partly to sort of understand where
were the opportunities to provide help
in a interesting place to go is that
while Google doesn't have a lot of help
and it's kind of a historical thing of
kind of wanting it's sort of to force
the engineers in the direction of no you
can't release this feature by saying I
know it's hard but I'll put it in the
documentation you know assume there will
be no documentation and make it usable
at that level so whether we found the
right sweet spot that is always
debatable but you'll find on things like
YouTube and other places videos that
teach you how to do things with google
search and there are these you'll find
them in people's blogs they're just lots
of places you can go now they're not
well aggregated but yeah I think the
fact that there's kind of a cottage
industry in helping people become better
searchers is definitely evidence that
what you say is true sort of following
up on that question there's a lot of
research in the cognitive psychology and
education literature on this a novice
expert shift and one of the main things
I know that I've heard there is this
so-called self explanation effect that
if you get students to really explain to
themselves why did they get these
results and try to get them to think
deeper about it that that's one of the
best
things that they found in terms of
trying to convert people from novices
Dexter I'm just curious within this sort
of you know web search environments
anyone has ever tried that sort of thing
or looked into that literature for clues
on even heard people from novice to
expert not as a manipulation we
certainly see people when they're trying
to explain to us why they got the
results they did kind of getting new ins
insights so a common thing we've seen is
that the minus operator tells you I
don't want that word and people put a
space between the minus and the the word
afterwards and it does essentially
nothing if you do that and and they will
then tell us that this is what it's
doing completely ignoring initially the
evidence that that word is bolded on the
page that and you know that those kinds
of in those circumstances you know we've
seen several people have these aha
moments of well I guess it isn't working
and then why isn't it but as a
manipulation we sort of haven't figured
out it's not like we can send a
researcher to everybody's home for an
hour a month or so to help them get
better so but Dan who does this work one
of his side projects as he goes around
to the local schools and either teaches
the students or the teachers how to
become better searchers because there
are a lot of teachers out there teaching
bad searching and you know this is sort
of the equivalent of the teachers who
have to teach basic computer skills who
were not exposed to them in any
systematic way and are perpetuating
those things well the same thing is
happening for searching so so in that
kind of overtly teach the teachers we we
are doing that in a exploratory way but
yeah figuring out what we might be able
to do that's kind of very much in the
moment enables people to recognize that
they have because part of that
explanation is being directly being able
to recognize the difference between what
you wanted and what you got and often
people will say I want to X they show us
the search result page is full of y and
they say see it worked
yeah that that makes it much more
challenging oh they're more questions or
comments Gary well we want them Mike
mm-hmm this kind of collaboration
contract the collaboration contracts
hear that Elin has man that's a very
appealing idea to those of us who've
been in a chain for a long time it is
they're starting to permeate the culture
here I mean it's a very strong
engineering culture yes aha and it's not
a very different kind of idea about how
to do anything so she's done it with two
project teams and I think one of them
has gotten far enough along that they're
sort of starting to do it themselves
that is you know not not just kind of do
what they're told but kind of bring
ideas to the table in meetings where
she's not there it sort of tends to
continue its it's a I know that labor
intensive is a while but it takes a
while to sell people so it'll be
interesting to see if over a couple of
years of doing this whether this spreads
at Google cuz it you're right it's not
the traditional Google way of doing
how did for us on the Uganda project get
funded it's just curious to know you
mentioned that it was said 21 of the
twenty percent projects and that's it's
a wonderful project but it required
quite a lot of resources to actually get
it done in the field there so how does
something like that happen at Google
well so this one had a couple of
partnerships some of which I can't
completely tell you about but one of
them was with Google org and so
certainly her time was just that's part
of the twenty percent and and her you
know flights going over there and stuff
like that we're funded out of her
organization and thus far we are not so
budget constrained that saying what you
can do this twenty percent project but
you've gotta you know fly to a ganda on
your own it has not been an issue but
the training the other researchers and
those things that are significant dollar
outlay that was sort of a collaboration
among several partners and I'm guessing
that google.org funded it although I
don't you know as at least the money
parts of it there were people
contributed their time from from the
partner organizations
well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
