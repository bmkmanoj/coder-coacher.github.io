there's my mic okay how many of you all
have been to Burning Man before raise
your hand all right how many is are you
gonna go for the first year cool how
many of you have been to Burning Man
before have cooked at Burning Man okay
so this will be nice and educational for
everybody you know it's not easy you
know it's a little bit different from
regular camping so my name is Mira Cohen
I'm a sous-chef newly sous-chef at Cafe
150 I was at cafe five and Charlie's and
catering and and I'm like well plate I
work at Charlie's cafe doing admin stuff
all those menus and everything else so
today we're gonna split this in two
parts I'm gonna cover the hardware
issues basically setting up your cooking
space and the equipment you need and
chef Marie here is gonna cover all the
software issues basically all your food
how you cook it so let's get started
what's different out there mm-hmm a lot
of things are different but mainly
what's parts of cooking number of
factors yep consider the heat it gets
hot during the day temperatures up to
what 110 somewhere around there it will
spoil foods really fast if you're not
prepared the dust the dust just blows
everywhere gets in everything you got
protect your food yeah protect your
living space unless you want to eat more
dust than you usually do you got no
electricity unless of course you bring a
generator but that's a whole nother set
of problems we're gonna assume for the
most part you don't have electricity no
running water same idea you got to bring
everything in and on there's also the
opposite end of things when you dump
your water you have to save it once you
wash out things it's contaminated and
you're just not allowed to dump it on
the playa so you got to keep up great
water which is uh we're gonna cover that
later pack in pack out the general ethic
of the thing you got to bring everything
you need and you got to take out all the
trash you make
and time constraints you do not want to
be spending all day cooking in your
kitchen there's so many other fun things
to do but you still want to put in
enough time do eat well so what do you
need to set up your kitchen
first of all protection against the dust
needs some sort of shelter a tent the
truck the two main options are a carport
it's a thing they sell at a Costco and
number of other places it's basically a
giant tent for your car it's they're
cheap they're great easy to set up you
just got to remember to secure them
properly last year was anyone around
last year do you remember the dust storm
on Wednesday yeah some of our stuff went
flying and one of our poles crashed
through the windshield of a neighboring
camps man that was a knife on safety
same idea secure everything and make
sure you're prepared in case of fire
fire extinguishers are very important
otherwise it's just your basic kitchen
these you need some area to chop up your
stuff prep up your stuff cook it you
need storage zone to keep everything in
order and seating it's good because you
if you're cooking for a group of people
you all want to sit together have some
dinner so I'm gonna show you how my camp
set up its kitchen last year it's called
you are that pig we had a pretty good
operation going we were feeding 50
people for the whole week actually nine
days cuz we were there early and I'll
just show you how it's done this is shot
from inside our kitchen first thing I
want to point out is the other mess in
all these shots this was taken about
Thursday or Friday and it's just an
inevitable fact of life there that it's
utter chaos so the more you prepare the
better organized you are at the start
the less headaches you'll have later
specifically pointing out we have a nice
little picnic bench table some benches
and a pantry set up just basically milk
crates all wired together and we found
these old cabinets that were pretty
useful as other food storage
this is a shot of our prep area some
things to note here basically our prep
tables a special thing we have it was a
propane powered refrigerator we don't
expect you to find any but if you can
get your hands on one there oh they're
so good it took basically a 1/5 gallon
tank of propane for the whole week so as
long as you watch yourself like don't
open it too much same thing applies to
coolers just only open them when you
need them otherwise you're gonna be
letting in heat unnecessarily we also
have our kitchen sink setup here we have
a detailed shot after that this is our
kitchen sink basically a table the whole
cutting out in it little pot here that
drains down to a large 50 gallon bucket
in which our gray water was collected
all the nasty food particles and soap
and stuff you just don't want to dump it
now we got this pump pocket that allowed
a pretty high pressure spray that made
dishes clean dishes pretty early oh it
should note please clean your pots and
pans and dishes as soon as possible
because the dry environment makes things
very crusty and hard very quickly so
it's just a little bit of work but it'll
save you a lot more down the line and
going back here there's another shot of
our prep table and this is what we
mainly use our burner just your standard
camp stove some other options I'll be
talking about later we put together a
chore list it's pretty essential when
you have a lot of people and you don't
know who's gonna do what work you can't
really assign these things beforehand
because again you don't know where
people are gonna be so we just had a
list and people filled in their names as
they felt it was necessary to volunteer
fairs tasks like prep cooking cleanup
everything else
this is what we use for our garbage
collection we set up a little wooden
frame with six large trash cans
underneath and you can't really read it
from here about they're labeled trash
plastics aluminum glass plutonium and
burner bowls yeah it's good to separate
it out because there's a number you know
plutonium is very dangerous and
otherwise you're gonna have to be
sorting through them later
specifically cans you want to separate
out because those you can dispose of on
playa there is a specific camp that does
that all the recyclables you have to
take with you oh what's not pictured
here is a little innovation we came up
called the drying rack we're not sure if
we're the first to think of it basically
take two screens with wooden frames you
put two hinges on one side and a latch
on the other you put any wet food scraps
like melon rinds or mostly vegetable
scraps put them in there you put them in
the morning by afternoon it's gonna be
completely desiccated lost a lot of the
weight it'll be easier to pack out it's
not gonna be rotting in your trashcan
all day this is our evaporation pool
pretty essential I mean you have to have
one if you want a shower but we also set
one up underneath our coolers because we
noticed there's like a thing there can
be leakage problems if you have some old
coolers and dpw really hates you if they
discover a giant pool of water leaking
out from under your kitchen tent Oh
Department of Public Works those are the
not familiar they are dangerous folks
the people who clean up all your stuff
the week after and they build Burning
Man so yeah you know before all this
happens it's just Playa just what you
see on the ground that's it there's
nothing there there's no plants there's
no mountains there's no nothing so they
build
they build a city which becomes the
third largest city in Nevada for the
week so they're kind of particular about
what you do to their city and then they
clean up after you so it will send them
ownership of the place yeah be nice to
them give them gifts yeah
bribe them okay so let's just start
covering the hardware what you need to
bring i'm just going to cover in general
because basically bring everything you
need to make your meals that you're
planning there's no real need to bring
just everything in your kitchen because
it's just too much stuff to drink so
basically you again need your cooking
plants your pots or pans your spatulas
tongs everything else we need to
physically put the stuff on the heat you
need the heat itself grills are nice if
you have the space and capacity to bring
them because they're great for all sorts
of summer cooking they cook things fast
burners pretty much essential because
you cook in your rice chili anything
else you want to cook on a table have to
have it there's some other options we're
gonna cover later two coolers again very
essential some things to keep in mind I
did mention that you shouldn't open them
as much as possible also you need to
label them so you don't have to open
them exactly you can it helps to
separate them out like this is the meal
cooler this is our drinks cooler this is
our snacks cooler and you know don't
open this till this day also ice runs
they they don't sell anything on the
playa except for ice and coffee two
essentials of life so don't forget to
reais the coolers like by Wednesday
you're totally you know conked out and
you just forget everything and there's
gonna go bad so if you have something
that's been there since the beginning
don't forget to spill out the nasty
water and put new ice in there yes your
prep equipment just basically knives and
boards and bowls that you mix everything
up in and chop it all up
oh no specifically does anyone own
really fancy nice
anyone I really wouldn't recommend
bringing them a better option you go to
a kitchen supply store I'd also
recommend getting most everything else
you need there don't places like sur La
Table and Pottery Barn they're great for
pretty things to have around your
kitchen and they do salt the good stuff
but it's not the stuff you want to bring
out here Restaurant Supply stores
they're all about the utility they're
just it's tough doubt and they also sell
these stamp knives that run around like
ten to twenty dollars they're pretty
good it'll last you a week so you know
yeah same idea you need you know you're
serving utensils your platters your
bowls your spoons bring some extra in
case you get some extra gas or people
forget there is because everybody
forgets this storage you want to put all
you you want to minimize the packaging
that you bring because otherwise just
creates more trash it really helps
beforehand to repack everything and in
more convenient containers Tupperware
and all the imitators are very useful
because it seals against the dust
cartons milk crates
those are great for perishables that you
want to breathe sink in washing you can
set up a little sink like we showed you
before
another option is just having a bucket
you do your washing in there and then
you put it in your vet in your
evaporation pool later or into another
bucket and last but certainly not least
fire suppression you should always
always always in any kitchen where
you're using a flame heat any type have
a fire extinguisher please okay dealing
with the garbage like I said alright
covered consolidate your packaging less
in less out there's two types of
recyclables the again like I mentioned
Burning Man
only takes cans everything else you're
gonna have to pack out dry garbage again
keep it separate you can put the stuff
you dried out in your drying rack in the
dry garbage your wet nasty compost your
waste water
drying racks and like I mentioned before
secure those cans you don't want them
toppling over make sure they have a lid
so uh I'm just gonna sum up with some
favorite little bits of equipment this
thing is called the cassette foo it's
pretty standard in the catering industry
if you're looking for a new stove
actually would not recommend those large
bulky camp stoves these things are much
cheaper much lighter they run off these
little cartridges of fuel that are
actually pretty cheap and they're just
very convenient they pack up in a little
suit case like this my favorite of all
cookware the cast iron pan does anyone
know in one of these all right good
people if you're getting a new one
remember to follow the seasoning
instructions basically have to oil it
put in a hot oven until it forms a nice
coat these are great out there because
you don't need soap to clean them all
you have to do is sprinkle some kosher
salt rub a paper towel put another layer
oil on it you're done they withstand so
much abuse and they still love you I
love them they won't go flying away
either oh and also it's great for
cooking itself too because uh they're
thick they're heavy they retain a lot of
heat so dishes where you want to get a
nice sear on something like any sort of
meat you grow on a steak some chicken
this is gonna do a much better job baby
those like thin little flimsy pans you
might have lying around ah the French
press my favorite method of making
coffee
some people are fans of the drip hot
method where you can get a little filter
or drip pot and just pour your hot water
over but this is great - you just put
you have some pre-ground coffee and put
it in it's also good for tea
this is what you want to get a little
bit extravagant ah it's called the soda
siphon it runs off a co2 cartridge and
it just puts out fresh seltzer it's
great for just you know there's exotic
little bubbly drinks it's a fun little
luxury to have blenders this is only if
you have a generator obviously those are
great not just for your standard
margaritas and ice drinks but for sweets
- gazpacho is lovely out there and also
if you have electricity this is great
the crock-pot so many slow cooked dishes
it just involves a combined a number of
items put it in their way to bathe it
wait about eight hours and you know no
hassle good deal so I believe that ties
up my end of the hardware I'm gonna pass
it on to Murray to cover uh food issues
alright so we'll have a little time for
questions afterwards in case you guys
are wondering so food what do you need
to eat when you're out there this is
really really important it could mean
the difference between a good experience
on the playa and a very very bad
experience on the playa you are
responsible for taking care of yourself
out there nobody else will so make sure
in this hot weather active lifestyle
that you have light fresh food lots of
water and they recommend bringing two
and a half gallons per person per day
for all of your needs washing your
yourself your pots and pans and cooking
um low volume less is more make sure
that what you bring is nutrient dense
power bars and stuff like that are good
but there's other kinds of things I'll
talk about in a minute and spicy is good
and you just will will like it out there
it's hot think about you know how I know
in Chinese medicine it's well known that
spicy foods bring your heat to the
surface so initially you feel hot but
then you're actually cooled down
there you go and balanced starches
veggies proteins
okay you're gonna bring starches
everybody will because you're like oh
what's easy to bring some snacks and
bread some you know pasta or whatever
some vegetables I'll throw them in there
mmm I don't know meats kind of hard to
keep cool okay I was in a camp that
neglected protein I nearly killed myself
after three days and had to beg for
tacos from next door so don't forget
your protein it's really important out
there to have a completely balanced diet
me is actually one of the easiest things
to cook out there because you don't have
to really season it that much for it to
taste good if you're a vegetarian
I'll talk about some other things you
can do but if you're not bringing meat
trust me you're gonna want it okay so
what we're talking about here is how to
make this easy on you okay you want to
be able to enjoy the experience of
Burning Man so you know if you really
love to cook that's one thing but if you
want to free yourself up so you can do
everything else we're gonna talk about
how to do that okay so there's four ways
one bring things that don't need to be
prepared or really easily prepared to
remember to bring things on your arrival
date that are fresh and ready to go so
you can enjoin that day subsequent days
other as people come in they can bring
them things that are prepared in advance
and reheated on the playa and then of
course there's real cooking so I'm gonna
go through these one by one okay no
hassle foods so we're not the first
people to discover living in the desert
it's been done for quite a while so I
kind of thought of that and think well
what do people who live in the desert
eat they've probably figured this out
before so I have pictures of some things
prickly pears they grow on cacti they
will stay well out at room temperature
dates those grow in the desert preserved
items like olives pickles all kinds of
pickled vegetables preserved meats like
salami
beef jerky that sort of thing and
breads flatbread I'd survive better than
kind of your fresh fluffy breads so also
hard breads like you know pumpernickel
or German rye or things like that okay
so things bring a lot a lot of things
that are ready to eat these are all
things that don't require any cooling at
all so if you don't really have an
advanced camp like with the whole big
kitchen and everything you can you can
live on this kind of stuff sturdy fruits
and vegetables like potatoes onions and
even a lot of fruit really can go at
room temperature and then there's also a
thing drag
okay so she asked if if you're going for
a short period of time can you survive
on this stuff alone yeah I think so
you know really think it out and make
sure you're gonna have enough for the
whole time but I would stress if you're
gonna do that the preserved meats and
the pickled vegetables so that you get
your your vegetable matter and all that
kind of stuff what else did I miss oh
just to note we provided details all of
these things they're all in the head in
the handout yeah okay so other things
that are no hassle like things that
maybe need to be in your cooler like
hummus or salsa or cheese yogurt those
are all ready to eat but you have to
keep them cool okay yep so there's more
information in in the packet don't
forget your staples
don't forget your drinks obviously water
but there's the handsome smoothies or
other kind of canned juice drinks or box
juices they also package milk in boxes
non-perishable milk even in little ones
so you can have a serving at a time
throw a couple and your cooler in the
morning you know whenever you need it
that later that day or the next day you
have cold milk and in the packet I
actually the question you ask think you
can't have a satisfying meal with only
these items guess again here you go
sliced cured meats with pickles olives
mustard hummus and flatbread served with
mint tea cheese and crackers with honey
dried and fresh fruit dates nuts
couscous with tomatoes beans lemon juice
and a side of yogurt avocado corn tomato
bean onion salad with lemon juice and
olive oil with a side of chips and salsa
slow roasted onions and potatoes those
are easy if you have a grill wrap them
up in foil throw them in there slow cook
them yummy or you can even just find a
burn pit out on the playa somewhere and
you know throw your onions in there hot
oatmeal another cereal with a bananas
nuts dried fruit honey those are all
nutrient dense meals that you can have
okay bringing it in fresh foods don't
last long but they're appreciated so on
your first day bring a burrito with you
that you stuck got you know in Reno or
something like that or sandwiches or
something that you will last until
you're ready for dinner that night you
will not be ready with your kitchen and
even if you're bringing one you won't be
ready with it that night okay and then
say you get there on Sunday but you have
friends coming on Monday Tuesday
Wednesday or maybe even Thursday remind
them to bring you some fresh food it's
all appreciated it's easy for them it's
taken care of
assign meals don't just suggest so if if
you're part of a community at Burning
Man and you're not just taking care of
your own personal food how many people
is this true up for this coming Burning
Man you're in a community okay it's
really important people are depending on
you and you're depending on them to get
your nutrients so like I gave you the my
camp kind of forgot about protein
because we all assigned you know
different people to different days but
we didn't really check on what those
people were cooking and three of them
chose pasta with sauce and that's it
so really assign the meals make sure
that they're nutritionally balanced make
sure you're covered okay and in fear I'm
sure about your group bring enough for
yourself to just to take care of
yourself prepare before and reheat this
is a really easy way to have a good
satisfying meal do everything you can at
home so either you know in the weeks
leading to Burning Man make some extra
food when you cook at home or have a
cooking for Burning Man party with your
friends or camp mates beforehand prepare
a bunch of stuff that's you know keeps
well and then freeze it you can cool it
and then if you have access to a cryovac
machine that works wonders or just
ziplock bags you know double it up or
even tougher where it will defrost quite
easily on the playa and then you heat it
up in a pot you're good to go one thing
one of the people in my camp did last
year that was I thought was awesome was
they ordered Indian takeout and froze
that it was so good
so you know you don't even have time to
cook order takeout so and then pre-cuts
that there on the left that that's a you
know restaurant set up for pre-cut for
you know it's called Mason class with
everything everything in its place
beforehand so that will easier time on
the playa of preparation but some things
there might be more perishable so if
you're gonna pre-cut things make sure
you pack it really well and cool it
properly and all the other things you
need to do to it but if you're gonna do
that it's good to bring things that are
prepared for you the real deal okay so
you want to go to Burning Man and have a
gourmet meal that was my idea my second
year I spent the entire time cooking and
I had I had a lot of fun but I didn't
want to do it ever again but if you're
gonna do it and it's really appreciated
if you do you know maybe even just one
day you're there or you did something
you do for your camp or for your
community we just want to spend one day
going all out prepare okay make sure you
have your ingredients your equipment
your balanced nutrition and the time to
do it and the labor to do it okay um you
know don't don't try to do it all
yourself if it's a hard job make sure
you have people are gonna help you prep
everything you can in advance package
and organize if you're not totally sure
about what you're doing bring some
recipes spread out the work in the
packet I have some menu ideas they're
basically the things I made that year
that I cooked all weekend there's plenty
of other things you can do though I've
seen all sorts of stuff happen there or
pancake breakfast is also pretty easy
you know pancake breakfast bacon bacon
on the ply is delicious yeah so it's
just some things I don't recommend pasta
well it's tempting because it's so easy
it produces a lot of waste water so you
know do it if you want to but just think
about the fact that you're gonna be
producing a lot of waste water and fish
you know fish really smells bad if it
goes bad you can do it you can bring
fresh fish
you do wrap it really well in several
layers of plastic or better yet cryovac
it and cook it quickly on the first
night or so don't recommend sushi on the
playa people like to do it even if it's
good it kind of doesn't taste good in
the hot weather so you know just think
about those things think about am I
going to want to eat this when I'm
sitting there really really hot and you
know is there gonna be a lot of stuff I
have to throw away afterwards so get
cooking so if you have any questions you
could go back to the microphone over
there we'll do our best answer and we'll
open floor two if someone else has a
better answer I have a really random
question and it is working or not but
one of the people I'm camping with wants
to actually like try and baked goods and
some wondering if you've ever even had
any experience is like trying to bake
stuff on the playa bake yeah Wow certain
baked goods keep better than others
you mean baked on the flyer bring baked
goods to the slicer okay actually I have
a good answer for you remember that
question about what if people who live
in the desert eat flatbread on a hot
stone it's their search for it it's
really easy I've made it and like as
like a little you know Scout kind of
lesson it's you know flour water salt on
a hot flat stone pita bread oh just to
provide details for any sort of baked
goods the rule of thumb is the more
moist it is the less long it's going to
last so dry our cookies like biscotti
are going to last you the whole week
chewy cookies a few days the microphone
is fat something okay yeah
yeah there you go excellent you
suggested I'm just repeating the
question to get it on camera
he suggested skillet breads like
cornbread in the cast-iron skillet and
dumplings be dumped in stew both
excellent ideas so you mentioned that
Isis teal and ice and coffee is the only
thing that's sold around and can use dry
ice or is that yeah I've done that
before where I before I leave pack a
little bit of dry ice and every cooler
and it keeps your ice lasting longer but
it actually doesn't last that long once
you get there so if you're gonna use it
you know bigger pieces of it be careful
um you can but if they don't sell dry
ice there do you have any anything
another thing I don't know much about
okay the whole event so what is an
evaporation pool it's basically a good
way to get rid of your water without
dumping it directly on the playa let's
get back to the basically you lay out a
large sheet of plastic put up a number
of two by fours to provide an edge to it
oh there we go
so you just the water spreads out and
it's so hot and dry there that it pretty
much goes pretty fast if you have a lot
of water it will eventually build up and
you have to stop using it but otherwise
it's a good deal we actually had a
little innovation in which we added
these little rocks and towels here that
just increases decreases the evaporation
time like little wakes actually I wanted
to add one thing about another way to
make your kitchen there's the carport
what I've done in years past if you're
going with a big camp and you bring a
truck we had a big you know eight
wheeler or something like that we once
we unpacked the truck with all our stuff
we turned our truck into the kitchen it
was really good it was kind of like a
galley kitchen on a submarine or
something like that yeah so like if you
imagine inside that truck you know we
set up everything in there that way you
if there is a wind storm or you're cold
or whatever you can just shut the door
make sure you have lighting in there but
it's really really the best protected
area that you can have it's out of the
Sun we kept all our coolers in the back
of the truck or water in the back of the
truck and then just had tables against
the wall with our heating elements and
our milk crate pantry and that sort of
thing
question so I'm sorry I missed the first
part of your talk wondering if you have
any experience using solar ovens or Sun
ovens in the desert you know I haven't
had experience using them but I've
looked into them they're great for
things that you want to just heat up if
you want to bake something to a specific
temperature they're actually a very bad
idea
because lots of baking is depending on a
specific temperature and you can't
really control that but again they're
great if you just have something frozen
you wanna get to hotness there is a camp
called the alternative energy camp at
Burning Man every year so they could
probably help you've asked them there
there's a plenty of other camps who are
using alternative energy as well so yeah
for those of you who haven't been before
one of the most striking things about
Burning Man is for a city with no Public
Works like electricity the light at
night will really amaze you it's like
crazier than Las Vegas neon lights
everywhere so you know there are ways
oh also about those solar ovens there's
a much cheaper solution to the solar
oven instead of buying one so I called
your dashboard it gets hot your car yeah
there's a cookbook out there dashboard
cooking you know so there is oh yeah yes
sir I was curious about how to how long
meat keeps in a cooler how to watch out
for spoiling or you know by the end of
the week making sure you don't poison
yourself okay basically just just like
you would in your refrigerator as long
as you keep the keep it in the right
environment so a couple things well you
know the ice is gonna melt eventually so
and it's not gonna be contained in a bag
if you try and put it in a bag so keep
your food raised off the bottom of the
cooler especially meat if it is at the
bottom with the the water it's just
it's gonna leak into the plastic somehow
and make it soggy unless you cryovac it
which is really the best thing but
raising it up somehow putting putting
something down at the bottom that like a
little piece of Tupperware or something
that you can raise it up to the level of
the melted ice better yet to really
empty the water every day and to make
sure it's packed with new ice probably
every you could get away with every
other day but even everyday if you're
particularly concerned about the meat
and would like a if you bought say a
steak at the beginning of the week would
it be safe by the end of the week I'm
just not sure what the usual keep time
is hmm it's probably raw meats are
probably not going to last till the
seven days one thing especially watch
out for is a pork that will spoil unless
it's like a cured salami or whatever the
pork spoils faster than beef and uh
chickens somewhere in the middle yeah
but you it should it should be okay for
the you know most of the week if you
really don't you treat it properly and I
keep talking about cryo backing but
that's gonna make think make it last
even longer you can also freeze it
before you leave so it goes into your
cooler frozen takes a longer time to
defrost and then you know stays even
longer but always you know give your
meat a good sniff before you start
prepping does anybody else have
experience and we want to add to that no
okay any other questions yes sir did you
have a question
yeah the saying he's saying the solar
ovens don't get hot enough to boil water
so again only good for reheating things
not a disinfecting does anybody else
have a question yeah so I'm not a
relatively healthy person I guess sense
of eating what happens if somebody gets
really sick at the event there is a
medical staff on-site they're all
volunteer so when you get there make
sure you look at your map and find out
where the medical staff is and they will
take care of you there's first-aid if
it's serious they'll ship you out so
yeah there is medical stuff there but I
would recommend not getting sick yeah
so there she just said there's gonna be
a Q&amp;amp;A session for Google burners to get
together sometime next week yeah
right
very quiet
yeah so they were saying do bring your
own first aid because the first day they
have there isn't it's not like a
hospital that they're just there to
evaluate you if you're gonna be able to
you know stay or go to the hospital
off-site so definitely bring your own
first aid don't forget that your
prescriptions enough to last you and an
extra keep them in two places things
like that it's good to go with the
doctor to we like to do that it's even
better to camp with the doctor yeah
that's what I say
any other questions okay we have
handouts at the front if we run out just
let us know and thank thanks everybody
