name is Dan Reicher I'm director of
climate change and energy initiatives
for google.org very pleased to have
David Victor here today to talk about
renewable electricity cheaper than coal
particularly the coal side of that
equation and I'll get to David's
background in a second but just for a
brief background re less than C
renewable electricity cheaper than coal
is a google initiative that we launched
in January focused on as it as the
formula indicates lowering the cost of
renewable electricity to make it cheaper
than coal which in our view is what it's
going to take if renewable electricity
is really going to take its appropriate
role in our mix in the US and worldwide
in it and the initiative has several
elements to it an RD piece we've got a
group of engineers at Google now working
on some of these challenges and some of
them are here today an investment
component we've made several investments
in renewable energy related companies
particularly those with very promising
technologies that can take us down the
renewable electricity cost curve the
third is the area of policy we're
working on in particular on policy
opportunities in Washington and we'll be
making some announcements about those in
the next couple of months and the fourth
is information tools what we can do with
our own Google tools to really put a
spotlight on renewable electricity to
get to consumers to get to investors to
get to policymakers and influence the
sort of changes we need to see to really
realize the benefits of renewable
electricity most of our focus has been
on the re side of the re less than C
equation what's exciting about today's
talk by David Victor is we're going to
hear about the status of coal where we
are with coal the global supplies where
we see coal technology headed because
ultimately we can do some on the re side
but we've obviously also got to be very
focused on what's happening to the price
of coal as well in this in this
competitive landscape David is a
professor of law at Stanford Law School
and also directs the program on energy
and sustainable development
his current research focuses on the role
of state-controlled oil companies in the
oil market on the design of effective
strategies for protecting the global
climate and the emerging global market
for coal he's also an adjunct senior
fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations where he was senior advisor to
the council's Task Force on climate
change and leads study groups on
improving management of the nation's 50
billion dollar strategic oil reserve and
on devising foreign policy strategy for
regulation of geoengineering it's an
author of many many books numerous
articles as PhD is from from MIT in
political science and international
relations and as a BA from Harvard in
history and science he also has one of
the coolest pair of glasses in Silicon
Valley it is my great pleasure to
introduce David Victor thank you Dan
thanks to the Google team to invite me
to come and talk about heavy iron if you
like the heavy iron in the energy system
we're doing a bunch of work at this
program that I lead at Stanford and
really no single person can do justice
to it so I'm going to talk a little bit
today about what we're doing generally
and then in the QA introduce my
colleagues Varun rye Richard Morris and
Jeremy Carl who are working in much
greater depth on particular parts of
this research and are the true experts
you're in the middle of this
extraordinary initiative re is less than
C and we started asking some questions
about what's going on with C because
there's a relationship here and I think
you're going to be surprised in some
cases shocked with what's happening on
the right hand side of this relationship
think of this as a dog chasing a bus and
you're re initiative is feeding the dog
with some steroids to help a catch up to
the bus I want to talk about the bus
what's happening with the with the bus
I'm part of a research group that works
on a wide range of topics and that we
call the political economy of energy
market so it's about the political legal
and institutional aspects of energy
systems much of our work is in the
emerging markets Brazil China India
Mexico and South Africa up on the screen
here you see the list of topics that
we've been working on a range of
electricity and natural gas markets to
the role of state oil companies in the
world oil market and now our newest
initiative is to get academics focusing
on coal coal really matters not only
because it's it's the right hand side of
your equation but it is in essentially
all of the world's largest economies
it's the dominant part of the energy
system this country it's 51 percent of
all the electricity that we generate is
from call in China and India the
fractions or even or even higher so
we're doing a bunch of work to model the
global coal market today and in the
future and try and understand where coal
prices come from what might happen to
call what the future of coal is in a
carbon constrained world if we really
get serious about cutting greenhouse gas
emissions I'm going to talk broadly
about two things in this talk the first
one is what's going on with the coal
markets themselves and the role of co2
prices co2 carbon dioxide the leading
human cause of climate change and and
how co2 affects the viability of coal
and then I'm gonna talk a little bit
about new coal technologies and about
the prices and costs of those
technologies that is the ultimate target
in your own re as lesson see initiative
is to make re reliably less expensive
than coal based technologies
first let me talk a little a little bit
about coal price formation where to coal
prices come from because as Dan
mentioned in his introduction we need to
know what the price of coal is going to
be if we're going to understand the
relationship and the competitiveness of
renewable energy where the coal prices
come from and what are the patterns in
in coal prices this slide here shows you
the price of the three major fossil
fuels in the main trading markets in the
world over time back to nineteen ninety
five up to the present day the vertical
axis is is perhaps a little bit
unfamiliar it's a dollars per million
btu million btu is the main unit for for
heat of fuels and so what we've done is
we've taken all these different fuels
and converted them into common heat
units so that we can normalize for the
differences in the heat content between
a barrel of oil and a ton of coal and a
cubic foot of natural gas what we see on
the top is the price of oil than the
price of natural gas and the price of
various coals there isn't yet a global
market for natural gas but one is
emerging and there is not yet a global
market for coal but there are several
different coals that are traded
internationally and I'll talk more about
that in a little bit as everybody knows
the price of oil has risen quite sharply
in the last five to six years for a
variety of reasons I'd be happy to talk
about in the Q&amp;amp;A period what's
interesting though in my view is that
natural gas has followed oil to higher
prices that's because for some
applications gas and will compete
directly with each other and in most of
the world natural gas bulk natural gas
is traded on contracts that are indexed
to the price of oil which means that as
we develop an integrated global market
for natural gas when the price of oil
rises as the price of natural gas Rises
that helps explain the phenomenon we're
going to be trying to understand today
which is why is the price of coal risen
and as you've seen in the last roughly
year and a half the price of coal has
risen dramatically roughly a factor of
three depending on which market you're
in so so already the dog is catching up
to the bus mainly for reasons that have
nothing to do with the dog and a lot to
do with the bus and the bus as
competitors
in a nutshell what's happening here is
that because of oil prices rise and
therefore gas prices rise not constrict
lien lockstep but broadly gas becomes
less competitive with coal and that
raises the demand for coal and therefore
the coal is becoming more expensive now
let's talk a little more detail about
the potential demand for coal looking
out into the future because that will
give us a sense of what coal prices
might be like in the future and that's
ultimately one of the things we really
care a lot about when we talk about re
is less than C let me talk about coal
demand the first thing that's that is
extraordinary and I apologize on behalf
of the energy modeling community that
this is news but it is always news and
you will read about it periodically in
the newspaper which is the models we use
for projecting total demand for fuels in
the world's system are very slow to
catch up to reality and the reality over
the last few years has been the oil
prices and therefore gas prices have
been rising every time the major
modeling groups update their models that
are used to project future consumption
of the major fossil fuels and other
sources of energy every time in the last
few years they've updated their models
two things have happened that are
interesting one of them is their
expectations for the consumption of
energy in China rye or even higher than
they expected before I'll talk about
that in a second and the other one is
that their expectation about the role of
coal in the world energy system become
more and more bullish or if you're
worried about co2 bearish but they but
their projection of the role of coal in
the world energy system Rises and that's
because natural gas prices are rising
and when you tell these models about
ever higher price of natural gas they
solve in ways that that in effect put
more coal in the world's energy system
that means if you're worried about co2
which which is the coal is the most
carbon intensive of fossil fuels it
submits the most carbon dioxide global
warming gas per unit energy if you're
worried about co2 ironically the rise in
oil prices has actually been bad news
for the co2 problem it's encouraged more
efficiency because when fuel is more
expensive people conserve
but the opposite has happened in the
electric power sector it is concurrent
in most of the world actually a swing
back in the direction of coal making
kool arguably more competitive and this
slide just underscores the problem these
are snapshots three times in history the
year two thousand four on the left two
thousand six in the middle and two
thousand eight on the right showing the
total projected world consumption of
energy from major sources out in the
year twenty twenty so this is if you
like this is a way of checking to see
how consistent the energy modeling
community is and what you see is back in
2004 where the models more or less
didn't know about what was going on then
but knew that gas was cheap because they
were using data from the late 1990s they
projected that the role of coal in the
world market would be relatively smaller
than what they project today natural gas
they were very enthusiastic about and as
gas prices have risen the role of coal
the expected role of coal has continued
to rise even higher so in some sense is
that it is actually getting harder to
unseat coal due to the high prices of
oil and natural gas let's unpack this in
a little more detail one piece of
conventional wisdom is that well maybe
the prices are favoring coal but at
least in the United States for example
you can't actually cite a coal plant
because if somebody tries to build a
coal-fired power plant the local
neighbors are going to organize an
opposition and they're going to take you
to court and so on so this is from a
study just released a couple weeks ago
that has been tracking every single coal
plant in the country over the last
roughly decade and a half and what it
shows this slide here just shows for
coal plants what it shows our announced
projects the tallest bars and it shows
projects that are under construction in
red and then actually new build projects
every year going back to the year 2000
and what's happened is that local
opposition to coal plants has slowed
them down but is in fact not stopped the
siting of new coal-fired power plants
and the big news you'll be reading about
on the newspaper over the next year so
is that in fact we have roughly a wall
of coal-fired power plants even in this
country where people are increasingly
worried
out carbon dioxide and other
environmental problems that wall of
plants is coming online the end of my
talk I'll try and put this in
perspective with other kinds of other
kinds of fuels and this is because we
read a lot about the cancellations of
plants in the newspaper but nobody ever
takes the kind of big picture to
understand which plants are going
forward and which plants aren't going
forward and that's what this slide shows
that's the picture for the United States
and it underscores a point which is you
should not expect the demand for coal in
the United States to to wane anytime
soon this is a picture that underscores
the scale of the challenge that you have
in front of you as effects China and
India this is a slide from the
international energy agency in Paris
every year they put out a large study on
the state of the world's energy market
and it shows for the major fuels coal
oil natural gas nuclear hydro renewables
and the total it shows out in the year
2030 what they project to be the shares
of these different fuels and who's going
to contribute to the rise of this share
what you see here is China which is
shown in red and India which is shown in
yellow those two countries alone are
expected to be eighty percent of the
rise in demand for coal out to the year
2030 so I think one of the challenges
when we think about re is less than C is
not only making already less than C in
this country and other leading
industrialized countries but also the
emerging markets and I think in
particular we ought to have a discussion
about how you make this the case in
India and in China almost every
discussion about the world's energy
system at the end of the day comes back
to China because that's an extraordinary
economy many people growing so rapidly
experiences the Google knows extremely
well just another slide or two about the
situation in India and China one of the
reasons they're burning coal is not
surprisingly they have a lot of coal
this slide on the left for India and on
the right for China just shows their
current fossil fuel reserves according
to the types of fossil fuels coal which
in India is eighty-five percent in China
ninety-four percent oil and natural gas
and so one of the reasons that they burn
coal is frankly they've got an enormous
amount of coal and until recently the
coal has been proximate and relatively
inexpensive to acquire let me just add a
footnote here which is you've been
reading a lot of the newspapers about
the controversies around oil reserves
and natural gas reserves and do we how
much oil is actually out there in the
world and some companies have been
cooking the books on their reserves and
so on arguably the data on reserves for
coal are even worse than the data on
reserves for oil and natural gas so do
not be surprised if in the coming years
we actually learn that although the
world seems to be a wash and coal
reserves we don't don't be surprised if
we actually learn that there's a lot
less coal out there than we originally
thought it's harder to get to and the
quality of that coal is much lower to
put this number and put this in
perspective in the last 10 days alone
the US Geological Survey has revised its
estimates for the giant coal field
outside Gillette Wyoming which accounts
for two-thirds roughly a total you as
coal production and this one
reassessment reduce the estimate of the
reserves they are by twenty nine percent
so we're learning an enormous amount
about the quality and size of coal
reserves right now they're pointing in
the direction to most of the data having
overestimated the size the coal reserves
and therefore becoming more expensive to
get coal out of the ground and when you
put that together what you have is a
story about continued high demand for
coal some difficulties in supplying coal
and therefore probably high coal prices
which will have some really interesting
implications for re is less than C if
you bear with me just another two slides
to give you a sense of what factors
drive the decisions in China and India
about which kinds of power plants to
build this slide here and we're going to
make copies of the slides available so
you don't need to madly type all this
down gives you a sense a snapshot of the
situation in both China and India right
now both of them are huge coal producers
China is actually by far the largest
cooperatives are accounting for almost
half of the total world production but
both countries interestingly enough
right now are facing
significant shortages and supply so
their domestic industries are unable to
keep up with the need for coal this is
part of the reason why you'll be reading
in the newspapers about a series of
blackouts in China because of short of
faltering coal supplies and similar
kinds of stories for complex reasons in
India both countries last year were
actually importers of coal so we think
of China and India's countries with
enormous amounts of coal they must be
producing cold like mad and until a year
ago that was the case for China China
was a net exporter last year was the
first year in modern recorded history
where China has actually been a net
importer of coal and we think it's it's
it's likely in the in in the future that
these both these countries will continue
to be importers of coal one last point
about this which is when we think about
re is less than C we have to pay close
attention to which factors drive the
decisions to build coal-fired power
plants and those factors you can imagine
some of them immediately what is the
cost of coal what does it cost to build
a coal-fired power plant in China and
India and other emerging markets and
other factor turns out to be incredibly
important and that is the cost of
capital the cost of money because
coal-fired power plants are extremely
capital intensive and most of the
companies that build them are
state-owned companies that have access
to money unlike private companies their
money their capital is much cheaper to
get to then private companies facing
those same markets and this this slide
just gives you a sense of this for the
41 Province in China the province of
Guangdong these are some modeling
results that we've put together and
released late last year that shows the
expected demand for for coal and for
energy if we tell the model that all
parts of the economy have the same cost
of capital which is the way most
efficient economies actually operate and
this shows us the results if we tell the
model that state enterprises that build
coal-fired power plants have access to
really cheap capital but companies that
use energy their capital is extremely
expensive and the difference is in norm
so our models when we tell them to the
cost of capital is the same everywhere
in the economy they actually predict
coal starting to exit parts of the
Chinese economy already because of local
air pollution concerns and so on when we
would tell them about the real cost of
capital it ironically becomes even
harder to unseat coal from these
economies I want to switch gears now and
talk a little bit about the
International Trade and coal and then
I'm going to end by talking about the
cost of different coal-fired
technologies we're all used to reading
about the world oil market and now every
day it seems like the news begins with
whatever the price of oil is up or down
and then they try and attack the
national mood to whatever the price of
oil is oil is a fungible commodity
almost all oil the vast majority of it
trades in international markets it's
very cheap only a few dollars a barrel
to move oil around and so the price of
oil almost everywhere in the world is a
function of the behavior of the
international marketplace that is
starting to happen for coal but because
coal is harder to move the dynamics of
the call market are very different this
will be arguably the single most
important factor in helping us
understand re is less than C
understanding the bus and how rapidly
it's moving and what the cost of coal is
is the changing structure of this
international coal market and in a
couple slides I just want to walk
through what's happening in this
marketplace so that you can hopefully
appreciate what is likely to be the big
news in the coming few years the first
thing to underscore is that total world
trade in coal has risen dramatically in
the last two decades if you rewind the
tape of history two decades ago back to
the 1980s what you saw is very small
quantities of coal compared to total
world demand that was traded
internationally and and half or so of
that cole was specialty coal used for
making steel so called coking coal and
the reason for that is very simple
coking coal is a whole lot more valuable
than what's called steam coal which is
used in power plants for making steam
and therefore election
so whenever a product's more valuable
you can usually justify the extra cost
of putting on a ship and transporting
around nobody's yet you're in an
incredibly high value at an industry and
so this this point may not fully sink
sink in because when you have a physical
product that's incredibly valuable you
call up fedex and you put it in a fedex
envelope and the next day it's somewhere
else in the country or two days later
it's anywhere else in the world because
the cost of transport is such a small
portion of the total value of what
you're moving around nobody is fedexing
cole around yet but maybe there'll be a
change in that with innovation the
reason for this rapid rise in the
international trade and cole is 4 is
titled lots of factors the single most
important of which is the dramatic
decline in the cost of shipping over all
over the last few decades all of the
increase in Cole shown here over time
all of the increase in international
trade and call has come from steam coal
so coking coal is flat trans bordered
I'm sorry land-based trade and coal by
trucks and rails and so on is flat the
story is the increase in steam coal for
making electricity on boats now globally
this is a global marketplace how do we
think about the impact of this on prices
for coal this slide here is going to
show us the price of a handful of
important marker coals so coals traded
in different marketplaces and the
freight rates so here is the price of
coal rising over time the the freight
rates so this is the part of the coal
price that is shipping so this is the
equivalent of the FedEx bill the freight
rates have been extremely volatile and
when the price of coal goes up freight
rates usually go up a little bit that's
because people in the shipping business
know and their product and the product
moving around is extremely valuable they
demand some of that money for themselves
but overall the big the big effect has
been that the price of coal has gone up
and awful lot of that has been reflected
in the ultimate final price of coal and
the value that coal producers get
this is going to have an enormous impact
on coal prices and that's what I'd like
to show you in this slide here this
slide shows us the price of coal in the
atlantic basin in europe which is shown
in yellow and in Appalachia which is
shown in the blue here and what you see
although the connection between the two
is not perfect what you see is that in
the eastern seaboard of the United
States the price of coal today is
broadly coming out of the European
market and that's because the price of
natural gas in Europe is incredibly high
and with expensive natural gas in Europe
they're actually having an incentive to
burn more coal and they're pulling that
coal out of the US marketplace if you
look down here at this yellow line is it
hasn't moved at all this yellow line at
the price of coal in the western part of
the United States in the powder river
basin in around Gillette Wyoming in the
Northeast northeastern corner of Wyoming
and the reason that doesn't move is
because the capacity to move that coal
is already fully tapped out the railroad
capacity two-thirds of the nation's call
comes from the Powder River Basin and no
matter what happens in the international
market today you don't see those coal
prices changing but over time almost
everywhere in the world that you look
and see markets getting exposed to the
international conditions what you're
seeing is the price of coal starting to
connect to each other everywhere in the
world I want to close this discussion
about coal prices with just a word or
two about carbon and co2 because one of
the reasons that you're worried about re
being less than C is you're worried as
you should be about global warming and
the consequences of global warming and
one part of a strategy to fix this is to
put a price on co2 emissions to get the
marketplace to send a signal that we
should stop using as much causing as
many co2 emissions as we are already
there are now several markets in the
world that price co2 almost all and work
through something called a cap-and-trade
system like with the one we're
developing here in California where the
government puts a limit on total co2
emissions and they give companies or in
some cases individuals
the right to trade those limits and this
is a little bit like the day traders in
the late 1990s and you can then trade
these credits and the market price for
co2 goes up and down as people's
expectations about demand and supply for
co2 credits as those expectations change
and this slide shows over time for these
markets back to january 2002 the
experience so far has been very very
brief with carbon markets there was
there was an early one in britain
there's been one running along in
australia there's a market here in the
united states a voluntary market called
the chicago climate exchange and the
biggest market by for are shown here in
the blue is what's called called the
emission trading scheme in europe so
this is this is by far the largest
market and the most significant effort
anywhere in the world to put a price on
carbon and to encourage companies to
switch away from carbon the vertical
axis shows US dollars per ton of co2
emitted so the european market today is
trading in the neighborhood of forty to
fifty dollars per ton of co2 that's a
significant increase in the price of co2
and has produced incentives for
companies to look for ways to generate
electricity make industrial products
heat homes and buildings that have a
much lighter carbon footprint but my
question is what has impact has this hat
on coal you would expect that coal would
be seriously disadvantaged in this world
because coal relative to natural gas
which is its main rival and generating
electricity in most of europe kollam
it's twice as much carbon dioxide for
unit electricity as natural gas so every
kilowatt hour of natural gas produced
using coal twice as much co2 as natural
gas if you put a price on co2 you would
expect that that would result in company
is not dispatching as much coal and
instead buying more natural gas what's
happened in Europe is exactly the
opposite this slide shows you the same
data we had before the price of carbon
the vertical axis in this case because
we're being European is euros per ton
over time
for the december two thousand nine
contract to to have an emission trading
credit and the price is on the order of
25 euros per ton in the forty dollar to
fifty dollar per dollar forty to fifty
dollar per ton range the same chart that
I showed earlier this next line shows
you what's called the carbon parity
price this is the price at which carbon
would have to be priced in order to make
gas and coal equally competitive in the
European market so not just not a favor
gasps but just to make them competitive
what you see is the carbon parity price
is twice the level twice the level of
the current carbon price in Europe so in
the world's most active system for
regulating carbon dioxide in fact the
price of carbon for near-term investment
decisions the price of carbon is in fact
nowhere near as high as it needs to be
in order to change significantly
behavior the reason for that very
briefly is that the price of oil is high
and therefore the price of gas is
incredibly high because the largest
single supplier of gas in Europe is
Russia and almost all the Russian
contracts going into Europe are have
their gas price index the price of oil
so even though coal has risen a fair bit
in the last year and a half all in kohls
in fact more competitive today compared
with natural gas than was the case five
years ago I want to switch gears now and
close my talk with a little bit of
discussion about what you guys do best
and what re is less than C is mainly
about which is technology I want to talk
a little bit about advanced coal
technologies and how we might think
about those those technologies
the first slide here is designed to give
you a sense of scale there's been a lot
of talk in the news about what are
called carbon capture and storage power
plants in the jargon CCS carbon capture
and storage these are power plants where
you redesign the power plant to produce
a smokestack that doesn't have a low
density low pressure stream of pollution
which is what with this is a norm for
smokestacks but instead has a very high
concentrated high-pressure stream of
carbon dioxide and you turn the
smokestack upside down you injected
underground where the co2 presumably
stays safe from the atmosphere and
therefore doesn't cause global warming
people in the heavy iron of the electric
power industry folks were interested in
nuclear and coal and advanced gas plants
and so on their banking a lot on this
technology CCS because they think this
is going to be one of the ways to use a
lot more coal and also to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and I want
to just walk through a couple slides to
give you sense of what's going on with
this technology so far the first one is
a sense of scale this slide here shows
over time back to nineteen ninety up to
the present day and then projections out
to the future of the total emissions of
carbon dioxide from all sources in the
all electric power sources in the United
States and this is the pulse of the
electric power industry in the United
States the leading industry organization
research organization was asked a couple
years ago to take a look at what the
industry could do to reduce its
emissions that industry actually right
here locally the electric power research
institute does I think by far the best
analytical work in this area and this
slide summarizes the results of their
research what they show is that if you
wanted to take the emissions of co2 from
electric power sector and instead of
having them grow up continuously as they
are currently slated to do but have them
stop and then reverse so that eventually
co2 emissions from the power industry
would be much smaller consistent with a
worldwide effort to reduce co2 emissions
the order of half by the year 2050 which
is a long way down the road not fully
but a long way down the road of what we
need to do to stabilize the atmosphere
this is what they think would be needed
and then they filled in this difference
is huge differences with the wedge with
different slices of technologies and
initiatives that could help make this
reduction so an energy efficiency has
shown in blue renewable energy they're a
little more pessimistic about renewable
energy than you are renewable energy is
shown in green and so on and I want to
draw your attention to this orange slice
right here which is their expectation of
the role of these CCS plants carbon
capture and storage plans totally new
kind of toll coal based technology for
generating electricity and to put some
numbers on it what they expect is that
by the year twenty thirty in order for
the industry as a whole to make its
contribution to control in co2 emissions
you have to have a 350 million tons of
co2 per year injected underground that's
a big number that is at typical
pressures for underground injection
about four and a half million barrels a
day of stuff per day of stuff four and a
half million barrels a day is a lot it's
not outside the realm of what we're used
to designing in engineering systems the
world oil market today for example is 86
million barrels a day so it's a huge
amount of material it's about
one-quarter one-fifth of total u.s. oil
consumption you need piping and wells
and all that stuff in order to move four
and a half million barrels a day this is
just the United States so remember this
number 350 million tons of co2 per year
this next slide as a result of my
colleague varun rise work at Stanford
well what we've done is we've gone and
we've looked at every single
announcement anywhere in the world for
one of these CCS plants and we put it on
this chart according to the volume of
co2 that it would store underground so
we have a chart here that stacks up the
volumes and then varun
has to x-ray is incoming mail now from
power companies because he's ranked all
of these according to the probability
these projects are actually going to
exist because turns out shock as it may
be there's a lot of vapor where in the
energy business so people announce
things and they don't really happen and
so we've ranked all these things and
then we put this chart up and we stand
back and so the ranking is possible
projects and then speculative much less
than fifty percent probability that they
would exist and what you see on this
chart is that if you add up the total
level of effort even if all the
speculative projects came into being by
the year twenty twenty-five almost the
year 2030 we think total world effort in
this area these advanced CCS plants is
only 100 million tons of co2 per year
and if you then adjust that from the
probability these projects really exist
the total world effort is roughly 1% of
what the world in power industry needs
to do in order for ccs to play its role
in storing co2 so my point is that this
major technological option and also one
of the major competitors potentially to
renewable energy is in fact not doing
well at all one more point on this and
then I'm going to move on it turns out
that you can do a lot with a co2 when
you inject it underground if you're
going to be injecting millions of
barrels per day of co2 mostly you're
going to be injecting an underground and
you're just hoping it's going to stay
there and I think the geology around
that has worked out fairly well but you
can inject some co2 underground and use
that for making more oil and natural gas
and so what Varun has done in this next
slide as these color-coded all these
projects according to which ones are
involved in actually making more fossil
fuels and which ones are involved when
storing the co2 underground and keeping
it there which are the kinds of projects
that we ultimately need at scale the
ones that are involved in making more
fossil fuels are colored in black so if
you didn't catch the message there's the
original slide and then here's the new
slide so if you remove these projects
because they are filling an unusual
niche market that very soon will be
filled up what you see is
total world effort in this one
technology alone is roughly one-tenth of
one percent of what you need in order to
stabilize emissions from the power
industry over the next 50 years the coal
based part of the power industry is
falling severely far behind in the
carbon challenge last couple slides I
just want to flag something that will be
potentially important although right now
we don't think it's that big a deal
which is so-called coal to liquids so
this is take coal and through various
chemical processes turn it into a liquid
fuel people get excited about this
because they think it's going to help
boost energy security if you think the
world's coal market is becoming a global
market just like the oil market then
this energy security arguments kind of
hard to maintain right now it's awfully
expensive although high oil prices have
made it much more cost-effective it's
unbelievably carbon-intensive roughly
twice as much carbon per gallon of
gasoline or diesel fuel comes from this
mechanism when compared with
conventional petroleum products there
are some projects underway to try and
make these liquid fuels out of coal and
also store the carbon underground it's
unclear how well those are going to work
so to close where does this where does
Cole look in broader perspective and to
answer that question I want to stop with
two slides the first one is the slide I
showed earlier which indicated that
actually there's a lot of coal plants
being built in this country despite the
best efforts the environmental community
to mobilize and stop coal plants and a
growing interest by the courts and
considering the possible implications
for co2 you're starting to see more coal
plants and this chart here just shows
you that coal build relative to all the
other technologies that people think are
likely to be built out in the coming
years coal is shown in black natural gas
is shown in blue renewables which is
your principal focus are shown in green
and if you look at the year 2007-2008
roughly the current period what you see
is that renewables are a very large part
of the build-out of the electric power
system but they are still roughly on
average
a minority comparative natural gas and I
think the big news in 09 will be that
coal actually could be a dominant part
of the u.s. build-out despite looming
regulations on carbon dioxide this is
the last slide I want to show because
you're Arya is less than teens team
asked me to talk a little bit about
costs how much does it cost to build a
conventional coal-fired power plant and
how does that compare with other sources
of electricity the way in this industry
we normally compare costs is we level
eyes them we imagine what would it cost
to go to the bank and take out a loan to
build the power plant what would it cost
to buy the fuel what would it cost to
maintain the plant and you put all that
in including the loan service and you
level eyes that so that over the
lifetime of the plant you have the
average level cost of electricity zal
ittle bit think of it a little bit like
a mortgage and so the question is what's
the levelized cost of electricity for
different kinds of technologies in this
slide I'm just going to show coal
because your team is much more advanced
than I could ever be in understanding
renewable energy and this slide shows
you conventional coal plants in the
maroon down here the the standard I'd
like you to focus on right now are what
are called supercritical pulverized coal
plants which is a standard industry
plant that's built in this country in
most of the world at the margin today
and then the cost of building a coal
plant that would have CCS so capturing
the co2 and then injecting it
underground this this result these
results were done about a year and a
half ago and what it showed is that the
levelized cost was about fifty dollars
to sixty dollars a megawatt hour for
conventional coal plants that's roughly
five cents to six cents per kilowatt
hour when you open your bill from PG&amp;amp;E
nobody has five cents to six cents a
kilowatt error because PG&amp;amp;E has lots of
other fees that they attached to it most
importantly the cost of getting the
wholesale power over the wires and
delivered to you in your house and the
conventional wisdom was that these new
plants would cost roughly double to
store the sea
to underground how does this compare
with renewable energy options well with
this data here C was still probably more
less expensive than the major renewable
energy options let's set aside rooftop
solar photovoltaics which which people
like to have around because they look
good and but they're not economic with
current technology and in my view will
never be economic but who knows about
the distant future the really big
contenders in my view are centralized
solar thermal power stations and bulk
wind and in most of the world settings
Cole would still be cheaper than bulk
wind which was depending on where you're
looking and so on was 62 maybe eighty
dollars a megawatt hour but here's where
lend these data were done a year and a
half ago this is a project by electric
power research institute the same Morgan
organization I mentioned earlier during
the process of updating this right now
because it turns out that the cost of
everything all commodities in the world
market has risen dramatically in a
particular cost of steel stainless steel
chrome concrete and engineers maybe
because the engineers are excited about
going into software and not so excited
about building nuclear plants and coal
plants and so on and when you put the
cost of all that together the capital
cost of building a coal-fired power
plant in the last two years alone has
gone up by maybe forty percent maybe
fifty percent put a number on it for
those you follows closely it looks like
thirty two hundred dollars per kilowatt
of capacity and if you combine that with
the higher cost of coal the levelized
cost of coal today for building a new
plant is maybe a hundred dollars a
megawatt hour ten dollars a ten cents
per kilowatt hour which suggests to me
and this is where I'll stop that in fact
you've caught the bus
let me stop here and open it up for
questions how much of the cost of the
coal is in buying the gasoline sorry the
poll buying the gasoline to get it out
of the ground Oh a tiny fraction a tiny
fraction in the coal industry I've told
a complex picture here which doesn't
have a simple answer because that is the
nature of the dynamics in this industry
right now on the one hand prices are
high in a particular price of coal-fired
electricity or very high 40 forces that
I discussed on the other hand the coal
industry has been the source of an
unbelievable technological innovation in
the last 20 years and I urge anyone who
wants to do this to go visit a mine like
the one in the picture for the flyer
this of this here this is not an
underground mine with people with
shovels and a hat this is a massive
strip mine that mine that we show there
is one just outside Gillette that is now
today I think producing 80 million tons
of coal per year and I think we counted
the number of people actually in
operating stations in the mind I believe
there were 14 and it's actually it's all
electrified almost all of it was
electrified because the most
energy-intensive parts of the mining
operation are better to run like the
dragline better run with electricity the
fuel costs of doing all of that at scale
and the australians are even further
ahead is a tiny fraction evolution about
carbon capture and sequestration I just
wanna make sure I understood the graph
it looked like he said that CCS could
account or is accounting for one percent
of what would be needed if we got to
level that we think we get to be given
the products that are coming online and
if you multiply that number by 100
that's it was that 10 gigatons of co2
that we need to be injecting by ccs
that's a huge amount yeah it would be on
the order of
a 1 Gigaton from ccs alone now these
calculations move around depending on
one's assumptions about the cost of the
technology and so on and I think part of
the shock coming out of power industry
over the next year or two will be folks
revising these numbers downward because
real companies trying to build real
projects are finding out but the
financial risk associated projects is
enormous and therefore they're much less
optimistic today than they were before
but yeah there's a huge amount of
material that would be needed to put
this in perspective if if we took just
the four and a half roughly four and a
half five million barrels a day of stuff
of co2 that we needed in this country
alone and put it into pipelines the size
of the pipeline network roughly would be
as large or a bit larger than the entire
natural gas pipeline network in the
country and people are talking about
doing this in 20 years whereas it took
100 years to build a gas pipeline
network so that the scale is
unbelievable we're talking about one
gigaton capture that's needed by 2015
roughly thoughts me every question hey
David could you talk about going back to
your slide with new capacity additions
in the US why there's going to be why
there's expected to be such a spike in
new coal capacity and also why there's a
decrease in new renewables capacity
projected beyond 2008 so let me say a
couple words about this and rapidly
becomes a much more complex discussion I
think there are two things going on here
one is that people who tried to build
coal plants and faced enormous
difficulties when the price of oil and
the natural gas went up about starting
five or six years ago it took a while to
get rid of all the gas that was on order
it is this big spike in gas 2002-2003 if
you like is the hangover from Enron so
it's in the late 1990s all these
companies wanting to be Enron gas-fired
companies so they all placed orders for
gas turbines than many of them went
bankrupt but then the turbines still
arrived and so you have all these
turbines being commissioned many of
which are still not being used to full
load something similar to happen in coal
when the price of gas went up sharply
people say well let's just build coal
plants so they went out they started
trying to build call flint plants they
ran into lots of opposition and while
that resulted in a cancellation of many
plans on average about fourteen percent
of the anounced plants survived all the
way through the for the sighting
olympics but it didn't result in
everything getting canceled and so and
so what happens they've been delayed and
stretched out the wind point here is
because the group making this projection
is the energy information administration
which is part of the Department of
Energy and although they're independent
in my view they are politically wise to
only make assumptions about existing
policies or likely policies and as you
know one of the hardest things when
you're in the wind and solar business
today is to figure out what Congress is
going to do maybe that's true in any
business because the expiration of the
production and investment tax credits
and so that's I think explains why wind
is probably underrepresented and they'll
probably be a little more stretch out of
coal but the basic point which is we
should not be surprised to see a lot of
new coal plants come on which partially
is good news because they're replacing
old even dirtier plants that that news
is happening but on a local level that
we add up if the national level is quite
consequential to questions so first
thank you very much for a wonderful talk
and i particularly i'm going to take
away the ten cents per kilowatt hour or
electricity from coal us cap and Fred
Krupp have estimated that a
cap-and-trade system would add two cents
per kilowatt hour for the cost of
electricity from coal on a base of four
cents per kilowatt hour in the US and
three cents per kilowatt hour in China
that would be a global price so whether
it is now two cents on top of your ten
cents or not
which would be twenty percent or two
cents on top of five six seven cents in
China that's a huge amount do you agree
with that is that does that sound right
to you I think we have no clue and I
think we have no clue because that
calculation is right in an engineering
sense if you went off you had signals
for people to companies to change the
behavior they went out and they
optimally acquired new technology they
installed it so on but two things are
happening in the carbon markets today
one of them is that the actual signal
from the marketplace to real companies
is much more muted and fragmented around
the world so there's no global carbon
market for example is that you there's
an emerging US market that's probably
going to four or five different markets
in it because California would do
something different from from the
Northeast and on and on and you have a
European market how you hand out the
emission credits in the beginning really
matter it's because if you're a
coal-fired power company and you're
given the mission credits for free based
on your actual emissions then you
actually have ironically an incentive to
increase your emissions at least for a
period of time rather than decrease them
and the value of those emission credits
gets treated by regulators in different
ways and so when you work all that out
what I'm worried about frankly is not
that the engineers can't fix this
problem I think actually that the
solutions are in sight and things like
your initiative help make them in sight
I'm worried that the real regulatory and
investment climate doesn't see clear
signals and therefore can't figure out
what to deploy so that's one caveat
there the other thing I'd like to say is
the estimate that it would only cost two
cents per kilowatt hour wholesale
increase in electricity price in this
country to reduce carbon emissions and
sensitive a lot of different factors set
that aside for a moment
it's unbelievably sensitive to one's
assumption about the the capital cost of
the technology so if you think the
industry is going to go off and build a
lot of CCS plants and advanced nuclear
plants and so on as part of its solution
then the fact that the capital costs
have built in a nuclear plant has gone
in the last five years from this is
hypothetical because nobody's built one
from two thousand dollars a kilowatt to
five thousand to I can defend eight
thousand dollars a kilowatt for capex
maybe not for a long period of time but
that's a huge increase in soon where the
increase most of the price of a
coal-fired electricity is the capital
cost and so if the coal plants have now
doubled the triple and cost then the
cost of building a plant that has more
gizmos attached to it and more pipes
presume is going to rise as well all of
that is is if you think renewable energy
is less capital-intensive which is true
in some settings many settings all of
that suggests that that would be good
news for re is less than C in that
context your colleague celly Benson at
Stanford why is she so bullish about
carbon capture sequestration based on
the date of the you've just shown
because I think there is a again who
knows what's really and I what's going
to happen over the long term when real
companies build real projects and they
get experience and they discovered the
project's work which is highly likely
because people like Sally are working on
this technology and her own work is
making sure the co2 stays underground
thank you very much when real companies
have this experience then presumably the
cost isn't come down just as the cost of
renewable energy has come down with
experience but there's a you wanting gap
between people between the assessment of
the technological and engineering
potential here
the real financing of real projects and
the more capital intention intensive and
risky the projects the harder it is to
close that gap thank you yes and I'm
going to ask draw on some of my
colleagues to answer some of these
questions as misogynist of Poland and
the bar can be transported the question
is how much does it cost to move
electricity around and how far can we
transmit it the cost of moving
electricity around is a very small
fraction of the total final cost of
electricity moving electricity around
until you get to the neighborhood when
you get to the neighborhood the cost of
your final electric bill depending on
the neighborhood and depending on a good
your power company is is was almost half
of the total final electric bill because
all those wires are carrying small
amounts of electricity but it's very
capital intensive but long distance
transmission is relatively inexpensive
although the cost of that is going up as
well it used to cost a million dollars a
mile to build a standard high-voltage
transmission line the latest estimates I
heard earlier this week are two million
dollars a mile I haven't heard three yet
might be three million dollars a mile in
places where it's expensive to acquire
the land so that those costs have gone
up as well typically four or five
percent of the electricity maximum is
lost during the transmission process and
those losses are due to the resistance
in the power lines themselves and so
there are some theoretical limits here
normally power is not moved distances
greater than several hundred miles to
perhaps 800 maybe a thousand miles
that's the outer roughly the outer limit
there's an enormous amount of innovation
though in the power line business there
are much higher voltage lines being
tested million volt lines and there's
high-voltage DC lines so these are lines
that have extremely low line law
and they allow you to direct the current
and so the whole line doesn't have to
resonate at the same frequency as the
rest of the grid if those innovations
really take off that could change
renewable energy radically and it could
also change CCS radically for renewable
energy means we could put wind for
example in the places that are the
windiest and move bulk power long
distances for ccs it means we could put
the power plants on top of the places
where you'd store the carbon and move
the power as electrons rather than the
current vision which is to build the
power plants closer to the load and then
move the co2 by pipelines to places
where you can inject it
well not yet global markets there's been
some really interesting work done still
mostly theoretical on superconductivity
there's I believe one super conducting
line in Detroit and it may be one other
that's operating in this country a
couple others around the world if that
really to work or to work you could
imagine continental style super grids
that's still a ways a ways off there is
an international market for electricity
in particular in Europe mainly because
the countries are smaller so everything
is more international but also because
the Russians have very strong incentive
to build both power and send it to
Western Europe the in your bus chasing
the dog distant bus analogy yeah the bus
is not chasing the dog you know but if
things become equal the bus is still as
actually you know may not have slowed
down all that much we're still digging
up all the coal out of the ground that's
reasonable at that price you alluded to
China and India as being a large part of
the building demand for that I wonder if
you had any nuggets to add about how you
could mitigate the effects of all that
added demand because that seems to be
why you're digging up that much coal
yeah i'm going to ask my colleague
Jeremy Carl who works in both China and
India to talk about the answer that
question there's a microphone right
there once you just come up here so that
the video can capture you yeah I mean
that's a good question and I think one
of the key the key sort of opportunities
to look where the real the real leverage
is and I think one of the difficulties
even when you kind of get excited and as
I understand kind of re less than C is
focused on on new generation and not
necessarily looking quite as much it you
know what the inflection point is to
begin to maybe turn off some of the
existing cold that you've got going but
I think one of the challenges in a place
like China is they've just built out an
enormous amount of infrastructure and so
that those costs of sort of the big cost
have sort of been paid and it makes it a
little more difficult to dislodge
in India as was alluded to in the slide
there's a little bit more opportunity
i'm doing a lot of research right now on
the state-owned indian coal company
because it's so dysfunctional there are
more opportunities for somebody to come
in there and innovate and potentially
come in with some interesting renewable
ideas now the renewables industry in
india is also kind of dysfunctional but
in different ways so there's some more I
think opportunities to do some
interesting things in countries like
India and China and I'm a little bit
worried that the discussion quite
naturally because we're in the US
becomes very us focus but in the slides
that David showed I think you really see
that if we're serious about incremental
growth you really do have to look quite
seriously at China India does that begin
to your question from this party we've
got time for a couple more questions I
just want to see if anyone on the VC had
a question
okay know how much of taxes or carbon
trading would be necessary to make us
provide a significant incentive to
reduce the carbon so let me answer that
in a way that will probably result in my
door pass at Stanford getting revoked
because what I must say is very anti
market I think we have vastly oversold
the role of the market in this area in
the role of price signals because we're
actually trying to solve two problems
simultaneously one problem is if people
have a bunch of technologies on the
shelf as it were we want the marketplace
to send a signal so that they choose
less carbon-intensive technologies in a
way that's cost-effective and so on and
that's a terrific and very powerful role
of markets and that's what these carbon
markets are doing right now my own view
is that the carbon markets are a serious
mistake because they turn they turn this
into a casino because the price the
carbon goes up and down you know these
people day trading as long as I'm
focusing on their day job as it were and
a much better policy would be a tax it
would make it much clearer with carbon
would cost we make it much easier to
plan these long-lived industrial
investments that's all about how you
take technologies that are already there
and encourage decent behavior around
those technologies the other problem
which is my view actually the bigger
problem here right now is how do you get
the technologies to a state of maturity
where they could actually be deployed
and their carbon markets are a small
part of the story they send a price
signal that encourages the right kind of
behavior but the bigger part of the
story is is direct funding of research
and development in some cases smartly
designed mandates you know one of the
reasons that wind is so inexpensive
today is because of enormous
technological innovation on the back of
mandates and feed-in tariffs and
subsidies and things like that I think
the big policy challenge here is to
design those in a smart way that
directly encourage innovation my own
view which is probably different from
your own team's view my own view is that
these local solutions and bulk nuclear
solutions have to be an enormous part of
the story because that's where a lot of
the energy is and frankly that's where a
lot of the politics are and if we're not
serious about that we're going to end up
with solutions that don't exist in the
real world but it requires targeting the
technologies directly and I think that
point people imagine you set up a carbon
market and it all kind of falls into
place we hold hands and sing Kumbaya
knit that's just nuts last question um
oh it's once you guys one of both of you
ask the questions and then I'll answer
then I'll answer them as a tandem so my
understanding is that coal plants are
basically exempt for environmental
regulations because they're
grandfathered in before they were
written and so therefore they can
produce huge amounts of solid waste as
well as gaseous waste whereas other
plants subject to the regulation so
nuclear ones can't compete with is that
still true has that changed briefly
that's not true that was true for some
regulations some of the most onerous
regulations under in the United States
under the Clean Air Act when it was
amended in 1977 because the thinking was
that these older plants were on their
way out and politically was really hard
thing to do you make Polly compromises
in politics and then there's a bunch of
technical kind of legal interpretation
of wind as a plant I've been upgraded so
much that you've done the equivalent of
building a new plant but this image that
there is you know it's the Wild West of
these coal plants and folks are just
chucking stuff in and setting it on fire
and
and I outcomes electricity is not
correct in fact this industry is in the
middle of a wrenching enormous capital
investment to apply much more aggressive
environmental controls on the whole
fleet more or less of coal-fired power
plants and re powers take out all plans
and put in new plans and when most of
the CEOs and this industry sit down and
they think about their strategy frankly
they spend much more time thinking about
that than most of these other problems
because in today's market in the US
that's where the billions and billions
of dollars of capital expenditure are
right now and the carbon stuff because
of dithering in Congress and so on the
carbon stuff is more speculative and
therefore harder to build into one's
investment plans okay thank you oh if I
can go back to your analogy the dog and
the bus I'm sorry about the analogy good
actually um so you're saying that maybe
the dog has actually caught the bus but
nobody can ride a bus or i can write a
dog do you see any of the renewables
even if they are on par being able to
scale the point they could actually
compete and they're in a real market
yeah i'm i think what's happening in
bulk renewables today is some of us uh
neck anomic some of some of a lot of
things in life are on economic but the
tenor of it is unbelievably interesting
right now so you take these large
central stations solar plants let alone
wind there are in addition to innovation
in the generation of electricity there's
an unbelievable amount of innovation and
storage some of it integral to the till
the solar technology itself and some of
it new battery concepts compressed air
underground is a huge compressed air
project being developed in Texas to to
connect to wind which would allow when
wind is dispatched to be dispatched more
reliably and and these these ancillary
innovations along with the core
innovations in
in renewable energy are extremely
exciting this is a very exciting time to
be in the evenin the utility business
which was previously thought to be one
of the dulles industries on the planet
it's incredible because they are in the
middle of a revolution and it's not
clear who's going to win for renewables
there's still a lot of work to be done
in my view on the ancillary innovations
and on integrating renewables with the
grid to make reliable delivery so that
you don't control they do the equivalent
of control alt delete periodically and
you see that innovation happening though
it's it's very very exciting thank you
very much so let me just thank David
Victor for a great great talk I also
want to thank his colleagues Varun
Jeremy and Richard and I also want to
thank Michael Terrill my colleague who
organized this today and I think we're
going to try to do some more sessions
like this thing it's very helpful in
encouraging this sort of discussion at
Google so thank you David and to your
colleagues we really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
