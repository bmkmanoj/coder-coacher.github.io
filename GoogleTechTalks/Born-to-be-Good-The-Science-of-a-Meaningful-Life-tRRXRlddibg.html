in the maps team and I'm here to
introduce Professor Dr Keltner of the
University of California Berkeley where
he's a professor of psychology and
director of their greater good science
center
professor Keltner is with us today to
present work he's published in his
recent book born to be good science of a
meaningful life his work is inspiring
timely and relevant particularly given
our own motto don't be evil
his work has garnered numerous accolades
Wired magazine has described podcasts
from his course emotions as one of the
five best educational downloads online
Barnes and Noble book review has written
that his book is deeply fascinating for
quote anyone interested in well life so
assuming you're interested in well life
please welcome professor dr. Keltner
thank you
Aditya well it's a terrific honor to be
here to talk to you about this crazy
science that we do up at Berkeley and
that's spreading throughout different
departments throughout the country I've
had a couple of great Google experiences
and just in the last 12 hours or so
last night I used your map system to
plan out a vacation into the High
Sierras and that was terrific
it really spectacular and then this
morning my daughter preparing for a 6th
grade math test was asking me about
adjacent angles and complementary angles
and supplementary angles as I go so I
googled it and got quick answers so it's
good work so as edita talked about I
wanted to talk to you a little bit about
some of the themes that I develop in
this book that I just published and it
really is at the heart of the center
that I direct and the science that we do
up at Berkeley it is can you guys hear
me if I step away
okay okay great today what I'd like to
do is to talk about my favorite emotion
and a fascinating emotion from an
evolutionary and neuroscience
perspective which is compassion or
sympathy in a terrific book the
historian Jonathan Glover and for those
of you who are interested in a history
of sympathy and compassion writes about
this fascinating thing that happens in
combat which he calls sympathy
breakthroughs which is in the heat of
combat people will face their
adversaries be ready to kill they've
been trained to kill and then they
become overwhelmed with this emotional
response that he calls a sympathy break
through to their adversaries George
Orwell the great essayist was fighting
the fascists in Spain and had this
terrific experience where a fascist came
running at him his he was a little bit
disorganized and had a shirt off and
Orwell was about to pull the trigger and
just couldn't do it because he became
overwhelmed with this emotion there are
actually fascinating studies historical
studies from the Second World War
showing that most of the time people
actually do not shoot their bullets at
enemies and that led to a major revision
that you might have heard about in
military strategy about training
combatants how to shoot at the enemies
the claim that Glover makes is that
we're wired up to feel this connection
even to adversaries in the heat of
combat if you go to the science that I
work in which is really psychological
science or evolutionary science you see
that that view that there were capable
of these sympathy breakthroughs is not
widespread and in fact one of the points
that I counter in the book that I think
Aditya was referring to with respect to
your mission is that the counterpoint to
the thesis that were wired for a
competitive and nasty and brutish life
well in our science there's this
widespread assumption that the bad in
human nature is stronger than the good
and I actually want to take that head-on
with a lot of data that you'll hear
about today but this is a
telling idea it has many manifestations
so for example when people write about
basic attachments between caregiver and
offspring the supposition on our science
is that it's motivated by anxiety sort
of a Freudian anxiety you guys have
probably been exposed to debates about
altruistic behavior why we give to kin
non-kin strangers often at a great
expense to the self the contemporary
science says it really is about selfish
motives or some sort of Freudian defense
mechanism where we were worried that
we're not good people megive and that is
the primary motive and we'll make a
different case today one of my favorite
ideas in this bad is stronger than the
good thesis is a very interesting idea
that Paul Rozan at the University of
Pennsylvania has detailed which is about
contamination and rosin observes isn't
it fascinating how powerful bad things
are in terms of contaminating right so
rosin who studies food and I hope I
apologize further to those of you who
are eating has this observation that if
you're about to eat a delicious meal
right and a cockroach walks close to
your plate the essence of that cockroach
its badness contaminates your delicious
meal and you can't eat now think about
the opposite right you're about to eat a
pile of cockroaches
you put a truffle next to it the
goodness of the truffle doesn't spread
over and change the essence of the
cockroaches and and he kind of talked
about wow maybe that's just this state
of nature's bad Trump's good and I'm
going to show you a lot of data that
suggests otherwise now this idea about
the basic state of human nature being
corrupt and competitive and brutish has
deep deep places in Western thought
as I review in my book and and very high
profile champions or advocates give you
a couple of random quotes that I got to
sort of survey as I wrote this book
Sigmund Freud
the very emphasis on the commandment
thou shalt not kill makes it certain
that we are descended from an endlessly
long generation chain of generations of
murderers iron ran the most influential
philosopher outside of probably Plato
and Aristotle ever and maybe Kant and
Descartes anybody know who Iron rands
favorite disciple was Alan Greenspan
hung around her circle for quite some
time
iein ran in a well-known essay and
Playboy magazine could you not if any
civilization wish I could publish a
Playboy magazine and I'd have a bigger
audience that if any civilization is to
survive it is the morality of altruism
that men have to reject in other places
she said that an act of altruism or
acting on the behalf of other people is
an act of treason this is the one that
really bothers me in the science that I
work in which is George Williams the
natural world he's a well-known
evolutionary thinker really fundamental
in getting us to think about what it
means to call something an adaptation
right and Williams said the natural
world is grossly immoral natural
selection can honestly be described as a
process for maximizing short-sighted
self-interest and regrettably that turns
out to be wrong headed as we'll see with
the science that unfolds now very
interestingly Charles Darwin had a much
different view of human nature that is
often lost sight of we associate Charles
Darwin with the thesis that that it is
survival of the fittest that wasn't
Darwin's as you guys probably know
phrase that was Herbert Spencer who
popularized Darwin Darwin actually made
the case that sympathy is our strongest
instinct and I think for very sensible
reasons that we'll move through today
the compassion carrying bringing out the
good and others is our strongest feature
of our design which we'll talk about at
Darwin in my own science Frank solloway
and I have started a write about
Darwin's amazing conceptions of all the
different positive emotions that we
should be studying as scientists this is
a distillation of his specific
observations about emotion Darwin's idea
was that the emotions that we observe
today which I'll show you some photos of
are really the final vestiges or
products of these mammalian processes of
building up social relationships that
have evolved for hundreds of millions of
years and what we see today are really
the tips of an evolutionary iceberg and
I I you know if there's one thing you
get out of this talk is you should go
read Darwin his expression book his
descent if man the guy had an eye to
human nature unlike any his expression
book is the best book on emotion to this
day and here's some observations to tell
us about the evolutionary origins of
emotion in a state of devotion we get
into a humbling kneeling posture he was
observing back in his Victorian England
we get very small we feel a state of
reverence for things that are greater
than itself my favorite and this will
remind you of your colleagues perhaps he
observed in a state of cheerfulness when
you're feeling really upbeat and happy
you just might get caught with your note
nostrils raised and then smacking your
lips and rubbing your belly when you're
feeling really good about this which is
making the point that out of consumption
and the opioid system that's involved in
eating came this emotion of cheerfulness
great observations about human emotions
okay so what I want to tell you today is
a story an evolutionary story about
compassion we will have little detours
to emotions perhaps of interest to you
like love and desire and the like and it
really flows out of this Darwinian
analysis that evolutionary psychologists
have been working on where we try to
understand the deep origins of an
emotion a genetically encoded emotion in
the problems that it solved in our
evolutionary history as this very
particular social interesting primate
that we are okay so what do we know we
know we're pear bonders which is
interesting which I'll talk about we
have amazing capacities for
reconciliation we have very interesting
hierarchies compared to other primates
that are much more negotiated I write a
lot about that or study that in my work
on power and hierarchies and then
important for today's lesson which is we
are we're caretakers we are a profoundly
caretaking species and this will really
set the stage for our understanding of
emotion these are our close primate
relatives they are the chip the bonobo
on the left and then the little
chimpanzee infant on the right they're
doing things that are pretty unusual for
human offspring what do you what strikes
you about them what seems different
feeding themselves they're able to sit
upright right if we position our little
human baby like that it would fall
backwards and damage its brain with
catastrophic effect and they're very
self-sufficient right the human
offspring because we developed these big
brains in these giant heads and because
our pelvis is narrowed as we started to
walk upright our offspring are born more
vulnerable and more premature than any
mammal on the face of the earth the
estimates are that they take from 7 to
46 years to reach the age of
independence depending on the state of
the economy we have to adjust that
upward figure a little bit but that you
know we lost sight of this basic raw
evolutionary fact about the human
species and what people are starting to
say is that the dependence of our
offspring rearranged our social
structures gave rise to a caretaking is
a basic dimension to social structures
and what I'll show to you today is that
rearranged our nervous systems on our
motion profile so in my lab we study all
kinds of positive emotions I'm happy to
talk to you about other positive
emotions than compassion
today if in our Q&amp;amp;A and our discussion
later on but today I want to sort of
give you this distilled science on
compassion we think all these emotions
have very important places in our
evolutionary story okay so compassion is
just a concern to enhance the welfare of
others for a need it's different from
other concepts like empathy
understanding another person's mind a
feeling of love of humanity or pity or
the like you guys know that it's a
concern for the welfare of others and to
be honest
compassion hasn't fared well in Western
thought there have been very vocal
critics of this all-important emotion
like Immanuel Kant was not a big fan of
compassion he felt as I stayed here in
point three it was way it's just way too
subjective and it moves around
unpredictably to be an ethical principle
which is sort of one of the many
critiques levied against compassion but
Darwin thought it was our primary
instincts and Karan Armstrong how many
of you guys have read for an Armstrong
great religious historian writes about
the historical development of different
spiritual traditions said at the heart
of spiritual traditions 2,500 years ago
cultural traditions is compassion is
building up this emotion that enables
you to take care of others in
cooperative relationships okay so any
deep historical questions or cultural
observations about emotion the bad is
stronger than the good compassion yeah
sure
yeah yeah what a insightful question
group selection is the idea that we have
properties that have been shaped by
evolution because they gave certain
groups right cro-magnons add advantages
in fending or competing against other
groups Neanderthals it's a very
controversial thesis as you very
astutely observed Darwin believed in it
or implicitly fell out of favor and then
if you really want to track it David
Sloan Wilson and Eliot sober are writing
about how certain properties of the
human psyche like our interest in beauty
may be shaped by group selection that it
helps groups do really well I'm agnostic
about it I I think I think it it is
useful but it's gonna be very hard to
get the data that show that you need
that idea to explain some kind of part
of human nature but but excellent
observation yeah you
yeah you know but even the comparisons
with them like if you just look at the
the length at which it takes to reach
independence and mature it's a it's just
a much slower trajectory they are born
more premature you're right but it just
takes them a shorter period of their
lifespan to reach the age of viability
yeah
so push it one step further so I'm not
quite following right right yeah viruses
and like right yeah yeah I think that is
the psychological origin in the belief
is that it's a fear of toxic
contamination but it doesn't it doesn't
we've over extended that idea to think
that that is just the state of nature
and the human being is that all of our
bad tendencies are more robust and
they're a lot of new data that'll survey
that suggests that's wrongheaded so yeah
it does that's right and that's my
mission at the greater good science
center is to do that work all right
excellent questions Wow so about ten
years ago I started to do to take
Darwin's thesis seriously and to get
interested in this emotion of compassion
that the great thinkers from Aristotle
to Confucius to the Buddha on down have
been interested in since time immemorial
but for some reason scientists because
of this bad is stronger than good bias
forgot to look at this all-important
emotion of compassion and so from an
evolutionary perspective and this is
really relevant to the work you guys are
doing and I'm sure you've have very
sophisticated thinking I'd love to hear
about this here's the question that was
implicit in some of your comments which
is all right how in the world from an
evolutionary perspective from a game
theoretic perspective or when you start
to model the spread of genetic
tendencies in populations how could a
compassionate strategy where you're
really invested in the welfare of others
at the expense of the self how could
that take hold in social groups and then
genetically encoded into the human
organism and evolutionists like David
I'm glad you mentioned group selection
Elliott sober is terrific on this Robert
Axelrod the evolution of cooperation you
may have read and others say and and
Robert Frank you really need to honor
three or four principles for pro-social
strategies to start to prevail in the
competition of other strategies in our
evolutionary past one you got to find
the good that you got to reliably
identify what is truthful and good right
to interact with that kind of individual
to maybe
compassion is really contagious and if
it's contagious it will reset our social
orientation to allow for more
cooperative behavior it just switches us
from a self-interested mindset to a more
cooperative mindset three maybe it'll
change how we do the calculus of giving
and being altruistic to make it easy and
to reduce the constraints of giving and
then for maybe we can use solid
evolutionary argument to say actually
people who are pro-social or
compassionate fare better in the classic
tasks of evolution and all I'll say on
this one is it's so fascinating the
number one what do you think in a survey
of 37 nations and 10,000 people what's
the number one attribute the deepest
human universal people look for in a
mate how'd you guess this is like a
Rorschach test you got to be careful
when you answer
reasonably symmetric feature there you
go
number one beauty the big big lot of
drama about sex differences in beauty
men like it more than women it's about a
two on a three point scale kindness is
two point eight seven
it just trumps around the world and and
for very solid evolutionary reason yeah
it is but you're advocating we have to
come clean and I'm totally with you
you're speaking my language that's why I
hope that so so these are some
principles but there I'll show you some
new data we have that say it pays to be
good okay
so I'm gonna go on a Darwinian voyage
with you in search of this most
pro-social of a swath of human nature
will call compassion and I'll start I
did a lot of work with Paul Ekman who's
kind of the progenitor of lie to me this
showed you you know did all this facial
expression work so as a young scientist
I got really excited because it turns
out when people are feeling compassion
right I thought well let's find that
reliably identifiable signal when people
feel compassion that is the muscle
movement in the face that they do which
is a little oblique eyebrow it's two
muscles that pull your eyebrows up and
in I took this to different parts of the
world to damnit that's that's pretty
good
I took it to different parts of the
world like India Japan the Philippines
to see if it's a universal Darwinian
signal of compassion they look my
participants looked at that and they
said compassion gee she looks like she's
confused
she's doing a Sudoku puzzle she's a
little constipated
that's not compassion and I was I failed
so it is not in the face the voice we
put so much emphasis on the face the
voice is our richest modality our most
primate specific modality of emotion
communication for interesting
evolutionary reasons with little
half-second sounds we can communicate
about 20 emotions we and we've done this
work in my lab you guys ready
give you a test this is the latest sound
that might preteen soon-to-be pubescent
daughter gives to me on almost anytime I
opened my mouth or put on a piece of
clothing see if you guys know what this
means right I'm like hey what's wrong
with teens they're kind of cool they're
comfortable I got bad knees you know but
we have this amazing vocal Rhett
repertoire of emotion sounds and indeed
they're not there it's actually one of
the five primate signals little primates
actually when babies approach have this
thing they call coos or gern's or right
it kind of sounds like our sigh and
we've done research soon to be published
that if I asked you this would be
interesting for your guys technologies
which is if I ask you just to use a
sound to communicate an emotion and then
I present those sounds to people in
different parts of the world what you
can see is that people are pretty good
at picking up compassion with sounds it
sounds like a sigh oh right and we have
amazing bandwidth in communicating
things like amusement and awe now you
may be surprised to discover and I'm a
little disheartened by this when people
try to communicate love it was a
disaster and and yet again humans have
this problem but but but that's not part
of today's talk so we're pretty good at
that but the real language of compassion
is touch you know there is a stunning
new science of touch that I try to
synthesize with these crazy slides here
but I'll work through really quickly a
simple touch on your forearm if I
touched adityas forearm it would
activate a part of the brain it's
involved in processing of rewards called
the Oberto frontal cortex
it's a basic reward it releases oxytocin
which we'll talk about touch if you get
the right kind of touch in a classroom
pat on the back students are twice as
likely to speak out in class if
librarians hold that touch the hand of a
student checking out a book
the student is twice as likely to return
to the library and not be able to
explain why they like the library right
I don't know if it was kind of good in
here there is amazing new science of
touch showing if I little rat pups that
are touched a lot if they're put into a
mother's environment right reared by a
rat mother called a dam that touches a
lot and grooms a lot that rat pup a year
later has fewer interconnections in the
stress-related part of the brain and a
stronger immune system it is stunning
how powerful much is these that's so
powerful as touch you know you guys know
primates spend the the more
sophisticated the primate the more time
they spend touching to build up trading
relationships and then that little guy
anybody know what that little primate is
on the right ya know I've asked 10,000
people that there was only there only
one person own a little eight-year-old
boy who is a genius at primates he's
like that's a slow loris I was like wow
well what's amazing about the slow loris
is it evolved one finger only that it
uses to groom that's how powerful touch
is in primate evolution and so here's
what we did to capture this in this
crazy study you may have heard about we
had people come to the lab and we wanted
to see if they could communicate these
pro-social emotions through touch as
sort of a signal of compassion and a way
to spread goodness to others
the what we did it's kind of a crazy
study we built this big barrier they we
built a hole in the barrier one person
came in stuck their arm through the hole
and waited then we brought another
participant to the lab and we gave them
a list of emotions that we said touch
that forearm and that person has to
guess what just happened right to try to
communicate gratitude or love or
compassion anger fear and so on so you
know there you are you get touched in
the forearm you're
okay I think that was gratitude those
are remarkable identification rates in
that graph chance guessing we had 12
emotions in this study was about 8.5%
they're getting compassion at 60% in
high touch cultures my student went to
Spain the u.s. is a low touch culture
one graphic on that just for you guys to
take home and think about when friends
talk to each other one researcher found
English friends touched each other
0 times American friends twice Puerto
Rican friends in the same unit of time
180 times I think most of our health
care problems I've ridden op-eds on this
that have all been rejected you know
Berkeley professor thinks you know put
aside all this public option stuff just
go out and touch each other you know but
oh well but you know it's it's it's
impoverished my friend my student took
it to Spain they were much better at it
did a more sophisticated language of
this we've gotten into a whole language
of touch one finding that's under review
but I'll tell you about it we coated the
touch of NBA teams and basketball
players have a great language of touch
that's really friendly and my favorite
unit of that touch is the but is the
flying shoulder bump and then the head
slap and that's when they're really
getting along and cooperating they slap
each other in the head but what you see
here is great the ability to communicate
compassion through touch and this is so
vital for the male-female dynamic we had
to gender differences that you'll have
to meditate on and they are we had all
gender combinations of touching and
being touched when women try to
communicate anger to a man he had no
idea what she was doing and he got zero
right
I was like no you got to analyze that
data again I don't believe it it got you
know and then when the man tried to
communicate compassion to a woman she
got zero right she had no idea what he
was up to and she would say things like
I don't think that was a human hand I
think that was a slug that dropped onto
my arm and you know and I'm like ah and
a therapist I gave it he almost was in
tears he's like this is the entire
dynamic where men are like I truly care
for you pinch or whatever they're doing
so did you have a question or comment
yeah yeah yeah well you know we I've
given you the pro-social side and and
there hasn't been as much systematic
study on you know what firm pinches do
or but obviously you know our bet is
that just as pro-social touch as
processed with certain sensory receptors
in your skin which goes to your cortex
and says this is trusting clearly no
one's done this study and it'd be a
great study which is really aggressive
touch probably activates amygdala and
then the cortisol system but no one's
done that that would be very important
data to have so all right so let me just
round out our two points compassion has
a signal in the Darwinian sense through
touch voice it has spread through this
amazing language of touch that predates
the spoken language and semantics and I
think is the language of moral
connection and Trust and then there are
a lot of neat new data on how powerful
you guys have I'm sure are working on
this and probably have a lot of data
would be interesting for someone like me
to look at but how fast goodness spreads
and pro-sociality stress spreads through
basic their findings for newborns will
cry when they hear another baby cry but
not their own distress call have you
guys heard about Christakis at harvard
his social network stuff unbelievable
data he has a new book out called kin
if I am feeling kind first of all he
finds positive emotion he studies the
spread of everything in a community in
Massachusetts obesity spreads cigarette
smoking spreads depression is contagious
and what he has recently found is
happiness in kindness spreads more
powerfully to through social networks
than negative stuff which is interesting
with respect to some of the comments he
had earlier one of the great findings is
just recent and I'll build on it later
if I'm feeling kind and considerate and
I interact with Aditya he he gets a
boost in that feeling he goes to another
part of his physical space has an
interaction that person is more
pro-social and I haven't even interacted
with them right and you guys know this
well this is your business but now we're
getting great data on the potency of how
that spreads okay so that's the MBA
touching study the I have just a couple
of we're right on track will have good
five ten minutes for open-ended
discussion and if you have other
questions as we move through this so so
I hope what I've convinced you of and
we've moved quickly is there is this
signal in a new paper we have coming out
we show how primates hunter-gatherers
all the right kind of evolutionary
approaches show that in the primate
Darwinian language of emotion we have
this compassionate behavior the Darwin
wrote about that science is starting to
document and it is compassion is very
powerfully contagious so the third
barrier to getting compassion encoded as
a stable strategy in the human
repertoire is to and and economists and
so philosophers and early-game
theoreticians wrote a lot about this
which is it's clear there are a lot of
boundary conditions there a lot of
constraints upon acting altruistically
right you can be exploited you can give
resources and lose resources which
becomes consequential
within impoverished environments or
resource deprived environments the
Machiavelli ins of the world the guys
who are out to screw other people can
find the good people and say yeah I'm
gonna be I'll give you back later on and
take advantage of you right there are a
lot of constraints to acting
altruistically and so the way that the
game theoreticians of reason about this
is that you have to change the calculus
the mental calculations of being good
and find rewards in it or change the
sense of the person you're giving to and
there are stunning new data coming out
of the neuroscience world finding that
for example if I cooperate with you and
you're a stranger it activates a part of
the brain you've probably heard about
the ventral striatum which is in the
middle of the brain loaded up with
dopamine receptors right my act of
cooperation downstream triggers the
physiology of reward there's a more
recent study by Harbaugh and colleagues
showing that if I sacrifice for you it
has the same neurological downstream
consequences where I give to you
I know self-interest has been risked but
the nucleus accumbens and ventral
striatum light up and the dopamine is
rewarding that altruistic behavior
that's pretty amazing that it's
inherently rewarding to give which will
change it the the costs of giving but
I've been really interested in this one
really that Peter Singer the ethicist
wrote about which is another way that we
make kindness and goodness and
cooperation easier is by changing our
sense of the other people in our
environment that we assume if we're the
same it's easier to give to similar
people Peter Singer wrote about this
amazing capacity for humans to expand
our sense of who we care about our
circle of care Steve Pinker has written
about how that is a major trajectory in
human history is expanding who we
consider to have rights and worthy of
respect so we've done study
where we activate compassion and people
were doing neuro scientific studies of
this we show images of harm and
suffering and what you find when you
feel that is the blue bar is compassion
and and we ask them how similar are you
to 20 different groups right all kinds
of different groups farmers Republicans
Democrats terrorists lawyers medical
practitioners god forbid Stanford
undergrads these are Berkeley undergrads
like Oh am i similar to that first uh
you know but what you for they object to
that right especially since we placed
just below Stanford and football but
what's great is compassion activates
this sense of similarity to people who
are vulnerable pride does the opposite
it makes you feel like oh I have a lot
in common with the doctors over there
but less so with the homeless compassion
has the opposite effect what compassion
also does I'm totally flipped out about
this part of our nervous system which
will sort of set the stage for our final
part of our day how many of you heard of
the vagus nerve okay that's that's
amazing that's a how in the world did
you find out about it
right it kind of slows down dropped your
blood pressure like this is exactly why
I studied it with respect to compassion
yeah I didn't know that but that's not
why I start why I'm showing you this
picture so the vagus nerve is this
fascinating part of our nervous system
it's evolving painting I didn't know is
involved in hiccups but and there's an
argument that actually evolution must
build up this bundle of nerves over
mammalian evolution because it helps us
take care of others and find beauty in
the goodness of others if you want to
get lofty and poetic but let's just deal
with some basic biological facts the
vagus nerve starts at the top of your
spinal cord near the pons at a part of
your brainstem that controls breathing
and basic biological function it comes
out of your top your spinal cord and it
influences muscles involved in
vocalization muscles involved in
postural movements like head nods and
postural orientation and then it winds
its way down to your heart and your
lungs and it coordinates the flow those
two biological rhythms the vagus nerve
helps your heart rate vary as your
respiration varies right and that's
actually how we measure it I don't know
if you did this work that he can in
James's lab over at Stanford but you can
measure activation in the vagus nerve by
looking at how your heart rate changes
in very its variation with your
respiration pattern
it's a classic synchrony of the two
rhythms Steve Porges has made the case
that the vagus nerve is unique to
mammals it helps you orient to others
and slows your heart rate down we now
are finding that when the vagus nerve
fires it stimulates oxytocin receptors
networks maybe this is part of the
caretaking system that Darwin started to
speculate for
early on when I show people slides like
I just showed you of suffering you get a
vagus nerve response which is
interesting and there's that finding
increased change in RSA or respiratory
sinus arrhythmia which is vagus nerve
correlates with my feeling of compassion
and feeling unconnected to diverse other
groups and it is part as we'll see later
of this basic pro-sociality now the
vagus nerve when we start to map this
good system that Google should be
turning on in more of our human citizens
the vagus nerve activates this little
chemical called oxytocin I bet a lot of
you have heard about oxytocin it used to
be a mystery about 15 years ago it's
involved in breastfeeding uterine
contractions milk letdown when you eat
chocolate you get a little burst of
oxytocin when the baby comes out of that
narrow birth canal and its head is
shaped like a trapezoid it looks like
it's come out of a boxing match and the
mom looks head it goes he was the most
beautiful thing in the world
that's oxytocin surging through her
bloodstream you know give and with that
yeah it's like God I don't know if that
one's mine it has dark hair that's
because he has 1/7 the rate of oxytocin
as women I regret to tell you if you
give oxytocin to have you guys heard
about this work there are trust games
which will figure prominently at the end
of my talk in four minutes or five
minutes you have two strangers playing
this economic game called the trust game
you one of them gets money ten bucks
they give some lump sum to the other one
that value of the gift triples and the
person gives back German scientists who
get to study oxytocin in the lab we
can't here in the United States I don't
know that's the FDA or but if you give
oxytocin to the giver in the game as you
see on the Left bar 50% of them give
away all their money it's unprecedented
that's a baseline control all right
they're like they with this oxytocin
they go you're beautiful man here you go
they give it away so Google should be
doing some oxytocin work so in my lab we
got interested in oxytocin in its
relationship to a close cousin of
compassion which is devoted love which
actually we can pull apart from
compassion which is whole other inquiry
you know this is my one of my favorite
painters yonce teen who was is a
contemporary of Vermeer didn't quite get
the fame of Vermeer he's a little bit
rougher but I actually think more you
know coming out of 17th century Holland
that that middle he's such it's so
interesting how few paintings there are
in Western art of positive emotion most
of it is you know you know but anyway
that's neither here nor there but this
gets it all if I saw this before I did
all my 15 years of science I'd stop
because he got it all this has the whole
spectrum of positive emotion the lustful
kiss right up there that got in the far
left he's trying to kiss the young mate
and the beautiful laugh the lute player
looking referentially up into the ether
as he plays music and then Yann Steen
the painter always paints himself he's
on the left-hand side there he's wearing
that funny-looking hat he's kind of
drunk and he's laughing because he had a
tragic life and then his second wife
right there is displaying the beautiful
displays of love that I'm going to show
you correlate with oxytocin relief that
primates do when they're cooperating
which is you tilt your head probably the
vagus nerve you do open-handed gestures
nice smile you show that luscious area
vulnerability the neck which evokes this
caretaking response in others from an
evolutionary perspective now I asked
nine-year-olds in a summer camp that I
teach at I teach them Charles Darwin
what does love look like just to start
my scientific inquiry on these how it
was and here's what we get that guy on
the right-hand side first grader second
grader Austen he kind of has a dramatic
young fell and he kind of gets it right
he's the first guy that ever kissed my
daughter I'm in first grade math I was
helping out a math after he complete his
math exercise right in front of me he
went right up to her I gave her a smooch
on the cheek you go
I was like what's going on here right
as you can see women have a massive
advantage in the pro-social realm
her display is perfect it's got the head
tilt the little open-handed gestures
she's about to give it she got a little
nervous pinch there that's a beautiful
smile I have to worry about that dude
right there look at that I literally
said what does love look like click
anyway
I'm like Ashton you're 9 years old man
you don't have any testosterone in your
body stop that so so there is looking at
that
so my former student John Gonzaga who
now runs research at a harmony he turned
down the Ivy League professorships to do
to do that but can't win them all he we
got interested in is there a skew of
love that correlates with oxytocin
release this great progenitor of
cooperation and we compared it to sexual
desire a good comparison in the
Darwinian sense primates including
humans do a lot of things just prior to
copulation try to think back till you're
late anyway I won't test on that they
pucker their lips they lick their lips
they bite their lips after I did this
research I discovered I have a senior
female colleague whenever she talks to
me
she pathologically lips her licks her
lips I'm like back off right primates do
a lot of open-handed gestures head tilts
and smile displays when they want to
groom and affiliate and be trusting and
so I don't have time we validated our
love cues those nice open-handed
gestures and head tilts correlate with
feelings of love but this is the
oxytocin story which is we had women
recalling an experience of connection
with another person they showed a lot of
these Darwinian cues of nice head tilts
and open-handed gestures versus the
sexualized lip licks and lip puckers we
drew blood at UC San Francisco we
assayed oxytocin in the bloodstream
which you get a clear measure of 15
minutes after this measurement and what
you find is the love cues map to ox
pretty cool so finally let me just tell
you does it pay to be good and I have
another really neat finding to convey to
you just hot off the presses the you
know I think this research starts to
show that compassion is it's as robust a
part of the nervous system as the
fight-or-flight parts that you guys all
know about cortisol Magdala and the like
the HPA axis that Robert Sapolsky at
Stanford in his genius work has captured
I think we're starting to paint a
picture of this pro-social nervous
system but does it pay to be good and
needless to say what I can tell you is
if you are pro-social you fare better in
the mating market that's pretty good
solid evidence for pro-sociality as an
evolutionary strategy if you are
pro-social you have richer friendship
networks young kids who are pro-social
have better friendship networks which is
good evidence for an evolutionary claim
that this evolved if you are pro-social
your offspring fare better on almost
every health indicator and when the data
are done we'll find that the high
oxytocin parents have kids who are just
more robust physically and in an
evolutionary framework would be less
likely to die a third of our offspring
died in earlier evolutionary times and
that pro-sociality clearly was a
protective device that is just the basic
mechanics of evolution but does it pay
to be good so here's what we did and we
haven't published this so we're still
working on it but we one way to ask the
question is what game theoreticians did
in all the prisoner's dilemma game work
that you've probably heard about where
you just get a person you turn them
loose in a competition almost a
Darwinian competition with other
strategies and you see how they do right
and there's famous work on this and we
got interested in do people with high
vagus nerve activation you know who are
more pro-social are they going to fare
better in this kind of competition
earlier work we've done has shown if you
have high vagus nerve activation at a
baseline setting and I'm waiting for
Google or somebody to have the the I you
know the the iPhone app where you put
your finger on it and somehow you
measure vagus nerve it's I'm not sure we
could do it but but if you have high
vagal tone in a resting setting right
you're just sitting there and I measure
it in our lab six months later you're
kinder more outgoing more positive
emotion better physical health and the
like lots of pro-social profiles so
here's what we did we took participants
who had high vagal tone and low vagal
tone and the low vagal tone people tend
to be more competitive and Machiavelli
and and a little bit more prone to
hostility of the like a different kind
of strategy certainly part of our
evolutionary story we had 50 of those
people half of them high vagal tone half
low and they played a tournament with no
I'm sorry we had 12 people six high
vagal six low vagal play in a tournament
with fifty other people with a trust
game where are 50 participants saw
videotape only 20 second long 20 seconds
long of the six high vagal people the
six low vagal people and then they had
to make a really simple decision you've
got limited resources how much do you
give to each of those other people on
the assumption they'll give back to you
right you got to make a classic
evolutionary decision who do I trust
half of them or the more pro-social high
vagal people half or the low vagal
people all they saw this is what's
remarkable was the higher low vagal
person on video just listening to
someone else talk right this is not a
lot of information there okay what's my
gut feeling is that going trustworthy
and what you find is that what this
graph tells us is if I have high vagal
tone and other people look at me they in
to ative Lee trust me they make that
Gladwell Yin snap judgment if I trust
that guy or that woman and they're more
likely to give you resources if you are
you have this high vagal tone profile
pro-social physiological profile leads
to a quick judgment of trust and then
that trust makes me give more resources
to that individual pretty interesting
just 20 seconds of behavior and I can
pick it up and say this is why I should
give resources too and we know that's a
wise decision because that kind of
person is more likely to cooperate more
likely to altruistically and the like it
pays to be good
let me round out and then we'll open up
for tea these are ways of estimating the
relationship between each of those
variables right does high vagal tone
predict judgments of trust at the tea
chest yes it does and then does that
trust predict more resources given and
then that final loop is the mediational
link in this statistical pathway okay
finally and I really appreciate your
your patience and attention my lab
thanks to Sarina Rodriguez who's now a
professor she came out of Sapolsky lab
at Stanford really knows genetics and so
many interesting things going on here
well lo and behold on the third
chromosome there is a oxytocin genetic
polymorphism right and what we know is
that oxytocin this this part of the
third chromosome helps build up oxytocin
receptors in different parts of the
brain which help us connect and care and
take care of others right we know if you
have a particular polymorphism the a a
combination you're more likely to be
autistic and suffer from asperger's
condition or B have that as part of your
profile and the gee-gees this other
combination are more likely to be
altruistic and so Serena did a some
snips of the DNA of 200 Berkeley
undergrads and what we measured was a
fascinating
tests developed by Simon baron-cohen
you may have heard of he is the less
famous relative of Sacha Baron Cohen
he's a cousin Simon baron-cohen used to
be a hero in our field until his cousin
became Sacha Baron Cohen but he
developed this what's called the mines
in the I task which is you get 36
pictures of eyes and then you and the
eyes are configured it according to
different muscle movements and you have
to read what emotion is in the eyes
right
it is tough stuff I'm not very good at
it even though I've trained to code
faces so that would be you know
incredulity or whatever
it's a classic measure of empathy and if
you have this oxytocin gene that's on
the more pro-social profile you make
fewer mistakes on that task it's and
she's got this whole set of data on this
which is fascinating okay so all I'll
say is our science you know here's some
a Darwin's quote on how this instinct
for care is part of our strongest
evolved instincts the Dalai Lama of
Tibetan Buddhism argues that compassion
is is wired into the basic state of
human nature Paul Ekman gave a talk at
our Center and he and we saw some video
he's just published a book with the
Dalai Lama and he went up to him and he
said you know it's interesting your
holiness
Charles Darwin actually felt as well
that sympathy was our strongest instinct
like you and the dalai lama laughed and
said i guess that makes me a Darwinian
which is not a bad state of wisdom and
we've got a lot going on at our center
that you guys should tap into if you're
interested in this science so let's I
really want to hear much more what you
guys have to say or what you're thinking
about thank you so much
questions for comments or last thing
you've got listed on this slide is an
emotion training tool is that for
autistic gasp burgers oh my god anybody
your employee would real uh we in my lab
we have Paul Ekman has a tool that
teaches you how to read micro
expressions seven emotions in one hour
of training you can teach people to be
better at detecting lies you can you can
train up Asperger's individuals to be a
little bit better at reading emotion
seven emotions we have 20 emotions
represented in the face the best library
of those faces in the world and we have
15 emotions represented in the voice and
so we are just beta testing a system
that teaches kids teachers you know
adults citizens how to learn about this
important language and it's it's going
to be awesome and we love to talk to you
about it so you alluded to this I think
a little bit but this this innate
kindness or compassion it's it seems to
be fragile in that when you scale it up
right and in some sense do you think the
proper view is that we have institutions
like religion and other social groups to
like help maintain this in the
population or do you think yeah that the
in-group verses out group kind of
feelings that creates that actually is a
net negative over what it what it could
be yeah
what a what a deep question and I think
you should be asking the question that I
didn't really address here which is
what's the role of institutions right in
in cultivating us and here's how I think
about it which is that the human nervous
system has all these genetically encoded
capacities I've given you one part the
in-group out-group switch is is the most
potent competitor to compassion we know
if you look at a face that's from a
different ethnic category than your own
this is these are liberal Princeton
undergrads the amygdala lights up they
go I don't trust that guy you
though you know they say that they do
and and the task I think a lot of people
feel and there's a lot of vibrant
evolutionary scholarship on how cultural
traditions and institutions take those
capacities and and and just codify them
you know it's fascinating the for
example the capacity for revenge
killings is a human Universal Jared
Diamond wrote about it in The New Yorker
and you have to have a strong state in
place to knock that that system out and
and what Steve Pinker is arguing is
those institutions come out of the the
raw materials of this compassionate
tendency right
the idea of rights that you have harm so
that's a great question
it's one of the major critiques of my
work so so some of the causes of being
pro-social or not being pro-social are
genetic
then would we expect to see you know
lower and lower numbers of people who
are not pro social in the gene pool well
I I think you know so how do we think
about the the distribution of these
strategies of the self-interested
aggressive you know we should pull those
apart fear-based strategies versus
compassion and I think they're they're
equally distributed and we need all of
them is Aristotle argued we need the
full repertoire of emotion and but I do
feel when you look at human primates
that we have a wider array of pro-social
tendencies than our primate relatives
and so that has that is one of the big
shifts in in our design so that that
would lend support to the kind of
argument that you're making but I am
something to that sure so um in the
school of personal growth we have here
at Google there's the empathy bootcamp
which is I don't know if you've had a
chance to meet with mango yeah no but
let's eat Thomas Lewis is
it's like um he was here yesterday
giving some give it a giving a talk but
he actually presented some nura some
neuro facility physiological data for
that essentially that as our with the
outer layer called cortex her cortex
grew we've sort of if you
we've moved larger and larger social
groups at a rate that has paralleled the
growth of that the cortex now going from
you know going from the lower mammals up
to primates which have a larger one and
then where they are the argument is that
we're the only ultra social essentially
we're social at a level where we can't
keep track of all of the people were
social with your primate group primates
can keep track of a hundred different
individuals and that's the size of their
social group but we're social you know
millions of people and he blames that on
the cortex right and it's in your
question is exactly where I think in ten
years we'll be able to provide a more
definitive answer which is in these in
this genetic evolution what what did we
get that that really characterizes that
development yeah in terms of the idea of
that institutions like religion and so
forth are basically just maybe co-opting
is a little too strong a word but taking
credit for or codifying things that are
actually evolved into our nervous
systems there seem to be a number of
books around about that yeah I just
finished reading one that I thought was
particularly striking it was religion
explained by Pascal boy a do you know
that book I've heard that I've heard of
the title I don't know it yeah it's well
I recommend it to you it's it's a very
chewy complicated read it's not a fast
read at all I had to read it twice
before I felt like I really understood
it but yeah it's it's it's really
terrific and Robert Wright the evolution
of God would be interesting if you guys
are interested and it's interesting you
know
Karan Armstrong said 2500 years ago as
the great ethical traditions took hold
classical Greek thought into his umber
ism and the like they her thesis is
all of those early institutions grasped
on to our capacity for compassion and
codified it and I think it and religion
would be one variation of that yeah yeah
so their question about the cortex two
questions ago and one of the ones about
religion before that made me wonder if
kind of a way of having the you know
different groups we assign ourselves to
is a way of allowing your cortex to
decide who you're gonna be more
altruistic with and not without having
to individually know that's great like
each person yeah so what do you think
about that I think you're right I have
one personal anecdote which is so we
have like a lot of mailing lists here
like for sale and stuff like that and
I'm much more willing to buy you stuff
and whatnot from another Googler because
I expect a higher standard of
reciprocity yeah you know and and it
turns out you know in this cultural
spread of altruism and compassion which
is part of the subtext of your questions
the reputation of a group which is part
of what you're talking about
hinges critically on will they
reciprocate and do well for you and so I
think you're right thank you for the
time not that I just had a crazy thought
because I first heard of the vagus nerve
from a poet who was talking to who was
that
I would sorry I'm so horrible with names
that's one of the things I study here at
Google's memory because mine so bad but
but I usually recall situations so
something's wrong up here that's more
important but he was talking about how
when he was talking with nearby
biologists that they were just coming up
with some research around vagus nerves
and the linkage with the heart and also
the construct of the vagus nerve being
very similar to brain matter more
draining right I'm sorry brain matter
more than any other nerve that the
construct of the cells within the vagus
no myelination yet yeah so he was just
romancing the notion that it it gives
some sort of background to the whole
idea of the parables of thinking with
our heart or make
decisions with their heart you know it's
so if I would buy one or I should find
one but if I had a neuroscience
colleague at Berkeley was giving a talk
to a class and he had a primates nervous
system and you know there's the spinal
cord you know there's a spinal cord whoa
what's that weird long thing that comes
all the way it goes all the way down to
your gut right
it's the vagus nerve and it is it is the
mind body it is so the question I have
is a strange one but like have you have
you looked at whether if there's a
congenital defect or something wrong
with the vagus nerve whether
intellectually you can still be
compassionate or whether it's a
fulfilling whole body thing right yeah
what a great question we're we in the
world of emotion and morality are
interested in the the rational cortical
parts and then the bodily parts and
ideally they're both operating but
they're going to be people with you know
different kinds of information flow
through the vagus nerve for genetic
reasons or the like that represent a
study a way to study that and I think
that'll be very it's a very very
interesting way to get at the question
of gut feeling in its role in judgment
okay one more question maybe
all right well thank you I have books
here if you do want to buy them for K
but thank you so much it's great to talk
to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
