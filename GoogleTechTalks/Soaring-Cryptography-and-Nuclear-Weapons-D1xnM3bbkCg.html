thrilled to host Martin Hellman as you
probably know but I will remind you all
in case you've forgotten he is professor
emeritus at Stanford University he has
numerous honors for the invention of
public key cryptography he's also an
accomplished glider pilot with strong
concern for nuclear weapons and thus the
title of the talk help me help me in
welcoming him by giving him a warm
applause well thank you Tanya and as
time you said what three of my passions
of soaring flying gliders cryptography
and not nuclear weapons aren't a passion
but making sure we don't use them is and
how could those three possibly be tied
together now the main goal of the talk
is really to talk about nuclear weapons
and which is something most of you
probably haven't heard anybody bring it
up for years if at all it's been with
respect to nuclear terrorism and even
then only very occasionally the threat
of nuclear war between the United States
and Russia is supposed to be your
father's Oldsmobile or maybe your
grandfather's old smo beal and by the
end of the talk i hope you'll see i hope
i've convinced you that the risk is
unfortunately alive and well but
fortunately you can play a role in
helping change that and get the risk
down to an acceptable level now i could
start off the talk with a slide like
that but that is singularly unattractive
right so instead we'll approach the
subject from the point of view of
soaring as the entree I have a plane
just like this it's called a STEMI or
stem ax STS 10 VT motor glider now it
does have an engine but in the maneuver
shown here the engine is stowed and
there's no way the pilot could get the
engine out in time to save himself and
the question is what is he doing and
it's not me because as you'll see in a
minute this is a maneuver I do not do
now this pilot is very experienced has
practiced this maneuver many times takes
any precautions so I'm not saying he
should not be doing it but it's
something that many glider pilots
undertake without really adequate
precaution in in my opinion it's a high
speed low pass in a high speed low pass
the pilot starts about a mile from the
runway and about 1500 feet altitude
depends on the particular glider he then
dives he or she then dives down the
ground coming up at a great rate and
then does a sharp pull back on the stick
so that the glider is flying right
skimming the runway at 150 miles an hour
basically very close to its vieni speed
it's never exceed velocity at the end of
the runway the pilot then does a sharp
pull up can reconverting some of that
speed into altitude about 4 or 500 feet
of altitude so he can turn safely and
land now you might wonder it since
there's no engine in a pure glider and
even in that case there's no time to
deploy the engine how can the pilot be
guaranteed that she'll have enough
altitude at the at the midpoint of that
maneuver to turn safely and land well
the laws of physics provide what seems
like an ironclad guarantee we know how
energy is conserved exactly how altitude
and speed are changed there are losses
due to the glider but those losses are a
known quantity which are factored in so
the laws of physics provide a guarantee
but it's important to read the fine
print in the guarantee the there's a
model that that guarantee assumes and
that is that the air is still now if
there's a slight wind or a slight
updraft or downdraft it doesn't it's a
minor perturbation and instead of doing
150 miles an hour the pilot might be
doing 148 or 152 miles an hour not a
problem but a friend of mine and some of
you here are go I know at least one of
yous a glider pilot this is Kempton as
uno is uno who used to do these
maneuvers doesn't do them anymore
because he had a scare
what happened was he as he started the
dive he hit an unusually strong and
sustained downdraft there was an air
circulation pattern like this that was
setting up and he was in the downdraft
so while he's diving he's also being
pushed down at about a thousand feet a
minute so when he hits the the threshold
or the runway instead of doing 150 miles
an hour he's doing about a hundred and
there's a huge with one-half MV squared
there's a huge difference between a
hundred and a hundred and fifty miles an
hour he was really scared and was afraid
he was going to crash now he's a
fantastic pilot and also he had a lot of
luck he was managed to pull it off
without hurting himself or his glider
but he doesn't do them anymore
now year and a half ago I gave a talk at
the local the Northern California
soaring group it's called Pascoe Pacific
area of soaring counsel at their safety
seminar my talk was called complacency
what me worried and I argued that the
most dangerous maneuvers and soaring
might well be those that are 99.9% safe
at first that sounds like an oxymoron
how can something that's 99.9% safe be
the most dangerous maneuver well in
general aviation and in fact in flying
in general the opposite of safe is often
dead I mean there are intermediate
states where you only get hurt or the
plane only gets damaged but there's a
much higher fatality rate in crashes
than in with automobiles for example and
if it's 99.9 percent safe and the
alternative is death what's the
probability that you kill yourself one
in a thousand one tenth of one percent
that doesn't sound so good it's totally
equivalent but it's that'd mean you can
begin to see why it's not particularly a
safe maneuver if it is 99.9 percent safe
worse if you do a maneuver that's 99.9
percent safe a hundred times in the
course of your flying career and high
speed low passes are something that many
pilots will do about a hundred times in
fact some contest finishes these are
glider races require a low pass although
there's a move within the community to
change to a higher altitude finish so
that things are safer but if you do it a
hundred times in the course of your
flying career and there's one chance in
a
of killing yourself each time that's a
10% fatality rate which helps explain
why every once in a while I read about
one of these night what maneuvers that I
argued might be 99.9% safe I don't know
the exact number but something on that
order and an experienced pilot who's
done that many times before is
inexplicably killed doing it and what
happened no one knows I think it was
just the tail of the distribution and
with the economic crisis were in right
now people are realizing that the tails
of distributions are fatter than most
people give them credit for it's the
Black Swan type idea now a similar law
just like the laws of physics are
invoked to tell the glider pilot that
she'll be able to land safely doing that
high-speed low-pass there's a law of
nuclear deterrence that is invoked by
most people to feel comfortable about
the fact that we have roughly 25,000
nuclear weapons in the world today
that's come down quite a bit from
roughly 75,000 20 years ago but it's
still a horrendous number and the basic
idea it's called
mutually assured destruction if we would
attack the Russians if the Russians were
to attack us then the the retaliation
would be so horrendous that both nations
would be destroyed no one in his or her
right mind would start such a mess well
and they point to the fact that only 21
years old between the first two world
wars and yet we've gone 63 years almost
64 without another world war and that's
attributed at least partly and probably
correctly to nuclear deterrence or
mutually assured destruction but it's
important to read the fine print his
nuclear deterrence and 99.9% safe
maneuver or strategy and over what
period of time is it 99.9 percent safe
per day in which case we expect a
catastrophe in three years which would
be horrendous
or is it 99.9 percent safe per year in
which case we expect a catastrophe on
average to occur in a thousand years
which sounds pretty good until I was
talking with Tanya she has a new baby
that has
life expected lifetime of a hundred
years roughly order a magnitude that
would be a 10% risk which is horrendous
you take these babies and you put them
as on their back or their stomach these
days on their backs I mean we go through
all these things for the
one-in-a-million chance that something
will happen to this baby and here's
probably a greater than 10% risk that
most people are ignoring and if you look
at the last 50 years because we only
have had enough weapons to call it
nuclear deterrence for about 50 years
there have been some major near misses
Korea in 50 and 53 were more minor China
Taiwan which by the way could come back
to haunt us today China has a an
emotional attachment to Taiwan that's
comparable to the attachment we would
have if Texas were to follow its state
constitution and secede from the union
and yet we've been shipping weapons to
Taiwan totally oblivious to how this is
and how this impacts the main mainland
China in Berwyn in 1961 there was a
standoff American tanks and Russian
tanks at checkpoint charlie
each had orders to fire if fired upon
thank God a car didn't backfire
the most serious event was almost surely
the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and
I'll go into that in more detail for
that reason Mideast wars in the 50s as
the 67 war even and but 73 war there's
some evidence may have been almost as
dangerous as the Cuban Missile Crisis in
some ways able Archer is something
almost no no one's heard about how many
of you have heard of able Archer okay
about 10% in 1983 this was in the first
Reagan term in office first Reagan
administration now there's a big
difference between the first
administration in the second and the
second he made friends with Gorbachev
and there was a lot of nice talk and the
world got a lot safer but in the first
administration those of you old enough
to remember that was when for a mic test
mics off mr. president say anything you
want
okay I've outlawed the Soviet Union the
bombing begins in five minutes was his
mic test
fortunately or unfortunately the mic was
live and we the whole world heard that
but there was that kind of attitude even
if that had not occurred even if that
had not become public knowledge and
Reagan was in many ways just more honest
about our nuclear weapons policy
President Carter who won the Nobel Peace
Prize actually put in place the plans
for building the Euro missiles which
Reagan it did admittedly accelerated and
got a lot of flack for and so Reagan was
not so much more reckless than previous
presidents as perhaps more honest than
previous presidents and for that I think
we owe him a debt of gratitude anyway
his honesty scared it scared something
out of the Russians and and drop of who
was in charge of the Soviet Union at
this point in time became paranoid
according to gates as memoirs from the
shadows which I strongly recommend to
you this is the current Secretary of
Defense but when you go back and read
what Reagan was saying whether was
paranoia or legitimate fear is an open
question and drop up became paranoid
according to gates that Reagan felt that
he could execute a successful first
strike against the Russian missiles that
is we had enough power with that we
could knock out the Russian missiles on
the ground before they could ever get in
the air and we would win a nuclear war
with the Russians and be unscathed now
to do something like that would require
tremendous coordination and a lot of
communications flowing which the
Russians would of course notice and so
the the Russians concluded that if the
Reagan were to do this he would do it
under the guise of a military exercise
but but the exercise would just be a
madam at the the cover for the real
operation able Archer was exactly such a
an exercise to practice the coordinated
release of all NATO nuclear weapons in
1983 and how close we came is not clear
but gates seems to feel that it may have
even been comparable to the Cuban
Missile Crisis so is the threat of
nuclear war well let's say I haven't got
quite yet okay yeah is the threat of
nuclear war our fathers or grandparents
Oldsmobile is it a thing of the past
that was then isn't the Cold War over
well let's read the fine print there's
many many places where fine print
appears in the deterrence guarantee but
perhaps the most important is the NATO
Charter which says an attack on one NATO
nation shall be considered an attack on
them all in May of last year just a year
ago I noticed an article in The Wall
Street Journal I've been focused on
Estonia as the possible flashpoint for
reasons that have become clear in the
next bullet but in May I started paying
attention to Georgia because The Wall
Street Journal had this article buried
deep in the newspaper because it's the
place it's the news that no one wants to
read because it it who's worrying about
that and it said it warned that Russia
and Georgia were close to war this was
over the Russian downing of a Georgian
reconnaissance drone that had flown in
and through a no-fly zone without
adequate warning so maybe the Russian
the Russians denied shooting it down of
course we denied that the u2 that Gary
Powers flew over Russia was an American
plane so this lying is not something
that uniquely the Russians do it's
something all nations do on things like
this and of course just two and a half
months later August 7th war did break
out it surprised most people but if you
were watching you could see the tremors
that preceded these earthquakes and
somewhat surprisingly although maybe not
surprisingly but but but very
dangerously most Americans when that war
broke out called for admitting Georgia
to NATO even more rapidly now how that
works out in terms of our safety is an
interesting question on my website which
I'll give you the URL for at the end of
the talk there I have on the resource
tab there are a number of emails I sent
out around this time to people who had
asked for updates and I have quotes from
Reagan advisers and Nixon advises so not
you know left-leaning
liberals who basically say Georgia
started that war
and if the United States wanted to pick
a country of less strategic importance
to us that would be hard to find one
with less strategic importance than
Georgia and it would be hard to and it
was ruining our relations with Russia we
had many strategic interests that were
being really hurt by this incorrect view
of the situation but if Georgia comes
into NATO and this would happen again we
would be treaty bound to attack the
Russians I mean let's get serious about
this this is real this is not something
that we should do without really
thinking it through and by the way as we
speak
NATO exercises are going on in Georgia
over great objections from the Russians
imagine how we would feel if the Warsaw
Pact still existed and there were wall
so our pact exercises going on in Mexico
or even Venezuela or Cuba now a year
earlier in April 2007 this is one of the
things that got me focused more on
Estonia which is still a potential
flashpoint it's just not in anyone's
radar screen weary few people's radar
screens Estonia has a population that is
one-third ethnically Russian that moved
there during the Soviet era and the
Estonians are playing payback they are
subjugating the Russians roughly the
same way the Russians subjugated the
Estonians there's some objections to
that we can talk about that later
Amnesty International has a report out
on the human rights abuses in that
country now I was in Estonia in 73 I saw
the other side of it I saw what the
Russians were doing to the Estonians the
bottom line is whoever is responsible
there Estonia is a member of NATO and
this was a cyberattack and NATO Estonia
viewed it as comparable to September
11th and they was questioning within
NATO if Russia wasn't clear who had
attacked although those strong
suspicions had emanated from Russia if
Russia had physically attacked
communications in a stone yet then NATO
would obviously have to respond if it's
a if it's a cyber attack what's the
difference and by the way in all this I
should point out that 1991 Gorbachev
thought he was given assurances
NATO would never expand beyond the West
German border and so the Russians feel
somewhat double-crossed in this whether
or not he's Russians are right in
feeling that way I'll leave up to you to
discover there's some reading I can
suggest it was Secretary of State Baker
who made the statement let's examine the
1962 Cuban Missile Crisis because that
is a oh and so the point of the last
slide is the threat did not go away with
the end of the Cold War Estonia
Georgia whichever view you take as to
who's at fault there or potential flash
points for costilla's between the United
States and Russia Pakistan is another
possibility if that country continues
its descent into chaos both Russia in
the United States might well send troops
in to secure the nuclear weapons you now
have American and Russian troops in a
potential battle zone not a good
situation
now the Cuban Missile Crisis surprised
almost everybody it seemed to come out
of nowhere
but again just like the Georgian war
surprised people it's because they
weren't paying attention to the warning
signs the sequence of steps there were
many but the key ones were 1958 Castro
comes to power in Cuba the American
government almost immediately sees him
as a potential communist threat an
interesting thing is according to the
Russians themselves and I can give you
references at the end it's boro boro
otsuki's book about Khrushchev Castro
was not a communist Raul was his brother
but Fidel was not a communist until we
according to this account until we
basically pushed him into the Russians
arms but we treated him that way and
this created tremendous antagonism which
led in 1961 to a failed invasion attempt
the Bay of Pigs which created problems
on both sides it made the Cubans and the
Russians very fearful of a second
American invasion and laid the basis for
one of the reasons Christiane put his
missiles in Cuba but it also made
Americans feel humiliated
Kennedy was humiliated by this mistake
and there was a lot of pressure both
within the executive branch and in
Congress - let's do it right let's send
the Marines an American invasion force a
quarter of a million troops and Excise
the Communist cancer and that Western
Hemisphere once and for all
another the Berlin crisis figured into
but I don't have time to go into how
that happened in 1961 a year before
Khrushchev deployed his missiles in Cuba
we deployed very similar missiles in
Turkey and in fact it was the deployment
of those missiles that was the genesis
in Christians mind of deploying his
missiles in Cuba said if they can do
that why shouldn't we deploy missiles in
Cuba the Bay of Pigs clearly played a
major role too and I've already treated
those points now the question we're
trying to get at is how safe is nuclear
deterrence as a strategy it can be
argued that the Cuban Missile Crisis all
by itself was a 50% safe maneuver at
least 10% it was no more than 90% safe
in my opinion in terms of war between
the United States and Russia for reasons
you'll see as they indicated there was
strong repeated strong support in this
country for invading Cuba and when the
missiles were discovered that reached a
fever pitch and yet and we didn't know
it at the time and this was not
adequately considered within Kennedy's
advisory group or within Congress when
they learned about this an American
invasion force would almost surely have
been met with battlefield nuclear
weapons that the Russians had on the
island and that we were not totally
aware of we kind we knew there might be
a possibility but we discounted it in
all of our all of our deliberations that
I've seen we all know if you've studied
this that there was a Soviet submarine
that was running the American naval
blockade and it was forced to surface
that we knew in 1962 well we didn't know
until many years later is that that sub
carried a nuclear torpedo that the
submarine commander was in a
questionable mental state he was being
he thought he's being attacked
we were sending what we thought was
signaling depth charges but we had told
Moscow what this signalling death charge
is meant but they hadn't been able to
get that information to the submarines
which were in radio silence plus when
you're being rocked by these signaling
depth charges and there's damage to your
physical damage to your submarine you
understandably think you're under attack
believing that he was under attack and
that World War 3 might be going on up on
the surface he gave there are various
accounts because these are all come from
crew members but one of the accounts is
that he gave orders to arm the nuclear
torpedo but was overruled by a battalion
commander who was on board which I
suspect actually may have been a
political officer rather than a naval
officer but again if and if the American
destroyers had been vaporized what would
have happened next does anybody's guess
Kennedy is quoted as saying that after
the crisis subsided that the odds of war
with Russia was somewhere between 1 and
3 and even orders were given for White
House staff to evacuate their families
from Washington or to have them near a
telephone so they could evacuate on a
moment's notice so that's why I say was
it potentially a 50% safe maneuver and
how many of those others what were the
risks and all the others now Kennedy may
have been trying to puff up his own
importance by saying that but he didn't
know about the battlefield nuclear
weapons or the nuclear torpedo when he
said that I think he may have actually
been on the money oh and by the way part
of the secret part of the agreement for
the Russians pulling their missiles out
of Cuba was that we pulled our missiles
out of Turkey but Kennedy insisted that
that be kept secret so it would appear
that he had been the winner in the
crisis and the Democrats did better in
the midterm elections a few weeks later
than they were than they're expected to
do now why Khrushchev agreed to keep it
secret which led to his humiliation and
to some extent maybe a large extent his
removal from power two years later is an
open question maybe it's because he knew
about things like the nuclear torpedo
and the battlefield nuclear weapons and
how dangerous the situation was in dobbs
recent book one minute to midnight he
talks about the chaos of trying to move
those battlefield nuclear weapons on
Cuba in the middle of the night with
lights out
/ so that they could strike one Tana
MoBay and one of the vehicles / turns
into a ravine killing several people and
I think there was a weapon on that
vehicle now but again that was 1962
could nothing like that could possibly
happen today least that's the belief and
we're very wrong there we have been
pushing for about 10 years 8 or 10 years
certainly in the Bush administration to
deploy a missile defense system in
Eastern Europe to protect we say against
potential future Iranian threat of
ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads
the Russians see it differently I'm not
saying they see it right but how they
see it is very important in terms of the
risk that exists Gorbachev who's hardly
a cold warrior just about a year ago
said the whole system is aimed against
Russia and China the Polish government
doesn't help matters because in their
statements trying to sell the system to
their public they are focused on how the
system might be used against the Russian
the new Russian topol-m missiles not
against Iran and so you can see where
the Russians who are listening to what
the poles are saying as well as to what
we're saying they don't believe what
we're saying anyway and this reinforces
it Putin a year and a half ago warned
that similar actions by the Soviet Union
when it put rockets in Cuba precipitated
the Cuban Missile Crisis now I've been
warning about this for about a year
before Putin at least six months in
possibly a year before Putin's comments
and so as I saw this unfold usually I
like to be right but this is one time I
was not happy to be proving proven right
worse last summer there was a potential
Cuban bomber crisis that could have
rivaled the Cuban Cuban Missile Crisis
how many again I suspect almost no one's
heard about this how many of you are
aware of this no just like nobody would
have been aware of the Cuban Missile
Crisis if it had been headed off before
it became the crisis that it was but we
need to watch for these warned
signs in July on July 21st is bestia
which is often used to week official
secrets just like The Washington Post
might be used in this country reported
that an unnamed very high Air Force
official in Moscow said that if the
United States proceeded with the
deployment of the Eastern European
missile defense system Russia would
maintain the viability of its nuclear
deterrent by basing bombers in Cuba with
strategic that is nuclear weapons the
next day and I can give you my website
has references to all these things and
links so you can go back to the original
documents Reuters the next day reported
that general norton Schwartz now the Air
Force chief of staff was in confirmation
hearings at the time was asked about
this and he replied we should stand
strong and indicate that as something
that crosses a red line that's kind of
what the Russians have been saying about
the Eastern European missile defense
system but just as we saw the Turkish
missiles as a good thing because there
were ours and the Cuban missiles in 62
is a bad thing we've got to get our
perception straight here or we're gonna
walk into disaster fortunately two days
later the potential crisis was diffused
when the Russian Defense Ministry
dismissed the early reports as false but
at a minimum I think you can see what's
going on here there's probably a heated
debate within the Russian military over
how to respond to what they see as the
encirclement of Russia by NATO American
bases and basically they see very
hostile actions I'm not saying that we
intend them that way but it's important
for us to recognize how they see it
because that affects how they will
respond we need to know how our
adversaries will respond
maybe they're trying to see what the
opinion of the other side is yeah why do
we hold the questions to the instance
it's being taped and we have microphones
that can be used but that's yes it is it
could have been a feeler but that also
says something's going on there that and
gives an indication of the the risk
nuclear terrorism is a new facet to the
problem that did not exist in the 60s
now the Russians are behaving
irresponsibly with respect to Iran's
nuclear program but before we get too
mad at them we ought to recognize that
we behaved irresponsibly with respect to
Pakistan's nuclear program which is a
horrendous risk right now for many
points of view I mean that country's
descending into chaos the potential for
a regional nuclear war between India and
Pakistan which would produce chaos and
the Islam and the Radical factions
within Pakistan then getting their hands
on some of these weapons and giving them
to al-qaeda is quite possible and we did
that in the 80s because we even violated
our own law to do it because we felt we
needed to Pakistan's cooperation for
getting weapons to the Mujahideen known
today as Osama bin Laden again if you
were reading what was going on I was in
the 80s I knew that these freedom
fighters as we were calling them were
chanting death to America around their
campfires at night but most Americans
were in a war and still are to some
extent in the Charlie Wilson's War
viewpoint of you know let's go kill
Russians and they were freedom fighters
we've got to really get smart about what
we're doing or we're gonna get in big
trouble
what about commercial nuclear power has
another problem with it we have a
program called Atoms for Peace
instituted by Eisenhower which is an
oxymoron in my opinion at least under
the current approach Ted Taylor was one
of this nation's most brilliant nuclear
weapons designers for the first 20 years
of his career and in this when I worked
with him in the 80s he's now deceased he
told me he was trying to undo with the
second half of his life what he had done
with the first half and he told me that
every nation with a commercial nuclear
power reactor is an
state of latent proliferation meaning if
they kick out the inspectors and are we
really going to go to war over someone
kicking out inspectors they are in they
could build at least a crude nuclear
device in six months to two years now
Ted was so good at designing nuclear
weapons that he probably was under
estimating the situation but still I
think it's an indication of the danger
there's an important coupling between
nuclear terrorism and nuclear war a
nuclear terrorist incident that may that
made New York or Moscow or Tel Aviv go
up in smoke would produce chaos and
would move us to a very dangerous
situation where in fact I'll describe
that in a minute so what's to be done
well all the old arguments all the old
approaches have almost as much validity
many of them just as much validity today
as they did 3040 years ago trouble is
people are tired of hearing them so new
approaches are not necessarily needed
but are valuable and I came up with a
new approach about two years ago that
has certain other advantages and which
is where I'm putting all my focus and
which I hope you'll support in ways I'll
explain at the end it's called risk
analysis of nuclear deterrence it's
based on two simple observations which
when combined produce a very surprising
result first observation even minor
changes even small perturbations in our
nuclear weapons strategy like the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty more
rejected by the Senate in the nine-eight
90s as too risky and while Obama is
going to bring it back again there will
be opposition and again they'll say not
testing is too risky even though we
haven't tested in that time now the
thing the other observation is until I
did a preliminary risk analysis which I
published just about a year ago no one
had estimated the risk of nuclear
deterrence failing that's putting those
together is the surprising result
how can rational decisions be made among
alternatives including the status quo if
you don't know the bay
flying risk that we suffer right now my
preliminary analysis and there's a link
to an online version of the paper on the
website we'll give you at the end my
preliminary analysis indicates that the
risk of deterrence failing is at least a
thousand and probably possibly ten
thousand times greater than having a
nuclear power plant built next to let's
say we're all at Google built in
Milpitas equivalently build a nuclear
power plant and mow Peters one in Palo
Alto
you know surround Google with probably
three or four nuclear power plants build
another ring around that keep going
until you've got at least a thousand and
possibly 10,000 that's the risk that
each and every one of us faces according
to my preliminary estimate from nuclear
deterrence failing now in the 80s when I
used to talk on this issue I would use
the diagram shown here
it involves two it's a two-state model
in fact those of you who know some
probability theory it was a two state
Markov model and the current state of
the world is on the left and what I used
to call post-world War three was on the
right you'll see why I call it nuclear
disaster instead right now and I said
that the there was a transition
possibility from our current state of
the world to post-world War three but it
was the state of no return' civilization
would be destroyed so there was no arrow
coming back and if the transition
probability stayed bigger than any fixed
epsilon-not you're absorbed with
probability one but that's not the way I
describe will describe it today or and I
didn't usually describe it then now
people have trouble with this they look
at the current state of the world and
say how could we possibly have a nuclear
war I mean this I don't see any danger
that's because I realized and this is
only my new approach with risk analysis
I realized the current state of the
world really consists of a large number
of sub states and the sub state we're in
right now is probably the one in the
middle that's the one that has does not
have a transition to a nuclear disaster
state and so people are right it's
impossible from the current sub state of
the world not the current state of with
the current sub state to have a nuclear
war but it's possible to put missiles in
Turkey or
in Poland and move one step toward the
brink and it's a sequence of steps and
we're not very good at thinking several
moves out like that and that's what I'm
arguing we need to do and that risk
analysis will help us do I also realized
and this isn't in the online version of
the paper I've only done this more
recently that the nuclear disaster state
also has a number of sub states so for
example a nuclear terrorist incident or
a dirty bomb or a commander a regional
nuclear war between India and Pakistan
things like that move us into the first
state of nuclear disaster which is a
state that allows a return back where
nuclear weapons are not being used the
civilization has not been destroyed but
once enough nuclear weapons have been
used you you as each one is used there's
more risk of escalation and so again to
get to the final state in which
civilizations destroyed would take a
number of steps but but I have to argue
that even the first state in this
nuclear disaster state like New York
going up in smoke or San Francisco is
totally unacceptable if we can avoid it
and I believe we can if we get smart now
there's another piece of the picture
that I just showed which is the current
state of the world is really in the
middle of the super stacker --nt sub
state of the world is in the middle of a
number of super states and it is
possible to make moves to make the world
safer to reduce the risk of disaster for
example I believe not everyone agrees
but ratifying the comprehensive test-ban
treaty would be a good thing and that
would move us one a small step in the
safe direction reducing our weapons from
25,000 worldwide to just a couple of
thousand when again reduced the rest
reducing to a couple of hundred reduced
it even further and we'd still would
have a very credible nuclear deterrent
and so there are a number of stage steps
we can take and so it's important to be
able to envision the inconceivable not
only in the negative direction but it's
equally important maybe even more
important to be able to envision the
inconceivable
in the positive direction because if
people are scared stiff they do nothing
they need to be energized and see that
it's possible to change things and so
some people have ridiculed the Gang of
Four Schultz perry kissinger and none
for their op-eds
in which they pose the vision of a world
free of nuclear weapons they're not
calling for immediate nuclear
disarmament but they're saying we need
to have that as our ultimate goal Harold
Brown and John Deutsch both from
Democratic administrations CIA director
and Secretary of Defense published an a
rejoinder to that called the nuclear
disarmament fantasy in which they argued
that even the aspirational goal of a
world free of nuclear weapons was
dangerous and again I have links to that
on my website and I think that's because
they're thinking about the current state
sub state of the world in the current
sub state of the world it would be
dangerous to get down to just three
nuclear weapons on both sides but for
various reasons but if we make the world
safer and safer and safer then things
that are currently inconceivable and
dangerous might become conceivable and
much safer the state of acceptable risk
must be a state of no return if there's
a return arrow then you have what's
called an ergodic Markov chain and you
and actually the risk in the long run is
not going to be acceptable now we do
have precedents in 1787 when the
American Constitution was written
slavery was written into that in terms
of the both the slave trade going on for
I think another 20 years and the
three-fifths rule how slaves would be
counted
anyone who proposed getting rid of
slavery in 1787 would have been laughed
at as living in Fantasyland but it was
possible through public concern being
developed books being published people
thinking about the issue to eventually
abolish slavery in this country and
interestingly the original abolition the
abolitionists originally had women's
suffrage as part of their platform they
wanted to free black men and give women
the vote at the same time sometime I
think was the 1840s they dropped women's
suffrage
why because they it was viewed that
women's suffrage was so much more
radical than ending slavery so much more
fantastic that if they kept the two
linked it would prolong slavery by
decades and in fact if you look at the
time between the two constitutional
amendments it was 55 years
so again envisioning inconceivable
anyone who proposed taking your vote
away today because you're a woman would
be laughed at just as roundly as people
who proposed giving it to you 200 years
ago and in the same way there are
possibilities for making the world safe
and it's that state of acceptable risk
now I do have to get cryptography in
here since it was in the title in 1971
which was roughly when I started working
in cryptography all my colleagues and I
don't think that's an overstatement told
me I was crazy and they had two good
reasons NSA had a multi-billion dollar
budget for decades how could I hope to
discover something they didn't already
know and if I did anything good they
would classify it both of those
arguments had validity and came back to
haunt me but in hindsight you'd have to
say I was wise to be to be quick to do
the crazy foolish thing and work on it
anyway
but it took a sequence of steps it was
only for a long time people thought I
was crazy fortunately I met with Diffie
and Ralph Merkle and we were able to do
some things and eventually we now have
there's a whole industry based on this
but again it was inconceivable now a
state of acceptable risk what what does
it mean well if the proposed studies oh
the first step the next step in the
process that I'm proposing and you'll
see it on a slide in a minute is for a
group like the National Academies the
National Academy of Science Engineering
and Institute of Medicine to undertake
an in-depth study to either correct or
confirm my preliminary conclusions we
need an objective in-depth study by a
prestigious knowledgeable group and then
that could be used if it confirms my
concern even within an order of
magnitude or two then it could be used
as a vehicle for getting the public
support that's needed for changes in
policy but if I'm right the risk has to
be reduced by at least a factor of a
thousand and maybe 10,000 when
that implies a long-term multistage
process of change it's not going to
happen with the Cold War ending for
example and I was really beside myself
with concern when the public concern in
the 80s evaporated with the end of the
Cold War I knew the problem was not
solved at best we left it to our
children and yet all that concern
evaporated that can't happen again now
some would say that the state of
acceptable risk involves nuclear
abolition getting rid of nuclear weapons
a world free of nuclear weapons maybe
our current president even believes that
based on his speech in Prague last month
Shultz Perry Kissinger and on two
Democrats and two Republicans have
certainly posed it as a vision for the
state of acceptable risk others would
say it's going to take world peace
others would say it's gonna take world
government all three of those tend to
produce derision and arguments about why
they're impossible the nice thing about
calling it a state of acceptable risk I
don't have to describe it explicitly
however we get there's fine if the
abolitionists are right we'll discover
that
further out in the process if the world
peace people right we'll discover that
further out in the process and so on
instead of arguing about the nature of
the end state and whether it's
achievable or not let's focus our
energies on the first step which is
learning how much risk we actually face
today and whether we need to do
something so risk analysis avoids a
major stumbling block which is another
reason I focus my energies here the
advantages of it the first step is in
art in arguable unlike the comprehensive
test-ban treaty which has been rejected
and may well be rejected again as too
risky if anything it's too risky not to
know how much risk we face the later
steps as I've pointed out are implicit
not explicit I don't have to say get rid
of all nuclear weapons I don't have to
say world peace or whatever it is I
think it's going to be it's a state of
acceptable risk if what I think it is is
right we'll discover it further out if
I'm wrong we'll discover that the
sequence of implicit steps leads to a
complete solution if we know if we learn
that the risk is a thousand times too
great then if we have a major advance
that reduces the risk by a factor of
five or ten can we stop no it still
200 times too risky and so I think
that's a very important characteristic
and I also think although I'm I haven't
had success with this I've been doing
this for about a year now I thought that
the first step these risk analysis
studies could unify disparate groups
whether they're working for world peace
whether trying to strengthen the UN or
some other form of world government
whether they're working for nuclear arms
control or abolition understanding the
baseline risk would seem to be a good
place to start okay remember envisioning
the inconceivable this is how most
people see the situation and it's in
fact for 25 years roughly that's how I
looked at it although I am I understood
but it wasn't saying explicitly about
all those sub states that help people to
get a hold of why even though there's
very little risk today over the next
five or ten years and over the lifetime
of a child born today the risk is
considerable and also it's important to
remember it we can also move in the
other direction and keep in mind ending
slavery women getting the vote and
public key cryptography so I called the
website defusing the nuclear threat the
details are on nuclear risk dot org and
this is wonderful search engine what's
it called that you can put in no not
Yahoo you can put in helmand and nuclear
and risk and it'll take you right there
in fact helmet a nuclear will might well
get you there although there's some
stuff on my Stanford website as well it
has the article on which this talk is
based and the original paper as well it
also has a statement and many of these
things are the resource tab is a good
one to go to it's got emails on the
Georgian War and all those references
there's a statement that concludes we
the undersigned and I'll tell you who
they are in a minute
urgently petition the international
scientific community to undertake
in-depth risk analyses of nuclear
deterrence and if the results so
indicate to raise an alarm alerting
society to the unacceptable risk it
faces as well as initiating a second
phase effort to reduce the risk to an
acceptable level I'm paraphrasing
so who signed that Kenneth arrow a 1972
Nobel laureate and economics
seems to about half of his he's an
expert on economic risk Jim big house
chairman of Verisign until recently also
the CEO acting CEO he got a replacement
in January he and his I hope I'll be
able to see him again
dick Garwin who most people have not
heard of but he's very well thought of
in the defense community teller in a
moment of honesty admitted that Godwin
was the one to figure out how to make
the h-bomb work in in the early 50s he
did it in this summer visiting for a
summer from the University of Chicago he
was an assistant professor brilliant man
Fermi is quoted as saying Garland's the
only true genius he ever met
so the garland has signed the statement
admiral inman the former director of the
National Security Agency my old nemesis
those of you who remember the 70s we
actually became friends and trust each
other now he signed the statement he's
also former deputy director of the CIA
bill Kay's who was a Dean of engineering
at Stanford Don Kennedy are one of our
past presidents at Stanford so it has
the support of some very knowledgeable
people oh and Martin pearl Nobel
laureate in physics also at Stanford
sorry now this seems like such a huge
problem you might wonder what role could
I possibly play but you have a critical
role everybody has a critical role but
at Google you might have an extra role
that I'll explain people only believe
what the media and politicians say and
the media and politicians can only say
what the public believes in fact Obama
during the primaries had said at one
point that he would not use nuclear
weapons in Pakistan against the
terrorists and he was hit so hard on
that by Hillary Clinton they'd had a
backtrack so the the politicians are
constrained by what we will let them do
it's a catch-22 how can you get public
attention for this and the critical
thing is getting to about 5% of a
population at that point it's enough of
a mass audience that the mass media
begins to pay attention so the key is
getting from 0 to 5 percent from 5 to 50
is much easier and so if you agree
please bring this up with others and in
fact I have a model that Google could
become a self-sustaining chain reaction
5% of them
American population is 15 million people
5% of Google's only a million people
right that's opposed to be a joke okay
you're not that big yet 20 million
Googlers but Google is a much smaller
population you guys come together on a
daily basis if 5% of you were to really
take this on and have the courage and it
takes courage to bring it up when people
say what's new what are you concerned
about people would hear about it
repeatedly and more and more people
would start to pay attention so anyone
interested in doing that contact me we
might be able to start a Google's for
Googlers for sanity group visit the
website there's a little join us box and
not much happens right now you put your
email there and I send you updates at
some point more may happen it's
important to have a list of supporters
finally our slogan which reads the risk
of a nuclear catastrophe is far greater
than we think but our ability to reduce
that risk is far greater than we
imagined so there I will stop and do we
have time for questions a few minutes I
took a little longer than I thought we I
also want to make an announcement any of
those of you who would like to join us
for lunch
just meet us here at the podium after
the talk in about ten minutes before I
take your question I do want to you can
stand up though I do want have a
question from somebody who's unable to
attend and sent me an email the question
is the web article focuses on a
potential American Russian nuclear
conflict does Iran's quest for nuclear
weapons change anything yes it makes the
situation more dangerous I've had a
continual problem in writing these
papers and in the soaring cryptography
nuclear weapons when there's no mention
almost no mention of nuclear terrorism I
was able to get it into the previous
article I found a way to work it in is a
question of flow certainly nuclear
terrorism is one of those sub states in
the nuclear disaster state that that
greatly increases the risk and needs to
be taken into account I absolutely agree
the table out of Pi paper the the
earlier paper explains why focusing on
just nuclear terrorism though is
what we need to do we need to look at
both of them together so you a big part
of your talk was in trying to understand
the risk in a scientific sense of a
nuclear disaster back in the 70s and I'm
sorry if you cover this there was the
notion of the Doomsday Clock Oh was that
just theater or was that a similar does
this a clunker doomsday machine
well the Doomsday Clock is the bullet in
the American scientist it says whether
it's five minutes to midnight or ten
minutes to me I don't women was that
actually a similarly thought out problem
statistic probability analysis of the
likelihood of design of nuclear disaster
or was that just theater no and it still
exists I think they still have the clock
I'd have to check no I think that was a
subjective estimate that's no idea is to
bring quantitative risk analysis to bear
and it's like analyzing the the the risk
associated with the nuclear power plant
design that's never failed and all
American power designs have never failed
catastrophic way even Three Mile Island
was only a partial meltdown and no one
was killed in it how do they estimate
the risk of those when they haven't had
a failure
it's the same way you do it here you
break it down into a sequence of events
each of which you have a much better
idea for nothing okay question here or
comment Marky you are known as an author
of protocols that establish trust
between parties so I wanted to ask is it
possible to design protocols that would
establish kind of trust between
nuclear-armed parties is it okay yes it
is but it's not going to involve number
theory it's going to involve much more
psychology we need to understand I think
the fundamental problem is fear anger
and hatred if you look at the mess we're
in in Iran and Iraq I'm sorry not Iran
yet thank God Iraq and Afghanistan right
now it really stems from September 11th
and if you trace September 11th back you
get back to the Mujahideen and what we
did in in Afghanistan in hindsight I
think it could be argued I'm not going
to say it's true but it could be argued
that letting the Russians maintain some
semblance of order in Afghanistan would
have been in America's best interest and
we should have helped them rather than
hurt them
under the current government which is
American supported it is a capital crime
to convert from Islam to Christianity in
fact there was a case on this last year
that President Bush was able to help the
guy get out because thank God
Bush was a good Christian but it's still
on the books I'm pretty sure under the
Russian puppet government I don't think
it would have been against the law you
would have been you would have been
sanctioned for practicing religion as
you were in the Soviet Union but you
would probably not have been killed for
it so we need to get much smarter and
start looking at why we hate and fear so
much so risks are all relatives so I
guess I'm trying to understand where the
the nuclear risk is in relation to
things associated with global warming
and then with the current economic
climate okay
section six I have a primer the resource
page of my website has a primer with six
sections the sixth one is called what
about global warming I encourage you to
take a look there but the short version
is there are many problems facing us
there is an underlying theme to all the
ones I've looked at and that is that
technology has given human beings
godlike power we can create new
life-forms we can destroy civilization
things that historically only God was
supposed to have the power to do our
social development is not godlike I
would estimate that at best were in our
adolescence and so the analogy I make on
that page is we're like a 16 year old
with a new driver's license who gets his
hands on a 500 horsepower Ferrari and so
we're either going to grow up really
fast we're going to kill ourselves and
if we can get the public to pay
attention to any one of these problems
that stems from that chasm between our
technological or physical power and our
social development then I hope we will
use it to deal with all of them we need
to start thinking long long long range
that's the fundamental problem I agree I
focused on this one because I think it's
the one that's most in arguable with
global warming people are still saying
let's wait and see and and unfortunately
they have a better argument there than
they do here anyone who says let's wait
and see here is it's much harder and
that's why I focused on this one but I'm
very concerned about that any other
questions
okay well when we end here I'll stick
around and I'll be having lunch - thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
