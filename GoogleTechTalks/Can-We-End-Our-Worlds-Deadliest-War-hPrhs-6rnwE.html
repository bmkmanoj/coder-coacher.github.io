honored to be here we our story is
really a story of an accident in a lot
of ways and I think that you know we're
not we were sort of never geared or
trained to be experts in this area but
we fell into something that we couldn't
ignore and have sort of begun the
process of becoming experts in it and so
I think there's a lot to be gained from
the sharing of stories so if it sorry
with you guys I just want to share ours
a little bit give you guys some insight
into why we're fighting and sort of what
we're doing and and then we can sort of
talk a little bit more about what can be
done my story really begins with film
called invisible children if you guys
seen invisible children was sort of this
documentary that some friends of mine
had made about northern Uganda and they
had sort of brought this documentary to
us and shown us these stories of these
children who are dying in this war in
northern Uganda and and it was sort of
like oh my gosh you know I was 23 it's
like we got to do something and and you
know it's kind of that reaction that
people have when they see something
that's so big it's like we got to do
something that's like well what
something and I don't know something
something like something big what's what
big like I don't know big big like
something historic like what's historic
I don't know you know I mean this whole
like thing that you especially when
you're young and it's like we just have
to do something it doesn't really matter
what we just have to respond and and so
what was happening order uganda at the
time was kids were being basically
abducted out of their homes and they
were sleeping in these community centers
these verandas like sleeping side by
side to sort of escape being abducted
and so what'd invisible children said
was for one night all across the country
let's do the same thing let's leave our
homes and sleep side by side and close
our eyes in order to open up the worlds
and so it was like cool let's do this
we're gonna do a protest right sort of
this like global protest the none of us
had ever done anything like this before
but we're going to organize and and it
was the first year that Facebook had
sort of begun the process of hitting
critical mass right was very beginning
and and when we were sort of like
beginning this process of not just the
tech industry being connected and not
just sort of first responders being
connected but kind of the mass is being
connected and so we sent the word out in
about four weeks before the protest we
had about 4,000 people signed up
nationwide which is pretty shabby and
then it just sort of hit it the way that
things can only hit the Internet era and
we saw the numbers go like this so there
this moment the night of the protest you
know I was me my six best friends and
you guys ever seen Newsies news is like
my favorite disney musical and and and
we're sort of sitting in austin and
we've like got our banners and our
shirts you know the whole thing and
we're wondering like is anybody going to
show up right are we just complete fools
who have like put our reputations on the
line for this thing and and and and
we're sort of looking around like what's
going to happen and all of a sudden my
friends looked at me and they said oh my
gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh
and they were just people thousands and
thousands of people coming out it was
the largest protest for african-american
history over 80,000 people came out that
night and and you know for many of us it
was the first time that we'd ever gotten
the chance to put our collective values
on display right these sort of things
that we all kind of agree about like
these fundamental truths like sort of
all people are born equal all people are
born free was the first time especially
for for our generation and we never
gotten a chance to sort of say that out
loud and and you know it was kind of
this moment we were like text messaging
everybody like you know in different
cities are there thousands of people
where you're at then thousands people
where we're at thousand people were your
end oh my gosh and people would just
come out and the result was that just a
few weeks later the State Department
started referring to the conflict in
northern Uganda as an emergency first
time in 22 years of war the State
Department had acknowledged that this
war was an emergency almost no one
organizing it was over 25 and it was
sort of like oh we just changed the
state department right we can do this
what else can we do and so the next year
we decided to do it again and this shoe
is even bigger and we did it in less
cities there was higher concentration
again about 80,000 students came out all
across the country we built displacement
camps out of cardboard in every major
city and and the result of that was that
the State Department appointed 20
million dollars to the peace process and
a senior level diplomat bringing the war
as close as it had been to ending in 23
years most no one organizing it was over
26 and right about that time a buddy of
mine started a company called TOMS shoes
if you get a sort of Thomas so a shoe
company where for every pair of shoes
they sell they give
when to kidding need shoes and and so
this was sort of i just show this
picture because it makes me look cool
this is it was so did the original idea
was like elevate your soul right you're
like jumping and you're giving and so
soul and soul you guys get it nobody
really cared it was a stupid campaign
and it never really worked but Tom's
really worked and and so Tom's was able
to go from selling like a hundred shoes
and in a very short order it just sort
of hit again the same constituency of
young people that really wanted to help
had sort of embraced this idea and they
sold 50,000 shoes and it was like oh my
gosh now we have to give away 50,000
choose how do we do that and so the
option came to do our first shoe drop in
South Africa and so I quit my job and
hightailed out to South Africa and ended
up on this continent so this is the
first day in South Africa and I just
show this picture because the only way
that I know of to describe this is like
cocky little uh-uh you know like a
stupid white kid who doesn't know
anything about anything but we're gonna
change the world hoorah right like and
so going on to this continent not
knowing anything and for two weeks we
gave away shoes we had 50,000 shoes to
give away so we just gave them away we
gave his shoes and we gave away shoes
and we gave away shoes and we gave away
shoes and we gave away shoes and the
thing about choose is that it's not
water and it's not education right it's
not like sustainable development it's
not what you want but shoes provide this
stunning moment of connection between
two human beings who would otherwise
never been connected hey there sort of
sit I mean this moment these kids ran up
to our van and they're like you know hey
hey do me food give me water and we're
like ahh no but what size shoe are you
and they're sort worse they're sort of
like we've never owned shoes right it's
like right stupid white people like yet
again right it's sort of like our
ignorance kind of on full display but
you you know you give them these shoes
and and and now you're a part of each
other's lives right it's it's brief it's
momentary but there is a moment of
connection and I think connection is
maybe the currency that makes our world
go round it is not to be underestimated
in a lot of ways so from there I just
wanted to get lost I don't know if any
of you guys have ever wanted that before
that's sort of like um
Global desire to just break free and get
lost and we use this quote by Herman
Melville he says it is not down on any
map true places never are so the idea
was to find true places by true people
here sounds I never heard before smell
smells I never smelled before and just
go and so we wondered we explored and we
explored that's Hansen was kind of
random we met them on the continent kept
exploring kept exploring and ended up in
northern Uganda and this is a girl named
Rosalind and you know it was it was my
job to spend a couple weeks with
Rosalind and to sort of film her and
tell her story so the Western audience
could sort of know who she was and you
know roslyn was 14 she'd been born with
aids inside of war and we spent two
weeks together and as you do with anyone
that you spend two weeks together with
right you get very close and and at the
end of the two weeks it's sort of
pouring down rain we're saying goodbye
and I'm so thankful for the rain because
you know we're all crying and you don't
want the Ugandan VIN to think you're a
sissy and and and she looks me in the
eyes and she says Sean our skin is a
different color but our blood is the
same you're my brother I'm your sister
you know and there's an element of I
mean here we are right we're sitting and
I and I just want to be sort of really
Frank about this we're sitting you know
inside Africa's longest-running war with
a girl who's born with a totally
treatable disease right and she gets
what all of our great visionaries have
always gotten and so few of us have
understood this idea that we are all the
same right that we are in fact one and
and she's going to die right this
fortune your girl is like destined to
almost certain death and and the
question for me you know I'm a young man
I'm like 26 at this point it's just sort
of like why right like for what purpose
is she going to die and and and there's
this moment I'll never forget you guys
remember like Bill Gates a handful of
years ago I decided to save the world
right in no way do I want to take away
from from from the effort I think it's
great but he had sort of called together
all the world's experts on all of our
major issues health the environment
water war all of it so he's surrounded
by all these gray hairs with like charts
and graphs
diesels and they're explaining to him
all these problems that are so
entrenched and he's sitting there with
his hand on his head and he just says
it's just the distribution problem like
we can solve all of us if we just
distributed better and so the question
for me as a young man sort of looking
into this girl's eyes was like why
aren't we right then the why don't we
why haven't we and that was very much so
the question as I sort of continued to
wander through the continent continued
to get lost and if any of you like to
dance I beg you to go to the continent
of Africa because you will never dance
here the way that they dance there this
was a graduation ceremony in a
displacement camp and these people had
done this micro economic program in this
camp had taken the gdp from zero to
thriving uh-huh in a matter of two years
and and so these are people who are
celebrating their first shot at a job
their first shot at a life for
themselves right one that they could
earn for on their own merit and and so
this is four in the morning with like
dust so thick clogs your lungs but you
dance anyway people celebrating their
first opportunity first moment when they
can have pride and claim a job as their
own continue to get lost continue to get
lost and ended up in the Democratic
Republic of Congo so here's here's like
the New York Times version of Congo
which i think is a terrible way to
introduce a country but let me give you
guys like vital statistics so you have
some context Congo is right now it's the
country it's it's a country the size of
Western Europe it's the size of the
united states east of mississippi so
take mississippi draw straight line
north right go east that's how big combo
is it's also home to our world's
deadliest war currently you're dealing
with over 6.9 million people dead this
is the deadliest war since World War two
you're dealing with about 1,500 people
dying every single day and about 1200
women being raped every month seventy
percent of the world's rapes are taking
place in common of course we knew none
of this we walked in
we had just heard there was a lot of
problems and we wanted to stick our
noses where they didn't belong kind of
explore and understand and so we went in
and started to sticking our noses where
they didn't belong and this is you know
signs of destruction everywhere this is
a band that had been exploded by rock
companied case you know abandoned
children literally by the thousands sort
of littering the streets and on the end
of the fifth day we found a military
encampment that was holding escaped
child soldiers it was beating them for
war crimes so these are five boys who
had been abducted and they had been
forced to kill right forced to fight
forced to force others to kill and they
had escaped these are sort of evolving
the most clever ones they'd escaped and
they had run to the National Army for
refuge and the National Army was
torturing them treating them essentially
as enemies of the state so we kind of
freaked out you can imagine right I was
26 I'd never seen anything like this
before we just started frantically
calling everybody we knew trying to get
them pulled out you know you got to pull
these kids out you gotta pull these kids
out oh my gosh you gotta call these kids
get these kids out and and no one would
return our phone calls no one would
really respond to our requests because
who are we were like 26 year olds and we
don't know anybody we don't have any
influence or power and and so because no
one would listen we spent the next eight
hours just listening to their stories
you're sort of sitting there with them
and staring them in the eyes and hearing
their stories and and and you know
storytelling a strange and storytelling
is powerful we had had very very little
in common I grew up in San Diego went to
university in Austin you know they were
born in the jungle right taken at a
forced to kill at 10-12 they're being
tortured but as we shared each other
stories it's like you know we feel
hunger the same way right we feel thirst
the same way we sort of laugh at the
same jokes although there's like a
30-second delay because the translator
right we sort of long for our families
the same way they've been away from
there for four years I've been away from
mine for about four months
as we spoke it was sort of like the
commonalities we're overwhelming these
boys told us that the kids were too
small to carry a gun were being sent to
the front lines armed with only a
whistle they're being sent out as human
shields as to make enough noise with the
whistle to scare away the enemy and then
failing that they were supposed to
receive the bullets with their bodies
and in falling create a blockade for
other soldiers to hide behind you know
look I mean what do you do with
information like how do you like even
begin to process one of the boys had a
shirt that said extinct forever which
fell very suiting given what had
happened to his childhood we we exposed
the encampment to you in the kids got
pulled out encampment got shut down it
was a pretty intense day right certainly
more intense than any day we'd had up to
that point and I went home that night
and just bawling through tears and sort
of chucking down red wine and punching
holes through walls wrote this blog
called falling whistles send it out to
about 80 friends and family is my google
group at the time actually I'd set it up
just before I had left and everyone in
that Google Group forwarded the blog all
the way around the world I woke up the
next day and had thousands and thousands
and thousands messages in my inbox
saying what do we do how do we help why
is this happening what's going on who's
like I have no idea I just got here
I know nothing right I've never studied
this region I've never studied their
role in our world or our role in their
world their influence and sort of the
way that we've developed our influence
the way that they've developed and how
is it possible that I had gone through
23 years of education and never been
asked to study this vast continent right
never been asked to study this place
that had really been the center of world
history for centuries when looked at
through a certain prison so we decided
to figure it out we made fake press
passes and decided to go out we went out
we went out we went out
blew it out well we discovered as a vast
country as beautiful as any where I've
seen the second largest rain forest in
the world more natural resources in
Congo than anywhere else in the world
the estimate that it's 27 trillion
dollars worth of natural resources are
in Congo today put that in context
that's larger than the u.s. European GDP
combined found a beautiful people women
who wear these like ornate head scarves
with almost as much fabric as their
dresses right men who wear these
meticulous suits they might live in a
hut and have to walk through a muddy
sort of road in order to get to the
meeting but by the time they get to the
meeting they will have polish their
shoes and made sure that their shirt is
pressed down tightly a people group who
have been battered down for over 120
years but who carried themselves with
enormous pride I tremendous dignity we
also found that people who had been
pillaged by war note to self when
hanging out with child soldiers don't
smile I didn't know what to do I was
just a little bit nervous never done
anything like this before this boy was
taken at nine this is him at 19 and see
that there's not a trace of a child left
on him his boys were both in their teens
went deep into the base camps the
surrounding military groups warlords
rebel leaders asking why is this
happening what's going on who's funding
you who's behind it this man to my left
or to my to my left is a man named major
Alexei major Alexi was 21 studying
poetry and philosophy at University this
photo is 29 war broke out he went and
fought for the side he thought was most
patriotic since then he's done
unspeakable things right he's raped
women and taking children burned
villages killed thousands you know when
you sit down and have a cup of coffee
with him still feels a whole lot like
that 21 year old who is studying poetry
of philosophy I see a monster absolutely
she deserve justice absolutely the
deeper we down the more we saw humanity
and
the most evil of creatures this boy had
been tied up and beaten by the warlord
in Kunda we asked this boy to draw what
he had seen he drew a tree on fire and a
gun with blood coming out of it you can
see by this time it was a very different
trip from the one that we had intended
for it to be found war war war war war
war war smads in Kunda he's wanted by
the International Criminal Court is
currently arrested in Rwanda spent the
day together on war so much more by the
end of it I was just ready to get the
hell out of Dodge this is me my first
day home with a mimosa to my side glad
to be back home and what do you do I
mean I want to like honestly ask you
guys like what do you do in a situation
like this right you sort of like have
this enormous amount of new knowledge
this enormous amount of new
understanding about what's really
happening and what's behind it and no
resources to channel any of it so I just
sort of went a little bit crazy and just
started writing I like wrote and I wrote
and I wrote and I wrote and I would go
to parties with my friends and I would
just scream and everybody I met kids are
dying kids are dying this is happening
right now right now right now this is
real women are being raped children are
dying at this moment at an emergency
rate right now right now eventually you
just stop getting invited back right
like who wants to hang out that kid and
so in the midst of my craziness one of
my best friend's a guy named Marcus
street artists in San Diego he went he
got an old vintage whistle and he gave
it to me put around my neck and he said
no matter where you go keep those boys
alive in your heart all of a sudden we
could go to parties and we didn't have
to scream at anybody anymore because
everywhere we go people would ask what's
the whistle we got a chance to speak up
for the boys in a way that you know sort
of elevated the converse
rather than destroyed it we started
saying basically the whistle became our
similar protest as we pursued solutions
in a region where there in short supply
we started saying make their weapon your
voice be a whistleblower for peace we
started studying this history of
whistleblowers this was asked our first
day in the office sort of screaming at
the world right our first piece of
furniture was a bucket we study this
history of whistleblowers people who had
said what needed to be said long before
it was popular long before they had the
answers they said what was right because
they knew it to be true and they
couldn't allow themselves not to people
who'd spoke out defiance the prevailing
systems and in pursuit of what could be
started selling them out of our back
pockets I was sort of like the Timex guy
like selling whistles putting them on
people's necks and saying go and speak
for peace go and speak for peace go and
speak for peace it worked valorum and
they went out and everywhere they go
they'd have this conversation about what
was happened in Congo conversation
they'd never had before and it was just
explosive we had one hundred fifty
dollars we started with five we raised
$150 we knew where we have to reach the
entire world with what was happening and
so a friend of mine hitchhike from
Austin to New York City he had checked
over the course of four months and two
over 40 cities and he stopped down with
slogans of people just like this and he
said we don't have all the answers in
fact we have almost none that's all
right but we're not going to be quiet
about this problem join us we
whistleblowers for peace he got picked
up by an ex-convict in Tennessee he got
picked up by like these death metal kids
in Alabama and when he told them that he
didn't like death metal they drop him up
from in front of a cop blue plot in
front of his face so that he would smell
bad and get picked up he got picked up
in Philly by a guy who bought him a
jacket the pair of shoes because all he
had was a hoodie and a holy pair of
Tom's on about 20 degrees outside we had
three college students who rode their
bicycles from Florida to San Diego
stopping in every city and saying the
same thing we don't have all the answers
but we're not gonna be quiet while 6
million people lose their lives joanna's
we had a kid sleep out of an addict for
four
to do design work for free that's why we
have a website we had a kid sell his
company in Houston move out tell later
on finances for free we've now had 40
interns come from all over North America
sleep in bunk beds and work out of our
crappy little garage demanding more of
the world it worked for them they wore
them wore them and everywhere they went
had new conversations the following
whistles campaign was born campaign for
peace in congo sorry garage we got desks
out of dumpsters were piled in enormous
amounts of people what we do now is we
sell the whistle with the original story
that was sort of the moment that made me
sort of wake up the moment that made so
many of our readers wake up and we sell
it in stores we sell it at retail steven
alan this designer came to us and he
said I'd love your whistles could be
settled in our stores we said can we do
that it's not possible and said yeah so
we went to our friends at times we
learned how to sell in stores we started
selling in stores of system Fred Segal
we started building these income
generating museums says could this
little whistle in the world's largest
Wharf we built the whole thing floor
wall ceilings and what we found with
this museum for example was michael
siegel came to us and he said you know
in the three months that you've been
here you've been in the top five selling
brands of our entire year you helped
keep Fred Segal a lot and so the three
months that we were in Fred Segal we
first launched we helped keep one of the
most powerful retailers alive we earned
enough money to rehabilitate 267 kids
open up an office in DC and we educated
over 20,000 people about the problem
from nothing write the whole thing
costed but cost us about two hundred
dollars to build
yeah I'll tell you about it yeah so we
build these museums right in stores this
one is built in Soho the cool thing
about this it's literally like eight
bolts can pull it off the wall and bring
it to another store it's been on
rotation store to store to store the
stores love it because they make money
they're able to make money living out
their conscience right they drive press
destination customers and here's the
most exciting part about this is that
what we're doing is we're giving them
financial incentives to educate their
community and advocate for peace because
the more educated their community is the
more whistles they sell so we made this
one in Donna Karan's door and the cool
thing about this is that you know we
didn't actually build this we just email
the files to Donna Karan's people
because they had financial incentive
they made it themselves so these sorts
of decisions are happening the things
that are sort of around Congo or
happening in closed doors in DC right
the reason why they're able to
perpetuate century after century is
because none of us know about it and the
media doesn't print it and so we're
saying is we're going to skip the media
now open up an office in DC and they're
behind these closed doors getting this
information passing a toss in LA will
beautify it make it sexy and then
distribute it out to retailers to go
directly into the hands of communities
skipping the entire media and also in
some ways skipping the internet and just
going right into their communities we've
built these all over the country we
built this one in Portland lightboxes
illuminating stories that have been held
in shadows for centuries they're very
visual very educational by educating
people about the roots of the problem
what we've done in Congo's we found
visionaries young local visionaries who
are already doing the work we come along
behind them essentially like a venture
capital firm in a lot of ways help them
professionalize help them create
world-class systems of accountability
transparency then we're giving them the
tools they need to stop the cycles of
violence inside their region right
rehabilitating children now and
eventually women programs totally
holistic takes them to expression
therapy job skills training
Basic Education psychosocial support
ultimately reintegration which is
actually much harder than it sounds on
that first day in the encampment we
found out that two of the boys had
fought for opposing rebel groups and I
asked them does that make you enemies
and one of them looked over at the other
one and he kissed him and he said we are
only boys how can we be enemy it was
sort of like ball game alright that's
the whole deal right there if we can
connect people before they become
defenders of the systems that sustain
them hold them accountable to those
connections we live in a very different
world in 10 years because this is real
right i mean this happened
the turn of the century bicycles became
very popular and then beyond that the
automobile so there was a new need for
rubber and what Mark Twain said is the
horseless carriage has brought the world
closer together what he's obviously
referring to is the way the automobile
has changed the way our world operated
right cars change the way our
communities operating it was also
referring to is that in our pursuit of
rubber for the automobile 10 million
people were killed in the Congo from
eighteen eighty to nineteen hundred
twenty years there was a Holocaust
almost unprecedented proportions 10
million people were killed who was
literally half the country the same
thing has happened today well real quick
there when when they didn't turn it
enough rubber their hands were kind of
this was sort of their punishment for
not bringing in enough of the rubber we
put in place man who stole billions and
billions of dollars with resources made
sure that western companies had those
resources to thrive this is real and
this happened as a result the same thing
is happening today resources in Congo
are what are used to create many of our
electronic products and it's the illicit
trading of these minerals that fund this
war general is necessary for processors
colton caster a tungsten 10 this
technology has brought the world closer
together in extraordinary ways you guys
know more than almost anyone else my
blog never would have been read by
thousands of people had we not had that
capacity the resources necessary for
this technology is causing another
genocide another Holocaust of mass
proportions
so what we did was we took the W from we
the people and we took the P from people
and turn it into an F we are following
missiles for a freer world how unfree
people ever become free through whistle
blowing right individual protest the
collective rising of a people group so
I'm here at Google asking for your
partnership and solving one of the
deadliest problems of our time it's a
hell of a challenge but I think that
most of you are probably entrepreneurs
in one way or another and if you are
then you love problem solving so do we
and there are areas that you guys have
capacities in that we absolutely don't
so what we're doing right now is we
should sell the whistle we use the money
to partner up with local visionaries to
stop cycles of violence in the region
but we're also creating sustainable
distribution that has the potential to
be global through retail the key inside
here is that whoever controls because
you're dealing with a problem that's
never been talked about in mass right by
the mass media so whoever in controls
distribution of information controls
perception the new Everett controls
perception controls paradigm the normal
controls paradigm and a pretty
fundamental level controls reality for
those of us who want to change reality
such as living in a 21st century without
mass atrocities living in a 21st century
without genocide what we want to do is
create new distribution channels for new
kinds of information that
psychologically impact people in new
ways that's why I think retail is so
important because it's outside of the
paradox of choice you're not at a
newsstand you're not in a bookstore and
you're not on the internet but there's
so much information coming at you you're
sort of like hanging out with your
family or your friends and you're
walking to a beautiful store with
Beautiful People the beautiful lighting
and they're smiling and all of a sudden
you're engaged in a subject you've never
heard of you're encountering this museum
sort of educating you about something
that you've never
imagine before and your open way that
you wouldn't be otherwise so we're going
to use retail to build what we hope will
be the widest broadest most inclusive
coalition and history it will have to be
in order to deal with a problem of this
size demanding an end to this war there
are enormous technological solutions
available so one of them is this this
will be my challenge and I want to hear
all of your thoughts afterwards but in
2011 in September Congo will be having
its election and in Congo today there
are more peacekeepers than anywhere else
in the world 20,000 UN peacekeepers the
UN is spending about 1.2 billion dollars
on peacekeeping in Congo and they're not
doing almost anything in fact in many
ways they're counterproductive but the
boots are on the ground the people are
there right the capacity to respond
exists in a way that it doesn't anywhere
else in the world so here's the idea
let's get Android technology with a live
streaming app into ever into the hands
of every single election monitor in
Congo and let's have real-time live
streaming election monitoring so that
every form of coercion violence
corruption can be immediately reported
and we can send that enormous amount of
people that we have immediately there in
respond let's help the Congolese people
have the freest and fairest elections in
African history it would be historic it
would be world-changing and only an
organization like Google could help pull
it off so that's what we're asking we're
asking for solidarity many ways charity
is demeaning right it is has guilt that
has pity and I hope none of you feel any
of that hope none of you feel that from
us because we don't have any of that
with us the people who were working with
in Congo are nothing short of
extraordinary they don't deserve our
pity and they don't deserve our guilt
I think about how hard it was started
organization in America where we had
everything going for us they did it in a
war zone where they had nothing going
for them they are visionaries so we are
saying is we're looking into their eyes
and we're saying we were with you right
until the boots are off your throat we
were with you solidarity Eva's here as
well I'd love for you guys to meet Eve
afterwards he was from the Congo 10
years old he left because there was war
and here's an extraordinary story that
I'd love from him to share with you guys
well we are about in the very end and
the final measure free men and free
women using the thing that is most
fundamental to our freedom our speech in
order to fight for others there's a
short film that I'd love to show you
guys if you guys have a couple more
minutes and then we can talk a little
bit do some question answer they'll be
cool great we get it welcome can't
program my friend Sean just gotten back
from the Condor an empty warehouse
listening to reports from the ground we
moved into understanding the deadliest
war in our world we do to help I'm
coming up from another country country
alcohol from a cotton ball you and me
nearly secure
an emergency is this right now the Great
Wall of Africa thoughts on the hills and
plains of eastern Congo just killed more
people than any other conflicts since
the Second World War as installed
Gilligan mortality survey found as many
as five point four million people are
dying in the armies of business they
went into condo not to track down
killers but to see the country's
unbelievably immense mineral wealth to
grab it and to sell it out to New York
to London to Paris to the developing
world people have looked at Congo for
over 100 years and they've seen a great
big pile of riches with some black
people in conveniently sitting on top of
you know I distance tribal water has
nothing to do with you it's a war whose
trail of blood leads absolutely directly
to our world and indeed to your own
apartment militia groups are targeting
civilians and there's widespread killing
rape and I'll no longer fighting each
other so much but instead targeting the
other side's women so Connolly's
children the tragedy is a massacre in
their village a massive Shetty's or
recruited as child soldiers hundreds of
thousands of
child soldiers then told us that the
kids too small to carry a gun were being
sent to the front lines armed with only
a whistle an emergency exists 15.4
million people have died from war
related causes in the Congo since 1998
we didn't have much but out of the boy I
did hear me brothers their weapon beyond
words we did what anyone would you sold
the whistle to rehabilitate the most
vulnerable actress and rebuild our
country found Congolese visionaries and
partnered with them to rehabilitate
hundreds of children and lead the future
generations this is what we need is
peace but as the broadcast continued we
needed the room for all of us to do and
it's a real straight to out because last
time there was this scale of mushrooms
on those when the Belgians colonized it
and killed 10 million people so the
situation that occurred under King
Leopold a hundred years ago is basically
what you got in conroe today there were
must campaigns across the developed
world led by people like Joseph Conrad
after conan doyle so there were
questions off the Senate there were huge
mass meetings in London the same thing
has happened in our lives Tyler's and
we've done virtually nothing we needed a
symbol that would stand some peeps
drives towards the end of the largest
war in the world and the whistle sounded
like this if we believe as they believe
that all of us three and doing something
in peace you didn't have all the answers
but dreamed the falling whistles return
was peace in congo with four forward
steps first we must educate the torch
has been passed to a new generation of
American unwilling to witness Oh from it
a small one doing those human rights our
past is filled with a history of whistle
blows standing up against impossible
odds you learn from these giant solar
solutions and better minds now we call
it the free world was ending the
violence in the comedy to educate is one
thing but you we have to get the message
out for a free condom we have to
disseminate the idea that peace is
possible so build museums in the heart
telling the story of condo the message
is out there and brave men and women are
responding individually however we need
a place to congregate together around
ideas that will lead to peace like the
speakeasies of old gathering and
defiance an unjust law whisper societies
will grow together people to participate
in solutions and end the violence of an
unjust war
and finally free men and free women will
use that which is most fundamental to
our freedom our speech speak truth to
power and add me you will go on to
petition lawmakers for conflict free
electronics and stamp our protests
towards a full resolution not stopping
until that final day the day we see
peace in kind we all immigrants we are
all refugees are refugees of the free
there were some global peace both of our
countries now face the same problem of a
swiftly changing world same question of
how to bring our abundance and our
technological progress to the
fulfillment of all men and the
liberation of all mankind so I come here
to Africa learning to live together you
to respect for the rights and the
well-being of all of our people
rehabilitate educate disseminate
congregate advocate if this wheel is
rolling then we are on the move and
peace is the new frontier we believe do
you thank you truly for giving us the
time I really sure
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
