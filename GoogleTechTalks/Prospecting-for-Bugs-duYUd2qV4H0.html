citation on first week theory a new
interesting idea that might help
software testers my name is russ russ
collar and it'll come to my violin just
a few minutes so what we're talking
about here is risk-based testing how
risk assessment is a tool and the test
is toolkit and what we gonna know that
all these points so I going with them a
great yet yet but I'll actually have
more words on there over here that i
will speak sort of reverse usual
speakers i'm assuming even read faster
than i can speak so you know this back
lander for long as you go again when we
talk about risk-based taste indonesian
this assessment to directed here
sniffing there's a possibility
breakthrough i call it possible because
it's an interesting idea but some other
tribe so as yet it's called prospect
theory got a couple of files called
Kahneman and Tversky actually issued to
correct that one of the fellows kind of
incredible prize in 2002 for this his
partner would have that he was deceased
and a tentative ever present to people
are to the passed away so the serie
agency on their head is a more
enlightened way of understanding risks
of probabilities and we've identified
some ways which we'll get into later on
they are part of people out of people on
the animistic wait some kind of
properties arrests and averaged my
others and we use them to previous
assessment by the way questions a
12-point anytime please jump in as you
go please feel free to jump as we go and
ask questions you would like are there
any statisticians in the group good
that's really good okay person that will
be home to help assist oh good gracious
let's go hey intended audiences with
giving this for experienced software
testers but that's alacati tree because
a lot of it heroes really basic if you
haven't heard before it's good stuff
it's worth knowing people likely Harry
Robinson Jr Hardy and so on and we're
also giving this for melody new testers
even if you got three to five years
experience according to us all salts
you're pretty new and there's some good
stuff in here too it's going to be our
practice rather than a theory very much
right into was working pregnant it's not
too
the demolitions some say 20 audiences
worth of coop mentioned I sometimes talk
about this and do some work for people
are hedge fund managers that people have
their private jets you know the kind of
thing and do like suffer engineering
managers psychologist and so on mostly
the first to myself I literally put
something here quite stuffy and pompous
about my credentials were so this was
more interesting so as so I said cooling
I think it's Clooney as I George I think
that was never on there Helen Hunt so I
claim to be way cool though and truth up
such a nerd I don't recognize half these
people walking around I don't the foot
down to cure the purely our he sees a
new guy in town yada yada I've been
around with quite a few firms hi taken
large multinational enterprise and so on
also total over the years and please
like harbor them UC Berkeley terms of
potentials I make a Celtic and Stanford
myself which means they take any it is
it these days so enough about me sorry
there's somebody work outside the room
talking so moving right along tato to
practice with it one thing I'll say a
friend we change this few times
quantitative methods forest assessment
at work it's not really very well anyway
they don't really know how to measure
things on some kind of linear or
non-linear scale not very well and we
also as well as nothing I would get the
right numbers the first place in terms
of merging things metrics they don't
really know how to pry respective who
film we don't know whether we should add
numbers or modify them and so there's
risk based quantitative techniques are
Theo she's a quantitative quantitative
risk technics out there searching the
military insufficient if government
agencies in Washington I think that a
little bit dubious because you can get
any answer you want out of them and even
worse than that they consciously try to
interpolate to get the answer you want
there's one thing but instead of you are
manipulating and unconsciously you have
unrecognized assumptions we have a
number
and you're going to have big trouble
trouble so what David it doesn't help
what about the qualitative methods well
unfortunately i tend to be as good as
the practitioner if you someone who's
pretty shrewd and savvy and alert today
you know it you know half asleep because
you can sleep deprived by somebody not
project and you made it as well that's
very much individual and so on so we
have a little problem here luck it's
good luck to do with it as Napoleon see
it and I'm sure this is a misquote that
it's roughly right just before Waterloo
I understand it Napoleon said you know
thank you me young brilliant generals
making me virtuous generals gonna be
lucky generals I guess you didn't get
enough of them for Waterloo moving right
along leave us of soups a person of
sophistication of this dress first half
is going to be fairly basic again if you
haven't heard it was new to you it's
important and i would call my
presentation masterful sorry about that
I that hump and they were getting a
little increasingly more intermediate to
associated material if you're you know
really pretty experienced in this area
take the 45 minute nap you know tune out
ya go you know right another test
framework or something for the half
minutes and then we'll get to the day
mostly clip stuff and I don't have too
much at the very end because I don't
know too much about the break-in age I
don't think anybody does that will
discuss what self via our probabilities
some we have to be fairly savvy you have
to be feeling knowledge about the season
probabilities that goes with the
territory we can't really do Resta
season without knowing the chances of
things having having said that the
opinion were on my part which is a bit
harshly stated here I'm not doing like
people I'm talking about the big board
and air in general the aggregate
people's test test the skills and
probably a fairly pathetic you see this
cushion on the over here here I asked us
quite often well not two of them because
I be pilloried but we ran out of town
that I acid at conferences from time to
time and the question you see is the
following what's the likelihood that the
person sitting next to you has got the
same birthday now I typically ask that
of people and they sometimes look like
deer caught in the headlights that so
it's done leg of until two minutes to
think about in a scratch way and a piece
of paper and of course if you think
about it the answer is the following you
have a birthday on
the day unless you were not born but
hatched as I was myself sorry I said all
she would joke but resist you know
usually have a birthday there probably
are probably of the first next to you
have the same birthday is probably 165
that may not be true to say have a
convention of people all on the same
birthday not gonna have their
probability but soon as just random the
population in general you probably have
a probability 1 365 the personal issue
is that going to be the same have the
same birthday and if you want to be
really nitpicking emphasizes one and 360
for you certainly one two three three
five and a quarter because every four
years earlier 366 days I was 36 25.25 so
that makes us feel morally superior to
get it there precise that rounds out to
about 0.3% you see this number here this
was actually chose about that twenty
percent of the people that's typical in
these conferences after they sort of
blooming viewers I feel bad they are
then go ahead and pay for this and they
actually lower to trace the signal
choice I don't wanna say the people as a
seal our love we paid 5 totally random
choice which diseases to the term time
market basket no that's not true got my
intestine something else anybody i
couldnt online and had a microsoft that
what i'm saying here we don't ever eager
schools most of us and lately there have
really good schools on a serial don't
need to be superior and papas I'm just
saying this is the way it is for many
many people in our field before I go
ahead now consider leaving us hang this
let me say that this is an opportunity
you know to improve you know fitness and
basic training and probability i think
will help a lot of us like they start
raining while chicken so on enough on
that I'll let me move a hit so basically
here's this is worth a quick to it and I
think these are all pretty pretty
obviously already a risk i define risk
is any little chance for non-trivial
loss some people disagree with that am i
say any possibility of a loss there's
some of us are very small it starts in
two a penny it probably is very very
small we're not going to put a lot of a
twister key ones my speaking of them
from long positions
and this coming here about some chances
maybe Nautilus uncertainly than probably
that's somewhat controversial a lot of
people would pass on that and disagree
what I'm saying is well never really
know the actual probability or they
leased the property distribution of
probably the Herbalife because we have
one situation will either work or not so
now we're probably more interesting and
certainly then probably yourself Paul is
a sort of slippery concept of my opinion
which makes it interesting I've really
talked about this already so just let me
move on this anybody has questions alas
you know in a very civil of this
definition losses anything that we care
about one thing I'll mention it I've
frontin we're going to come back and
talk about this and what it seems in
some ways obvious when I say it but it's
actually quite profound I've gained is
the former Los they find that person has
a possibility of losing five dollars
versus gaining five dollars if we're
probably out the way the two are not
sort of transferable second for the gain
is psychologically differently lost and
it's going to be important to us a rest
is just a possibility as it says here in
the middle they over here it's not
actually real until this is reiterates
you know something that she realizes
that risk tend to do an event or failure
anytime we you know worry about it
faults and failures I couldn't just put
anything because some of our
professional brethren have to agree with
us it's important to differentiate
between the two depend on which I use
the words and there's no Universal
consistency of terminology he will use
the words in the voice button called a
failure here is the actual event the
failure the problem let's got an
underlying cause it's the fault the
failure is the problem handling causes a
fault better than my early days about
900 years ago when I was a young testa I
was naive and I thought that you know
folsom hey I said a one-to-one
relationship was some kind of
identifiable relationship they do have
relationships because otherwise we'll be
able to fix problems but nations are
very complicated what we find is it
typically a belief a late and we caused
by many different false and vice versa
one fall can have many different
manifestations of failure and different
situations so it's accomplished many to
many relationship is also not very well
understood
that seems too complicated the world too
often we think we're talking about
failures we're going to have faults in
terms of risk assessment risk
identification just allows you to have a
clear idea in our heads where they're
talking about the symptoms or the causes
it's going to help however that sound to
appreciate I think if I talked long
enough and loud enough you actually know
what I think I know what I'm talking
about I see there was made to be
punished side comment the term exposures
with a quick definition to this is a
word that's quite popular in the
insurance industry risk managers
insurance have a lot to worry about pun
intended and they define this photo has
been the accommodation of the
multiplication of two factors one is the
probability of an event occurring and
then if a desert clear the costume or
consequence of that sounds good to see
this comment at the bottom here provides
us wrong anybody like to tell me what's
wrong with that there's a definition
it's a good start but yes sir right yes
i will let me repeat your answer added a
couple more to your answer is it screws
up at extremely low or high
probabilities and extremely low or high
costs it's not letting up we know it's
not whether you give example if you
think about it this formula is true none
of us will ever buy a lottery ticket and
that was really they have fought for
insurance because if you took the cost
of our insurance modified by the
probably of having a fire assuming the
custom not having for insurance the
money you save I'll give you this right
on my brother brain you know what I'm
try to say right it's really simple
that's why I was a big powerful frame
right man you can't do little simple
things I think it's just the opposite
background action good time to be
serious here have two options we can
either choose related for insurance or
not if we choose late the furnitures
right at a certain amount of money and
that's gone on the other hand if we
choose not take the assurance assuming
she's not to pay the fire insurance we
have no outline now but we have a
property of a fire fire does happen we
have our two hundred dollar house the
two bedrooms you know four inches screw
female I packed and down whatever so she
wrote evaluate the two options after the
net benefit benefit by the way it's why
it's best not
so it's best not to take a lottery
ticket and this is of course is the
reason why an aggregate insurance firms
in the state-run lotteries you only do
pretty well there's another reason for
this to that as well as the fact that we
can't multiply things to be together
again at the extremes high probability
line probably very hard reload there's
not a little bit let me add already no
problem here courses are we actually I
was assuming by this equation you can
actually do these things one enough to
collect numbers and actually get a
meaningful result there's so much
fuzziness is so much and now in buzz and
these numbers that you know it's dubious
there's something concept that i still
find useful nevertheless again this is
exposure and the whole idea was Chris
prioritization as we identify the risks
we did some kind of assessment of the
likelihood sign properties to them this
is some kind of system of the likely
cost at the garage modified them out to
get the exposure each risk and then we
simply make them in order the highest
exposure on down we're done this
correctly we should have a good risk
based his focus you know check this
check this check this is the most risky
things in terms of multiplication are
probably by cost sounds good right
doesn't work very well but it sounds
good it's better than nothing mixing
automation in terms of this basic set of
ideas I do have touch the risk as I see
it here on they ever hear a bigger
system is our progress there many
different factories since these when
promised here project lists the things
that could go wrong a project you I have
a testing project sometimes we very
wrong might include the test tool
automated history issues does not work
as some key server there's an apology
test lab is not a right on time aqui
taste professional is written as the
harlot system or the test approach you
know is out for three weeks with flu and
peppery these are all project risks but
they're not the kind of restoration
isn't here what we're generally with
testing is what I'll call system
operational risks and sister Martha
racial or is it simply things with the
wrong in the system and live operation
yeah okay this problem malfeasance we
have fraud we care customers you know
leaving us because we have slow response
time you have you know financial assets
because of database
tillery problems that's what we
typically talk about here system
operational risk again this is fairly
obvious is sorry but if you're not aware
of this can be fairly difficulties so
that which things we care about the
sense we try to look at their
association for tasting this is not this
is what kinds of other risk as a Caesar
the bottom of page here marking risk we
have product out might be risks of
product development disabilities
anniversary of marketing near the
Immaculate right press it right you know
advertise the right Papa soda right
there kind of thing we talked about this
already I think I mentioned all these
points up front be very careful with the
clarification yeah and so the signs to
some people that you're incompetent if
you qualify as side water city they
nearly refill it if what you tell and of
course the problem is as I said before
that if you don't qualify have something
possibly even worse which is just so
subjective field and to reveal and you
risk assessment I like to move on i
talked about success for a few minutes
and I reason we're talking about Susie
Susie I think about risk Hawaii has been
yeah the achievement of CCS or the lack
of achievement of success and the reason
I like to look at dimension of successes
because the tension a bachelor broader
view of what the risks are we have a
cushion here is a system of citrus or or
especially many of us I typically people
do when they go through some kind of
sitting up system at critic's it has
criteria they go through a checklist to
various things and say you know this is
important this is important someone and
some of the times I things that might be
on the ship this and things like mention
here these dimensions of success the
features work correctly do we get the
right data at the database do you have a
full set of features that kind of thing
this the first three I have a list of
well over a hundred of these features
this isn't what I had to these
dimensions here I succeeds the money for
things like maintainability portability
install ability survivability
sustainability actually believe sale
ability of the software selling and so
on so on your performance reliably
robustness all these kinds in many
different aspects success maybe 90
similar not that relevant wasn't a
project that's good because anything
just narrowed and what's important again
it's useful I think to look at these
dimensions as he says because it gives
you the brewer
fetch with the things I will come back
to a few more of these in just a minute
and example the whole idea here is the
takeaway current situation and basically
treat these CSI to save actually
important situation this one here for
example I would maintain for this yeah
automated or semi-automated health
system for the IRS the firstlings of
whistle hear a motion for accuracy
device given to text files the usability
the system by the clerical people text
first season of the speed the
performance response time so on my
contracts we have a different system
this example we have a different set of
success factors and again if you losers
prejudice that were launched atleast i
have i have them if you want to get one
you go through and say okay I'm artfully
these things were important in terms of
success and is that definitely assist in
multiple different dimensions is that
defensive this is a way of defining risk
yeah mr. failure I think it's pretty
obvious right it's it's important to
talk about it because it's easier to say
somewhat harder to do I saw examples and
we won't go through many of them but
there's another half dozen examples here
I we're talking about from my checklist
okay let's come back to risk based
testing as you can see on the over here
it's a powerful technique oh so limited
ways we sit while the ones already by
the school of people have do it
subjectivity and so on that the whole
idea was we can taste everything who I
need to focus the taste of it what we
want to do and focus in the history of
it is determine which pass the system
which exclusive system required a
different in cases of testing and which
others pass the system we can afford to
skim over or miss states in entirely
razor on a skim or lightly to hear some
passive system is sort of them
considered resources to allocate to the
passion system require intensity so this
is as much a resource allocation
officials anything else had I decide to
allocate the resources i haven't testing
which is always limited it's usually
very limited to the different things i
could hear that's what this rotation and
translation systems about and if it does
if it does this done well with soft and
it is you tend to get a lot of signal
problems regularly because
you'll have the critical things we're
going to important things you nice big
bags quickly rather than looking at all
the wrong places a little places with
the bugs in that way to be or not likely
be important we have techniques to
identify test cases there's very simply
south here tools generate test cases
Harry Robinson of Google's no next
webinar Syria and use techniques like
so-called path analysis to identify the
prime faster software and generate test
cases automatically this is great stuff
but all these two states generation take
things have a problem they tend to be
overwhelming thank you explain what we
can work with let's need to sort down
based on risk there's a little bit of
redundancy in here I probably going to
say profound things if you have any
questions please ask otherwise all
synthesis will say pretty well known to
everybody this fact is what we need to
do with the rest based testing approach
you certainly have some kind of list of
risk papers and we'll go through and say
well you know how painful is this one
have for that one you know FIRREA
speeches are recessed with the system
behavior and typically the kind of
things we will have unless the fist
focus will leave the following number
one with customer impact we might have a
feature this pretty good feature might
have very little customer impact in a
user on pack no matter how badly this
feature screws up account cuz the user
community more than three century here
by contrast another thing in the same
system of the screws up might be life
critical FEMA life is with it over what
we're doing is using you know customer
impact invisibility or usual
metaphysically as a way of a sign of
criticality it is critical visit must
guest mission-critical is a different
manner as sort of obvious now this is
good this is why my the float was sawed
down the different features of the
nastiest you know prettiest how do you
ideas with the state the risk about
tasting this is one sort factor on short
filter but it's not enough so very few
more to give the flavor again please
jump in if you have questions second one
for one of the name of called
operational risk softener instead of the
same thing but it might not be that's
the list of something are wrong in
operation and in the consequences of it
I have exactly that so few years ago it
used to be this is summarized now this
is probably a good 15 years old in
Sweden the cocina de las vegas reinvest
people t machinery head witches this
particular example is video game machine
hiccup and although the first one sent
like a thousand dollars and at the
moment there's a minimum threshold to be
to be reached for the minions to be
displayed on the other hit at all i
think was a thousand dollars so somebody
one thousand dollars and free peonies
and as you can see for yourself what
happens every just a flash to maximum
possible number the feel-good hold back
in those days of policy the casinos
resume really pay off that changed us
then if you have this happen they say
sorry machine have a glitch in a
software glitch tough luck it's to us en
el fili obvious point i had these both
down because they might be different
views sometimes the business operation
races based on internal see straight
through the customers our who the users
are how they're going to use the system
and it's not about different people on
the first one which is that I think we
called the what we call it again the
customer impact I got that wrong i made
to say it the other way around excuse me
sometimes it's fun here is the
baserunner customer view the world so
you know external looking in this one
here sometimes it's done the discovery
service is done by looking in clearly
the architecture these lava might have a
system I've been out so anybody outside
because the people outside as a black
box system they don't see the internals
immersive everybody outside with you
some kind of database technology we're
not very happy with so based on our
review of the internals you might say
that's an operation was the database is
going to give us problems more likely go
as follows then you know I've had a
different approach so again sometimes
see the first one the customer base is
done for people out looking I realize
people like to even Mac research perhaps
every project this is done by people
more like architects and designers have
it until of you now these two factors
within that's not enough this is assists
of sorts I mentioned a third one here
I'm not going to go through this a great
deal that I have 50 words America is
about a variety big history we have some
events and simply vigorously disagree
with us we have
evidence against the state we have some
evidence that we have some pattern of
defects as a predictor of what you
likely have in the future in terms of
multi fix there is a see if I can recall
some of the research on this I I do but
I've get her who as we go so typically
you know let's say you have them windows
95 a few years ago they say had you were
developing different applications and
test with your applications or is insane
flat 495 Magnus a plethora the common
areas problems a certain time you might
say gee that seems to be common to any
application developer was 95 I've it'll
look further new ones this is using
practically history the way to drive
what you're doing close to this you need
a Friday fig history you don't know what
the party because she was can't use it
very easily and three things wanted to
touch on those lines with a mention each
selling for defect clustering and also
facility on my heaven here deferred
first string and do the repetition of
problems it's not a defect clustering
devious tend to cluster than just her
occur at random I assume inducing
workers at the soul of a few years ago
forever and the Eiffel senior test
manager religion is far impression can
we basically predict future defects
based on the pattern we've seen in the
past they sifted through the data for
some time included they couldn't
essentially possess the line what we're
saying here in fact they were an
exceptionally good reasons we don't not
generally there is a pattern to fry
defects I've caught a lady 20 here might
not be a t20 exactly puritas ratio might
be 90 10 the telephone parents like this
it is in the second example at the
bottom for the National Security Agency
this is the affiliates in oral
components excuse me or Sydney resented
or sometimes contained down not if you
know the defects and what the severely
fix was even more skewed in Rome and
that's what we call by this one may be
very different has anybody been able to
apply this in this work then the working
I've just a naturally without thinking
about it but is very five but they're
seen as a partner by beginners
to add the testing it was to fulfill
Aladeen okay so in case this again
happen to early which the straps good
some defense to faster they do have
patterns you know how are we are said
the parents another thing well if you do
understand them or some confidence then
we might as well use them to focus our
testing the this the repetitive nature
of defects sees that you have something
goodnight Frances it or similar bug
happiness again in the future something
red one since I broke again some people
disagree with us they say why should fix
things fixed forever really depends I
guess on the quality repair and their
propensity of this political things are
bright other sort of things the same way
we're going to break too let's have a
little bit like these divorce statistics
which Allah she just browse through yeah
you might think the ones people heavy
listen Jim by modulus hash ways in a
divorce rather we learn and d better
second time around this is silly most
people been divorced once they get
remarried is the optimist today get
remarried likelihood a second divorce is
higher to those people that people
haven't never married at all in other
words higher than for the general
population seems to be some kind of
veena repetitive pattern there we make
the analogy to software comparison we
found one big annasophia product this is
ours we found no bugs at all the
probably is higher that that surf nevada
will have another burger found in the
future and there's some empirical
evidence about that claim little about
ranger respect is and resistance ruining
her hair falls in the south will give
you a sense but a major respective for
most of us is modifications we have a
lot of evidence is modifying existing
suffers a very risk mystery process this
only applies to new version is this a
software course that we have here lucky
you see some data from the ACI software
engineering Institute this is part of
carnegie mellon carnegie mellon
university in pittsburgh quite
prestigious has a lot of government
funding the ACI and as you can see here
they probably 85th is high from the
disguise it is not isolated data I vm
did a study a vm mainstream mainframe
operating system that used to be called
MVS
I've been meaning to see the IBM
mainframe mention operating system the
study saying over the last three years
the i drag it around my friend
mainstream whatever what was that again
I they probably are actually that I
still running a suffering system is now
highly reliable ahead tens of dollars
fame through debugger over 30 years so
it's getting pretty reliable let's get
to the point here what it is leave you
there own defect data city percent of
all changes introduced new our problems
and alpha tell the big French telecom
John has got a similar study see that
twenty five percent of all changes
introduced knee problems to be feared to
sup engineers and this is at the bottom
of page via mostly deficient reduce to
trivial and in our tutors I've seen
amelie by the authors softening your
modifying code Jesus about going to
Vilnius it Amelia fix it so actually it
is in his folks introduced I'm really
really at the latest phase lee assistant
is that never see them there's still the
remaining one-third of the bugs
introduced that are not caught by the
others I still quite numerous so way we
use this frivolous vector is the
following we look at the system say okay
this is new version ice cream catch
what's been modified what's been added
and this stuff is new and modified is
falling Morrissey the stuff is already
there existing has been touched or
indirectly influenced by the changes
it's going to be probably more stable
misty existing stuff lius rotates with
some abilities listen what this is the
modifications of the new sounds good and
principal and it works just takes a
little work together to do you work wow
that does work invincible any questions
what I'd like to do is actually
visualize some kind of table a worksheet
I could drop one but I just realizing
the sketch pictures on a year on soon
you can visualize this some had a
worksheet and what we're going to do
here is this down the rest so we'd have
to have a series of road names which
will be a list of the rest of the
specters and then we have a series of
columns the first car might say
something like probably the concurrence
the second column I say for the cavity
of a desert cure and then the third
column might be the multiplication or
the collagen it's not modification
combination of the 50 c then i have
something like you know the risk of the
swiss say that then and customs will not
nearly access the system at a peak
period of time that's risky and i said
probably that certain i'm the the
customer service console is another
number and then the combination of the
two even have some modification some
kind of questions he might say tia this
is the critical or important or nice or
irrelevant testing they use that for the
video she to list everything then we
sorted in order of criticality of the of
the explosion now recent addition air
here is because you see the second point
here the very questions were asking our
variable it seems sort of obvious when
you think about it but it's quite
profound of the way we don't really have
one generic checklist will work for
situations because we have to take the
checklist the risk assessment checklist
and change the row titles based on the
situation and this might sound a little
bit abstract but let me give you an
example of what I mean a couple examples
these are other respect is just go with
these ones here other things that might
have an effect on tasting complexity you
have a very simple feature is a very
complex feature and that might be a
subjective evaluation simple business
complex features all things other things
being equal the complex ones were
probably need more testing mainstream
visit exception just briefly actually
something you do all the time deception
is what is the Lancias imagine have
officially used on average once every
three years another feature which is
similar any other measure that while the
first which was being used on average
once every three years the second IV
news 800,000 times a day you thoroughly
tested take one dimension won't he'll be
used one based on popularity so again
these are a few things to catch up for
the listed first feathers we had before
this early hit a slightly out of
sequence that's not a big problem so
we're talking about this idea that the
state is very coming back to that idea
that the titles and the row titles and
its really change let me give you any
South clear so far we've talked about
system station in general that's where
we had a list of risk factors these
things like the customer impact this is
operational risk party history that's
all good stuff now we have some stuff to
specific to performance testing you do
an EVA foam States you probably ought to
focus your effort based on these things
and so as long as the things we had
before but you've got any factors in
that is a consider like for example this
is a resource hog is a resource
intensive let's say you got an existing
system your modified it I think you
modify might be a simple query another
thing you modify might be some kind of
really complex mapping you know it's a
makes generates high high resolution
maps and pops them through high but
rather rather world you know this is
resource intensive like that of popular
or time and critical is ready to make
more effort sir these are just new risk
factors new things little rose titles to
considering our pages on our work she
does that make sense these are these
things that bring true to you these are
the kind of things you might look at if
you try to taste the system performance
rather as functional correctness terms
of prioritize you give more time to the
specialist time is critical no time is
sensitive and stuff that was not coming
to pay another goal even more times the
stuff that's frequently used which is
similar to what we see the month ago
about my stream this exception things
the resource hogs things that might you
know be associated with bottlenecks or
my trigger bar mix in folks you taste in
that one hi this is just good old common
sense to get a third example so far
we've gone through this awful that we
had the general first situation we see
things like customer impact business
operational risk that's different from
if it's different customer fact Friday
league history what's new and modified
that was the first month in the sig-
here here's our popularity frequency PSP
consumption Tyra criticality like little
children but makes the theory example
here is this one here this is actually
from dell I did a favor with building
response to do for new product
development and some of things they have
on Ellis the things you never see our
suffer lyst one is taken to availability
he really suffer this design meaning
though software you might have names
like nasty said patty unknowns plugins
that signals availability means you know
respected if he bothers you your primary
source of component I had to dinner last
night afraid with a friend his CEO
founder of an electronics company in
Syria he's got a part this manufacturer
for him by one place in the world it's
got a single source it's not working
this one pad in the world his stuff he's
going to find a second source very
quickly things like the second point
they're confined with city regulations
than 100 countries that's the big issue
has of the Dow having software that's
going to use them you know downtown los
gatos nice about it that won't be an
issue my phone again with these examples
is that the first in themselves seems
obvious in a way it's important the fish
themselves changed based on the context
sir please I call it several ISM that's
a good word for things we don't know how
to do very well what like to do is talk
about some of the Christians come up
when you're trying to do this one is how
former should it be I run some
experiments on this if you can call them
that and if anybody's interested without
too much pain and participating there
would be welcome I do this with you know
a few films it doesn't require in da
generally there's no crime
non-disclosure agreement the visual this
creature is how much time is worth you
know actually verb or a super-earth
sheets and competing numbers and these
are us what we do is we asked tisk
officials to give us their first off the
cuff estimate or estimate in a situation
and Julie why do you think the mayor ISA
and was ranking then we have them go
through the paperwork our field over at
risk assessment process might take hours
a days and then we come back and compare
see how much better if any the
formalization has got the result is a
word doing all the paperwork of roc
dinner find things right in the down was
it worth instead just sort of brainstorm
just saying
we think about this let me work on the
middle distance saying I'm going to
check this a bit of shake that and we
found that the fault lies fridge you
know helps a lot with people on this not
about the situation so people are pretty
knowledgeable about the experience and
the political environment physical
context you know they tend to do it
unsuitable in there his and they don't
really need the paper so anybody have
questions about this there are some more
important freshness to how well do we
assess risks this is definitely one of
those faces we can use that famous test
disaster it depends how long do you
needed to be done sometimes you get
through this primarily of sheer dumb
luck on their term since I asked
inclusion I'll try to give you a sense
of the typical practice out there is no
such thing as average of course
everybody's different that most people
do some kind of Association how far it
is is different they'll go through and
think about things in the focus on
passing system and documents economic
still had a justification of might be
lever right have species or out of place
yeah the crude that workable the next
thing i want to mention here is really a
side point but is it worth mission if
you haven't thought about it before
infantile pretty one way to do things
and when I described this way to do
things is going to sound ridiculous but
let me describe it any wonder I didn't
is to identify crystal with his skates
if you might need once you've got this
all dignified you go and sort some
shrimp and so the end which ones are
critical that's you know you're going to
actually run the critical ones the race
you brought it right not at all re
problem of that frozen steaks a huge
amount of effort to actually identify
and define don't let all this history is
so how most people do is not native
French door they have an incremental
twinning approach to study out and say i
have this far the system of the sensory
of the systems instantly important is
that so important it's you know we're
going to put my taste if it under that
but not as efficient as that and they'll
go to the if that they think is
important go into a bit more depth and
visually get down to generate histories
in there is that are critical they try
to sort of prune and try to eliminate
the thought eliminate and then
probability no credit to ear is a
product atisha they want to be able to
dismiss them before actually at the test
case is designed it seems to work pretty
well not good also common sense really
anybody have questions
right um I think the question is more
excuse me the question was there's each
test and need to understand the entire
system and I think the question if I
might rephrase it only we reframe we
could reframe let us say it's just
totally just to do it any place is more
but if they do need to know it or not
more like how what are they oh I don't
know much series and I don't really have
a good answer for that I have an
strengths answer which is famous so the
slippery you know just as much to do the
job in that more so um what I can do is
give you examples by any toes yeah how
should we need to understand is enough
to get the job done and I'm one doesn't
seem very helpful but I don't think
every taste when a prejudiced now every
last piece of functionality they say for
example is a six month training class
available to the user community is every
single tears to have to go through this
is 120 class know the depth of inner how
did this time to transition ever do that
one probably not let's for the a virtual
on the other hand to give you an example
of them because we call it and the kill
I saw a taste about 23 years ago down at
State Farm Insurance briefly state farms
a large organization they hit put in a
little town and overall about two hours
drive south of Chicago and to get to the
point here they had a work with that
time they prolly still do that did some
kind of insurance claims processing this
workgroup fearful people like it I
working on the door get a package in the
door and I have to go through a series
of steps to get the job done this series
of steps required a computer interaction
Asian diversity it was some kind of
terror odd someone for some kind of
response on the computer they had their
business process reengineering before
that it totally closed typically about
50 to 75 steps to get you one work unit
I do this then do this to do this 35
steps aren't the re-engineering which is
designed to simplify X without the
process it came down from about 50 to 75
steps more like maybe 20 to 30 to get to
the point here if you walked around the
user area the cubicles just obvious
first glance that the users were very
happy they seem motivated that like the
new system very productive and so on now
the performance is screw you know this
reason into the performances group was
monitored by another group a different
group who never met the users and never
seen what they did in terms of work and
never been in there were clear the
performance monitor group was in a
different building and what happened was
the following the work unit was reduced
from 50 75 state wanted Adam all I tilly
230 however each individual Sturridge
turn around with the computer system
took longer because there's much more
data registers much more data to
retrieve a message and so on so the
people monitoring the performance not
realizing these individual turnarounds
steps were just part of the whole look
to the individual components and they
each individual to memories first time
was about 32 piperazine swallow the guys
that microfilm concluded that there for
the system was in a terrible shape you
know particularly must have degraded by
about 35 cm in fact the office was true
that's the nicest example with them I'm
not sure I can tell examples better than
that one thing I say here and attempt to
be helpful she should think I via
facetious one thing I found with these
kind of things we need to do what I hold
feel for the edge you know day by day
you sort of ask yourself doing now
enough yet in this particular matias
knowledge on this video a strip of the
system do I know enough about to feel
confident I'm able to go ahead and I'm
not confident soon I had actually choice
I read being pressured with red line i
sent it another day and then reevaluate
day by day or even hour by hour right
now and up till now enough and sort of
feel for the asian any of their point to
say okay I'm dear we're done that's nice
and simple but of course it doesn't
allow for things like differences in
psychology as you say tissue psychology
Cynthia's would never let the thing go
out the door and say at the three
hundred thousand years or so even
studied or not it's kind of thing that
lets the best answer they can get
however I need now and often this is
digesting other ways to say we have this
toilet some people from Microsoft
yesterday they have a major new systems
with this tasted and the test is
obviously that man knows about the
functionality it's an internal system
from microsoft itself that I plan to get
some people are they using really end to
work with them so that helped a bit its
way around the problem so unfortunately
ounce is not very precisely this lean
our submission
that helpful I figure if I talked long
enough you forget the question to you
time is getting short it allows of
satellite let me fast-forward them the
subjectivity question is very important
maybe let's give you a quick our forest
or a few other hits here but let me just
give you a quick via the subjectivity
pressure there's a big a lot of
controversy going on about certification
of software test professionals you might
have heard about it there's a big
conservancy going on about licensing you
know States license offer these
professionals and some people believe
that we can have exams like engineers
have to say we are confident enough now
given that background but secretly with
us well let's say you putting together
an exam question for a certification or
licensing on this area of space tasting
you have an exercise to get the right
answer how do you get that one way to do
it passes to get a group of experts
together pisseed experts separately to
experience and have them do it and see
if they have similar answers the answer
all over the place obviously have a
problem so then simply summarize since I
do you take the call of the commonality
and said this is the right answer is the
answer we here so some of the person we
need to address here is you know if
you're going to use this stuff for
things like a vacation they did a good
job in taste now they didn't go to a
limitation in medication financial like
this and it has some kind of objectivity
where do we get it from what I'm doing
this experimentation to see how closely
different test is based on my level
discover the same answer or not I'm
getting really definitely i've done it
with about 250 TS is now round figures
definitely Rick's bag on us again the
group of experts that are socialized in
whatever theater quite a bit of being a
team of the same environment in
hopefully some more answers that might
be misguided and I we all sort of put in
correctly together experienced teacher
officials with widely different
backgrounds didn't know about with
widely different answers to the same
Krishna what's the answer to risk
assessment exercise and the people are
newbies in the new trauma center come up
with answers that saw it different in
the reason of the equations responders
the bridge between the different stances
to vision advanced operations of our
supplies the experts there is an idea
about whether the whole field is mature
enough
even have sort of one answer just
instead of a scattering of references in
the second one apparently the Navy's for
the experience we've already actual
learning involved people doing this no
better than they were 15 years ago and I
first started myself with yes so the
answers are no descriptions different
maybe to both things seem to be mix we
don't really have conclusions yet I hope
you see the importance of the questions
right that subjectivity if you in a
lawsuit you don't want somebody say this
is the way you should a tested because
this is the holy gospel on teasing you
might be able to say I used by judgment
and his defense of it so we've already
talked about this already consistent
either fizzes among the experience
tasters I'm going to this is a big hit a
little bit for the point here I said
before the gains and losses I treated
differently psychologically our friend
of the back seat this forsaken point
lower high properties walk this is a
situation pension methods I'll just I'll
just skip over this and who the time and
then get into this idea of prospect
theory these fellows developed us in the
he ended up never prize in economics in
2002 anybody have a charge people if
they were you re read any sorry this I
think it might have implications for us
perhaps for verification for software
testers because this total that how to
get a bit of sense of remodel resistance
what the probabilities are
the Tivoli south of the bottom of the
page here people when they drivin her
standard state five dollars on a
fifteen-dollar coat a little bit not 5
125 dollar cut we have less heartsaver
innocence kind of thing Kate went about
900 years ago when I was a graduate
student at Stanford I worked on this
kind of stuff myself not as a thinker I
was just sort of a hired hand I was some
kind of research and teaching fellowship
and two in my keep I did the daily
frosted in Italy the codeine
data-crunching virtus for some
psychology professors that we have us on
our part appear to be inconsistencies I
epitome exercise you should violate our
senses water how people think some more
examples here rather than try to read
them to you to you or just give you a
manager read browse through this and
reader
I think the key word here is at the
bottom of the page of symmetry as
symmetric behavior
and this anybody has any comments or
just moves right here another example I
don't mean to drown you in examples this
is probably enough for the moment in
other words what we are saying here is
the way the way the choices are framed
by the way the physician whatever would
you want to call it people will tend to
make different choices for the exactly
the same situation and this including
not just you know people who don't need
anything more than TV guide us in front
of people like professors and students
so doing this behavior
this is this is prospect theory theory
that in frustration really doesn't mean
too much i don't think i think the
follows cattlemen and series chosen
either so it would sound good yeah as to
do with the prospects of something
happening happening nothing's out there
or reveals and in terms of the mystery
scriptures will probably we tend to find
the problems the worse when there's some
kind of multiple combination of
properties you know this happens in that
happens and then I depends on the venti
or vice versa so you have some kind of
combination of off of this let's find a
century get worse other example I'll
moving very quickly I like lovely
through this so let me just pause and
make this up for a few more seconds I
just see if anybody's got any questions
on it you know we have Charlie hundreds
of thousands hundreds of thousands of
scrubs like this sure need apparent
inconsistencies of human behavior it's
good for us because it caused us to go
look for a better model of how people
think these two types are probably at
the sinkhole conjunction and the
disjunctive and always get them mixed up
on my head that I have them on the next
page basically our combinations of
events and as I just said a moment ago
we find that when there are multiple
properties involved people's you know
intuition as to what the right
percentages are tend to be even more off
and they seem to be successfully off to
some offices me
okay disjunctive ism but supportive even
they'd all be having the jesters
probably a and B and the second one is
successive iob might be two things
happening in parallel but I envy is to
be in sequence I then be if I haven't
sinned be so until they say the first
thing probably right happening or not
happening that is two together I have
any or not happy with add up to a
hundred is a probability that happens
and I might have a little self Olivia
said probably in assaulted a does happen
I say seven once we probably be
happening to hear for modify the two
properties together to get there so the
judgment of across modification this
chance of typical cause edition now one
of them conciliatory sites that's
because this way all the time but
another one's Cecilia richness and I
haven't found it clear petting it that
I've been able to put together but the
research are we doing on us getting
caught up research is the following I
mean working with various testing saying
ok let's look at you pissed this
assessment let's identify you as we
resolve a conjunction remember again
transactions where we have the word and
and whether you seem to always like this
look will congestion recently
underestimate let's say they put some
patterns together that's about the
current state of what I know about it
what I was thinking to do is the
following I want to develop some what
was the thumb here and they might be
country-specific I don't know they have
a generalist yet so it was the time to
say when you're doing your risk
assessment you should adjust you should
adjust for the differences between what
you think is going on or what was likely
to be going on so adjust to the
underestimation of every summation seen
and I'm going to categorize like this
conjunction of situations but again the
model with a multitude of this charter
which are additive by a straight to the
system let's about everything I wanted
to cover in these notes you see I have
anything else in there here
let me just see if you like to jump in
and ask patient's on this
yeah I don't know that I can give you I
don't know that I can give you excuse me
I'm sorry Thanks the question was can I
give them tell me again ok write the
answer the question was predator seduce
is about software testing I don't think
I understand the situation well enough
yet to have a generic answer and as for
Imaginary Constantine I think what I can
do and i'll be very happy to this this
isn't it right now as an example
one-on-one or off-line one-on-one just
go through your situations they aren't
do this and I did that because I think I
resist your formula again oh and then
what I do know is the following I've
done a lot of this everything is and
what I'm trying to do is the following
trying to fly these ideas here get to
what we already have
talking about Reggie respect this here
this one example
this is a when we talk about Angeles
factors initially I'm going through the
same processes I always did tivity with
test teams and I got you a risk
identification which means typically
using shakers saying what are the risks
in this situation the number of risks
would never end in a course which means
infinite so just try to come up with a
first cut at what we think of the
significant was surely something we
prioritized as we have that post Lister
risks and there might be categorized
like this customer impact this is
features and I have a high customer
practice features and I have a lot of
customer we then go through the
traditional spreadsheet or worksheet
approach then if I the risk factors
which row titles come up with some way
of a season the property than having
well I think I'd an income of various in
the consequences in so ranking the virus
the difference is that we're doing this
what we're doing now is under probably
column especially were saying okay
Justin would have done this don't see if
there's anything less theory that
conjuncture been multiple given
discharge of an additive might actually
apply you know that the tenderest I the
next kind of situation this number here
see this is a moderate risk it seems to
apply this trick that up to a harvest
that's kind of thing the seller area the
state so this is a fairly high risk but
you know that this for the arrest
neither so let's tweak it down there use
it as sort of a way of refining the the
sea priorities for the ranking are the
difference of taste now I'm talking very
generally but does that make sense is it
approached and as it if you'd like that
the very have to go through a situation
what do you sort of a frenzy by afraid
of experience but I think we've gotten
to the point where we can say okay for
this type of project the tasting project
here's what we do maybe we'll get
through in the future anybody else on
this question it's a good question i
just wish I had a better answer yes sir
I think it's rather than I think there's
some inflation of the other sister
following to indirectly answer first is
a lot of inflation out there that's
easily separate
is really optimistic and it's also
evidence that says that the Peace
Committee perhaps is what morosely there
should be this move that back cover of
professors were so ecology in the
Midwest and I've looked the ratio of
positive versus negative his cases it's
anybody here comfortable with the term
is positive and negative anybody not
here is comfortable around hey so then
one good question that I like to ask
multiple people on the spot but when
food fish not lie to our statuses as a
ratio of positive and negative hisses
you have mostest as if I don't really
know that number off the top of the
hizmet you know the finest of these four
faces I don't have the exact numbers in
federally with a Miss policies with this
is is that make sense to be something
like seventy percent positive or higher
variaty another visit positive and it
into a percent negative review based on
the history of the past prolly should be
reward the other way otherwise without
too optimistic we're not doing enough to
break the system now if you look at most
regression test case harvest which is a
bit unfair because as Italy sit up to
rerun tsk to vsphere to pass much
English in his case libraries are very
heavily weighted was the puzzle to his
case that 97 98 with him positively is
one among sheep is in- so so i would say
based on this work that pieces are
probably on their Twista so silly even
if they are even if we are optimistic
person a lot more realistic than sup
engineers and project managers other
people in general the rest of foreign
you silly and talking the fight to death
let me just add a little bit more here i
saw some into well i thought was an
interesting juxtaposition of numbers in
a few years ago i was doing a lot of
working late 1990s francisco's in a
solvent was a lot of work for Bell Labs
indigo solemn to Cisco down on Sanus I
an automated with his facility not sure
I bigger these days but back then it was
super hundred thousand test cases friend
automatically every life run fast enough
had cheap enough they listed for
regression test now in this free Griffin
is for real Cisco the viscous was
roughly about ninety-eight percent
positive that she wasn't negative at the
same time loosened had some giant his
lives in town Swiss of Chicago with
names like
never go on indian hill and they had the
art huge religion test case nervous that
the next was quite different and that
leaves the next is why I feel the same
puzzle case case assembly with a
negative this is ninety-eight percent
thirty percent does this go let's touch
on the reasons because it's going to tie
back to the list PlayStation will be
talking about one reason was the age of
the products back then typical associate
product was maybe two years or maybe one
hero baby she was always very new by
contrast the typical recent product was
quite all 15 20 30 years old and over
time is a tendency of every reason to
say striving for the various detail more
negative if you maintain it it's not
everybody does have you maintain it
because it is Tennessee the you know fix
problems and if they're severe enough
you guys ass pics apology alright i'll
create new test cases to catch those
kind of forms in the future as since
Lisa delicious taste so smart so every
time revision this is very tends to grow
in volume and here's a so sorry son
Edward slowly more negative that's not
the primary reason for the difference
primary reason was risk des lately
underlying technology cisco has rather
switch the tcp/ip based and then
basically how did a centralized ha be
decoupled lucent we're talking about the
giant telephone switches in here'll you
know Melissa telephone calls
simultaneously some of the big ones and
these old telephone switches had a
central architecture which means Valley
the names of these peace with the big
ones is called five es es there was a
brand name primary assist so telephone
suicide would take care of alien half
the rent furniture area there was
central athletes or finally switches
went down nobody could get downtown at
all so those are the high risk of
wandering dealin right here telephone
service to millions of people competed
the cisco routers one rather goes down
mrs. travis has rather true hundreds of
thousands of other routers to me in
