from social actions this is Peter dudes
and this is Christina Hager and they've
been working on some interesting
microphone on TPA and web keyboard all
kind of stuff but I thought you so don't
you guys take it away great thanks Thank
You Heskey and thank you google for
having us over to share our open source
initiative and I anticipate they'll be a
fair amount of synergies between stuff
you're working on and perhaps some of
the work we're doing I'm going to
Christine you want to load up social
actions calm meet the platforms so my
name is Peter deets i'm the founder of
social actions the last six months have
also been serving as the project lead
prior to six months ago social actions
was just up here so there was no project
lee there were no volunteers there is
nothing happening all that much so as of
six months ago we received some awards
we got some attention in the nonprofit
tech community and as a result we've
been moving forward fast with our effort
to aggregate peer-to-peer social change
campaigns as well as micro philanthropy
campaigns a little bit of background I
studied history at university
undergraduate masters degree in history
but I've always sort of been very
involved in the technology sector its
knowledge and community the last five
years I've worked exclusively a
nonprofit technology and and for the
last two years I've been particularly
interested in how micro philanthropy can
play a role in bringing about
large-scale change in society as
communities we live in and belong to
fuel attachments to
social actions is a its mission is to
connect individuals with opportunities
to take action and I guess I should
define what I mean by that to find what
taking action would mean in this case
and define of course what micro
philanthropy means so micro philanthropy
as our working definition is any small
scale activity or gesture that carries
with it some intent to do good and has
the effect of transforming communities
for the better and it's micro
philanthropy that we're talking about in
two cents micro because we're dealing
with very small gestures whether their
monetary or non-monetary and it's also
micro in the sense that it's facilitated
by technology the social networks we use
everyday blogs open source software and
of course the good old email what's
emerged in the last two years is truly a
sector a kind of micro philanthropic
sector composed of websites and
platforms that facilitate this small
scale micro philanthropic activity some
of the sites that we're talking about
deal exclusively with donations others
have to do with entirely non-monetary
actions like signing a pledge or joining
an offline event or simply lending your
support expertise and resources for some
specific goal or in support of a
specific cause now if we think of each
of the platforms that have emerged in
last two to three years as individual
fountains split pouring out these
opportunities to take action some of
which are created by individuals some
which are created by nonprofits they
just sort of are out there and you have
to know about the fountain you have to
know about the platform if you want to
get involved if you want to take up that
invitation to to be part of this
movement what social actions attempts to
do is remove the need for you going to
one of these social action platforms as
we call them and instead connecting you
directly wherever you are on the web
with an opportunity to be micro
philanthropic to make a small donation
or to sign a petition or to pledge to
attend
event or an offline meet up and we're
doing that through first aggregation of
actionable opportunities we've set up a
simple RSS based aggregation using Ruby
on Rails and we've created on top of
that a search interface that allows you
to search across platforms and we've
opened up this data set by an open API
so any third-party developer can create
something really cool with this data set
and in so doing connect people with
opportunities to take action so I we're
going to get into some details Christine
my colleague here is going to present an
overview of the micro philanthropy
sector and then I'm going to share with
you some more of the technical
challenges we've come across in building
out this open source repository of
actionable opportunities I'll mention
that we have a Google Group that
facilitates a lot of the organizing
around this project we have a Ning blog
with 200 members we've been written up
recently in a number of leading
philanthropy and nonprofit technology
blogs we've also appeared in The Wall
Street Journal The Daily Telegraph and
the chronicle of philanthropy and we've
been the recipient of several awards the
third place finish in the net square
mash-up challenge and a finalist in the
case fell in the Stockholm challenge
winner of the Case Foundation donate now
challenge and help me out here a
recipient of a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar grant from
the puri foundation out in the bay area
so without further ado I'm going to hand
it over to Kristine who's going to give
an overview of the of the Micra flan 3
sector I'll mention the last point that
we would love and to extend an
invitation to each of you as individuals
to both get involved in this project to
consider yourself potential micro
philanthropists that make use of these
operative these platforms but also
partners in our effort to create this
infrastructure that will help micro
philanthropy fulfill its promise
hi as Peter said I'm Christina ger and I
get to be formally involved at this
project in the near term as platform
liaison and I'll explain briefly what
that means I got to know about social
actions and became a fanatic fan of it
just last fall when I found Peters blog
and joined the google group at that time
so I've been informally involved for
quite a while as this thing has been
ramping up the reason that I'm so
passionate about micro philanthropy and
what's being done in this sector stems
from an experience I had a couple of
years ago creating a campaign on give
meaning which is one of the platforms
that we aggregate from someone passed me
an online article of an interview of a
boy in Nepal who had been out of school
since he was 12 years old taking care of
his family and a bunch of people posting
comments to that said boy wouldn't it be
great if we could do something about
that and help him get back to school and
that's okay well let's believe we could
make that happen we got the technology
available and it was very challenging
and continues to have challenges
although it's rewarding too because he's
back in school but a site like give
meaning made that experience much easier
than it ever could have been without it
to collect all of that that support so
so as a platform liaison what I
basically do is connect with these these
platforms these websites encourage them
to develop RSS feeds if they haven't
already encouraged them to collaborate
with us and get explicit about what
their mission is and what our mission is
and where we overlap and also and and
and encourage them to think of their
contribution as contributing to more
than just each platform separately they
are there actually is the secretary
merging a micro philanthropy and and the
platforms are just beginning to discover
what the benefits could be of
collaborating amongst themselves so the
sector what is what is it it's online
giving and receiving of gestures of
actions of compassion 112 another stuff
our definition of philanthropy millions
of dollars being funneled through these
sites five to ten dollars at a time
millions of volunteer hours being
distributed one to two hours at a time
we've identified already about 80
websites that are creating these
opportunities to take action in this way
any of them are very big first giving
alone is responsible for about 50
million dollars worth of donations
funneling through two nonprofits
volunteer match three and a half million
volunteer connections but many are
emerging many are just just starting up
so I shouldn't have to turn back I lost
my train of thought so so I'm going to
describe three of those platforms and
some just very briefly a little bit of
detail to give you a sense of the
diversity and the incredible variety of
kinds of actions that are taking place
within that umbrella that we're calling
platforms and then go into some detail
and then describe why we believe why I
believe very strongly that this is more
than just breaking down philanthropy
into small pieces and moving it online
what we're describing we think is an
infrastructure that's fundamentally
different and that changes changes the
way that philanthropy is going to is
taking place so three quick examples one
I really love is a group right here in
New York called modest needs and they
help anyone who is making ends meet
they're not on public assistance may be
living paycheck to paycheck they get hit
with an unexpected expense and reach out
to modest needs fill out an application
and ask for help and handling that
expense and anybody visiting that
website can search through these vetted
applications and decide to that they
want to contribute to helping that that
person out so one recent story a
gentleman lost a foot the medical
expenses were paid for but he needed to
adjust the pedals on his car so he could
continue to drive to work not risk
losing his job put that application on
Modest needs and and the donors
collectively decided to cover that for
him a second very different type of
website should I speak a little more
slowly being platform liaison helps me
get over my fear of public speaking I
meant better that Andrew a second one
the point com very different group the
point is out of Chicago they help they
give anybody an opportunity to raise
funds or sign a petition or start a
start a campaign to enable people to
take action the difference being that if
a pledge or any kind of fundraising
campaign is started on the point nobody
puts in an actual dollar nobody
actually does anything until there's
enough collaboration enough
participation to reach a tipping point
so if you might be reluctant to actually
put your money in not knowing if enough
money is going to be pulled together to
have the impact that you want the point
removes that reluctance and gives people
a chance to to move forward and make it
make a difference david cone who's
active in citizen-led journalism use the
point to get over 100 people to to give
25 hundred dollars altogether to hire
reporters to fact-check political
campaigns political advertisements in
the election coming up in San Francisco
so he put that out there a couple
hundred people and the aggregate put in
twenty five hundred bucks and the
tipping point was reached and those
reporters are now being hired she's
pretty cool wouldn't have happened
otherwise and a third platform it's very
different from the first two is knob or
and that is dutch for neighbor this is a
group that comes out of the netherlands
they connect online volunteers to
projects going on in villages in Africa
and one example of the group recently
decided to start a dairy farm project
because they needed some income in the
village and they needed some more
protein and they tapped in the community
tapped into online volunteers from Hong
Kong Australia the UK South Africa for
help in deciding which livestock to use
when they decided on goats which breeds
to use and now they're they're tapping
into that online volunteer pool to help
with their training materials and so the
village guides that process and knob or
allows volunteers that's happened to the
project as it moves as it moves forward
and evolves so why is this different
than big money top-down programmed
philanthropic assistance I really think
that that what we've got here is we're
building an infrastructure that reflects
it's got its got a design in a system
that reflects the society that we live
in more than top-down pre-programmed
long-term projects would that's a very
newtonian mechanistic model
and if we draw from chaos theory and
quantum theory and some other ideas that
excite me and might be familiar to this
group as well we want to design an
infrastructure that reflects the
nonlinear relationships we have in a
society and with each other as we
participate in these philanthropic
gestures and three characteristics come
to mind of a system that would reflect
this nonlinear the nonlinear dynamics
that were actually engaged when when we
reach out to help one another and those
would be lots and lots of feedback lots
and lots of points of entry
participation and and the ability to as
you participate change your role
reflexively and adaptively as you engage
so examples on lots of participation we
have a decentralized system here with
thousands of points of entry to either
give or receive or learn or put in your
funds or your insights whatever you have
to contribute and gain from this sector
and knob or is the project that i
mentioned from knob or is a great
example of that and and the the ability
to just let me turn the thought the
second so this participation and many
points at many points of entry and being
able to switch hats so one moment we
might find a campaign that we'd love to
volunteer for another we decide that we
want to fundraise for or we want to
collect funds for and we want to be able
to switch hats as we step in and out of
these opportunities to be philanthropic
and modest needs is a great example of
that sixty-five percent of the people
who approach modest needs fill out
applications asking for help on their
website become future donors in the on
modest needs so they make it really easy
for people to respond to their
situations as it as it changes so we
really do believe that this represents
an infrastructure that's developing
that's massively scalable phenomenally
decentralized and represents a very
different system a different way to
engage in the sector than we've seen
before that requires that this
infrastructure requires some
technological development and I'm going
to pass it back over to Peter who's
going to talk about how you actually
build this the easy button that were
that were that were constructing here
the process that we've been been
adopting for creating this
infrastructure for micro philanthropy is
equally decentralized and hopefully
equally scalable to the infrastructure
that Christine was was was discussing um
I want to kind of restate what social
actions does provide an example of one
of the web applications that have been
built using our API and then sort of put
out there are some of the challenges
that we've come across in really
providing an API that contains and
disseminates Syndicates actual
opportunity actionable opportunities but
with all of the context and meaning and
rich information that a potential action
taker would want to have on hand when
they're making that decision on whether
or not to be philanthropic at that
moment so social actions stated very
simply connects individuals with these
opportunities to take action we've
aggregated the action the micro
philanthropy campaigns from at this
point 25 platform partners that number
is going to go up to 28 at the end of
this week and we expect that with time
as news of our open source repository of
actionable opportunities grows or
expands more and more micro
philanthropic platforms will find us and
plug into our data set so the data set
is out there it's in the public domain
it's free to add actions to the platform
it's free of course to search the
platform and all of the web applications
that get built and syndicate these
action opportunities won't pay any sort
of licensing fee or need or they will
have there will be no need to create
friction between the developers creating
those applications and the applications
that they've just built so in its
current form our API aggregates some
very basic information we're using RSS
as I mentioned earlier and so what we
can pull in right now is the title of
the campaign the little description a
link to where the campaign resides
obviously we know the plan
form that created it because it's
produced the RSS feed and we have the
date that the action was created that's
great and you can do a lot with that
information in the aggregate we consider
that a huge accomplishment just to have
approached these 25 platforms encourage
them to create the RSS feed and
succeeded in building out this open
source system that aggregates and then
syndicates actionable opportunities with
the open API as it currently stands by
the way I'll point out it was developed
by a worker-owned cooperative up in
Brattleboro Vermont called the
brattleboro Tech collective they've just
done a phenomenal job putting this
together the search method itself is
finks for any of the developers in the
room and that is a really quick way of
searching across a large data set for a
keyword and pulling up the the matches
though so what we've done with the API
in its current form is develop a widget
called related ways to take action and
this widget is actually inspired by the
work of Google so thank you for having
inspired us in this regard our widget
can be placed on any web page in any on
any blog in any context on the web and
it identifies the three most relevant
keywords from that web page that
represent the content of the page and
then it makes a query to our API and
pulls back the three actions that Sphinx
has determined match that keyword I can
do a little run through after the
presentation if anyone's curious so if
we take an example of our widget being
put on a website like Human Rights Watch
Human Rights Watch has a lot of articles
without human rights abuses around the
world for each of those stories our
widget would present three at first
three actions that someone can take if
you're not inspired by them you click
the more button you get three more
actions all from different platform
partners participating in our system and
then hopefully one of the nine because
you go through three screens would
inspire you and you can just go straight
to the platform and take the action
required the goal is to catch
the catch people to catch potential
action takers at that moment that
they're most inspired that they're most
revved up and really want to effect some
change on the in regard to the content
that they're consuming online so yes
Crick exempt okay sure i'll use the let
me give you two examples first let's
have a look at our search interface so
if we type in Burma for example there
was enormous storm in Burma a few months
back in the last week there's been one
action created that is asking for
volunteers in in in in Burma and it
comes to us by idealist org if we change
the search query to show me all actions
referring to Burma create at any time we
get 19 actions from global giving which
is one of our micro philanthropy
partners that focuses on donations to
international development projects we
get a petition from care to and the
volunteer opportunity from idealist.org
a donate a fundraising campaign from
bring light and some actions from
change.org give meaning and a few others
so that's the example of our search
interface in action we don't think that
every morning millions of people are
going to come to our website and search
for opportunities to take action when
that happens wonderful but until it
happens this API that I was describing
will connect and move those actions to
where people are already sure sure yeah
the question was can you sort by more
advanced information than just keyword
so if you go to our search and click
advanced query advanced search you get
this interface we've listed all of the
platform partners and you can check or
uncheck what you're looking for which
platforms you want to search you can use
this pulldown menu to bring up the kinds
of actions you want to search for right
now it's just you can select one but
we'll change that in the coming weeks so
say you're looking for
volunteer opportunities created in the
last 14 days from all of our platforms
you could go for that your question was
regarding location right right if
exactly yeah if you're not in Africa but
you want a volunteer you'd go to a site
like nabor if you're not in Africa but
you want to affect change you would be
looking up fundraising campaigns that
you contribute contribute to or local
events in your community that lends
support to community in Africa way to
the microphone it's a very good segue
for where we're headed with the API but
i do want to present the related ways to
take action just really quickly because
there was a request for that so we've
created again inspired by google social
actions labs which is what our kind of
incubator for these web applications
that draw on the api and here's the
related ways to take action so there's
the form when they go quickly to HRW
here's an article on child soldiers this
is a live demo if it doesn't work I
apologize but I'm pretty confident in
Eric Cooper and Joe Solomon's abilities
they're the two individuals who built
this widget for us so say your website
is HRW if you want to get a sense of
what actions would be presented when you
if you put that widget on your site
you'd put in the URL that you're adding
the widget to you click this button that
says create widget and here is the name
of the title of the page you looked up
in this case US Congress acts to
prosecute recruiters of child soldiers
and here are some actual opportunities
first African United partnerships
prevent spread not sure what care to
petitions child education the fight
against something care to some more
petitions if you go to
the mouseover has to be full text that's
again Eric Cooper's brilliant
development and in action the third
screen includes this more button and
that's where you would find out actually
what keywords were found for that
particular page and in this case its
soldiers United and child so we have
done a query against this ruby-on-rails
system it's brought back these nine and
if you want to see more results you
click the more button and it takes you
to the social actions page beginning
with search result number 11 and it's
found 2064 total actions that fit that
query so if you can imagine this sort of
application that we built with just the
very limited data set of title platform
type of action and link you can begin to
think well what would be possible if our
API included a lot more rich information
about actions what would it look like if
there was a micro format that the
platforms could use to send us up to
date information about each of their
actions and well just turns out we're
developing a micro format that would
help platforms send over information to
us with the latest information about
their actions and then our API would be
able to push that out in real time to
all of the web applications that are
expecting that kind of information let
me take a quick sip of water and I'll
then I'll go into some of the data
points that we've identified common to
virtually all micro philanthropic
opportunities shoes
and there is a payment mechanism you
also mention maybe some ice cream to
make sure that eventually pink one
before you know everybody can continue
are you sure that finally the bottom
eight you're you're you're setting me up
for all of my segues so thank you that's
great let me let me finish with this
microformat example then we'll go into
sorting and filtering this enormous data
set obviously that's the holy grail of
this whole thing do you actually be in
by microformat sure you might be
catching me on that when i say
microformat I'm really just referring to
a universal data standard for moving
around these actionable opportunities
I'm sure sure so this what we think is
Allegra for mmm-hmm gotcha great so
really what I should be saying instead
of micro format is a universal schema
for referring to actual opportunities
and how you package that data determines
whether it's an XML feed or a micro
format in the microformats org style or
whether it's an API connection JSON is
the format for API connections that were
most familiar with so in this sense it
would we plan to embed microformats org
style microformat and all of the search
results so for any reason your browser
is able to identify the presence of an
action it could do something with that
microformat because it's been embedded
in the HTML with the span tags and all
that but more important before we get to
the micro format structure we need to
know what's in the micro format and
that's where the conversation is right
now with between social actions and our
platform partners and also among the
platforms independently obviously as an
aggregation tool we want to be able to
pull in as much information about the
actions and have it be up to date as
possible the platforms are just coming
to that realization as well it would be
great if we could syndicate this stuff
so what we've created
is a google doc that lists all of the
fields from the donorschoose.org open
API and then maps that to a more
generalized schema for action microphone
throwback opportunities in general and
then we've added on a few fields that
aren't necessarily relevant to the
donorschoose.org model because it's
dealing exclusively with classroom
projects and moving money to the
teachers who have brilliant ideas for
classroom projects the fields that were
discussing their there about two dozen
of them some of them relate to the
context of the action what it's about
what's the name of the nonprofit that's
implementing it or serving as a conduit
where is it the action going to happen
so some kind of geo location of either
the person who created the action where
the action happens what's the expected
impacted area geographically speaking
for that action and then other things
crucially the expiry date for the action
when's the last date you can sign on to
that action or contribute if it's a
fundraiser that's one kind of collection
or category of the fields we want to
embed in this micro format or universal
schema for micro philanthropic campaigns
the second category of fields has to do
with the progress of that campaign to
date so it's about the feedback that's
been generated in relationship to that
action and in this case it would be like
how many people have signed on to this
action how many people have donated if
it's a if it's a fundraiser and then
social actions will add and I have there
been any pictures generated from the
action so potential action takers can
see the event unfolding in real-time
social actions will add to that
information its own meta data like how
many times has this action main click
through as a result of our API or how
many in unique websites refer to that
action and we can use that information
to help filter so let me conclude with
some thoughts on filtering and sorting
our data set and then we'll open it up
to questions I'm really looking forward
to absolutely the toughest questions you
have for us and any insights on how we
could be making this better
so filtering and sorting is kind of the
the most difficult thing I mentioned at
the beginning that each of these
platforms is kind of like a fountain
whatever the verb is distributing
actionable opportunities the last thing
we want to do on social action side is
turn those fountains on their side and
kind of create a giant fire hose that
overwhelms action potential action
takers with opportunities to get
involved we want to be connecting
individuals with the actions that are
most relevant to their particular
disposition they're a theory of change
their ability to engage with an
actionable opportunity at that moment so
for the 12 the two dozen fields or data
points that I described in the micro
forma that we're developing that's going
to those data points are going to be
critical for providing much more
meaningful filtering of the data set as
a whole if someone is interested in
being that last person who makes an
action happen or makes a campaign on the
point tip we can create a web
application that says just in time
actionable opportunities and it lists
only petitions or fundraisers that are
about to reach their fundraising goal
never mind you know actions that might
not get that far on the other hand there
might be people who really want to be
that first person who says this is a
great idea let's run with it and we can
create a web application from the data
in the API connecting individuals with
actions that have just now been created
and if you fill out some information
about the kinds of actions you're
looking for social actions or this web
application that's been created will
notify you immediately by a mobile phone
or email or by a social network of this
opportunity that's just come up so you
can think about the filtering and
sorting possibilities they're really
endless I'll conclude by saying that or
reiterating what Christine said which is
we are in the process of creating an
open source repository actionable
opportunity
we want it to be massively scalable we
want it to be decentralized we want to
create as many entry points into micro
philanthropy as possible thank you where
are we based we're virtual yeah so I'm
based in Montreal from them from New
York originally Christine's in Michigan
our developer is in our developers well
some of them are in brattleboro some of
them are wandering and and 111 fellow at
Joe Solomon is based in Vancouver how do
we end up here in New York in this room
so so I'm involved in a surety that I
started with ten years ago which
provides scholarships for kids in the
pool where they talked about meeting
this kid and Nepal was supporting his
family by parking motorcycles and got
men do and it got this response with
people said oh we should thanks we
should help this kid out but that's
that's very difficult first of all just
finding him again I mean the reporter
found them but then you know to find
them again and and get him enrolled and
God knows what the difficulties are and
why he's where he is but it got enough
interest and Christine had enough energy
to actually get something started and
she approached our organization to see
if we could help and because of the type
of project it was we didn't we don't
usually do some my bad but some of the
people in the organization specifically
our president thought he would like to
help and so this that project got
started and to date has been quite
successful and it's an interesting
example of philanthropy and that's how i
started learned I learned about social
actions I thought that would be
interesting to present here that answer
your question
talk about going together for the
actions okay these action opportunities
whatever you call them there I mean if
one goes down the road of developing
schemas in in the area of nonprofits
that's only one of many schemas that
probably should exist I mean for
instance one thing that you're probably
going to refer to but you probably won't
have a lot of you probably won't go into
it in great depth would be just the
description of the nonprofit itself your
focus is on describing the action as
opposed to describing a non-profit there
are a lot of nonprofits for instance
that might not have these specific sort
of actions but just have general needs
you know like they need a couple hundred
tons of wheat or something like that and
I'm guessing that that's probably out of
your scope as well because that's like
big-time philanthropy as opposed to
maybe micro philanthropy or whatever but
there is a there there if if one thinks
that developing scheme is is a good
thing by the way I do think they're good
and I'm actually working on a project
which is which is doing that are there
any what one would one would think this
really should be sort of a sub scheme of
something much larger are you are you
aware of any other schema projects that
you're working with or other people who
are taking the same approach but maybe
from different angles as far as as far
as we know social actions is the only
effort to create a micro
philanthropically m'a some of our
platforms have or any kind of
philanthropic scheming there are some
other examples though for well I should
mention a subset of our platforms I have
entered into conversations on their own
about how to share data and those are
all projects that have received funding
from the MIDI our network that's an
aside there are other efforts within
nonprofit technology to create Universal
schemas and one example is H grant
initiative and that's an effort to
enable foundations to syndicate and
publish what their grant opportunities
are at the moment and therefore kind of
bypassed the very expensive
infrastructure and databases that have
been created and called over time
representing what foundations fund if
this each grant were to become popular
and i believe it is gaining some
traction than nonprofits or grant
seekers could excuse me immediately
connect with those opportunities to seek
the macro kind of philanthropic support
that you were discussing well Google
probably offer quite a bit more than
tech but i would start there actually
the resource pool that's represented in
the google employees between the ears is
probably your most valuable asset as far
as our open source grassroots initiative
is concerned so we would love to see
google employees given the opportunity
to lend some support perhaps one hour a
week or one day a week they're probably
won't give you a day but to to to help
us work through some of these challenges
I just remembered I completely left out
the issues of creating an open API and
an encapsulating meaningful data that is
incredibly sub qualitative or difficult
to to pack into an automated system so
if a Google employee can enlighten us on
how to seamlessly identify the cause
area of a microphone throughout the
campaign in a really reflexive way that
reflects the changes of a campaign over
time maybe it started off being
environmental but with within a few
weeks it quickly shifted to something to
do with poverty or education or maybe it
covers all three cause areas we need
help in developing that system there are
other things that for example how would
we identify the activist missed
of an action some people will be very
put off by actions that are too radical
or too conservative or too religious so
we want to be able to layer on to our
data set that ability to pull out the
actions that fit a certain profile of an
individual so those sorts of big tough
questions I think some Google brains
would be able to help us with and you
would be joining in a conversation
that's already out there community
that's wrestling with this thing with
these questions and you'll be helping us
in resolving them we're moving towards a
501c3 status what we're looking for
right now is a fiscal sponsor that could
provide the legal infrastructure for
being able to apply for things like the
Google Grants but yes we are familiar
with Google Grants sure sure okay thank
you the AdWords words yes so at this
point it's only I was thinking about
Adsense actually when you were down like
this but currently it's just text ads on
Google so we don't syndicate any display
ads or even texted on to our partner
network media and I don't know the
status of any change
to that but you know what you were
describing looks like absence so maybe
nonprofits you know can sign up for you
know for and really not receive any
payment removal and Association placing
those ads on their sites button perhaps
you know foster more awareness about
related organizations or ways people can
take a burden if it's a site that's more
about education you know but something
like that I don't know if that's in the
works but it may be related to this
thank you can potentially do something
interesting with if you had a google
adwords grant then you could use the
adwords section of their search results
as you are widget hmm take some good
keywords and put here the action comes
there yeah we we've just come from a
luncheon that we hosted or we didn't
host experiment office but we convened i
was hosted by changing our world and and
we were talking about this so how do we
move from this data set that exists to
and develop a marketing strategy that
would actually connect potential action
takers in a big way with this with these
opportunities to take action so far our
focus has been much more decentralized
and bottom-up we want developers to
create web applications that syndicate
the these opportunities but i think at
the lunch what we arrived at was well
you know we really have to go the big
guns wrote not tues a military metaphor
and we need to go the decentralized
grassroots route so i think you'll be
looking you'll be hearing that at some
point we would be able to do an ad
purchase that would help to syndicate
these opportunities you know host sites
like this you're hosting is it similar
to amazon's e3 or a year it's less
general specifically geared towards
hosting website
if you would like to buy can i'm on a
machine mmm App Engine is the web server
that handles scale and stuff like that
friend video on the amazon thing you
gotta scale an issue you'd have to go in
and say go I need to buy more machines
let's check right now it's free up until
a point though yeah but but that's a
pretty good right it's actually not
really but it's dirt cheap imports it's
not true if the Grants Program didn't
order anything are we gonna do something
we're supposed to do something I thought
I may not be in the loop on that
Courtney Tuchman made that's sure did
the Google Grants added the google
checkout without fees for nonprofits and
added an app that you posted we've got
the effect of nonprofit Webster
President Lee's but these guys don't you
never take actual money yourself or
rightly on which I which chris so they
wouldn't be able to use the check out
what would it but he makes a good point
something is that at least until the end
of the year if anybody does in credit
card processing if your nonprofit will
give you a free credit card processing
and then after the end of the year
assuming that we start charging again
which isn't certain it'll still be like
the cheapest credit card processing idea
anyway so whether night you can use it
I'm too tired from ionizing of
installations because the free credit
card processing is like getting a free
four or five percent anywhere between
three and five percent so free money
yeah I'm curious actually a question for
you okay is that listed on the Google
information for nonprofits what a lot of
students they abrogated a bunch of stuff
there to make it
yeah I i I'm on that google group for a
non-profit so I'll check in and I can
email you if that's available yeah I
wanted to make sure I answered the
question from the back a bet regarding
filtering did I feel like no no no your
question was is fine is search the
valuables but as that is there a
bottleneck in the first place is that do
you feel like we have answered any of
that or do we need to revisit so i need
to find you know what who did I can do
then i am going to show you are an
aggregator so then i'm going to end up
on one of these sites but you will have
to provide some information about myself
maybe some credit card information and
and maybe i want to manage multiple
projects so so it is really complicated
because you have the problem of single
sign-on so you know when to get to me to
another pie square area so it's a big
mess and so I think that commit the
dream picture and then you know what
should you know you know that's the
first step in the right to buy pieces i
would like to basically go to your side
I need to enter my profile once and only
once and basically I have you know all
my projects all the people i work with
and and everything and this is the
single point of access to all my you
know we get goodies persona share and so
is it you know the division that 12 and
is compatible with the nature of the of
the arena because i'm sure that this guy
they are they going to find you know all
the day i'm sure there is some kind of
I'm a medium you know naive and evil and
the do-over Flav and ever it is
something some software and maybe they
you really want to have their own little
Africa this is mine okay final point
there is you know one way to play nice
such as step whether it's moving boxes
mm-hmm wanna take that ok yeah well your
assumptions are correct yes these
platforms you know as they learn about
each other they often see themselves as
competitive with with each other
there are reasons for for developing a
particular niche and saying you know we
serve this sector extremely well and we
should be the go-to platform for you
know go-to destination site for that
kind of action and so I would say maybe
one of our dream scenarios long term
would be to have so much to have those
walls come down to the extent that
they're comfortable with people using
the social actions API to access their
site and and perhaps interacting was
with an intermediary that with the
function with interacting with
functionality that doesn't reside on on
that site exclusively so it's so
different for each one for those that
create opportunities for feedback
creating those mechanisms is an
absolutely important part of their
mission for some they don't quite
understand that feedback or they've
limited the their definition of the life
cycle of a campaign so quickly that it's
just reach a fundraising goal and done
no community no extensive relationship
with a campaign leader beyond that
moment for others they're building huge
communities that that track these
projects through time through extended
time with blog and video posts and
really a lot of communication back to
the donor donor base or the donors so it
really is different for each for each
platform and that speaks to the
challenge of standardizing the types of
information that they could they could
feed to to an aggregator like ours so
yeah it implied or just assumed
competitiveness and assumed really
unique bitches bitches here but it is
we've got another question it is going
it is giving way to a more collaborative
spirit and Christina and I and other
people involved in social actions I
would hope are playing some role in in
in in in getting those platforms to the
point where they see the collaborative
opportunities and something like a
universal ID for logging in
the platform's would be awesome we had
just took this lunch that we just came
from was with I think we had almost ten
platforms that are that are here in the
you in New York eight or ten represented
and next weekend in Washington we've got
almost two dozen coming together and
these are brand-new sit around a table
get to see your peers close up and talk
about what challenges and opportunities
you share and we're being encouraged to
create retreats and workshops and
conferences so that more of these
conversations can take place so I
actually I wanted to like tutor math to
medical students in New York cool and I
had a really hard time finding something
to do yeah and because like I would
search and I would search in New York
and it would be a huge articles or
whatever he stuff that was about it from
your newspapers without other places or
about like Westchester which I wasn't
really willing to go to and they really
had a very hard time finding someplace
and i actually just called up the
kindergarten that I went to in New York
and he was also like a public middle
school it happened to know of some
organization that works in their
cafeteria on Saturdays and that was it
so I I don't know if more of a comment
really drawing on what are those said
earlier but location is like really
important to me so I find like a lot of
people's demands of me or like oh I just
want your money and then you can just go
and and for me like issues that I care
about are much more important to me than
that um and I would much rather like I
would give of my time and my money but
not really just of my money and so it
would be great if location was a part of
this I think which it doesn't seem to be
yet it's not there yet but its its its
features large in this Universal schema
and one of the fields for example is
will be scale scale what is the scale of
this project if you're looking for local
projects then those actions are going to
tag local and then they're also been
getting going to going to be given a zip
code or a postal code or some
coordinates so you get a sense of where
that is and for your search you can you
could filter based on your location
maybe the location filtering happens
automatically because it takes some GPS
coordinates of where you are at that
moment can you say anything of the
process you're going through the define
the schemer
you doing this is a lot of times in on
the technology side what we'll do is
we'll create a like a wiki somewhere
anelia mailing list which is a place
where we can go and have conversations
and people can join in is is there
something like that yeah but if I wanted
to make comments on your schema tomorrow
morning how would I do that we need a
couple places Google Google of features
large and that before providing that
forum so here's our google doc which
shows the schemas that's currently
conceived these are the donors choose
fields the fields exposed in donors
choose API and here are the fields that
I proposed for the universal schema by
the way you see RSS a it's short for
really simple social actions and that's
what we hope this thing will be named
and for lay consumers they would just be
subscribing to action feeds or an action
well opportunity they wouldn't
necessarily say not even that's Kyle
Shannon and the up let us in associate
on the uplift Academy thought through
this idea of a microformat a few years
back so here are the more generalized
fields working from the donors choose
example and then here are the fields i
added beyond what donors choose offers
that might be relevant to organizations
as to our platform partners and then how
you discuss this well let's see
nothing's been posted here because we
have a Google Group and a blog where
that discussions happening so Technology
Committee inside the name logged out
social actions is where work yeah here's
the technology committee that is working
through this question of how to develop
a micro format and here's my post that I
updated the the microformat schema and
I'm linking to the google doc
conversations actually are
are distributed a bit too much so some
of these conversations more recently
have happened just through phone
conference calls and I haven't been
captured or they've happened in my inbox
and haven't been captured you've got all
these you've got 24 groups you're
working with them that's a tiny slice of
all the groups that are doing this sort
of stuff mm-hmm it's like almost
everything in philanthropy is
phenomenally fragmented ridiculous
amounts of duplication between the
organizations in variety mm-hmm um can
you talk about that why is that the case
is it I mean what you know the cynical
view is how everybody just likes do
their own thing and they they don't want
to work with other people are having fun
hmm the other possibility is that it's
just really hard for people to find out
about who else is in the space one thing
would be there's just so much
opportunity that in fact you know you
can create all these little niches and
they they really should be there of
course one wonders is there well anyway
yeah then what's going on here why is it
such a benefit structure I I think that
feeds directly back into my my
statements earlier about this being a
reflective a very nonlinear chaotic
complex environment and we're all
responding to whatever compels us to
want to create a solution or create a
resolution to a problem or a paradox and
we have an opportunity to do that if
we're compelled to create something new
then we've gotten opportunities to do
that so part of it is just that there's
there's so much opportunity to get
involved in so many ways to do that that
we're able to respond create something
that was sort of like when you're
watching sort of like seeing you know
the evolution of economies and merchant
systems as opportunities came to
actually create profit and and build a
build a middle-class same thing
proliferation of philanthropic
activities and of nonprofits simply that
there's a space created to do that and
people are feeding into it so I don't
know that I don't know that it would be
a goal
like I don't think of all of these
platforms and all of this activity as
mom and pop shops mama pop like video
store rentals that eventually there will
be just one or two big blockbuster type
you know top-down groups I don't think
that's the goal I think the goal is to
allow the proliferation of really unique
niche filling organizations and then
make it manageable to learn what's going
on and respond connect with whatever
across as entire universe means the most
to you and one of the benefits one of
the most powerful benefits to me of the
API is that instead of just looking at
one of these platforms you can search
across the entire spectrum look by
keyword or or issue whatever it is that
you're searching for and see boy there's
three very similar projects that are
going on in three neighboring villages
in this part of Peru and you know I
wonder if they're talking to each other
or instead of you were looking for an
opportunity to volunteer if you're
actually thinking I want to I want to
find some vile I want to create a
campaign that will bring volunteers to
this school like I want to raise my hand
for that and tap in and find three or
four others you know within 10 miles of
your zip code that you can go learn from
and we so create an infrastructure where
you can find out where there's overlaps
and inefficiencies learn from what's
working well so for me it's not a matter
of trying to simplify what's going on
out there let's just make it manageable
let's let's not be overwhelmed and
confused but actually be able to respond
intelligently to this incredibly diverse
field of activity I don't think we're
ever going to minimize that diversity
and that heterogeneity I think it's our
challenge to figure out how to work
better with it kind of a rambling answer
how do i do yeah the answer really good
question it's a very questioning inside
because I think any of us have tried to
delve into this encounter this and
that's also what happened when we
started their organization
we you know that the question comes out
why why would you want to start an
organization shouldn't there already be
but any almost everything you touch the
pound is true it's incredibly hard to
find still the other ones that reflect
what you had in mind people have an idea
that they feel is separates them and not
from the other ones like something like
the tipping point might have been by
somebody who looked at like hundreds of
sites or organizations that have
information they say themselves in this
ridiculous i'm adding like 25 awesome
cause and it's never going to happen and
you know but it's one thing they felt
was so different about the day they made
a methodology of it and and in some
parts of the world you know there's
other things like trust you know you
don't feel like the organizations that
exist are doing what you think needs to
be done and and as for the duplication I
think that's something that's really
interesting to look into because it
seems at least to me that there are
certain things that could be duplicated
at a de los so if they're duplicated
then you're you're wasting time but I
think a lot of the other stuff that
could be seen as duplication is it
really so for example gathering you know
anything to do with with finances that
duplication is a complete waste of time
for any organization of fundraising
purely neyo just a process of
transferring money and reducing
emissions anything that you can do to
offload at another organization would
say go out the rest of the stuff and all
the people on the ground doing whatever
it is that the organization is trying to
do seems to for the most part extremely
distinctively screw things that I've
been able to to observe so I'm not
answering a question but I'm counting
that I've been noticing the same the
same thing
Cena way which they can you merge so
going back to my butternut question so
whatever I did when I go on the web and
I find tonight or go on a website and
I'm making a disaster in China I don't
know where ever completely missed a
number so if you see that the secure
micro payments system make a big
difference sure so you're right that
what we've tackled is the distribution
layer of scaling up micro philanthropy
well there are other zones or sectors or
subsets of this emerging space and
transaction free donations is key micro
payments is key I've talked to paypal
about what their plans is for micro
payments and they said well we can
charge you less per we can remove the
25-cent additional fee when you make
your payment but the overall percentage
we take is going to be higher so that
wasn't very helpful we have about four
three platforms that we work which with
that are the mic the payment gateways so
there's network for good as a payment
gateway there's pink giving which is a
payment gateway that accepts currencies
in different 33 different currencies so
you saw let's solve that problem and
they have a lower transaction fee than
in the case of network for good of
course there's PayPal which is the
engine behind certain of these platforms
that we presented and then there's a new
one coming out called revolution money
exchange which is the new project by
Steve case and that initiative will
allow 40 commission donations and
transfers of money so I guess what I
what I would respond to your question
with is it's being done it's not our
niche but folks are working on micro
payments
but do you see that this is the one of
the key botanist this Christian IV
passion that you know finding the right
you know I time or another addition to
contributing for him was about the night
okay so I mean yeah going back of the
big you know the adobe the domain of you
know geography and and where are the
barriers to enter right yeah there's
there are at the moment various points
of friction we've identified the
syndication and search as one of those
points of friction another point of
friction is how do you actually process
the payment manage the infrastructure
and as heskey pointed out you don't want
you don't there's no need to create
multiple infrastructures for that kind
of accounting work and then there are
other points of friction more abstract
like fact that philanthropic
opportunities are not in your face
frequently enough instead we get other
kinds of distractions and invitations to
to act in in other ways so the the the
fact is we need resources we need brains
we need people thinking about how to
spread philanthropy to encourage micro
philanthropy in particular and to invite
individuals all around the world to be
serious about their role as micro
philanthropists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
