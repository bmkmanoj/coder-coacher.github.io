G one of the
bobbins from Korea and dr. Ann studied
mathematics and computer science at
korea institute Korea advanced Institute
of Science and Technology one of the
premier research universities in Korea
appointed by the Korean national
government and he went on to study
computer science majoring in computer
graphics at Wong's Institute of Science
and Technology also in Korea funded by
the world's second largest steel company
Bosco and then after that he worked at
the electronics and telecommunication
Research Institute also in Korea kind of
the parallel equivalent of Korea i would
say and then after working at a tree he
pounded the current company which is
mobians come and in 2003 and today's
topic is going to be mobile qwerty
keyboard post special mobile and special
lead so let me let us welcome tactile
okay thank you for introducing me okay
I'm from the mobians company and our
company actually before on the founding
my company I had on small idea about
text input and and actually researching
and developing for several years we
found a very I think video useful useful
steps useful way to apply the solution
to different devices and so that's why
I'm came here to just let you know that
what those texts simple solution is so
well what the title is mobile cory
keyboard actually pay mobile cory
keyboard i mean a small simplified
universal keyboard which is a simple
structure and actuator name can you
guess that what that mean that is
actually a mobile version of Korra
keeper the curriculum is the keyboard
people you are using every day so we
want to make some equivalent keyboard
for mobile devices as well as the
keyboard for the
decay people because the Chanukah people
is very hard to use the real keyboard
actually you can see the contents next
slide okay let me start by ensuring the
keyboard that you are familiar with
lecture this is the computer keyboard
there's many computer keyboards types
and they the core part of the computer
keyboard is actually to lay out there
there's a the layout called the quarry
to WIP I starting from here so it is
called quarry so you know Corey keyboard
is the central part of the keyboard and
Tara the numbers may be the symbols and
the functions and the cursor movement
kids and some modifiers around here so
this is the actually the core part of
every keyboard but actually you know the
keyboard are practiced using both hands
and ten fingers so let me show another
examples of keyboard these are small key
words apply to maybe the smartphones and
other mobile devices now here actually
you can say that this is the curricular
and this is the curriculum actuality
they are different can you see there's
no actually number buttons here is
number buttons here in the symbol
arrangements at different so if you are
familiar became familiar with this one
and we'll also have to practice a lot to
make you familiar with this keyboard
okay let's these are other examples of
the same keyboard but actually they are
different small sizes and different
variations and these are the actual
keyboard and this is the actually um of
on boy one year ago I found this one
from the on a airplane a singer
paralyzed they are serving the open
office software on the plane and this is
the keyboard for the opener piece and I
tried for several several hours during
the flight but actually I couldn't do
any editing with this keyboard because
you know there's no function keys here
there's no alt keys here
so if you are you had to use the
OpenOffice like the back to the version
of open up an office you have to do a
lot of comments here without actually
the shortcut is very slow and very
difficult to actually the typing is your
typical and there's a level functions
there so this is not actually good for
open offices so after the talk you you
may get that our solution is a far
simpler than this one I but provide full
functionality for two in that kind of
job okay this is another keyboard
on-screen keyboard you can see the
difference is here so these are Hardware
plugins for small mobile devices they
are different so there are many kind
many like actually the implementations
of your keyboard but actually these
keyboards are mainly for the alphabet
input not the keyboard function and
actually these are I say I can say that
these keyboards are actually different
for users point of view small sizes and
many regions so you have to practice a
lot to make you familiar with each of
these keyboards so these are actually
the different implementations of the so
called the computer keyboard xol this is
a second part of my presentation the
examples of keep presentation okay this
these keyboards are for the handicapped
people the the one here actually uses
his single hand and single I to input
with the keyboard and this lady are
using the joystick to move the cursor
around the screen to select the letter
you want she want and the and actually
it is to children may not be handicapped
but the you know the children can't
control their fingers precisely so they
are they have difficult time to practice
the keyboard and these two guys are
using their faith to type in and
disguise um using his eyes to input the
text there's no screen keyboard here
and he controlled the cursor around the
screen with his eyes and just staying
looking at the keyboard for two seconds
it enters object lens on input so
actually from this lady in this man
using the mouth to control the cursor
here and the mouse to push the keyboard
using the stick on the mass actually
these keyboards actually this is Arab
opinion about the situation actually
handicapped people are actually very
serious and impractical using the IT but
actually they have to use the computer
keyboard to use the IT technology but
actually the the forms here the keyboard
phones are actually for normal people
not for handicapped people so it's very
difficult for them to practice so we
need some kind of simple simpler form on
keyboard and and of course we need to
provide the perfect functions for
keyboard and the fifth point is their
children and all the people are we we
make reach the scroll on older and order
and we may be trembling my hand later
but I had still use computer so this may
be for me for me so children although
people can actually precise control
their hands or fingers so I just want a
kind of simple form on keyboard for them
to really enjoyed the 80 technology okay
this is actually the point that I have
done zero on the slide Exeter current
structure on your keyboard is not
actually focal and good for mobile and
catch situation this is just folding
ideal text input solution for an idea
actually solution for computer use and
the indoor my computer environments but
it is rather actually complicated and
it's not suitable for mobile and
handicapped situation and I think that
are it can be actually the squeezed into
three binary structure the whole
keyboard thing firstly the letters now
the alphabet symbols numbers can be put
into three by three
but actually you can you can squeeze
into city by city in many ways maybe
millions and millions three but I think
we have we have found on actually a very
easy way that actually you are already
familiar with you may see what I'm
talking about okay to top all the
letters are going into three by three
way and actually add the functions
keyboard functions function keys concert
keys and the modifier keys can also be
put into industry by three so by doing
this way we just put whole keyboard
industry by three structure and actually
this one actually is good for mobile and
handicapped situation and if i zoom in
actually the three by three structure
can be applied to many different kinds
of devices you can see actually domo the
natural mapping between the three by
three structure and the bottom device
there and the pen devices here and
choose the devices and the cellular
devices together and also it can be
applied to this one what is when using
eyes may twist and stretch sure we can
also put into this I can show to explain
how you can input with the three by
three doc structure and the kind of
device actually instead of me to explain
you you can imagine how you can utilize
this revised data structure with this
kind of diverse different devices there
isn't natural mapping there I can show
later with this one about inputting and
doing the keyword functions later but
first I'm insured okay this one is
actually the the same as the previous
slide but II but dot the twisty is just
for directional one you just can direct
the diagonal direction but you can still
use the same concern you can see the
vector summation there so if you want to
enter for example in number one button
you can combine the reputation and
objection on the left side or right side
already you can put it twice on the on
single hand to get the number one
direction so that way you can actually
make the input actually this is just for
the
maybe the empty player digital camera
already gamepad device but handicapped
people can also use it use them on the
end of thumb both thumbs they can attach
small acoustic there so they can
practice even without directing the
diagonal direction which can be may be
difficult for them to this please direct
okay this one is the conceptual picture
of how you can input with the eyes pi
actually if you are watching this
description the camera can tell you are
watching the number one direction so
there is one just one to one
correspondence you don't need to move
the course around the screen which is
very difficult so the cursor is here if
we want to enter something you can watch
the diction and make something maybe you
can play guys to select something or you
can push buttons where you can move your
jaws or anything you can move maybe your
tongue and so on so you can also say the
crisp and chris natural correspondence
between the sea by structure and this
one maybe this one and you can also
combine any elements together so that
normal people can actually do with any
single one but but according systems but
the the degree of the handicap the
indicated may find useful if combining
different devices together so ah this
one is actually I'm showing the layout
there I'll explain the layout in detail
in the next slides but actually the
layout is invented that way you know in
the number one question e WQ is here so
the first letter in depth on color red
letters here occupy seventy percent and
the green letter occupied 25 and the
blue letter occupy just five percent so
actually before going I let me just in
demonstrated okay with a pen device this
is an easy way this can be the actual
phone Domo on the mobile device where
the handicapped people the first letter
second letter so
what I mean is let me just show to
demonstrate okay
okay this is the first letter e actually
normally you need to press actual item
in the budget away e WQ right egw so see
if you are using actual in the a base
layer you can input ABC right there but
if you are you're changing the way to
select none actually the pan way the
first order is like it by touching you
and second letter please select the pile
talking it and the solid letter is a
input by the checking in so desktop
first second answer actually with this
ABC layer is very difficult but let me
show them it's written here is a simple
sentence here for example Oh mrs. on
difficult part picture H oh and a double
W I'm in h.o.w but you can also connect
those elements together to get me how so
let me go to the adamo train maybe the
way you can input today okay let me show
later in detail but the idea is that the
image button you just draw some action
there that stroke and check to get the
first to consider and you can also
connect those elements together so that
you can just put the pen down and draw
something and you get the return so this
can be useful for the plane device or
they may be handicapped people so here
let's let's go into the layout so I
think the layup is important if you know
the layout you can use your maybe to
pick hands put eyes anything you can do
the input your input but the layout
matters you have to memorize it but you
know the how many people here can
perfectly memorize the constant early oh
I'm in the ABC layer maybe some people
can demmer eyes him on baby yeah but
most people don't memorize it there's a
reason because we did some experiments
with the actual professors in our
country but they conclude
that there's many reasons
psychologically sins and so on so
there's um okay let me introduce our
mobile cord layout and the ABA up there
the regulator's seventy percent i said
earlier and this twenty five percent in
five percent so actually the average
number of button presses per letter you
can lower down into 1.35 for later
instead of 2.1 pauper letter for a visa
layout and you can actually see the you
can you can actually cast where he
should be it must be the first position
in in some button because E is the most
frequently used letter and if the
regarding maybe jay jay must be the cell
letter in some button right because you
can catch the to let the letter the
frequency and another actually this is
the on the ABC layout and our layout
actually it we had first started with
the english and language alone but we
found that the other languages also show
the similar characteristics this is ever
easy 2.2 and this all show the average
1.25 so we conclude that in averaging
they show a similar actual behavior
across languages actually and this is
what i'm saying that are you our lead
familiar with the mobile porn you can
see the directions there may be the next
slides will show you work like five okay
the h the quarry is one part letter but
ours 1.3 5 11 ok here's cauri mobile
korean embassy seventy percent letter 25
5 and the number button presses just you
can compare it 11 points to 52.1 poor
actually this is a big difference here
compared to this one and another is that
you are familiar with the layout you
divide the whole lens into three left
side right side and this side so oh well
is a you must be on the left side why
change on the right side t is on the
middle you don't know the exact position
but you roughly know where it should be
so left letters go into the left
column in the light error isn't going to
the right column and the the letters in
the middle go into the middle column and
I just removed eight letters there's
eight and letters there because a letter
isn't actually we have to remove it for
the moment I divide it into three by
three so qwe goes into number one
position you can guess why right but the
order is e WQ according to statistics
this is lamp number 2 number 3 number 4
5 6 7 &amp;amp; a 9 so this is another way to
describe the directions here so seeing
the curricular you know roughly the
directions don't it so if we know the
production plant then you know where the
letter should be and you also know the
ordering in each button you know the
statistically practicing it seventy
percent 25-5 are so different figures so
you can guess where it should be in the
column and the remaining that is
actually here actually I and all is just
their neighbors but here Oh is up and
I'll is down there are so many there are
many reasons that we found the ibook is
better to be down there than all so we
just chosen that way but you can see the
actually the similar here at ir and SGH
here and the remaining three is zvk and
dip this way so this is our mobile
cornea and this is an example from one
to ten in putting one is input this way
right oh and in the keyboard you don't
actually don't need it to stick into the
real buttons there but the rough graph
is there the way so you can get two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
actually you can actually on input
similar to the real power keyboard on
the three by three this is our test to
be sure we want it in some
we we had to select some sentences that
can be measurable so we found the
sentence there that is unusable
measuring the canoes world record who is
the Faceless Men the word with the
handset so actually with the computer
keyboard it was actually this is that
this guy is not an expert on typing but
then he took it took 10 8 seconds to
complete the input here it needs 164
button presses this whole and with ABC
handset is it is more than 300 represses
at the time taken is what their 40
seconds actually two years ago it was 67
seconds and then the time gets lower and
lower until and to become 41 seconds
here but with our mobile curry the
button presses become 212 and the input
no the time taken to input the instance
30 seconds so and the other part is that
actually because of the time did I
actually omitted that detail but you
know the quarry want to be the mobile
devices so the whole keyboard is divided
into these components you have seen only
this one but actuated remaining things
are actually very familiar to you maybe
this one is a natural layout here and
actually this one I think this is also
familiar to you the natural do you know
why where do you think tab is better to
be here where do you are like your
backspace to be there where is space
where is enter so I guess tab is here
literally and backspace is natural here
and space adventures here and so on so
if we we divide the backspace to be here
Tabby's here enter is here maybe XP
spaces here so it may be confusing to
you because that index not the keyboard
corey and mobile corrine that come from
up to each other so we just wanted to
make some XML compo confirmer le dip it
in the curry in mobile Corey
and let me show you actually the three
by three can be extended in another
structure this isn't just an animated
our baby cartoon baby you can think of
that three by three we just think about
the direction up down left right in
direct diagonal directions and you can
also expand the functionalities of each
button that way you can also push away
the buttons in the Italian attractions
there so you can press this one or this
one together I can show you later with
the actual device here so and by
actually collecting those three buttons
here this is the actually the structure
for handset I think and a cherry pie
making this form this is an actual
emulator in Turkey you can download from
our website this is actually we want it
to forward the remote controller Mercer
Roper and you can also divide it into
four the two your hand version of the
same layer and this is the over / or
picture of this device restructure you
can see the layout here most important
on the factor in keyboard the alphabet
layer uber cornea here and the tab big
space maybe enter space and symbol
separation and so on we just put there
and they can have skin like there it can
have skin like they're like they're more
like that so this one is actually for
the heuristic devices and so on actually
you can also use this one but it is this
skin more simplify the masses of opium
praying this one just for the remote
control like thing and this one maybe
the UMPC style input using to your hands
and this one just for PDA style and
actually you can also make the whole
screen into by industry by three and you
can touch it to input I can also show
the demonstration later okay this is the
what I'm thinking about I do you think
about the hours the conceptual cable
solution there are had been curry 140
years ago they crystal pushers invented
it and the soul to the typewriter
company and there had been for a
keyboard but actually there's not so
much speed increase so people are live
in el corazon actually query Deborah
doesn't succeed in history and IBM
actually invented the current form of
keyboard in 1980s and nowadays we are
using the computer keyboard in many
shapes vilest were the literal shape and
so on but you know there are lots of
small powerful devices that one helps a
kind of keyboard without actual keyboard
you just can fully utilize the mobile
devices and powerful devices so but the
quarry is not natural to be input to be
integrated into small devices so we just
want a smaller form of query well I'm
insisting the Bob our quarry is the same
a simpler form so we can devise many
interfaces and many divides devices that
way so this is a flow is action with
Corrine so we just want a bow very
personable Corey that makes the life
easier for users to learn and practice
and so on and another technology may be
the handwriting speech recognition and
artificial entities actually at
different subjects so you just don't
want to discuss about that but that
those technologies actually should
someday benefit users but that yet I
think so this is the our ideal on our
solution our solution we want to be it
to be a framework kind of framework so
that we can extend it to fit two
different devices and manufacturers can
adapt the interfaces here to produce our
products and the users just buy in
instantly user because they already know
about the keyboard if you want if you
buy a keyboard do you struggle a lot you
to practice a lot because you know the
layout whole layout is include if you
buy the keyboard you can introduce you
so I just want it to be the same for
mobile station and the end cap situation
too so this is the mobile query equipped
with natura initiative
interface you can provide the solutions
here and also the solutions for the
handicapped people okay after the
conclusion they Michelle some small
demonstrations get this is actually
small conclusion the structure of Corey
is natural appropriate a mobile and
healthcare environment and three by
structure actually is a very convenient
device new interfaces very natural and
intuitive devices interfaces and the AVC
actually is very strange it hard to
memorize and the mobile column layout we
divided it to be maximally efficient you
know the first letter the most
frequently used letters in that way this
this is actually maximally efficient one
and because of the curry it's very easy
to memorize and the fifth argument is
that mobile curry actually if there is
actually the layout there ewq vui but
just like the party layout is the
central part of Korra keyboard which is
one mobile curry is a fundamental which
only way to the problem of after the
input and we think that it's a three by
three structure with the Cobell coral al
is a can make the simplified universal
keyboard working for mobile devices in
ellicott the situation okay let me
demonstrate with an example here
okay this is actually the syllabi 31
here I'm just uh I'm just briefly them
will demonstrate how you can input with
the three basic structure there so if
you just pressing it e w q this is it
right on what do you guess you should
input to maybe input the tap letter
there this is your touchscreen device so
you can make some different way to tell
you can draw it here right this is pan
this is a backspace this is all p this
is the anthem so by touching it in a
multi-tiered way in stroking it you can
distinguish it to two different kinds of
input so you can you can use the
combined layout auto belay out and the
keyboard layout combined to get into the
battery you can't tell though how to
input for example h.o.w and this is a
symbol and kitchen mark there and
another way is to actually I have thrown
the layout away and actually this three
this whole screen actually it's divided
into three by three which is the same
right this is a this is using them know
so actually this is 1 this is five right
this is a this is done you can roughly
case where the location is this is must
be 6 so you can actually by dividing the
whole screen 3 by so you can actually
case where it should be so if you know
the layout then you know where E is the
letter how they are three are the symbol
do they
and another way to input is using the in
a bottle stairway let me a shirt it
explained on demonstrate one is NPR let
let me represent on this maybe is a test
with the whole body with the ABC layout
here it's a long way actually so long
way and if I'm you want to use the
drawing way to input with the same
layout make sure this is also a long way
I actually I'm not going to believe this
one maybe all this way but we using this
mobile called layout the freaking trees
one is at the person so this is on
simple manner so this way and actually
there's a baby you can change the skin I
have shown you that this is actually the
three by three consecutive by three in
expanded in a tent like letters and the
buttons but you can see that decision on
deviation from seed by three so there's
a constant movement here and you can
also maybe health here maybe you can
close down or you can be actually pop up
and you can also to everything here so
in that way you just want to make the
the next in putting here and the
keyboard control here so
it's your decision just the same one
with hiding the layout here so you can
actually input the same way right oh hi
so you can if you know the layout is a
very intuitive way to practicing and in
the the next one is using that this
choice Lee here so I change the skin
like this one you can also use the the
stick skin but this is one each one
oh yeah the computer doesn't recognize
the device here oops i plug in different
so you can see the you can see that your
chance your raft right so if i won't
enter this is h OMW how can you input
with this one the space dear actually
the space here is the same position like
the pit pat amir down so actually there
are many buttons here so you can
distinguish it right this is pam in
space if this is a maybe this is
keyboard ok so the EP you want to select
the buttons outside you can push a
button here and if you want to enter the
inside one you can push another button
here so if you are using two buttons you
can use you can use the one concern you
can move the concert it was fatigue you
can also select it maybe so maybe you
can copy ctrl + C maybe you can taste it
control free so you can do the scene
without it should this one you can also
pop up the this one maybe maybe 1850s
and things like this one
okay and actually this is a space keeper
space Mouse here actually can move the
cursor in the space but actually in
putting this way it's very difficult now
right but helping be the one skin he
became put here it's also very difficult
for you to input even it with just a
single stroke it's very difficult but if
i change the mode into so there's a
gyroscope here so if you put down this
is eight so i can maybe change the
number this is a right this is too this
isn't six this is 40 so if you change
the world maybe this is H this is all
that this is H this is all actually test
answer is an echo in here so a we are in
space so today I can input with the
actual conceptually so I can babysit
this demonstrates a kind of input in
with the gestures right this is the
number five position so this is number
one two three so I can see designate the
first of the second layer so dry that
way so you can input well you can select
the letters you want that way ok ok the
other actual demonstrations you may
guess what will happen with my
demonstration there's a lot of
demonstrations here but mostly the same
I think and another one is the tool
interface here so if you are using your
hands like this way you can input for
example
actually this is done on another
television from Street by street
structure and for using both the hands
so if we want interpret them to w WAW
you can use your both hands together to
input that way maybe symbol in here that
maybe t 00 t symbol that you can use
your left hand right hand together so
you can speed up the input today so what
I haven't shown you is that there's also
many demonstrations with the terror
glove and the shrink on actual shooting
on you can read this one it's very
difficult for you to shut the small
button but if you think the whole screen
into by C into three by three you can
very easy to shoot out the right put
region so that way we can provide many
the intuitive solution to text the input
and we also provided you can also
provide the whole keyboard functions by
overlapping the layout whole alphabet
layout in the keyboard player together
so this that's it
we made some on emulator 14 dead but we
didn't do any experiments actually and
in last Chi conference we just wanted
the professor professors are the
researchers to do the kind experiments
and together so that we can verify that
this is a far easier layout and file
efficient layout to do the input have
you worked with Korean or any other
language requiring an input method uh
excuse me actually my English is not
good have you worked with Korean as well
as English text work me there are some
is like mascius korean requiring
anything we did and we try to do the
same thing for the other language like
korean because i'm a korean but uh you
know korean keyboard is not invented
like qwerty keyboard even though the
core the according to this theory of
corey keyboard it is a to avoid gemming
thing so the alphabet are spread over
the whole surface so that makes our
solution possible but Korean alphabet
layout is different actually is a little
bit like Dvorak keyboard so it's very
difficult for us to make the layered
conformers keyboard so it was difficult
but we just follow the similar guideline
finding the similar statistics so we
divide the whole letters in the city
grew and so on and we actually we have
succeeded in that the it is faster than
current solutions but of course it's a
little bit difficult you know what I put
it easy because you know curry but the
Korean layout is different and how about
the Japanese and the Chinese language we
have small demonstrations here actually
this one is for Japanese here you know
the Japanese people like to input using
the alphabet keyboard so
we have immensity this is Japanese and
this is johanna so if we want maybe
hello the data sayonara in japanese so
if you s a so it sa changes huh this is
lettuce ha and this is your nah-nah-nah
and then you press the space button
there to change you actually the right
Deb way we can provide the Japanese for
Japanese solution and advise the Chinese
solution one issue I see with adoption
for general mobile devices you know cell
phones and this sort of thing the the
standard ABC you know code is is pretty
hard wired companies give out their
phone numbers 1 800 Google you know this
sort of thing so we're tied to the ABC
code whether we like it or not is it I
mean do you see mobile devices
supporting both codes given or well we
thought about the accurate a barrier for
the dependent numbers memorizing numbers
but um there's a actually already some
smart phones that do not have a visa
layout at all so we are screen keyboards
can connect a be scheme it works for
them so we can also maybe the hardware
if the hardware is equipped with a
mobile Corey then the screen can show
you the ABC layout worthy hardware is
equipped with a visa layout then the
software can display the software
keyboard let me demonstrate smoke
emulator here
ya like like this way you can see the
whole ski team up there so you can hide
it or the showing as you like so then
there can be one pair of them but can be
a busy day out there so actually on one
thing I have noticed is that if you want
to end call the 1-800 flowers do you
know the the correctness of your timely
let me and for example if you entered 1
800 flowers maybe fe 3l or maybe this
one so can you really own a github
flowers so I can you put it to example
using the hour hour late version maybe
one not a hundred maybe F L or w + e r s
entire lid so you can convert it
internally so you can call it that is
the normal the practice done by the
smartphones maybe so third I think
there's many workarounds for a VC
problem and X to the ABC is the most
serious problem in imprint so if people
want to do input on mobile devices they
have to change it without sticking into
the abyss layer this Maya plain opinion
thank you set the market shares okay
