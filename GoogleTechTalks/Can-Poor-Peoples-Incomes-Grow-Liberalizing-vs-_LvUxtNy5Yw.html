happy to present my father Lance Taylor
who does not work at Google but at the
New School for Social Research I've
known my father for a long time and
story I can have for Google is that he
was also the first person to pay me to
do computer programming on various
archaic systems most of which proved
that the economic models he was trying
to build could not actually be done on
the computers of the day we could do
them today but he's kind of moved on to
different areas anyhow so fast and well
thank you very much what I wanna do
today actually is talk about a fairly
old-fashioned topic
despite the formidable title of the talk
which is what has to happen in a
developing or transition economy if in
fact poor people are can get a look and
get into a position which makes it a
little bit better off and it's sort of
an appropriate place to start when
you're talking about that there's a
summary here which I'll skip since I'm
sort of limited in time but an
appropriate place to start whenever you
start to begin to talk about economics
is of course Adam Smith now Adam Smith
is a bit like Shakespeare and the Bible
in the sense that you can find almost
anything in the book The Wealth of
Nations that to support your point of
view and the point of view that I want
to develop is the following that the
first part of the wealth of nations for
200 pages roughly speaking is
essentially a defense of free market
economics in a sort of strange way which
we could I can perhaps mention and then
the next several hundred pages about
that after that essentially tell you how
real economies work or how the economy
and Great Britain and 1770s worked and
in some ways it's not terribly different
from from the way economies work today
because one thing that that Smith
emphasized is that economies you can
think about different producing sectors
in an economy one of which one set of
sectors would have increasing returns to
scale or have the possibility of very
rapid technical change whereas another
set of sectors would be decreasing
resources
would have decreasing returns to scale
and then Smith stay that contrast would
be between industry and agriculture what
he meant had in mind by industry were
the things like the famous pin factory
whereby instead of one guy doing all the
steps to put the pin together you would
essentially have an assembly line
operation which was subject to
decreasing costs in the sense you can
produce a lot of pins much more cheaply
that way than you then you could in the
traditional fashion so the idea of
economic development then is in a way to
stimulate sectors with increasing
returns and try to switch people out of
decreasing turns into increasing
returned sectors now that same notion
was followed up in in the US economy of
course by Alexander Hamilton who more or
less invented what is now called a
developmentalist model of economic
growth and that kind of growth model
would essentially say that you should
pursue a very aggressively creation of
sectors with economies of scale and try
to design policies that would serve to
that end now during the 19th century up
until actually the 19th during the 19th
century and actually up until the 1930s
the US was the most protectionist
economy in the world that is tariffs a
hundred percent two hundred were not
unknown and and there's also a great
deal of natural protection so Adams sort
of Alexander Hamilton's idea it was that
you should push as hard as you possibly
can to develop industries to compete
which would be on the same level as
England which of course served as a role
model for all these all the subsequent
economies and the US if you think of
what happened in the u.s. very high
tariffs state investment in the form of
the Erie Canal heavy government
investment
just to ask you a question how many
railroads were built between Chicago and
Seattle
does anybody know there are essentially
three railroad lines the Northern
Pacific the Great North or the Milwaukee
Road which ran parallel and they ran
parallel because the government gave the
people of building the railroads a lot
of free land to put these railroads up I
mean that the government intervention us
at that stage and of course has
continued to be so if you look at the
ARPANET in the 20th century would be the
obvious example in your particular field
that state intervention has always been
rather rather rather common there was
lacks enforcement of anti-corruption
people criticize the East Asian
economies after the Asian crisis were
practicing crony capitalism but if
you're running around Wall Street in the
1890s that's when really you had crony
capitalism and that was that was another
aspect of the American of the American
model the same model is of course
applied by the East Asian economies and
in one or another way during the second
part of the during the latter part of
the 20th century this in East Asia you
had very strong restrictions on foreign
capital inflows both portfolio
investments which means which means
buying bonds basically in foreign direct
investment both Japan and Korea for
example had very strong restrictions on
foreign direct investment and preferred
to develop the technologies on their own
beg borrow or steal so that they were
not open the fact that China and India
maintained capital controls up to the
late 1990s was a was basically the
reason why they avoided the Asian crisis
which which hit the other countries of
course as we all know very hard so you
get that kind of that kind of a sort of
theoretical background now if you ask
what happened in the world economy which
is another sort of background piece of
background that I'd like to bring up if
you start if you look at the world
economy in the period say from 1950
until the early 1970s and exactly when
you want to break off is is is unclear
but there was a so-called golden age
with what is now called golden
when most economies were growing fairly
rapidly and there was sort of consensus
view so to speak that the world was on a
fast track growth path which would last
forever of course did not last forever
various things happen the breakdown of
the the monetary system that had been
set up at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire
in 1944 the oil shocks increasing social
tension the Golden Age came to an end at
which point as you as a as a illustrate
a bit later on you entered into the sort
of present period of much slower growth
in much worse performance on the part of
developing countries just to give you
one sort of background number that you
may want to keep in your head I'll talk
a bit later on about productivity growth
or per-capita income growth and there
are all sorts of technicalities about
how you do that how you measure that but
the standard number for osed economies
of per capita income growth or
productivity growth is something like 2%
per year during the Golden Age
productivity growth in the rich
countries was on the order of four
percent per year and some poor countries
were maintaining rates of productivity
growth or per capita income growth of
about that same level as you'll see a
bit further on that has ceased to be the
case there are two major shocks for
developing countries that hit them
around the end of the Golden Age first
was it was a shift in commodity terms of
trade most developing countries are in
the business of were in the business and
still are to a certain extent of
exporting primary commodities that is
think that is things like coffee and
cocoa and and and metal products and the
terms of trade essentially refer to the
price that terms word terms of trade
refers to the price of those kinds of
commodities beginning around 1980 there
was a long prolonged adverse shift in
the terms of trade against developing
economies which had a major impact on
their performance particularly in the
very poor ones in for example
sub-saharan Africa and
and a Caribbean saint second thing that
happened around 1980 was a sort of paul
volcker interest rate shock which was
aimed at stopping so called stagflation
in the US economy it real interest rates
in the u.s. went from rather negative
value to something like so people like
10 or 12 percent per year that affected
developing countries very strongly
Brazil at that stage was running was
borrowing money in capital markets to
run a trade deficit of like something
like 5% of GDP which is high I mean the
current level in the US is about seven
which is really abnormally high but
that's another story
in any case Brazil was running a 5%
trade deficit until around 1980 when
when the interest rate shock came then
the basically they were told well we
won't right we won't lend you any more
money you'll now start paying 10% real
interest on the on the on the money that
we have lent you and by the way pay
right now
so basically Brazil had to switch from
something like a 5%
trade deficit to a 5% trade surplus
around 1980 and the economy has been
stagnant ever since so those were those
were really enormous shifts that that
that poor countries had to deal with the
saw the shocks both the terms of trade
and the interest rate shock were on the
order of five percent five to ten
percent of GDP which is a lot one two
more pieces of background and then I'll
sort of try to give you a quick review
of the empirical numbers during the
golden age policy economic policy in
general I could use the word Keynesian
was fairly interventionist in all
countries around the world in in one way
or another and in the poor countries it
was basically developmentalist along the
lines that had originally been proposed
by Smith and Hamilton the and the
developmentalist policies had greater or
lesser success in various parts of the
world in some places they didn't work
simply the government tried to intervene
and it failed
in other parts of the world they work
fairly successfully and again the East
Asian countries would be the would be
the major favorable example and
someplace in the middle you would find
countries like Brazil and Turkey which
which were had did some things well and
some things not so well by the way up
until around 1990 I'll be talking about
so-called developing countries and then
with the breakdown of the Soviet system
sort of to get transition economies
joining the development of economies and
there are some similarities and some
differences but but I can come back and
pick up that in any case around 1980 the
policy orientation reversed the the
transition points in in in the rich
countries were of course the president
the the administration's of stature and
Reagan where you had a enormous reaction
against the kind of policies that had
been previously pursued and in
developing countries transition
economies that took the form of what
came to be called the Washington
Consensus which explicitly repudiated
developmental ISM said you should not
practice Industrial Policy you should
get rid of protection protection of
domestic industries you should open your
economy to foreign capital inflows and
you essentially disabled all the kinds
of policies that the countries had been
pursuing up to that time a sort of
subsequent subsequent twist on the story
has been the sort of introduction
introduction or invention of what are
called the Millennium Development Goals
which are being pushed very hard by the
which are being pushed hard very hard by
the United Nations and also Jeff Sachs
has made himself famous by running
around the world and and
and proselytizing for the MDGs now
basically they say what the goal of the
MDGs in some sense is to put countries
on the dole the the aim of the of the
program which by the way will not get
funded that's another story but but but
the aim of the program is essentially
massive income transfers to try to help
poor people directly now if you go back
put your sign except if you go back to
Adam Smith and Alexander Hamilton that's
not going to lead that's not obviously
going to lead to fairly rapid income
growth which is the only way that the
poor people in fact can be made less
poor you can put them on a goal and but
you know you're talking about countries
absorbing transfers from abroad on the
order of 10 20 % of GDP now I I happen
to live not too far from Portland Maine
so I chose Portland Maine as an example
to sort of to illustrate a couple of
points of that Portland is the biggest
city in Maine and its GNP gross
metropolitan product is on the order of
20 billion dollars which you know keeps
a few people employed in the Portland
area 20 billion by the way is somewhat
larger than Kenya's whole GDP so you're
you have one small city in Maine with a
product of sort of twenty billion
dollars or one medium-sized city in
Maine with the product of twenty million
dot twenty billion dollars you have one
fairly populous African country with a
product of twenty billion dollars and
reason the basic reason why people in
Kenya are a lot poorer than people in
Portland Maine is that there's just not
enough money not not enough GDP to go
around so that's sort of one aspect
now think about Portland a city of
250,000 or a metro area of 250,000 how
could they possibly absorb a resource
transfer of two
in per year what can you do there are
only so many free ways you can build
there so there only so many schools and
hospitals and and social workers and
teachers that you can employ I mean you
would really have to reconfigure the
Portland economy rather dramatically for
it to be able to absorb a resource
transfer of 2 billion but that's that's
what the goal of the Millenium that's
the that's what the Millennium
Development Goals attempt to do in the
case of Kenya of course as I mentioned
you've got a population of 30 million
sharing out that 20 billion of GDP and
that means Kenya's a very poor country
yeah
yeah the question is how could portent
absorb two billion it's it's the other
way around that is Portland would have
to reconfigure its economy in such a way
as to use an extra two billion and that
you know that that's a pretty major if
if you sort of think through the detail
details that would be a pretty major
shift yeah the question is spending the
two billion across two hundred fifty
thousand people on one hand or thirty
million people on the other hand and of
course it would be much more yeah of
course there's a big difference but the
point I wanted to make is it either way
just to get that money into the system
to figure out how you can spend it in
some useful way is pretty difficult and
of course in Candia with thirty million
people you could sort of spread out a
dole which is in fact what what the MDGs
will be doing but trying to use it to
develop increasing return sectors within
a way which is what they should be doing
is not what the programs are aimed at
okay all right well the next thing I
would like to do is try to talk a little
bit about what the historical growth
performance in developing countries has
been and there are a few points that I'd
like to make and in terms of the data
first of all as I mentioned there was a
big change in performance of developing
economies around sometime between
sometime around the late around 1970
1980 prior to that period after the
Second World War
most countries most countries and most
economies in the world were doing pretty
well then subsequent to that you saw a
big change in patterns of development as
I will illustrate in a moment and there
was what we called what we my co-authors
and I happen to call the great
divergence between
one group of economies which continued
to grow quite rapidly the Asian
economies and the rest of the developing
and transition world now in terms of
going back again to Smith and Hamilton
what you found in the rapidly growing
economies or the economies that had
sustained growth was continual
structural change in a ride in a variety
of dimensions that is a growing economy
changes structure and of course you can
see that right here in this very
building which was not occupied by its
present company I guess not so many
years ago
and there now that's that the sheet at
the level of the twelve trillion dollar
US economy that's not going to be very
that's not directly visible but
certainly very important Google is
structural change and what you saw in
developing in the rapidly growing
developing economies was ongoing
structural change which did not happen
in the ones that were not growing and
that shows up in in in various
dimensions which I'll try to illustrate
now the stuff I'm about to give you some
some illustrations of what I have in
mind and sort of if you want to further
reference most of the material our
percent appears in this year's World
Economic and Social Survey out of the
United Nations with somewhat different
graphs and somewhat different labels but
it's basically the same story but let me
before I get into that let me give you a
couple of slides of historical data
there's a guy named Angus Madison who
has been who has essentially spent his
lifetime putting together data about GDP
in all the economies of the world and in
some cases now he's back into the 1500s
but but which are basically educated
guesses and nothing more than that but
let me sort of give you a couple of
illustrations of what the historical
growth experience is and also
it's this is a minor technical point
which might be worth spending one minute
about the these numbers that I present
now in this slide and the next slide are
in terms of so-called purchasing power
parity which is an attempt to correct
GDP estimates to make to illustrate how
much each country's real purchasing
power is and there's one example of that
which which works reasonably well which
would be the following I don't know
about Silicon Valley well I can ask
suppose you got to suppose you want to
get a reasonably upmarket haircut in
Silicon Valley how much would it cost
markets
well really cheap out here to make the
numbers to make the numbers work out
properly the the typical number for
Manhattan let's say if you go to midtown
would be something like 50 let's say you
might throw in a beard for the oil it
depends if you're a man or a woman but
but say say you'd say you were to get
that $50 and see we get that haircut in
midtown and that would cost you
something like fifty suppose you were to
get an upmarket haircut in Mumbai at the
current exchange rate what would that be
no you go to the Taj Hotel and get a
haircut but sighs what's that gonna cost
Oh probably five so essentially I chose
the numbers to make the arithmetic easy
obvious obviously but but so what what
I'm saying is that the Manhattan haircut
is 50 bucks and then the Mumbai haircut
is five now but it's the same same thing
basically somebody just cuts your hair
so what purchasing power parity
calculations do is essentially revalue
the labor of the
the Mumbai barber so it's not if not
equal it's much closer to the labor of
the New York barber
so essentially you revalue revalue the
account the GDP and poor countries
upward to take account of the fact that
if you're living in a poor country it's
much cheaper so to speak to buy a
haircut than it is in New York and you
go through these comparisons the the
difference again this factor of ten what
I what this graph illustrates are income
ratios of poor countries to rich
countries and I don't know if you can
read the the legend but it begins in
1820 and runs up to nineteen ninety
eight and in terms of PPP these income
ratios the this line going down is East
Europe in the USSR the the upper dashed
line going down and what that saying is
long about 1820 the income ratio between
Eastern Europe and Western Europe was
like point 55 and it gradually went down
to point 20 over the long period with a
fairly precipitous drop beginning around
1980 when the Soviet growth model ran
out of steam but the main point I want
to make is that these lines go down that
all developing regions lost relative
income in PPP terms and in sort of
market price terms all developing
regions lost income dramatically in
comparison to the developed countries
and that was mostly due to per capita
income growth in the developed countries
that is what what this what this graph
is hiding is that is that developing
countries were fairly stagnant in
developed countries continue to grow
here is a is a sort of more diagram with
more regions for the period after
after after around 1960 1950 and again
the general trend is downward with a few
exceptions
this is East Asia the Tigers which grew
quite rapidly throughout the period if
you picked out Japan as a separate
country which which I don't have here
they would have started up a bit sooner
and actually grew a bit faster than East
Asia but all the other regions are
essentially going down with toward the
end of the period China and some of the
other some of the other a few other
regions beginning to catch up but again
a picture of general slow growth and
stagnation in the in the developing
economies here's a picture of what
happened to growth rates not levels of
income but growth rates over the
post-war period and again notice the
fairly rapid growth in the in the golden
age these come from two separate
databases but but they essentially give
you the same results you get fairly
rapid growth until the golden age you
get the so-called Lost Decade
which actually actually lasted quite a
bit longer than a decade in in beginning
around beginning in the late 1970s and
then you get some recovery in the period
since 2000 so that's the general picture
of growth experience and the next thing
I'd like to do is look in a bit more
detail at different regions what you
have here are the three major sectors of
the economy that is agriculture mining
and manufacturing and and public
utilities for 12 regions across the
developing world if you do this at the
country level rather than a regional
level you get essentially the same story
but to keep the thing relatively
relatively compact you
you it's easier to work with with
different regions you had mr. questions
not so basically what you have here the
Tigers Southeast Asia China and South
Asia which is basically Indian in the
data and those four regions grow quite
rapidly this is this this data begins at
night these data begin in 1970 you get
fairly rapid growth in all sectors in
these four regions and you get fairly
comparable growth in Central and Eastern
Europe as well although they went they
were on a roller coaster they went up
they rode up and then when violently
down in the 1980s and then came back up
so we get a sustained growth group a
group that we called rate late recovery
which would be semi industrialized Latin
America actually semi-industrial is
Latin America and this particular set of
data includes turkey and South Africa as
honorary members but but but those
economies are essentially similar but in
semi-industrial is quote-unquote Latin
America Central America Caribbean and
yeah those four regions you get sort of
up and down performance and then the
rest of the world former USSR this data
runs out in 2003 and foreign if we went
up to 2007 former USSR would look a bit
better but nonetheless it's not
spectacular to African groups middle
east african those particular regions
just don't do very well at all let's see
where we are okay you can also look at
structural change and we looked at only
the broad sectors but again if we if you
disaggregated to two more to a more more
sectoral disaggregation you would see
the same story so on the vertical axis
you've got
the percentage change in agricultural
output over the period 1970 2003 and
basically agriculture declines in all
economies as they get richer and on the
horizontal axis
you've got per capita income growth now
the main thing I want to emphasize you
can run a regression which is what that
line indicates there but regressions as
we all know are quite sensitive to
outliers and if you take out the red
regions that is South Asia Southeast
Asia Tigers in China and also take out
Central and Eastern Europe if you were
to sort of just block out those five
regions where there is a consistent
relationship between agricultural
streakin agricultural sector per capita
income growth if you remove those
countries from the sample which I
suppose I could do if I was very good
with PowerPoint then what you would see
for the other regions is a blob so what
if you look at the diagram in that way
what you see is a consistent
relationship consistent structural
change in in the rapidly growing regions
and no nothing much of all nothing much
at all going on in the in this sort of
blob of countries off to the left you
get the same story with industry
industry expands and again you have the
four Asian countries standing out as
outliers Central and Eastern Europe is
doesn't stand out as clearly in this in
this diagram but that's because they
were already over industrialized anyway
and again a consistent relationship for
some parts of the world in a blog for
the rest of the world and as I say if
you if you actually did serious
logistical analysis as opposed to
drawing pretty pictures you would get
essentially the same result if you look
at labor productivity the way
productivity is measured which is
extremely simple minded I mean economist
blabber a lot about technical change
and how this is pushing technical change
and that's not pushing technical change
but all you mean by labor productivity
is just basically just average output
per worker or average output per person
hour and so it's a very simple-minded
measure but but it's the only one that
economists really know how to use but
again you get a very similar picture
there is a little algebraic trick that
one can use if you have a number of
sectors in the economy to decompose
productivity growth within sectors as
opposed productivity growth due to
reallocation what I mean by reallocation
is that if say the industry sector has a
higher average level of productivity
which it does and if you move people
from other sectors into industry then
you get a reallocation gain and in the
sense that that that people are moving
from a low productivity to a high
productivity sector so so the darker
part of the bar shows the productivity
gain within the sector within within the
overall productivity growth within the
economy in this case and the lighter
part shows reallocation gains and notice
again that that in the in the rapidly
growing economies you get substantial
productivity growth mostly from sort of
productivity growth within sectors but
also reallocation and reallocation
turned out to be quite important in fact
in in Southeast Asia where you had
rather large movement of people out of a
low very low productivity agricultural
sector had negative employment growth in
a low productivity agricultural sector
with people moving to other parts of the
economy if you look at investment this
is a slightly different story in that
there appears to be a consistent
relationship across all economies that
is capital formation does play a role it
seems in in supporting per capita income
growth but again one could argue about
causality
which but that's not something I
particularly want to get into here
education does not apparently make that
much difference
here you have sort of growth and average
years of schooling on the vertical axis
and again per capita growth on the
horizontal the quite clearly the
regression line such as it is is is
pretty flat it's dominated by these
economies out here and then for the poor
poor for the slow growing economy to get
this kind of blob like scatter of points
which which it would not basically tell
you anything so what that's saying in a
way is it education begins to look like
a necessary condition for economic
growth and certainly education is highly
desirable on social grounds but the
direct input into into economic
performance appears to be reason appears
to be fairly weak foreign direct
investment same story yeah
if you the question is if you look at
the absolute level if you plot absolute
education rather than change in
education what does the relationship
look like it's a little stronger I mean
what people typically do is take the
absolute level at the beginning of a
certain you compare countries for a
certain period and you look at initial
absolute levels and the relationship
would would would be somewhat stronger
but but again it's subject to all that
it is subject to complications I mean
I'd if you look at Sri Lanka for example
Sri Lanka back in in the 1950s 1960s had
very high levels of education but very
low growth Brazil before it ran into
trouble in 1980 had very low levels of
education very high growth so there
they're always there they're always
outliers and you know in a way the
outlier is a more interesting thing to
look at then the then the then the sort
of average that a regression picks up
foreign direct investment more or less a
similar story these are foreign direct
investment shares in GDP it's not clear
what the appropriate metric would be but
notice for example that China which is
the big outlier in this case over the
period that it's being considered here
had foreign direct investment on the
order of two and a half three percent of
GDP which given the size the Chinese
economy is it is a big inflow of foreign
direct investment and they grew fast
Tigers also got a certain amount
Southeast Asia got a certain amount this
is Southeast Asia is assembly operations
in in Bangkok for example South Asia got
very little so again you get you get
this sort of blob of points and then
some relationship among the outliers but
no nothing very consistent across the
across the whole sample
so just to sort of sort of summarize the
main points that I'm trying to make that
rapidly growing regions had significant
sectoral output shifts there was
structural change and the the other
regions did not labor productivity
growth was high in the in the in the
rapidly growing regions was not terribly
visible elsewhere yeah can you think of
scenarios where growth would be rapid
without high productivity growth that is
if you talk about income growth per
capita the difference between per capita
income growth and labor port city growth
basically has to do with labor force
participation which can't change but it
is it is almost Hana logical that per
capita income growth and labor
productivity growth or are associated
with each other an exception would be an
oil pot country let's say well nobody's
really working but but you can have high
income grows without productivity well
yeah
totally
yeah the question again a question about
sort of countries who live off ramps and
the oil-producing countries would be
certainly an example of that
Kirt Russia at this stage would would
would would be another example Egypt in
a way with the Suez Canal and the
tourism but that keeps people employees
at least let's see what else so later so
it's almost tautological but but
nonetheless it's probably capturing
something and the fact is you that you
get differential productivity growth
rates across sectors which I think we'll
get to and things like that is
relatively important and then capital
stock growth does appear to be
associated with with economic growth
overall and again the same points I've
been making in terms of more education
high FDI not a very obvious connection
and no visible structural change let me
just talk a little bit about sectoral
patterns of productivity growth which in
a way goes a little bit further in the
direction of addressing some of the
questions not here's a labor
productivity in industry across
countries and again notice that you have
extremely high productivity gains in the
rapidly growing economies yeah
yeah that basically says what says
depression about sub-saharan Africa that
basically says that people are moving
out of high productivity sectors into
low productivity sectors because the
economy is doing so badly but that is in
a way what that is is in many
sub-saharan African countries is is
government bureaucrats going back to the
country as their salary structure falls
apart
I mean you know it's as serious as that
Middle East in northern Africa heaven
knows what's going on there but that
that's an odd collection of countries in
any case the main point again I wanted
to emphasize and notice the CIS or
former USSR really net highly negative
productivity growth do the due to the
economic collapse in the 1990s but again
the point I want to make you get clear
productivity growth in the in industry
and in the in the rapidly growing
economies much less performance in the
in the others here's services which is a
somewhat similar story and then you get
another decomposition which essentially
says whereas employment being generated
and the main point that I'd like to make
here is that you get a lot of employment
generation in services because that's
where the jobs are
that is if you think of the economic
growth process in rather broad
broad-ranging terms the productivity
gains are mostly in terms of this
particular aggregation which in fact is
fairly generally accepted productivity
gains actually happened to a large
extent in is in industry and not so much
in other sectors now industry properly
defined would also include sort of parts
of service sectors which also
particularly in rich countries are the
locus of productivity gains at this
stage in time but if you talk about
developing countries to a large extent
you're still talking about industry so
you get high productivity gains in
industry
but you get high employment gains and
services and again without going through
sort of fairly simple minded algebra one
can show that a sector will gain in
employment if its output per capita
grows faster than this productivity so
that an industry output per capita is
not necessarily growing much above zero
but you're getting fairly high
productivity gains sort of sort of
employment so the industry has never
been a big generator of employment but
in services if output per capita grows a
lot faster than employment then you
would create jobs and again I suppose
Google is a kind of a microcosm in the
sense that output per capita
I'm sure productivity growth here is
very high but but output per capita for
the whole for the across across the
whole US economy is extremely high in
Google and that's why Google is a job
machine but that is not necessarily true
in other parts of the economy so in a
way you have this sort of you have to
worry about what's going on in sort of
the both the increasing return sector in
this case industry but also on how you
generate employment and again the points
that I've been talking about
productivity growth arises at industrial
service reallocation has been a major
contributor only in Southeast Asia
service sector generates employment and
the bottom line is an industry serves
the engine of productivity growth and
services for employment I have another
set of decompositions here which I think
I'll skip over in the interest of time
sort of how you generate effective
demand and without going into the
details what comes out of these the of
the diagrams that I skipped are
essentially two things one is that
economies have
radar unless your degrees of flexibility
I mentioned greater or lesser degrees of
macro flexibility and how you get
yourself to have macro flexibility is
very much an open question but if you
say look at Brazil I mentioned
previously that they had the adverse
external shock of something like
something between five and 10 percent of
GDP around 1980 and the Brazilian
economy has essentially been stagnant
ever since Korea absorbed shocks of
equal magnitude within in the transition
from 1990 to 2000 and Korea is still
performing very well so Korea had a
highly flexible economy in a way that is
is very hard to quantify but that that's
certainly an important factor in in the
Korean development development history
the other point that comes out of these
of these slides that I skipped is the
following and that goes back to the
Washington Consensus what happens when
an economy gets into trouble who comes
to town to try to get the situation to
straighten out
it's on the side all right
the IMF comes to town and what the IMF
basically tells you to do is to run a
recession they have a well designed
toolkit for running recessions that
they've developed over the last 40 years
and basically what running a recession
is supposed to do is to improve the
trade position that is if you run a
recession presumably you act import a
lot less and in possibly possibly export
more so you run a recession to to to
improve your foreign trade position that
that particular theory is called twin
deficits which sort of became got a lot
of press in in the Reagan period that
that is that is supposedly the US trade
deficit during the Reagan period got a
lot got a lot worse because Reagan was
running a big fiscal deficit and and
then suppose they're getting rid of the
fiscal deficit would improve the trade
position which which turned out not to
work and in general that that kind of
interventionist policy does not work to
improve trade positions but but
nonetheless it's still very much part of
the Washington's Washington Consensus
which basically runs in the direction of
trying to get economies to contract and
which is another problem that many of
them face so then suppose you try to
think about reversing these growth
declines in eradicating poverty and what
can you say about macro linkages and
then you have this kind of simple-minded
diagrams and economists are fond of
drawing and we all think the arrows run
in the direction that the arrows are
pointing but if anybody really knew how
to do it I don't think we'd actually
have poor countries around the world so
in a way that this is an this is a bit
of a sham but it does seem that judging
by history the the policies which
attempt to stimulate productivity growth
and policies would you tend to stimulate
effective demand at least have some some
possibility of paying off
now if you try to simulate an effective
demand the IMF will come to town and
tell you to stop
and so you're already running into kind
of a kind of a barrier there and
depending on the the sort of freedom of
maneuver of the particularly economy
that you're talking about
you're some countries can do that better
than others both China and India large
closed economies have in fact been quite
successful as simulating an effective
demand India's had a budget deficit on
the order of five to ten percent of GDP
for the last 30 years which sort of has
had the IMF gnashing its teeth ever ever
since the beginning and but in fact
that's that's been a reasonably
successful policy China does something
similar as well on productivity growth I
would argue that again it requires what
history tends to tends to tell you is
that as opposed to economic theory or
received I cannot standard economic
theory but but but history tends to tell
you it is that it takes some degree of
interventionist policy to stimulate
industries which can generate
productivity growth now you know there
are all kinds of pejorative descriptions
that are applied to that kind of policy
regime sort of picking winners and crony
capitalism and and and sort of other
labels that sound rather similar but the
Oracle experiences has been that
economies that have and here I should
phrase what I'm trying to say fairly
carefully what historic experience tends
to show is that economies that have
grown consistently at 2 3 4 % per capita
have almost always practiced
interventionist policies there's
certainly plenty of economies on the
other hand which a practice intervention
is following these policies which
haven't worked so it's certainly not a
sufficient condition and
the sort of then you can get into the
sort of logical difficulties about what
you need what you mean by a necessary
condition but but certainly it's our
enabling conditions and certainly things
like Industrial Policy and probably
things like education are enabling
conditions or require conditions or
something like that for growth but you
don't get growth in a lazy Fair
environment there there really there's
really no history of that yeah there
aren't any so I get in a way I'm talking
about an empty box but countries that
have been I mean develop among
developing countries say in the last 20
or 30 years if they've been pushed very
strongly in the direction of lace a fair
I mean where the IMF and the World Bank
reigned supreme which is basically in
sub-saharan Africa and small open
economies all around the world they've
been pushed very hard in that direction
and nothing's happened you could argue
that Britain was fairly close to being
lazy fair but even that's not true so
there you're right I mean it was that's
a perfectly reasonable point of view so
in a way the the set of countries to
which standard economic theory applies
is pretty close to being in all set and
the and the inhabitants of that said if
there are any would be poor open
economies in the last 20-30 years and
they're going nowhere so I mean that
that's in a way what the what the
history is telling you the history is
also telling you that you can have as I
mentioned you can intervene too much and
that there's there's no question about
that but but that's but that's another
story in any case what would be the
important linkages in the fast growers
while the same points that I've been
mentioning before that you see this
industry service breakdown and you see
that policies were aimed at
that had sectors stimulating sectors
with where you had a chance to get
economies of scale and also one might
add where in the successful exporting
economies where you would have big
demand for your export product IT in
India would be something of a
contradiction to what I just said in the
sense that the government did not
explicitly target IT but certainly
created enabling conditions by setting
up the Indian Institutes of Technology
and and having it extremely highly
educated having a relatively large
numerical number of highly educated
people who spoke English and that itself
you could view as a successful result of
sort of the policies that that were that
were invented by nerim
but in the poor countries in in the
present period policymakers hands have
been tied to a large extent by the
Washington Consensus countries that open
to capital inflows not just in the Asian
crisis but all around the world have
been subject to extreme destabilizing
macroeconomic shocks which can derail a
growth process for an extended period of
time
and sort of a technical point about
about macroeconomic crisis which I can
skip trade liberalization has been
associated with industrialization and
labor shedding the MDG intervention and
appears to be the most if it happens
which is I say it probably won't appears
to be largely palliative and boils down
to boils down to putting countries on
the dole which is not the best place for
a country to be this sort of kenya
portland maine comparison that i was
trying to make illustrates that you're
not really going to eradicate poverty in
an extreme sense that is $1 or $2 a day
kind of poverty I mean God knows there's
poverty in Portland Maine but
but there's there's a big difference
between that poverty and the poverty did
you see in Kenya and Kenya has no shot
at looking like Portland Maine unless it
has to stay in per capita income growth
for quite a few decades and the question
is how would you try to to make that
happen
I think current policies are just not
aimed at all in that direction and
whether or not they change of course
there's an open question but it's not in
a way a very promising prospect it's not
a good way to run the world yeah it's
big there's a group of countries that
are HIPC countries which basically mean
they're very poor and the MDG is aimed
at them and it's basically countries
with a big chunk of the population under
$2 a day
well in fact the money's not going to
happen
no boy there's there's a very
complicated history there basically the
the the pressure was bad where did the
MDGs come from they were you remember
there was a Copenhagen Social summit
about ten years ago and then and what
the this is a story that the NGO people
tell that they essentially suggested
something like the MDGs at this
Copenhagen social stomach which was that
basically taken over by the World Bank
and the IMF who say that they're very
good at delivering money to poor people
and so in a way it the the prime motors
were where the Bretton Woods
institutions and then it was basically
picked up subsequently by the UN by Kofi
Annan with with the name of sort of
developed directing a lot of money to
poor countries as they say the money is
not going to happen anyway but in a way
the program is also badly misdirected
because it's just aimed at that at all
yeah Hugo Chavez in Venezuela
a resource for Latin American countries
yeah yeah the question is what would be
the role of Venezuela I guess assuming
the oil price stays high in alleviating
poverty in Latin America let me tell you
a story about that I was actually
working in Venezuela about five years
ago when when the price of oil was like
seventeen dollars a barrel or something
like that sort of we were scratching our
heads at that point I was I was talking
to some guys in the finance ministry and
we were scratching our heads about you
know how the hell is this kind of gonna
work unless the price of oil goes up to
18 or 19
so the price of oil gets up to 50 or 60
that covers a multitude of sins
I mean Chavez is set up mechanisms not
terribly effective to deliver some
resources to poor people in Venezuela
and is trying to trying to branch out
into the rest of Latin America but he
has no coherent model and I mean more
power to him anything that upsets the
United States and Latin America is fine
but I did well and he doesn't have that
much money either if you actually sit
down and talk serious numbers so I don't
think that you know that that's in a way
noting something that will not be
terribly visible although I could do a
lot for Bolivia that's a probably do
just one more question
no okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
