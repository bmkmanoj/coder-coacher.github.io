and thank you very much
for us to talk to you about this
exciting book natural security edited by
myself and dr. raphael saccharine I
think by way of introduction I think
perhaps we each ought to say our
impersonal background so I think it's
very relevant to this this book I come
from what I suppose you might describe
as a security background with the
experience in the in the army of the
British Army and different parts of the
world also working for the United
Nations on inspections and places like
Iraq and other places and so my
background is security but I have a
biological background and my work that I
have done the inspections in Iraq were
part of the UN's investigations into the
Iraqi biological weapons program yes it
really existed and so that's my kind of
background and I was connected with Rafe
my friend and colleague here who comes
from a different background so my
background is actually as a marine
ecologist mostly worked on the Pacific
coast out at Hopkins Marine Lab
Stanford's Marine Laboratory in Santa
Barbara on working up and down the
Pacific coast of Mexico and Alaska and
all in the talk I'll explain how I got
it all involved in security currently
I'm at Duke University where I work on
environmental policy in the ocean as
well as on marine biology so I already
we're sort of a biology policy hat but
this foray into security was really the
result of being able to work with people
like Terry and some of the other people
I'll talk about okay no I think just by
way of introduction a Rafe is going to
deliver the meat of the presentation but
just by way of introduction just to
remind you that we're in the 200th year
of Charles Darwin's birth it is the
hundred and fiftieth year of the
publication of the origin of the species
if you haven't read it please read it
it's very accessible even today and it's
not a piece of history it's relevant for
us today and some people would say that
it's the greatest scientific eye
of all time and a lot of people say that
and if you read the book I think you
will agree and you are I think see its
relevance today and I think not only
just as a general idea but in the
application of the thinking behind that
idea and drawing on three and a half
billion years of evolutionary history
there's something we can learn from that
in a conceptual sense in applying that
in thinking about issues such as
security national security international
security but also could apply in a big
business setting as well there any large
structure that is facing various kinds
of risks I think would would benefit
from the kinds of thinking
that Rafe is about to explain to you now
and so let go ahead and then of course
we will take some questions and expand
in my particular case I apply this
thinking every day in my work it really
does work I can I can assure you it may
be in question time we can explore that
right thanks and I'll just mention that
Terry's work brings together groups that
you would not think would get together
at all Israelis Palestinians Jordanians
to work on infectious diseases in quite
a complementary way so that speaks to
sort of this idea nature of symbiosis
where there are things that get together
in nature that you would think on the
surface have no business being together
and form quite successful partnerships
and Terry's group is really sort of
living proof that that can be done in
society so I'm going to talk about
especially for this audience before I
get into the products of our our group a
little bit in the process because I
imagine many of you are interested in
sort of the process of how new ideas get
put together and I think that's guessing
that's what a lot of you do and your
your daily work here but it starts with
sort of an idea and this very compelling
idea that came out of the 9/11
Commission report that's been often
quoted that 9/11 was basically a failure
of our imagination and I think that was
certainly apt description of what
happened
leading up to and on 911 but the world
has changed quite rapidly obviously
since then and we no longer have any
kind of the same failure of imagination
I worked for a while in Washington DC
and one of the most peaceful places to
go if you worked on Capitol Hill is down
the hill to the Botanical Garden there
used to be a place you could just walk
into and end up in this rain forest and
it was fantastic but of course now
there's all the sorts of metal detectors
and security guards you have to go
through just like any building in
Washington
someone's imagination has run wild and
thought you know someone's going to turn
this into a fertilizer bomb and send
molten glass up Capitol Hill likewise we
imagine that we could disable a jetliner
with 3.5 ounces of mouthwash instead of
three ounces so we have these kind of
security things I think I want to bring
up a point here this isn't a recent
issue of new scientists there's a great
article on sort of eight myths of
evolution and one of the big ones that
comes up over and over again in our
studies is that there's a conception
that evolution is about being perfect
about trending towards optimal solutions
and it's actually never about optimal
solutions they say you don't have to be
perfectly adapted to survive you just
have to be as well adapted as your
competitors are the apparent perfection
of animals is more a reflection of the
poverty of our imaginations than of a
reality and where our imagination is
failing us now is more in terms of what
I call a failure of adaptation and I
bring a few anecdotes in here security
stories we've seen since 9/11 I'm sure
all of you have your own but this just
sorts that sets the frame of this
failure to adapt that we have the
building on the top left is a tiny
facility of NOAA the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration the
scientists there study fish and how to
improve fish stocks for fishermen in
North Carolina it's co-located on a tiny
island with the Duke marine labs so I
spend a lot of time there NOAA rebuilt
their facilities recently there and as a
result of being a government facility
they were forced to put up these huge
Walmart Style parking lot lights in
their tiny parking lot their tiny dirt
parking lot and there's a gate on the
island now and a camera that takes your
picture every time you go on and off the
island
well one major area of study that these
guys do and that we do at the Duke
Marine Lab is that light at nighttime is
really bad for marine animals such as
sea turtles that are migrating and
figuring out where they're nesting such
as birds shorebirds that are nesting and
get disoriented by this bright light so
here is a case where a that doesn't
adapt that says any government facility
has to have this level of security is
totally inappropriate and actually runs
counter to the research coming out of
this very facility a more sort of
trivial example I guess I mean it could
be a serious example but I tried to send
a package from Santa Barbara to Los
Angeles dropped it in the mail three
weeks later it shows up at my desk at
Duke University with a sticker on it
saying you can't send a package over 16
ounces without handing it to a mail
person
so now that package has passed through
many many many mail facilities and
gotten to me and if I'm an adaptable
terrorist or something I'm thinking okay
all I have to do is put the recipients
address in the return address field drop
it in the mailbox and we're all set so
so much for that level of security much
more serious things we're seeing about
failure to adapt to IEDs and then
recently a couple days ago in the New
York Times front page states are now
required that 25% of their funding from
Department of Homeland Security must go
to defenses against IEDs which most
state security experts are not thinking
is very high on their list of threats
and they are vastly underfunded already
in their mandate to conduct security
operations now they're being asked as a
set priority 25% has to go to IEDs which
is a hugely serious problem in Iraq but
not a serious problem stateside
adaptation is really about leaving your
comfort zone and here's where I get into
a little the process of how this group
got together
me my comfort zone were the tidepools in
Monterey where I spent a lot of my time
studying invertebrates their
distributions how they're changing with
respond to with in response to climate
warming but I always had this political
interest in environmental policy and I
spent a year as a congressional science
fellow in Washington DC mostly working
on environmental issues for
congresswoman Hilda Solis from East LA
but I sort of couldn't get the
naturalist out of me and in fact I I
needed to exercise that interest in
looking at ecology and ecological
systems and all I had around me was
Washington DC rather than the tidepools
and I quickly sort of saw this ecology
of fear that pervaded Washington DC this
was 2002 just after 9/11 and I put sort
of my observations in ecological terms
seeing these jersey barriers sprout like
fungi around every sort of monument
seeing these massive increase in
security guards in the armaments that
they carried but what I likened it all
to was what I call fiddler crabs
security fiddler crabs in this case to
secure mates which is a big aspect of
security for animals how can you secure
access to promote your genetic material
male fiddler crabs grow this one large
enormous claw and they wave it at other
male fiddler crabs in this kind of
ritualistic display and eventually one
of the crabs backs down they never
actually fight with these things but
it's it's showing how much resources I
can command by growing this enormous
claw these kind of competitive
interactions are very common in nature
and they work very well if you have an
opponent that has very similar resources
available to it that adapts in a similar
fashion that is has sort of the same
pathways that by which it can adapt
another hermit crab can't sort of all of
a sudden grow wings and drop bombs on
the hermit crab it's they're all sort of
escalating the size of their claw and it
has you know what I put in quotes here
as rational assumptions that is thinking
about the problem in the same way that
the opponent
is and also importantly that doesn't
actually really want conflict and and so
all of these things are very parallel to
the kind of cold war type conflict that
we saw these May Day parades of parading
missiles and showing off our armaments
and talking about a missile gap but also
understanding this in the context of
mutually assured destruction if we
actually use these missiles none of
these things really apply to the major
threats to our security now which are
things like terrorism things like
emerging infectious diseases and things
like natural disasters and their
aftermath none of those things apply so
we need a new way of thinking about
security but a lot of our security
responses have been in the old modality
and so I started compiling and thinking
about the ways in which three and a half
billion years of evolution and over 20
million solutions to this basic problem
how do you survive and prosper in a
hostile and unpredictable world that's
what biological organisms have been
doing for three and a half billion years
and I sort of summarized in a very short
article in foreign policy a few years
ago some of these ideas but I realized
very quickly even as I was writing the
article that I knew almost nothing about
security and despite the fact that I
know a lot about the invertebrates that
live in tide pools in Monterey Bay I
know almost nothing about biology and I
think any honest biology bolete
biologists will tell you that they know
almost nothing about biology because the
field is so huge so I realized I had to
bring together people with very diverse
backgrounds both in security and on the
biological side to really get at these
problems how what are the security
problems we really face and what are
biological solutions to them from a
number of perspectives so I brought
together a working group at the National
Center for ecological analysis and
synthesis in Santa Barbara it's a NSF
funded think tank normally they do
projects on what is the global impact of
fishing and they do very data-intensive
projects where people bring together all
their databases and try to figure the
things out but they they took a chance
on our working group and it was a very
successful working group where we
brought in people that represent all
these different kinds of
yields four three three and four day
meetings over the course of a year and a
couple of portent points about this kind
of working group one just in terms of
process that that you may be interested
in I used this facilitation process
called open space technology that's been
pioneered by Harrison Owen and he has a
book open space technology it's a real
quick read but it's a fantastic way if
you're faced with this conundrum of how
am I going to get people to talk that
come from completely different fields
use different languages and may have
completely different assumptions going
on well you don't go into that group
with an agenda and say okay guys here
we're gonna talk about fiddler crabs and
then we're going to talk about coral
reefs and then we're going to talk about
al-qaeda what you do with open space
technologies you pass out a bunch of big
index cards and sharpies and you say
write something that you're really
interested to talk about in this general
area of overlap between security and
biology maybe it's something you're
really expert on and want to share maybe
it's a question you've always had and
have no idea how to answer it you get
all the cards back you put them up on a
board and you start seeing the
connections between the cards with the
whole group so the group is designing
the agenda and when you first proposed
this to any group you'll get a lot of
blank stares you just say come on come
on take the cap off your sharpie and
start writing and they do and you get
three or four cards back and very
quickly you start making an outline of
how that groups going to go and so we'd
go to one group of cards and say who
wants to start the discussion because
all these cards seem to be on a similar
topic someone starts and then the
discussion never stopped over the course
of the year that we were together in
person in on an email it's an example of
non expert problem solving so you've
probably all heard of this paradox of
the expert that often you can get the
absolute experts on a topic and they'll
come up with absolutely the wrong
solution to a problem so it's very
helpful to have people who aren't
experts at a topic to give a different
perspective but you know as they say you
want your mind to be open but not so
open that your brain falls out and what
can happen if you just had a bunch of
biologists in the room who had no idea
about security is you might get some
very naive ideas about security so you
all
so have this component of
interdisciplinary collaboration that
people are truly cutting across their
disciplinary boundaries to to get into
this problem we had a huge far-ranging
discussion that went all over the map
and yet what I found I guess still
talking about how broad it was is that
we found that you can apply this kind of
thinking taking lessons from evolution
and ecology to security in a number of
different ways so we're not focused on
one particular approach to doing this
you can use evolutionary and ecological
analogies and that's a very important
and powerful tool for example looking at
what the immune system does the adaptive
immune system and how could say an
intelligence-gathering system function
more like an adaptive immune system so
we'll talk in those kind of ways another
approach that's being popular in a lot
of different areas not just in security
is this idea of biomimicry so using
ideas from nature and directly
translating them into something some
different use for example looking at the
hydro dynamics of a skipjack tuna and
designing your submarine to match those
those kind of dimensions is one simple
example of mimicry there are others in
computing energy generation medicine
we're increasingly looking at what
biological systems do and how well they
do it and trying to mimic those outcomes
an important aspect of our working group
was looking at the deep evolutionary
root causes of what people do and why
they do it rather than just stopping at
the level of saying look at these crazy
people around the world and what they're
doing getting beyond the historical
perspective of what they're doing down
into the deep evolutionary history of
why societies form the way they do why
the human mind form the way they do and
this is a very powerful tool for
uncovering and and sort of breaking
breaking down the the structures of how
we think about these things in in our
popular discussions and getting a little
deeper and finally there's been a lot of
very powerful mathematical models that
have been developed in the fields of
evolution and ecology everything from
game theory to population models looking
at fisheries and this kind of thing and
we're exploring how much you can apply
these to security situations here one of
the authors Dominic Johnson is using
basic population models to look at how
you might deal with an insurgency
understanding all the time that you may
have very different assumptions but what
you can do is use the models and then
identify here are the assumptions in an
ecological model here's what's different
when you apply it to humans so we're
always aware of these translational kind
of differences we had all these ideas
from all over the place and it wasn't
until I was actually writing the book
actually got all the chapters in from
the co-authors and then was writing the
book in chapters the introduction and
conclusion that I actually felt
confident that they could all be boiled
down into a small number of basic themes
which I'll I'll briefly talk about with
some examples so the first thing and I
think it's something that I hope will
resonate here is the power of
organizational systems and in particular
one of our working group members Gary
Verma who's a paleo biologist at UC
Davis
Percival Verma is a fascinating
character he can identify probably more
fossil and living invertebrates than
probably I would guess anyone on earth
and he has been blind since he was three
years old so he has this incredible
observational sense he's an incredible
naturalist but it all sort of gets
translated through his hands and the
other reason why Verma is such an
interesting character is he's really
broken out of a narrow sort of focus on
his science and has continually applied
what he's learning from the fossils to
questions in society his latest book is
nature and economic history tying the
history of nature to an economic system
so he was a natural contributor this
working group and one of the things he
finds overall out of looking at all
these fossilized systems and living
systems is that a structure of
semi-autonomous parts with weak central
control
is the most flexible adaptable and
reliable means of making unpredictable
challenges predictable and that's part
of the key of dealing with an uncertain
world is trying to get a little
certainty out of what you can do and
these systems these organizational
structures that are fairly allow a lot
of autonomy to sensing units to sense
and respond to the environment without
constantly going up to a central
controller are ubiquitous in nature and
they are the most adaptable kind of
systems and we see them at all different
levels of biological organization from
systems below the organism level to
whole organisms you can look at the
chromatophores of an octopus that can
function very quickly in terms of
mimicking the the environment you can
look at colonial organisms where there
are independent organisms still part of
a structure but they have a lot of
autonomy to do things like defense or
reproduction or that kind of thing and
there are some ideas coming out of
places like Princeton Simon Levin that
ecosystems and and networks of
ecosystems and networks of proteins and
cells for example also have something of
this kind of structure our first major
response to 911 probably the the biggest
response to 911 thus far has to be
create this department of homeland
security which is exactly the opposite
of this kind of organizational structure
and as a rather simple but important
exemplar of that you can look at that
circle in the org chart is FEMA so FEMA
Federal Emergency Management Agency is
locked away in this very top-down a
hierarchical organization and the first
major test of security post 9-11 fema is
high heavily heavily implicated at
actually the department of homeland
security in the failure to respond to
Hurricane Katrina and that came out in
the popular press I've since confirmed
that by talking to people like governor
Blanco Louisiana and first responders
who were down on the ground there
not all of you know the blame by any
means you can definitely look at the
fact that a natural system in Louisiana
was supplanted by a highly
unnatural system but also a large part
of the problem was the response locked
into this unadaptable organizational
structure a good example that also comes
out of government of how to use
autonomous units here advantages the
DARPA Grand Challenge where this arm of
the Department of Defense which is
charged with sort of promoting advanced
projects simply issued a challenge can
you make a vehicle that can navigate
independently a complex course and
rather than go to one military
contractor that then would subcontract
to to a bunch of different
subcontractors they went out to
basically two University groups and said
solve this problem so it wasn't a whole
bunch of university groups acting on
their own and saying make something cool
for the military it was here's a problem
so there's a little bit of central
control but then all the problem solving
was autonomously defined and what you
saw also is this ability for adaptation
because if you know anything about this
grand challenge the first year they ran
it was sort of a disaster very few of
the vehicles got very far but by the
second year it was a very good success
most of the vehicles finish the course
Stanford's entry is shown winning here
they learned from one another in that
interaction during the first year and
then went back and then autonomously
resolved the problem and this is you
know a fraction of the cost of typical
weapons development a fraction of the
time and and you had quite a bit of
success there I know this idea of
convergent evolution here this is the
idea that often very interesting
important features in nature show up
again and again but have developed
completely separately so there are other
authors and groups who have come across
the same idea in different fields I
mentioned form a but also in the field
of business this book you may have come
across the starfish and the spider talks
about the unstoppable power of
leaderless organizations Paul Hawkens
new book really focuses on social
activism but it's the same idea that
this sort of bottom-up autonomous small
groups are solving big problems
big social health environmental prob
in a completely different way than the
typical sort of large environmental
group or large UN body solving these
problems and in international governance
jean-franÃ§ois rashard has talked about
20 major global problems that we solved
this is a former world bank president
who's suggesting that these problems
need to be solved by these bottom-up
sort of autonomous networks that emerge
and this is exactly what Terry's doing
with the emerging infectious diseases
networks that he's creating now another
aspect of what we're looking at another
broad theme is in behavior and we look
at this in two ways we look at what can
we learn from animals non-human animals
whenever we like them when are we not
like them what do they do and we learn
and we look at why do humans do what
they do and this gets at those
evolutionary roots of human behavior for
all organisms again dealing with
uncertainty organisms want to reduce
reduce uncertainty for themselves and
increase uncertainty for their for their
adversary that's almost universal in
nature so flocking behavior is a way to
increase uncertainty for a predator
that's trying to come into that flock
these killer whales that actually can
basically ride waves up to the shore and
grab these poor sea lions and then
recede back into it's a very uncertain
situation for a sea lion because you
don't expect a whale a marine organism
to come up out on land and grab you some
of us terrifying and fascinating nature
videos I've seen of those things and
periodic Chiquita's are a great example
these are bugs that come out and and in
certain periods that different species
have different periods but they tend to
be 13 years 17 years they're always a
prime number so by having this period
when you emerge in masses is a prime
number it's very hard as a predator to
create a cycle that will match up with
that with the cycling of the of the
Chiquita's increasing uncertainty for
the adversary we tend to do a lot of the
opposite in our security responses for
example we announce in huge billboards
terrorists this is exactly what you
cannot take on a plane which reduces
their uncertainty okay
can't take a liquid explosive anymore
I'll dehydrate it and rehydrate it with
the ginger ale I get from the stewardess
it this this is exactly the opposite of
what you want to do we also do a lot of
what I call nervous Nellie signalling
this comes from Dan Blumstein a
behavioral ecologist in our group author
in the book who studies marmots marmots
are these big Alpine oversized squirrel
kind of things and what marmots do is
they basically eat they look out for
predators and they mate and they do this
in groups and Blumstein studies them by
sending in what he calls Robo badger
which is a stuffed badger on a four by
four remote-control truck chassis and he
sends that in and watches what the
different marmots do now there are some
Cool Hand Luke who only call when
there's a real threat in the environment
like a real well like a predator coming
in and then there are some he calls
nervous Nellie's that are that are
constantly calling and it's not always
when there's a real threat or that the
threat is imminent and you would think
there'd be this boy who cried wolf
effect that the marmots the other
marmots in the group would start
ignoring her in fact the other marmots
in the group spent a lot more time
trying to figure out if her signal is
honest and that's a lot less time they
can have eating and mating and we do a
lot of that we do a lot of nervous
Nellie signaling I don't remember the
last time the security level at airports
has been below Orange and as a result we
don't really know what's going on we
have we have a very little information
and so we're sort of always on guard and
we're obviously wasting a lot of
resources when there's no actual threat
as an aside I'll be absolutely panicked
if I ever go in an airport and the
security level is green so there's a
little problem with this detection
signaling thing we have because we also
don't know what it means if they
suddenly turn it down to green the other
aspect of behavior are these
evolutionary roots of human behavior a
lot of the talk about security and
international relationships is all in
this historical context which is talking
about humans as if they've always lived
in the kind of societies and and
governments that we live in now but
fact if you look at the whole history of
life humans make up about 0.04 percent
of that history of life and an
industrial humans that is humans that
live in the societies that we live in
now are just about 1% of human history
almost all of our history has been in
very small hunter-gatherer type
societies they're completely different
from what we do now that's where our
minds developed that's where our
societies developed and how we relate to
other people develop as John to be a
evolutionary psychologist who is part of
our group from Santa Barbara says our
modern skulls house a stone age mind
what I like to say is trying to
understand human relationships by
looking at this little slice of
industrial human society is like trying
to understand war and peace by reading
the last word if you translate the
number of words and war in peace two
years on planet Earth that's what it
amounts to that's the time we've been on
earth the last word and war and peace so
it's a very narrow extremely narrow view
of what we're doing so we try to look at
the deep deep roots of human behaviors
and it goes all the way back to the
earliest life on Earth
according to Luis Villarreal of Ayala
gist from you say Irvine who's been
trying to figure out why do we hold
belief systems and irrational beliefs so
strongly he is a Latino came out of East
LA and he works at Irvine now and he
mentors young Latino students coming out
of the same area and he's always
struggling with the fact that these are
the brightest students he has but they
hold on to a lot of the belief systems
that they grew up it with in this case
coming out of the Catholic Church and
and creationism and that kind of thing
and he cannot get even as best students
to easily give up these things no matter
how many sort of rational facts he puts
in front of them so he started tracing
back where did this come from
and what it comes from is a need to
identify your own group against another
group or as different from another group
and that need is so basic in life that
it goes all the way back to the earliest
bacteria fighting off viral parasites
and so that kind of what he calls an
addiction module a way of keeping
yourself
basically addicted to yourself as
opposed to another type of organism
takes different forms all the way up
through the evolution of life so in
lower primates it takes the form of
scent-marking well we don't do
scent-marking we don't have that sensing
ability as strong as lower primates but
we have this cognition and then that
turns into language and religion and
those kind of things that's how we
identify groups against non groups john
tooby looks more at the modern context
of how this now affects this this stone
age mind that's inside our modern skulls
and then operationalizing this on the
ground
Scott a tran an anthropologist he
studies people in the most intractable
conflicts he studies Palestinians and
Israelis he works with and interviews
people who have committed to acts of
jihad and said I am going to kill myself
for this cause and he tries to figure
out how do you get beyond these strongly
held belief systems and it's not about
breaking them down it's about finding
entry points so he talks about making
symbolic concessions in the
understanding that you're not going to
change people by throwing a bunch of
facts or by throwing economic incentives
in the way of these belief systems
because they have such deep roots so
we've got to find alternative pathways
environmental awareness is a third big
area that we talk about and the basic
concept here is that organisms live with
risk they implicitly understand
understanding quotes that they're living
in a risk-filled environment there's no
sense in the environment that a shark is
going to be anything but a shark by
contrast in society it's politically
expedient to declare wars on risk to say
we can eliminate risk we talk about a
war on terror war on drugs in my field a
war on invasive species these are all
generalized risks in the environment and
we're saying that we can get rid of a
hundred percent of them were boosts were
sort of buoyed in this idea by past
successes we've had against very very
huge risks in the environment like
smallpox
like fascism in Europe and those
successes give us the idea that we can
get rid of these generalized risks but
if you think about those things they're
actually although they were huge risks
they were fairly narrowly defined and
things where we understood how to solve
the problem may have taken a lot of
resources and a lot of energy but we
knew how to do it we don't know how to
deal with getting rid of all generalized
risk in the environment and so I always
put up a popular geologists t-shirt
which says stop plate tectonics it's
sort of akin to doing that trying to
stop plate tectonics with that sort of
comic view you realize that would just
take a ridiculous amount of resources
and probably have all sorts of ancillary
effects that are very bad and that's the
way we have to look at these war on
terror war on risk type framework it's
not what organisms do organisms live
with risk and they live with it through
adaptation here species that have no
business being together a small fish and
a predator that eats small fish have
established a symbiotic relationship
these are remoras that that live with
sharks organisms understand resource
allocation peacocks do very well
allocating a lot of their resources to
reproduction and showing off how great
they are two female peacocks if they
live in an environment without predators
once you start introducing predators
it's not very useful to have these
enormous tail feathers because you don't
even get to the point of mating before
you get eaten and organisms have a very
keen understanding a very nuanced
understanding of risk in the environment
and that has been selected for and
there's some great emerging examples one
of them I'll talk about here these
squirrels this came out and proceedings
in the National Academy of Sciences last
year
squirrels make signals to their
predators to say I know you're there and
I know you're about to attack me so I'm
aware of it you're not going to surprise
me but when they're signaling to birds
and mammals which can hear very well
they use alarm calls and they say hi I
know you're there when they're signaling
to snakes they don't use alarm calls
they put up their tail and they make
their tail bristles stand up and they
wave their tail in this
display that that sort of causes the
snake to have second thoughts and back
off but not only that when they're doing
that with a gopher snake they just put
up their tail when they're doing that
with a rattlesnake and that's what these
IR images show they heat up their tail
because rattlesnakes pit vipers have
heat sensing capabilities and we know
that because we read it in encyclopedia
a squirrel has learned that through the
process of selection that if you heat up
your tail it sends a strong signal to a
pit viper but don't waste your time
heating your tail to a gopher snake
because I can't see it doesn't sense
Heat
it's an incredibly nuanced sense of the
environment and more examples of that
are emerging cuddle fish for example
communicate a lot with color and they
have completely different color displays
for different types of predators but
while they're displaying to predators
they use polarized light to communicate
to one another that their predators
can't see so they're making signals to
each other cuddle fit to other cuddle
fish saying the predator in the area
through polarized light and through
visible light they're making signals to
their two predators
the final area that we talk about in
applying evolutionary lessons to society
is in the natural dynamics the idea that
the only constant in nature is change
but don't despair because there are
patterns and change and they appear
again and again whether you're looking
at cells organisms ecosystems or whole
evolutionary lineages of organisms you
see repeatedly this pattern of a
origination period or a birth period a
growth or proliferative stage and then a
stage of senescence or death and of
course it doesn't end there because
after the senescent or death part you
start all over again with with new
resources so when that old-growth forest
goes down you get a whole new succession
of new organisms for example these raise
all sorts of important questions that we
need to be asking and we're not asking
enough insecurity things like what type
of organisms colonize a new area we know
in in ecology there are different types
this blue line this is time and this
would just be population of a plant say
this blue plant would be what we call
our selected a live fast die young plant
a weedy type thing that come
into a broken-down area establishes
itself fast reproduces fast and then
dies off as opposed to the type like a
redwood tree that grows up long starts
commanding more and more resources and
ultimately becomes the dominant species
in a given ecosystem but over a long
time period the two have completely
different strategies and and that s also
the question what types of condition
give rise to new organisms where in the
world should we be looking for new
threats and threats that may be
fundamentally different from us they may
not be these case elected type species
that want to go and dominate the world
slowly through a careful process they
may just want to make a big impact fast
and that's how they that's how they
survive so we've got to understand this
diversity of approaches and a key
question is at what point in this
developmental cycle are we these are
zebra mussels that have grown on a
shopping cart that was probably in lake
michigan or something this is a highly
invasive mussel species by the time we
realized what a disaster these mussels
growing on everything was for for
recreation for shipping just about
everything that goes on in those
waterways they were so far in that
proliferative stage that there was
nothing we could do about it so now with
invasive species we have very aggressive
campaigns to try to get them first time
you see a little sprig of invasive algae
that some diver sees in a harbor in San
Diego it gets reported and we try to
eradicate it at that stage because
there's nothing you can do at the at the
proliferative stage and of course these
just kind of spheres interact they're
not they don't operate separately and
I'll just give a couple quick examples
the IE D situation in Iraq is a really
tragic example of bad organizational
systems mixing with an understanding of
the environment nearly from the time
commanders stepped on the ground and
we're on the ground seeing what's going
on in Iraq five years ago they were
saying these IEDs are a major major
problem this is what's this is what's
really going to kill us here and yet you
just heard a month or so ago these first
reports of vehicles that were designed
to respond to two IEDs better than those
Humvees
getting out into the field five years
later these Emre vehicles that have
v-shaped hulls that have adapted to the
threat of ground-based bombs so here we
understood the environment but this
organizational procurement system that
everything had to go through and create
these new vehicles is now sending out
these vehicles which by the way are
likely going to be obsolete as soon as
the makers of the IEDs adapt and
recognize okay now we have this very
slow-moving very cumbersome vehicle it's
got a v-shaped hull it's going to cause
less destruction let's figure out
something else so we're always behind
the curve and tragically about half the
deaths in Iraq are caused by IEDs
likewise on the interaction of behavior
and organization Dominik Johnson and
Elizabeth made and have a chapter in our
book about how there are behavioral
dispositions again evolutionarily
derived that make it difficult for us to
as humans to respond to major threats
until after a catastrophic event like
9/11 and that is sort of reinforced by
organizational structures that aren't
adaptable so here we're reinforcing both
our Stone Age mind and its inability to
calculate risk in the modern world and
organizational structures that don't
don't respond well on the flip side when
I think about airport security we could
use behavior to our advantage which we
don't which is that we're terrible at
calculating risk and that's probably one
the reason why we screen a hundred
percent of passengers going through
airports but we're very good at
assessing behavioural intent and that
goes back to living in small societies
where you really had to know what a
compatriot or someone coming in from
another society nearby what was their
intent so we have a very deep-seated
understanding of human intent just by
looking at people and so there has been
some early work and probably a lot of
work going on that I don't know about on
behavioral screening in airports which
shows a high degree of success if you
say look back at films of airports and
on the day of 9/11
screeners with a small amount of
training and behavioral screening could
say that one that one that one that one
and actually pick out all the 9/11
hijackers from film it's not even
live-action so I think there's some
promise there where we're not seeing it
happen but in fact mostly what we're
doing is dynamically responding to a
different stage of development of the
threat so we're taking away your shoes
after we discovered a shoe bomber plot
we're taking away your liquids after we
discovered a liquid plot a plot to
disable about a an airliner with a
liquid explosive so we're sort of behind
that developmental curve of where where
our adversaries are going so questions
that always come up when you think about
applying this stuff to human societies
as our humans really under evolutionary
control at all
I was certainly a skeptic on this before
working with this working group I think
there's a simple answer is you can look
at millions and millions of people in
this world for which life is a daily
struggle for existence not generally the
people making decisions but you can also
look at these very compelling cases of
understanding our deep evolutionary
roots and understand that a lot of our
behavior today is still under
evolutionary control at the same time
there are clearly a lot of areas where
we are insulated from the daily process
of selection on our systems and in fact
our own governmental systems our
economic systems are very insulated from
selection in a lot of ways you'd like to
think a democratic system a capitalist
system are very very responsive to
selection but there's so many ways we
insulate them and that's where we become
vulnerable because we're not testing
them enough and that's where we internet
essentially need to take the reins and
start controlling the evolution of these
systems and some people already are
there are bloggers out there who are
sort of bragging about all the kind of
contraband they've taken beyond beyond
enemy lines on airplanes this guy likes
to show off knives he's taken on board
going right through security but it's an
excellent sort of selective test of what
works and and what doesn't work and
there are other systems you can conceive
of that essentially are taking control
of evolution and apply
your own selection two security systems
so finally there's a number of
opportunities and challenges to bringing
these ideas we have forward and bringing
them into policy kind of context or
adopting them in business and that kind
of thing
there's been very little adoption of
sort of evolutionary ideas so far but
importantly none of these ideas are
classified they're out there for anyone
who wants to go out and study nature and
see what nature does there's there's
nothing you can classify about that and
I go back to Ed Ricketts who was a
marine biologist in Monterey in the mid
20th century good friend of John
Steinbeck's he pops up in many of John
Steinbeck's novels but he was also very
interested in the overlap between
organisms and nature and sis and
problems in society including security
problems and what he said which is very
important he said studying animal
communities has this advantage they're
merely what they are for anyone to see
and who will and can look clearly they
cannot complicate the picture by worded
idealisms by saying one thing and being
another so he's really getting this idea
that we need to really look at nature in
a very clear and unbiased manner and see
what nature is telling us about these
problems were encountering in this case
talking about security so there's a lot
of symbiosis that goes into this project
and these are many of the members of the
working group and people that have
worked with us along the way that I just
want to thank and Terry and I'd be happy
to take your questions and thank you for
coming out
any any questions are they more months
to raise yeah so get a microphone yep so
so what you're proposing seems to me to
be diametrically opposed to the
reactions and motivations of politicians
in the sense that they get rewarded for
doing something fixing the problem you
know these sort of what I want to say is
low touch reactions is not something
that they seem to get rewarded for or
think of I think should I yeah stop I
think you you put your finger on it on a
really key point I don't think it's
diametrically opposed I would challenge
that forward it although it may seem
like it but as you saw in in the midst
of Rafe's presentation there needs to be
a modification or an adaptation on their
part to get the idea of living with risk
and and that one of the fundamental
themes that comes out of all this work
that's put together and in fact I think
one of my favorite parts of the book
apart from Rafe's chapters and of course
mine is dear at ver mais final paragraph
which he he makes clear that any an
organism that tries to eliminate all
possible risks you know you know it's
not going to be successful and his when
you look at evolutionary history not
only think about the obsesses you have
to think about the failures as well and
that's hugely important so if there's a
message the policy community it's about
the idea of not concentrating on one
possible let this is one aspect one
possible catastrophic risk that might be
less than 1% you heard all heard about
the 1% doctrine
and I'm trying not to be political here
where you focus a lot of resources in
trying to eliminate remove that risk
international terrorism a terrorist
group delivering a nuclear weapon into a
US city may be more than one US city say
to debate a lot of resources which are
not only economic resources that are
cost to society cost to democracy and
ways of life and so on
and this is what you're doing by doing
that it's creating another vulnerability
probably an internal vulnerability
within within your own community and so
on so I think that's a message we want
to get from this it's not diametrically
opposed but get this idea of living with
risk and I think also you saw in Ray's
presentation how you connect how
organisms have exploited risks to their
own advantage by I think the classic
case of increasing uncertainty for a
predator because that's using risk in an
in a positive way we have a lot of
sympathy with politicians and business
leaders and this is something you know I
mean this is work in progress we have we
haven't got the answer and one of the
hardest parts of me it comes from a
security community comes from advising
ministers on what they should do about
the range of risks that they're faced
with is how do we equip them that they
can convey this message in a way that's
convincing that will get them elected
that's what they're they're thinking
about and of course it's very easy to
say with the policies I'm pursuing we're
going to eliminate that risk it's
unrealistic and raises expectations that
can't be fulfilled and worse actually I
would say it was dangerous and so some
so in this process of dialogue we
created through this group and it's an
open group that we want people to join
is that's an aspect that came up
actually in our talks
you don't talk yesterday it was well
it's all very well yet your terrific
idea but a politician has to do exactly
what you've just said that's exactly why
we wanted to talk here at Google because
rumor has it that there's a little bit
of ability to take some risks built into
the structure here and you know I'm
completely an outsider I've read this
Harvard Business School review which
also seemed to be to outsiders writing
about who
so I really wanted to hear from people
here is that really part of the culture
here to allow for some risk-taking too
which allows for adaptation and that's
why I said adaptation is about leaving
your comfort zone
so anyway I'm I'm eager to hear from you
about that
so one of the things that came out of
9/11 was there was a lot of information
at the the ground level and it didn't
percolate up very well and I'm wondering
if there's good examples of natural
systems that managed to get that that
fast-paced information filtering of
what's relevant and condensing to the
you know the parts that are actually
relevant to show up to a pending risk
management um risk yeah that's a really
good point because the Department of
Homeland Security was created to solve
the right problem which is exactly what
you identified the guy on the ground
saying there's a bunch of people here
that I never see at flight school that
want to learn how to fly a plane but not
how to land it that message never got up
you know to the people that mattered and
so the idea was let's put them all in
one building and they'll communicate but
of course that that's not how the
solution works natural systems that do
this
I think the immune system is a good
example you do eventually you do get
signals up to to the brain and you do
have all sorts of responses even though
it's mostly a system of autonomous units
sensing the sensing the environment you
see this in colonal organisms that have
different units that are sensing the
environment in terms of predation in
terms of competing with other colonies
and how much to expand how much to
energy to put into making stinging cells
at the frontier of these colonies
imagine sort of a colonial organism
living on a rock and meeting another
colonial organisms and the ones at the
front have all the armaments and that
has to you know be a resource allocation
that then goes back to okay we need to
spend time on defenses now but if
there's no other competing colony in the
area we can build up a lot more of the
reproductive cells that do that so these
things happen we don't completely
understand how they happen a lot of the
work that's going on with some of the
charismatic invertebrates I mentioned
squid octopi and cuttlefish is a lot of
the neurobiology work is trying to get
at this how do they do these amazing
things that they do with color and and
conformity to different shapes of rocks
and stuff and still maintain their
organization as something you can call
an octopus or a cuttlefish
this is really important again I say not
so open that your brain falls out so
we're not talking about a completely
distributed system where everyone's off
doing their own thing there needs to be
some central control even just a
statement of the problem that then
everyone is out solving in their own in
their own way so this is definitely an
area for further research we know that
they do it we don't know exactly how
they do it in most cases and in a human
example like a contra example would be
al-qaeda which evolved its own immune
system in response to the invasion
Afghanistan so they went from a place a
physical place that had central control
in other words they had strong central
control but after the invasion of
Afghanistan they went to they had to as
a reaction it was an evolutionary
process which mimics I think you know
the biological world where they have
weak central control their strategy
direction very very general strategy
direction an autonomous cells which are
responding to this weak central
direction weaken in other words they're
not strong lines of communication every
day ringing up go and blow up that
church or that mosque or whatever that
doesn't happen but the general direction
and they have evolved naturally as a
response to the US and its allies and
the way they've done it that's an
example in the you know in looking at it
from an al-qaeda perspective they have
adapted and whereas I think if you would
be fair to say in United States and
that's not exclusive the United States I
would say perhaps it's the wrong word
we've retreated and strengthened the
hierarchical structure as a danger had
gone in the opposite direction and the
opponent you know it has certain
advantages as a result of what they've
done or not this is not a comment was
the invasion of Afghanistan the wrong
thing to do you know we can discuss that
for a long time but we have to think
about the consequences of doing that and
what how the opponent will react and
adapt to the new situation they're faced
with
in case of immune system some where
often in medicine they have to suppress
immune system otherwise the organism
will die so what we would say about that
that's a great point I don't want to you
know put the immune system up at a
pedestal because after all some of the
worst medical problems we have are
either overexpression of the immune
system or basically the enemy hijacking
the immune system as an autoimmune
disease and it to me it's a very
important lesson especially if you're
analogizing the immune system to say an
intelligence-gathering system we need to
be very aware that every evolutionary
change every activity in a body or in an
ecosystem has consequences that filter
out through the system and sometimes
they can be fairly negative consequences
so you have to look at if you're going
to create an intelligence-gathering
system how much does the increase power
you give to that sort of immunity have
consequences for the rest of society
which might be something in civil
liberties or something like that to
translate it so there's always this
potential for systems within the body or
within the ecosystem to turn against if
you will the the functioning of the body
or of the ecosystem in ecosystems if you
give too much nutrients to a certain
kind of organism okay so climate change
as an example people have argued well
more carbon is great because plants grow
better with more carbon that's the
simplistic answer so more carbon great
more plant growth then you learn it's
actually plants like poison ivy those
are selected things those weedy things
that grow much better with that
increased carbon load so it's not
completely across the board so we're
always aware of what are the
consequences from a perturbation to the
system it's not a single response and so
many of those early examples I showed
you that the post off saying oh you've
got to hand your envelope to a postal
worker if it's more than 60 ounces our
single response is one time responses
that we think that's going to solve the
problem but
that doesn't solve the problem because
that response leads to a counter
response and so on and the immune system
is just another example of an adaptive
system where viruses that attack on the
immune system have been selected through
a continual escalation process to figure
out how to use that immune system
against the against the body and yet
still maintain the life of the virus and
the ability to them of the virus to
reproduce so it's a constant
evolutionary game so saying you know do
it like the immune system is not enough
because you've got to be aware of those
consequences so I've heard that
basically the Darwinian view of of life
made it possible to understand you know
organisms and ecosystems in in a
completely new way and in fact I think
Richard Dawkins or someone else said you
know before 1865 you know any theories
about life are completely useless
alright so you can see you can view sort
of a utility function that the that an
organism was trying to optimize is sort
of the survival and spread of its genes
just so how can we apply this this sort
of viewpoint to organisms like al-qaeda
what what is the utility function that
al-qaeda is trying to optimize you know
and and can we either have them optimize
the same function in a less destructive
way or you know use use the utility
function you know to high jacket or
something like that
I'll let teri mostly get into the
details that I'll just mention quickly
that we do get into that in in a couple
chapters in the book especially Bradley
fares chapter and Richard SOSUS and
Candice alcorta have a chapter on
religious beliefs and where these entry
points are and how you essentially can
insert at certain points alternative
views but I think Terry probably has a
better perspective on what is that
utility function of a group like
al-qaeda what keeps them reproducing and
going well well in a sense I probably
touched on it in the
to an earlier question and that they
they have their adaptation to their own
environment which is in a way was forced
upon them and that makes her kind of
natural evolution to go to weak central
control and the ability to accept losses
in other words there you need to be
careful with the term optimized al Qaeda
doesn't go for the perfect solution and
eliminating all its opponents that's not
what its objective is its objective is
to inflict damage on an opponent in
order that it might change its behavior
not to eliminate it if you were to turn
it round and look at US policy yet the
idea and not I think it's accurate to
say it's to eliminate al Qaeda and
that's a probably a such a high level
task and the cost of doing that is you
know and then they're not going to be
ultimately successful and so I think
what has happened with al Qaeda is is
its adaptation its multipolar you know
it's at different parts of the world and
it's very much an idea and another
aspect is and this is something from
evolutionary history they have a long
term view they don't have the next
election which you know in our
democracies you know there is there's
this business of time of providing
solutions that have you know this is
going to be done in the next five years
or next four years or whatever so we
limit ourselves by their very nature and
structure of our everyday life and
somehow we have to balance this and so I
think I worry about the term optimal you
have to kind of define it very carefully
you accept injury to yourself maybe as a
group you have to remind yourself what
the objective is is to change the
other's behavior maybe that's a lesson
we could take from al Qaeda we have to
change the behavior of people who might
get involved in these kinds of
activities so I think there's a real
lesson it comes straight out of a
evolutionary biology this three and a
half billion years that the brave talks
about if you were to translated into you
know just just taken into the kind of
everyday work
that I try and do with my colleagues
like Louise Gresham here in the audience
building on work done by Mart Smolinski
now with google.org but who made the
foundations of what we're doing when
these networks we have to try to take a
long-term view that's one thing the
second thing is there's not strong
central control is response to demand of
those places where you're doing the work
to deal with Biological risks that
they're encountering and the next level
is you have to think along the whole
spectrum of Biological risks from Natura
carrying disease things like antibiotic
resistance so that's where the man-made
intervention altered millions of years
of evolution and we tinkered with it and
we we've and there's very serious
consequences yet to come and then
laboratory accidents and then somebody
deliberately using biology in some way
either biotechnology or the organs
themselves as a weapon so we have to
this is a general approach in in our
everyday work try to learn from these
the kinds of concepts that derive from
thinking about the history and the
evolution I should say that successful
organisms have both general security
approaches and specifically targeted so
Denville um signs also studied organisms
that live in a place where predators
have been absent for generations and
generations they still maintain the
capacity to respond to those predators
in many cases if you bring the Predators
back in they'll have that capacity again
as long as it doesn't cost too much to
maintain that capacity if it does that's
when you see the evolution losing things
that you used to have in your past
lineage so it takes both sides of that
the full spectrum and the specific
responses
yeah Louise wait I hail from microphone
Terrier Raphael are there any plans to
apply this more on a community basis so
that people have what you refer to as a
more nuanced sense of their environment
I suspect that that is what we often
lack and are very controlled
environments in the US but in developing
countries I think they would have a
better sense of their environment and
risks and that should be greatly
respected but I'm also thinking of a
situation of genocide where despite
people's perception of their
environments they are not able to
control and nor do they often choose to
control those environments and dr.
Hamburg has just published a new book on
genocide the prevention of genocide and
those who side with Immanuel Kant and
believe in some evil of people no matter
how much a sense of nuance people get
they may not be able to change their
environment given this other force in
there that's absolutely true I mean
animals go extinct so that's you know
that suggests that just being aware of
the environment isn't enough
I think Terry's already spoken to how
important this local control of the the
programs that he's doing is the local
understanding of the environment and the
example I mentioned of Department of
Homeland Security saying 25 percent of
your resources has to go to this is
exactly the opposite of this because the
homeland security chief in Massachusetts
is saying that's not my problem you know
my problem is X Y &amp;amp; Z so some more
information is better but it's not going
to be a panacea and you can have these
systems that do go out of control
sometimes because of these very
behavioral predispositions that are so
deeply rooted that before the problem
gets completely out of our control
before that catastrophic regime shift
that Dominic Johnson talks about in his
chapter
you you get this genocide is a good
example of a catastrophic regime shift
that occurs probably promulgated out of
a core set of beliefs that no one could
shake or offer an alternative way but
one of the things that's promising to me
is both Richard Sousa says chapter and
Scott a trans chapter and subsequent
work that Scott at Rand has done shows
that there are pathways to entry and
pathways to open up the door and the the
trivial and fun example I give is what
we call ping-pong diplomacy when we
wanted in the 70s to open relationships
with China we didn't say you know you
must modernize you must open up your
doors one of the things we did I
wouldn't say this is all of it one of
the things we did is we sent a bunch of
ping-pong players to China it's a great
strategy because sending ping-pong
players to China get their asses kicked
by the Chinese didn't cost the u.s.
anything because no one cared that our
best ping-pong players lost the
Chinese's third string of ping-pong
players it was a glorious wonderful
victory for the Chinese and what it did
is it opened up the door to say you know
we're willing to give a little if you're
willing to give a little and a more
serious note this is exactly what a
trent's talking about with the Israelis
and Palestinians and has done
simulations with Palestinians and
Israelis showing that very simple
concessions that governments are still
loath to do they might be things like
apologizing for collateral damage due to
a bombing or something can go a very
long way much longer and much farther
than saying you've got to drop that that
thing that you want that's not okay with
us because they're not going to change
that fundamental belief if they believe
a certain set of conditions so there are
abilities to get in there but you have
to consider the timing once it's gone
into that genocide phase you actually
may be too late you're already in that
proliferative stage III think that's a
very interesting example I mean the case
you're talking about like for example
the fascist regime in Germany and the
mass extermination
while the attempted mass extermination
of Jews in that country and other
countries as well that's an aberration
and an overreaction to to a set of
circumstances you could look at that
like like the immune system going awry
then a deep-seated set of beliefs are
challenged and then there's a
misperception of how you would deal with
that challenge to your deep-seated
beliefs and you get these terrible
reactions I mean in a different way if
you think of the mass suicide of the
Jamestown the in Guyana absolutely where
they felt their deep-seated beliefs were
being challenged and somehow someone
managed to convince a group to do this
but the roots lie in the human evolution
and that that chapter that we have in
the book of that subject so one has to
handle these deep-seated beliefs very
carefully because you're caused the
overreaction yeah which was
extraordinarily dangerous and we find
pathways by which you can community and
as you do Louise with us we find a
pathway and as Mark has done between
Israelis and Palestinians on a
particular issue where there's a
convergence of interests it's not
challenging their deep-seated beliefs
it's not challenging the existence of
Israel it's not that at all it's about
human communities have a common interest
in improving important issues of Public
Health so you've kind of commented it to
this point just a little bit but um so
now that you've written the book
how will you promote it to politicians
and people making policy decisions who
actually I would imagine would be not
likely to pick up this book at all yeah
so the question was how now are we going
to promote this to politicians and
decision-makers who are probably not
likely to pick up an academic press book
we wanted to get first of all we wanted
to get the ideas out there in some
forums so I worked with the University
of California Press which is not a great
promoter of anything but they make books
they don't promote them so we're doing a
number of different approaches one is
talking to groups
like this in business yesterday we were
a security group at Stanford we've
talked to security think tanks in
Washington DC we've talked to scientific
groups in Washington DC like triple-a s
will be doing congressional briefings
for those staffers whose bosses are
involved in the security committees and
that kind of thing so it's a
multi-pronged approach I'm currently
working on you know sort of the the
Jared Diamond version the mass-market
version of this book which is a more
accessible approach it's it's sort of
everything it's a it's a marketing I
mean any ideas need to be marketed in
some way so we recognize the challenge
there and we were just talking yesterday
with Senator Gary Hart who's been very
involved in homeland security since way
before 9/11 with the heart Rudman
Commission and he had some very good
advice about you know what sort of
products you can put out that really
resonate or are accessible to
policymakers and and my my day job is
basically doing this for marine
environmental policy trying to figure
out how to translate science that I'm
doing another scientists are doing to a
language that policymakers and the
public can appreciate so so I'm getting
well-versed in this and I'll apply this
sort of same approaches to this book
right now it's still also a process of
getting new ideas every time I talk to
new audiences I get a new idea or
something new that someone suggests Oh
have you thought about this system or I
study these little bugs and they do this
which is really cool
so that's why it's so important for us
to have these conversations and we want
to add to the names on this list
yeah right and have a look at
www.securityasi.com comm it's a common
org we got them all you're a mole yes we
couldn't get Naturals that's why we want
ideas when you're people like you yeah
so you know yeah I work well it's kind
of a long question it's about the
modeling that you did for the colonial
immune systems to the government so I
was asking if there is any organism that
basically were in any colony there are
like two two organisms that stick to
each other and one of
act as the immune system for the other
one while it's not necessarily it's it's
you utility function yeah actually
utility functions to survive rather than
to provide immunity because absolutely
this modeling there well since you're
sorry please okay since you're from UC
Santa Barbara or like you lived there
for a while
professor Amara is in Palomar his from
low in society Department oh and what he
does is basically is studying the police
and basically what he's trying to show
is that the police as a system is not
there to protect people more than to
exist and to enforce governmental policy
policies so I was asking if something
like this is is there in in nature yes
so the question is are there examples
where something is you know sort of
appears to be providing some immunity
but it's actually there for its own
function as an organism that's in a
relationship with another organism and
the example given was police as
something that supposedly provides
immunity against crime but is actually
an organism on itself that has its own
goals to reproduce itself and support a
governmental system absolutely symbiosis
there are millions of forms of symbiosis
as many as there are organisms on earth
or more because you get into factorial
kind of things takes a multitude of
different forms and you can go back in
history we have tons of genetic
parasites within our own DNA that were
once symbiotic relationships that became
fully incorporated into our DNA so you
can look at our genetic code and find
almost exact matches to two viruses and
that sort of thing that once we're sort
of Free Riders and then eventually got
incorporated into our genome and there
are countless examples people consider
mitochondria to be one of these examples
of once an independent organism that
then got incorporated into our cell
structure and importantly on your point
many symbiosis are not these sort of
mutually altruistic
kind of things they are the organism in
it for its own good and reproduction and
sometimes it behooves the organism to
become a full incorporated part of the
host organism and sometimes it's a
temporary relationship that can can run
a ride there's a great example where
there are symbiotic bacteria that that
help plants but it turns out that if
they if they fail to help plants
producing nutrients the plant will
punish it by withholding oxygen from
those organisms so so these
relationships can be very tenuous they
can be very temporary or they can be so
long as to become fully incorporated
into the genome of the host organization
so almost almost anything goes when it
comes to symbiotic relationships so
there's no one answer to your question
thank you very good question and if you
look into the security world and by the
way you know whilst security has really
been the focus of what's brought us
together this would apply in the
business world to large corporations and
so on so while I gonna make a security
example in if you were to take the Iraq
case and I'm trying not to be political
but but analytical is there was a
concentration on force protection for
the US forces in Iraq so the company and
the mission was to protect
unintentionally was to protect US forces
in Iraq and not to protect the Iraqi
people and that's you know what a really
a fundamental problem until the policy
changed with General Petraeus going and
he changed that the tactic it required
more troops because we needed more
troops right from the beginning and so
the different tactics so we have to
provide security for the Iraqi people
and do collaboration with local groups
and so on and there are many other
lessons in the UK case in northern
ireland's there's another another
example or a completely different
approach was taken and if you were to
compare the counterinsurgency campaign
in Malaya going back some time and
Vietnam the two different ways in in
Vietnam had ended up with force
protection again being a key factor and
the big fire bases
not living with the community whereas in
the Malayan case because UK has not such
a rich country had very limited
resources had to go and live in the
community in advance to secure to the
community give them advice on
agriculture and all these other things
we're delivering security they got the
idea these forces are here actually to
make our lives better and safer so it's
completely different approach and that's
what conference agencies but should be
all about and that's a lesson from
eeveelution history that's a that's a
great example
protecting the force rather than yeah
all right well thank you all I want to
thank Michael Oswal who is our host here
recently brought into the Google
Googleplex I guess and it was great to
have that entree into your opinions and
ideas please contact me
Rayford sagar and at Duke Michael can
put you in touch if you forget that I
would love to hear more from you about
how you're working here's it is going
and how that might relate to these kind
of adapt adaptive structures but I
really appreciate your your questions
and your thinking our imagined by the
book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
