going
talking about the wind belt this is like
a awesome in the coolness factor so
without further ado thanks Caillou
really excited is this too loud okay
I'm really excited to be here today I
was at a talk a few months ago and
there's a I don't know y'all were at his
talk but he was he's a professor at
Harvard who's doing microbial fuel cells
basically turning chicken crap into
electricity
you know the coolest thing in the world
and I said wow Peter how's that going
and he said it's going pretty well I'm
giving a talk at Google so so I'm really
really excited to be here the company
I'm gonna be talking about in the
technology you're going to be talking
about today falls under my startup which
is humdinger wind energy and our focus
is a new type of wind generator which is
the first viable non turbine alternative
to turbine based systems and I'll dive
right in in a few minutes into the
technology itself and let you guys kind
of poke holes in it and ask questions
and whatnot but I wanted to warn you
that my goal in coming to this talk is
twofold
one is to talk about the technology it's
called the wind belt I'll show you a
little demo and to get your feedback
because it's an early-stage technology
that's really just starting to crawl out
of the water onto land so any inputs
most appreciated but my second goal is
to talk a little bit about this design
and invention movement it's sort of
where hunting or wind energy came out of
and where the technology behind our
company came from and that's focusing on
technologies developed specifically for
developing countries and then seeing how
the interesting thing that's happening
is this field of appropriate technology
or design for developing countries is
changing it's no longer the technology
that's in Uncle
ned's you know workshop in the in the
backwoods of you know Wisconsin I hope
no one's from Wisconsin but it it's
changing into the most cutting-edge
technology because when you give
yourself the most difficult constraints
in the world which you often find in
developing countries sometimes and other
folks are finding a lot of times that
yields new patentable technologies which
can have play in markets other than the
developing countries so I'll get into
that at the end while you're held
hostage here but just jumping right into
it so first something you guys know what
is this no I'm kidding it's a wind power
up-to-date is it can be summarized by a
few words something that spins and I
don't mean that in a derogatory way
that's just the way it is you know you
go back you know 2000 years to look at
when wind power was first starting to be
harnessed and you see things you know
you see spinning windmills that would
pound grain and then a little bit later
you would see spinning windmills that
would pump water and more recently in
the last hundred years there have been a
lot of research into wind turbines that
spin focus in a large area of wind to a
small gearbox spin up some magnetics and
some coils and whatnot and then get
electing electrical output that way
that's great and that works really well
on the very large scale when you have
you know a vast area of wind that you're
concentrating down but when you start to
scale down wind power to the sub 100
watt field that turbine technology that
focus on rotational systems no longer is
no longer is viable and that's why
there's nothing on the market presently
in wind power in these very small you
know sub 100 watt ranges you might
discount that and say well who cares
about sub 100 watt but if you look at
photovoltaics a hue a very large
percentage by energy about seven or
eight percent I believe of the PV market
in the world or is these are these very
very small scale energy use
for powering all sorts of small-scale
apps wind power just doesn't have that
for a variety of reasons when you scale
down a wind turbine to lot the
percentage of losses you get in your
bearings becomes a higher percentage of
your overall power output you don't have
the same you know the same angular
momentum that you have on the very large
scale so the dynamics change a lot so
that's why no one's been successful at
scaling down wind turbines so the way
that I got into this and what led to the
formation of humdinger wind energy was a
serie of new constraints and just to
give you some background this is a shot
taken from the roof where we were
installing some solar panels from BP at
a fishing village in Haiti pity dunks
and I've done some work there for the
last four or five years it's a group out
of MIT that works with a few different
organizations in Haiti we were doing
things like converting agricultural
waste such as what's left over after you
squeeze the sugar after you squeeze the
juice out of sugarcane converting that
into cooking charcoal with very low cost
technologies focusing on things like
solar water disinfection while I was
there I also realized which a lot of
people which a lot of other folks have
realized as well that kerosene lighting
is the predominant form of lighting for
a lot of homes and when you use kerosene
there's the kerosene is an outdated fuel
for lighting you know to say the least
it's inefficient in terms of energy
input and light you get out but it's
also dangerous hazardous and costly you
know you can spend five to ten dollars a
month on kerosene fuel just for a couple
of lamps so all those things combined
led me to want to focus on a system that
all in these were my constraints that
all land would cost about ten dollars
provide power to a couple of white LEDs
you might have read about a lot of
groups coming out of Stanford and MIT
and whatnot that are forming startups
that are looking at how to
displace kerosene with white LEDs the
problem is there's a missing component
to their system and that's the very
micro scale power component so my goal
was to design a wind generator that
would contribute to the system the
system all in including wind generator
batteries power conditioning unit and a
couple white LEDs that would be around
ten dollars cost I tried to do that with
turbines and it turned out to be way way
off by a few orders of magnitude so that
forced this new invention called the
wind belt and basically the kind of the
I guess our motto at humdinger is that
harder problems make for better better
inventions so by giving yourself really
difficult constraints you can come up
with something new that maybe you
couldn't come up with if you you know
didn't have the tight cost constraints
that that you would have in this case in
Haiti some of those constraints just to
run through them like I was saying whole
system whole lighting system all in one
- or about ten dollars whole system all
in about ten dollars so the wind
generator component of that would be
about five dollars max cost can be
manufactured in Haiti that was another
constraint it's very difficult those
panels that picture that was taken off
the roof with those solar panels those
panels took about two years to get into
Haiti they got stolen in the port we
were waiting by the panels and they were
covered in a blanket and someone before
we hopped on the little puddle hopper to
get 250 doughnuts pulled back the
blanket and it turned out someone had
switched the panels for a table yeah so
we got him back but needless to say it
would be good if there was an energy
system that could be manufactured in
developing countries and I'm gonna get
to some of the you know I'm focusing
initially on where this technology came
from but I'm gonna get to where I think
it can go and there's a lot of other
markets in wealthy countries like the
u.s. that you know countries in the EU
Japan
that can benefit from this technology as
well but you know just keeping on target
here another set of constraints was no
specialized materials I didn't want a
system like a solar panel nothing
against solar panels at all but I didn't
want a system that needed to have a
silicon processing infrastructure built
up or have to have a special material
imported it's just a it would make it
easier to get the product off the ground
if magnets were necessary for this wind
generator they needed to be small
there's a lot of import restrictions on
larger sized magnets that you would use
for a traditional sort of homebrew wind
system and one of my friends in in
Guatemala was telling me he can't get
the he can't get these large super
magnets imported in at all so you need a
mat you need a set of magnets that's
small enough that produces a small
enough magnetic field that you can
easily case it in with just a steel case
and then ship it without any import
restrictions and easy to repair and
improve part of the objective was to
design a technology that would be you
know viable when it hit the markets but
would be able to be transparent enough
and easy enough to fix and easy enough
to improve that the technology could be
developed kind of in-house that is to
say engineers and inventors in Haiti
could improve the technology sort of
going for the open source hardware idea
but with power so oh the final
constraint was no I wanted to minimize
the grinding in wearable parts as you
know basic fundamental principle that I
think everyone tries to achieve so I
really wanted to eliminate any bearings
in the system because when you're down
at these sort of small-scale power
levels that power things like LED lights
and radios and charge cellphones you
need pretty expensive bearings you know
air bearings to to make a viable system
I didn't want to deal with that too
expensive difficult to repair difficult
to import so that was another constraint
all these things led up to forming an
invention that you
no in a caricature looks more like this
a stringed instrument or the vibrating
bow of a musical instrument you could
say so
as opposed to wind turbines which are
basically a big rotating airplane wing
you know big rotating airfoil the
technology that we came up with after
looking at those constraints looked more
like the vibrating bow of a violin let's
say so what do I really mean by that
what I really mean is that where we're
focusing on a different phenomenon with
this new technology lift and drag is
what governs sort of the operation of an
airplane or turbine but there's a lot of
other aerodynamic phenomenon out there
that you can tap the one that we ended
up tapping looks pretty familiar I think
to engineers and anyone who's gone
through middle school in the States I
think and that's the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge the effect that ripped apart this
bridge is called aeroelastic flutter
sort of a positive feedback loop of
competing forces of lift versus the
tension forces in the bridge usually you
try to minimize or eliminate aeroelastic
flutter from any aerodynamic or
structure or structural system so
there's a lot of work that's been that's
gone into how to eliminate aeroelastic
flutter but if there was a way that you
could control the forces involved and
control that effect and harness it for
energy output then that would be a
viable alternative to you know lift and
drag over an airfoil you know wind
powers a few things we were talking
about it before the talk I see wind
power is a few things three main goals
one you have to collect and it just like
a magnifying lens kind of you know
there's these new solar panels that are
coming out which you have optics that
focus in a larger area of Sun into a
very small high efficiency
a little PV a panel of sorts I don't
even know if they're yeah PV panel of
sorts the goal for wind power is the
same you want to focus in a large area
of wind into a smaller area then usually
you have to do something with making
that small area move at a high enough
frequency that you can get a fishing
electrical output from magnets moving
past coils by and large and then the
third thing is you need to condition
that power what the wind belt does what
this new technology does is it it looks
at new ways to tackle one and a little
bit of too
you know how to concentrate in an area
of wind for efficient electrical output
and different sorts of configurations of
magnetics and coils in one night and we
did have to make some very inexpensive
power conditioning units to take care of
our cost constraints but um
but that wasn't the main focus just
keeping an eye on the time and if
there's any questions just holler them
out during the talk and we can get more
down to it at the end okay
so that was just to remind me that
wanted to not wait too long to show you
the demo because that'll kind of give
you a better idea of what it is I'm
talking about and I won't be so vague
but I wanted to give you a little bit of
a background of where this came from so
that you'll understand where I think it
can go and also so that you understand
why it's so different from other wind
systems out there so just to stop any
the comments I gets most from engineers
is oh that's great you can charge a cell
phone or you can power a couple LEDs but
you're pulling in 70 watts into your fan
and you're getting out a fraction of a
lot that is true but it is not my fault
that the fan is inefficient there
there's about three to five watts of
power coming out in this large cross
section at about 10 or 11 miles per hour
which is what the demo is I'm going to
show you right now and we're cutting a
sliver of that so efficiency all in ends
up being around 10% you know when you
take into account the losses through the
power conditioning unit into a match
load so it just stopped that question
it's tracked but feel free to ask me if
that didn't convince you so so this is
just the first demo of a couple so this
is the show that this system which again
is just a demo system but that this
system hit those constraints a couple
white LEDs you know just to show you
there's no magic going on here show you
that it works at a few different speeds
this is around 11 miles per hour this is
around 8 miles per hour I'm showing you
the different speeds because a a comment
that I get often is oh well that's a
great you know great idea fine but you
have to hit 11 point 2 miles per hour to
get the resonant effect but this isn't
you know there's resonance involved but
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was not ripped
apart by the same forces that let the
opera singer blow apart you know the
wineglass so it's not that you're having
to hit a specific frequency it's more of
a resonances a kind of positive feedback
loop to but this is more of a positive
feedback loop of competing forces so
that is to say you can tap a wide range
of wind speeds without having to have a
dynamic tensioning system although that
would be nice so let me show you another
demo just to show you that it can do
everything I said it could do
so if there's any questions while I'm
doing this feel free to shoot what she
doing right now so that's the only thing
I can't talk too much about because the
patent still haven't been fully filed
but the power conditioning unit you know
you're getting in a very clean AC input
and you need to do a few things you need
to rectify and you need a boost
typically you would do that with
something you know like you know boost
converter you know in combination with
you know typical bridge rectifier the
cost was too high for those two things
combined and the losses were too great
so we have so all I can say especially
since this is on tape is that there's a
few components that you could pull out
of you know any old radio that are in
the power conditioned unit and quantity
cost is probably somewhere around you
know it twenty-five cents or 50 cents so
they're their standard components know
kind of silicon components in their unit
to operate at this unit operates that
between around four miles per hour when
it starts to put out power to around 14
actually this one's probably to around
12 or 13 but we've had systems that work
in that range
after 14 it's not that your system just
kind of falls over and dies it starts to
hiccup and go ahead of itself and what
we're finding as we as I look at kind of
larger scale systems is that that's sort
of a function of this particular size
working on systems now where this effect
seems to give increasing power levels
through a wider range of wind speeds
it's no it's actually just and it can
get a closer look afterwards but it's
just this band here it's a band of it's
kind of a it's a mile are coded Taffet
it's a very very very primitive sort of
composite material that very commodity
you can use it for things like
of kites and as you change the wind
speeds does that change the vibration
frequency or is a chance at the Spanish
mostly the amplitude kinda frequency
changes by a few birds and it's going at
about a hundred Hertz now so that's why
it's giving some efficient output this
is to show you that it can do the duty
cycle of charging a lithium-ion battery
in a phone it doesn't it would take a
long time for this particular scale to
fully charge up the phone I don't know
if you could tell the difference as I
was talking over it but the initial
start up is very difficult for a system
that's as gossamer as this to do so it
took a while to be able to design a
system that could actually get over that
initial part of the charge cycle then
one more and keep shooting out questions
as I as I do this but we've charged it
up we you know we've let it run for a
few hours and have made you know half an
hour's worth of calls so it's more of a
demo let me show you that right after
this one but it works it's the same sort
of sinusoidal fall-off that you would
get from any change in cross-section
approximately so you know wind turbine
you get that kind of fall off as your
cross-section changes
similarly with this system but I'll show
you to convince you this so this is a
crank radio only because crank radios
require very little power this may or
may not work I haven't tested it this is
at the very edge powering a speaker that
people can hear it's at the very edge of
what this this system can do but I
figure what the heck
okay okay
so we would just like that because it's
like you know literally showing you know
that we're hitting about four and a half
bolts to replace the few double A's so
is that one you know I'm not going to
get into too much the business side
because I know this is a Tech Talk so
that's why I'm just kind of not too
worried about screwing around with the
demo here with you guys
so I hope you don't mind but so let me
show you this so so I don't know if you
all can see the LED there the systems on
its last legs this is the last demo it
has to go through it's been around the
state's a dozen times so the baggage
handlers haven't been kind I have a big
note that says this is a experimental
wind generator but they they open it
anyway I think that makes them open it
so this is to show you that unlike
turbine most turbine based systems this
can take you know pretty smooth laminar
flow which this is sort of this is
pretty pretty rough and tumble but it
can also take really really screwed up
non laminar flow from my breath so I
don't know if everyone can see that but
um that's just that part of the demo so
that if you're interested after the talk
I can show you one of the these are all
sort of the developing country
applications and after the talk I can
show you if you're interested kind of on
the side how this system power is a
wireless sensor node which is one of the
key first kind of killer apps for the
wind belt in wealthy countries namely
systems that you could have imagined a
peel-and-stick flat wind belt that was
about yay long about yay wide and about
yay high that would put out you know
just a milliwatt of power
but then you could that's enough
combined with a buffer like a capacitor
to power up a lot of wireless sensors
that do things like report temperature
report humidity things that you need in
any smart building to be able to make a
more intelligent heating and ventilation
system because that's where about 50% of
a building's energy flows so to make any
sort of LEED certified or green building
you need to know what's flowing through
the ducts right now that's difficult
because these sensors all require
batteries and you can imagine needing to
you know call it Tom Cruise to crawl
through the ducting system to replace
all these batteries every couple of
years when you need you know a few
hundred to a thousand sensors throughout
the ducting of a large building so I can
show you that afterwards but there's a
question I could and maybe this would be
correct or not but I could describe this
as a device that where the working fluid
is air yeah if you were to replace that
place that this thing a lot of work
underwater right it's it's conceivable
the effect is still there the thing I
have to be a little vague I get a lot of
enquiries about whether or not
aeroelastic flutter works in different
fluids such as water my personal opinion
right now is that there are other
effects that are maybe more viable in
you know kind of constant flowing water
if you're interested there's a group I
think out of Colorado maybe called
vortex hydro energy that uses vortices
shedding which is basically little
little whirlpools that spin off of spin
off of a cylinder and because your your
water is so much denser than air board
is he shedding kind of makes that
cylinder move up and down with a you
know pretty good amount of force and you
get dead spots because vortices shedding
is a periodic it it it makes something
oscillate at a periodic frequency so you
get dead spots that's it so I guess what
I'm saying is in air there's no other
but there's no other system that
competes with this sort of model at
these scales we're about ten times the
31
it's more efficient than wind turbines
that are on this scale so that's
important when you go up an order of
magnitude in terms of cross-section
that's cut we become much less efficient
not much much less but less efficient
than larger scale systems but there's a
recent publication about a couple years
well that's not recent a couple years
ago in nature about a small-scale
turbine and we're about 10 times more
efficient than that and they put out a
new study and more about 30 times more
efficient than that one but and and
these few questions and then we'll save
the rest for the end it's I can tell
that the the frequency is changing a
little bit yeah I'm not exactly sure the
it see we've put the system's through
200 hours of operation in the lab just
kind of constantly going through
different kind of heating and cooling
cycles you know throughout over the
period of them of a couple months and it
seems as if the frequency stayed roughly
the same and the power output was
roughly the same with this one I can
tell that there's something out of
alignments and I didn't hear it so it's
not that I think maybe there's just some
misalignment that's happened up on that
this end I think you said that was made
out of mylar I think Mar will stretch
unless you've got some carbon fiber it's
on my art but it's happiness of mylar
yeah right that's probably what's
failing here but what happens in a
hurricane and if you want more power do
you make
or to make a bigger one I'll answer that
at the end and what happens in a
hurricane I think there's gonna probably
be some questions about dynamic
tensioning so I'll bust through the next
bit just so that there's enough time for
questions I'm sorry I don't have a watch
that I have to keep looking up there
just to show this is what I just stated
you know and if you want to look at the
reference I got a lot of flack for
people thinking that I was saying that
the wind belt is ten times more
efficient than wind turbines which would
be impossible you know wind turbines on
a large scale so I'm being very specific
now and you can check out this citation
at our website humdinger wind dot-com
and do the comparison for yourself we're
comparing the cross-section that's cut
by the wind belt as it oscillates and
tagging that against the cross-sectional
kind of area of the wind turbines that
are published there's very little data
in this range for wind turbines because
a lot of the stuff that's out there it's
about a thousand times less efficient
than then this sort of system area the
entire a little time frame because I
mean that's gonna have it yeah so in
this system there would be an argument
for that but I can actually remove this
top bit and there's no sort of funneling
that's going on part of what I've been
mentioning about the strategy of
humdinger wind energy isn't for a long
time I didn't even mention the whole
developing country aspect of it because
that confused some people or I thought
it would now I hope it doesn't but the
purpose it the reason I mentioned is
because that's where the technology came
from and that's why it's so different
but that difference doesn't mean that it
doesn't have applications in wealthy
countries which I believe is a powerful
phenomenon that's going to happen in a
lot of other fields as well I mentioned
one sort of application which is the
small peel and stick little peel and
stick energy harvesters instead of
batteries wherever you have an airflow
there's other applications as well which
I'll get to in the next slide but the
idea is there's protectable that there's
IP in
and if that IP can be licensed in
wealthy countries it still stays open
source in developing countries just by
the nature of the patent system you know
there is no international worldwide
stamp of approval patent patents are by
country so there's no reason to patent
something in Haiti so it's still open
source where you know I want it to be
open source but it's protected where I
think some licensing revenues can be
pulled out and then the ultimate
objective you know through me I'm not
the only one in the company but the
revenues that flow through me flow back
to the original you know objective which
is these emerging economy markets we're
not a social venture it's a you know
hardcore you know regular business in
Silicon Valley but it's just something
that is an aspect to it so that's just
what I was saying next steps on the
horizon what we're doing is exploring
the landscape of where this technology
can go I got there is a question about
scale and hopefully this answers it a
little bit I already mentioned these
very empowering very very micro sized
systems and there's really nothing else
in the game in terms of using wind power
to power very small scale sub 1 watt
applications and there's a lot of them
out there
however the question is you know seeing
the system will also I think get a lot
of people thinking and it has on what
happens when you scale up a little bit
let's say you scale up to a 1 to 10 watt
system there's the base on the Bill of
Materials and we're just an initial
testing for this scale it seems as if
we'll be able to achieve around a 10
watt system and that's rated power so it
would be 10 watts at around 22 miles per
hour and so basically a 1 to 10 watt
system a 10 watt system for cost Bill of
Materials around 10 dollars if you
compare that to what wind energy costs
on the large scale that beats it in
terms of cost per watt it a lot of a lot
of people discount this you know out of
hand but when you look at the number of
components
involved in the this wind belt system
then I think people will start to come
around and pretty soon we hope to have a
demo model of this size scale system
that hits these goals these are good for
things like rural electrification and
you know let's say China where there's
not much solar irradiance in certain
areas because of the pollution so your
solar panel which is five to six dollars
per watt suddenly when you have a
hundred times less solar energy hitting
that area of the panel becomes five or
six hundred dollars per produced swap it
so it becomes non viable but in some of
those places wind is a viable input also
things like Wi-Fi nodes I know they were
trying to put up Wi-Fi nodes in Central
Park and they're having a big cost issue
with wiring things up there so having
these small-scale systems that use wind
and maybe in combination with solar to
power apps like Wi-Fi nodes and rural
electrification I think is is one part
of the landscape and another big part of
the landscape is how big does this thing
scale up you know anyone who knows
anything about scaling up anything knows
that you cannot make claims out of hand
that something scales because the
dynamics on the large scale are
different than the dynamics on the very
micro scale turbines have found this to
be true so similarly we may have an
upstream but what kind of a a battle
going uphill however its unknown we know
the effect is present because it rips
apart things on the large scale the
question is can we efficiently can we
make an efficient enough generator on
these large scales to hit the price
points we need to make that a viable
alternative to turbines on the large
kilowatt plus scale and that's a big
open question but it's part of what this
next year of development is intended for
part of the plan part of the kind of
non-conventional plan is because it's
difficult to do large-scale test
installations in the States partnering
with an organization and I encourage
everyone to check them out they're a idg
appropriate infrastructure development
group based out of Guatemala but also
with operations in Haiti
so a idg org
I'm not affiliated with them now but
they're going to be a partner with us in
exploring how the wind belt scales up to
these large kind of stretch across the
canyon
scales and I think we're gonna get there
faster and we're gonna get there not to
sound like NASA but I think we're gonna
get there faster and get there cheaper
than we would with domestic resources
devoted towards you know experiment
having an R&amp;amp;D Center in Silicon Valley
for instance for these large-scale
systems so that's one tier of the
experiment how am i doing on time here
okay so now that I've gone through the
wind belt you're gonna have to bear with
me for another five minutes as I kind of
poked at you about this coming design
revolution which humdinger wind energy
is a part of but which a lot of other
folks are starting to pioneer and I see
this as something that isn't on a lot of
folks radar so I'm I've I'm sort of the
West Coast evangelist for this new
design revolution as I see it so the
basic idea goes along with what I said
at the beginning of the talk and that's
that harder problems make for better
inventions the hardest problems in the
world happened to be in developing
countries by and large they're kind of
the avant-garde of the problems you know
clean water energy all these sorts of
things are going to impact you know in
10 to 20 years and they're already
starting to they won't only be severely
impacting developing countries they'll
be impacting everybody so the
technologies that are developed now
which focus on these very difficult
constraints in developing countries are
going to have cross over and I think
they're going to have cross over in
several fields you know I'll just buzz
through this so there's plenty of time
for questions these are just some of the
fields that I think there haven't been
the advances needed over the last 50
years that need to happen if you look
back a hundred years ago when a lot of
the kind of foundations for the
technologies we have today were made you
know but you know Edison in the light
bulb and electricity and dynamos and
whatnot the reason those were developed
is that the entire world was
developing country you know the entire
world every country in the world was a
developing country except for a very
very very small tiny elite so the
designers and inventors at that time
were very well weds to the problems of
the day whereas now about 10% of the
world that does most of the design is
disconnected from the other 90% of the
world and I think what that does is it
loosens kind of the vise grip of
constraints and makes for poor design
and you know you get to a point you say
okay that hits my constraints and then
there's these legacy effects that come
into play where an average design gets
kind of carried through decades now what
needs to happen is that the new industry
starters need to be developed just like
happened a hundred years ago you know
obviously I'm not talking about the
internet because that recent phenomenon
but besides that for things like power
and whatnot
I think the place a lot of this is going
to come is from the developing countries
and there's going to be as Jeff Immelt
the CEO of GE said this is sort of going
to be the third phase the third stage of
globalization where inventions and
developments in developing countries are
going to affect the developed world in
ways that people don't see I was very
surprised to hear him say that but just
some examples of places that this
revolution has already begun
I know that everyone here I've seen all
the posters for the for the give one get
$100 laptop all around Google but what's
cool to me besides that sort of strategy
of give one get one is the screen so
this was a technology that was developed
with very severe constraints you know
very severe power constraints you had to
make a laptop that was you know it
consumed xx or 1/10 the power of a
traditional laptop you have to make and
you know the screen consumed a lot of
that that power so what these guys did
was and not I think the inventor was
expert in in display technologies and I
think she's out of MIT I'm not sure but
what she did was designed pixels regular
kind of luminescing pixels that
you know work like a regular screen when
you're in the dark but then you can
switch it into more of an e-reader mode
kind of like an e-ink type of it's not a
inks technology but an e-tank type of
reflective display that doesn't consume
power when it doesn't change State and I
want that on my laptop but it's in these
$100 laptops and the only reason that
it's there is because of these severe
power constraints and the constraint of
needing to be able to read your laptop
in full sunlight so I think that's
something that's going to cross over and
was only developed with these
constraints I'll buzz through these
other ones but it's important that this
next organization jabber foot is super
interesting they're designing
prosthetics in India that are you know a
hundred times less expensive than
prosthetics in the States and they've
developed some interesting molding
technologies using basically sand in a
vacuum sort of a vacuum bag they pull
the air out and you can make kind of
instant molds of a person's you know
person's limb that that's been amputated
and then you can make these customized
prosthetics importantly even more
importantly than the cost is they can do
this in a one to two day turnaround time
whereas in the states you know someone
coming back from Iraq has to wait six
months to get a prosthetic limb and this
is something I see possibly crossing
over as well you can they just want a
tech award so you can read about them
they're you know in expensive cars
because of the cost constraints in India
face change incubation Amy Smith out of
MIT has developed a new way of
incubating biological samples using a
phase change material which is basically
a wax that you heat up to you know you
put it the wax little balls of wax out
in the Sun it melts the wax so by
melting the wax you're absorbing the Sun
energy or you can boil them as the wax
starts to Ries elyda fie it lets out the
temperature at its phase change so
around 37 degrees Celsius and you can
get constant temperature incubation for
things like water and blood samples this
is something that I think is going to
affect medical technology in a lot of
realms and again developed with these
constraints of not being able
have a $2,000 incubator that you need to
recharge you know before you go out into
the field and the moto phone is pretty
cool it uses you know kind of an e-ink
style display you know I think they're
$30 retail they the the power it can I
don't remember exactly what the duration
is but it's something like 200 hours of
I don't know you have to look it up but
it's it's almost an order of magnitude
more talktime and standby time than
their phones that you have in your
pocket right now just because again of
power constraints you know you go to the
city once and recharge your phone you
don't want to have to keep going so it
don't quote me on that
that order of magnitude greater but it's
substantial I guess that's it you know
oh the wind belt right so I guess that's
it but you know more than the technology
itself which you know I'm a technology
guy so I love the technology of the wind
belt and these other technologies but
more important than that is that there's
this new system of invention and design
that I think is coming to a head in
which a lot of the world's problems
including energy and clean water and
poverty are all going to coalesce into a
lot of designers and a lot of inventors
who focus on the problems in developing
countries with the outcome being that
those aren't only a social charitable
venture that those yield patentable
protectable technologies in the
developed you know wealthy world that
can then form industries the world over
not just developing countries so thanks
any questions
yeah when you you know on the large
scale it makes no sense to have a
structure that beams you know you don't
have to hold the mountains from coming
closer to one another so in that case
you're you cost reduce by eliminating
the structure which in this case is you
know about half the cost you know
obviously wouldn't be made out of
aluminum but but yes I guess the answer
the question is on the large scale the
way to do it I believe is by grabbing on
to existing structures whether that's
you know mountains or whether that's you
know components of a bridge or
architectural components you know like
in the frame of a window let's say and
and doing it that way so but again I
have to stress that there's been no
testing on this vast scale so all of
this is you know it's a postulation that
it can scale up
it wouldn't so if you did that you'd get
caught in more of a torsional mode which
is way way you know a hundred or a
thousand times less energy output than
this mode where you have this flutter of
the membrane in the middle and then that
concentrates that sort of motion across
this larger cross section to the the
most massive part of the system which
are kind of those button magnets so it
works kind of like a flexible lever you
could say so instead of getting your
high frequency oscillation of a magnet
with reference to some coils by using a
gearbox instead you use so instead of
gears as your simple machine example
using leverage and getting that you know
high frequency output that way really
not audible that it's generating energy
it's great when you scale that up you're
gonna run into issues of sound being
generated primary technical hurdles as
it scales up definitely and there's been
scaled it up to around you know a human
sized generator which is kind of in this
you know 10 to 20 watt size system and
sometimes I can design the system to
produce low levels of sound but
sometimes it's loud so you know noise is
lost energy so the hypothesis is that
with with more attention to how the
membranes actually designed and
tensioned then we can get around that
problem but it's a definite concern I
think there was another and then I'll
get back
approximately true so I should just this
this prototype was designed months
months months ago so the new systems
were working on our have a whole
different dynamic than this system you
know this is one of the least efficient
configurations for coils with reference
to magnets but it works at the wind
speeds I needed it to work at when you
can have cut in at 8 miles per hour
instead of 4 miles per hour cut in you
know when you can have your wind
generator you're starting to produce
power at 8 miles per hour then you can
use a lot of other approaches you know
cord coils and whatnot arranged
differently and then your tension
changes so but in general that is
probably a true statement you can also
change the aerodynamics of the belt
itself right I mean just like a wing is
different than a flat piece of paper we
need want to do the same thing have you
guys have grief invested that like has
been on the radar for a few years this
has been in development for about four
years you know yeah there's a self
tensioning guitar that I
and telling me about so you know that's
but designing a different sort of
airfoil which is I think what you're
asking
having the membrane have that sort of
different cross section it's definitely
an area I think that means that we're
going to investigate and I think some
other folks once this catches on will
investigate as well are you sticking
with a mylar material for your other
experiments or do we fool around the
thing is it's very much in an Edison
mode right now where it's very empirical
everything's empirically determined
because this phenomenon even though it
appears simple is extremely difficult to
model so there's still debate actually
about why the Tacoma Narrows Bridge got
ripped apart if you can believe it but
it's extremely hard to model so we just
have to try a lot of things and that's
why I think doing this experimenting
Guatemala is a way that we can actually
be able to tap a wider range of fields
and get the landscape clear more quickly
and know this scale
for this particular scale and this
arrangement of coils this is what I
found to work the best and if you
diverge from that even a millimeter it
changes the dynamics a lot a millimeter
is pretty big but everything's handmade
so everything is within a millimeter to
what extent or do you know
does the smoothness and the surface
composition of the fluttering material
interact with the frequency on that so
this mylar is probably pretty smooth
right but I should I would imagine that
that the same geometry with a different
surface texture will follow lead a
different
on the top where the mylar is coating
the taffeta so different materials do
perform differently and we haven't
quantified we don't have a we don't
exactly know why that is so I mean you
just you get different flows along you
know very very smooth material you're
gonna get more drag than you would get
for kind of a very like with kind of
micro bumps so all of these things have
to come into play what's important to
realize is even though I think this
development can happen on a rapid scale
turbines have been in development for a
hundred years the hope is that this can
be you know an order of magnitude less
development time than that but it's
still crawling out of the water onto
land
so all most of these questions are
unanswered and the reason for the talk
is to kind of get those questions going
and get people thinking how how's the
time
am i interrupting another talk you've
seen these turbines that usually
vertical and they Spencer this way and
there the advantage is that if the wind
changes comes from any direction is
still work now if you have these things
wouldn't you want to make it movable so
to crack the wind and it seems to me to
be a crossover point where if you see
there's got to be a crossover point
where if you scale this up to some
number of watts right and then you look
at one of those small micro small
turbines like the vertical spinning
whole thing with that in mind
what's pretty possible point here that
might start to look yeah you know again
it's it's not only the it's all about
the cost to me because it doesn't you
know if you're out in the field
somewhere it's that this could come this
particular generator can't take flow
from both directions but the larger
scale generators can take flow from both
directions so you would get address if
you didn't have two coils perpendicular
you would have to have some sort of
rotating system but conceivably but if
the systems are so cheap to make adding
that you know bearing and ability to
rotate on the small scale you know the
10 watt scale I believe is going to be
more expensive than having two belts
however there is going to be this
crossover where it becomes it makes more
sense to invest in that sort of that
sort of system vein system I think
you're an excellent can you say a little
bit about where the where the cost
breakdown is you know what fraction is
the mag
oh yeah on this scale each magnet cost
about five cents quantity the coils not
wound but you know the cost of the
copper in the coils in wire form it's
around 30 cents each roughly this would
be made out of some sort of you know
probably uh ABS or glass filled
polyethylene and for this much of that
material it's less than a dollar in
quantity and then the material itself is
probably a penny I mean I this is some
of the material here and you can buy it
in rolls so the only the part of the
system that could break is actually the
least costly so that's I think a good
way to do is design a system
particularly for environments where you
can replace that component that scale
it's actually very easy to adjust for
direction you just have to have a fit on
the end that sticks out and hang it from
the wire yes I mean it's very simple
yeah I think people are gonna do that
that option conceivably yeah thank you
all right
I mean finally works for I mean it even
it'll work for a wind turbine too but
the problem there is you know where you
have to build a stronger structure to
handle the drag that is forcing back
that funneling with this system one of
the advantages is that you don't have a
big spinning dangerous mass so I I don't
have anything against turbines at all I
think you know people should get them
and I'm glad they're working on the
large scale but you do have a rotating
mass which you have to account for when
you build the structure that that
turbines on whereas in this your mass is
you know very very very small the most
massive part is close to the base so you
know you can have a bamboo pole a thin
piece of bamboo that holds up this
system as opposed to a proper Tower you
would need for alternatives and adding a
funnel kind of reduces that benefit
however I'm sure people are going to
look at it I mean you're getting
powerful moving parts right oh yeah it's
definitely it's a function of the
frequency you know roughly the mass
because the mass affects the the field
produced by a permanent magnet and the
area that you know that field can
influence and those three factors like
any generator that's what determines how
much output you get so what we're
looking at is kind of how to focus in an
area of wind to make those magnets move
which is the challenge for all
generators and if you do channel a
little bit of wind you can get a slight
venturi effect so you'll get a little
bit better efficiency out of less wind
no I think that so there's a vast you
know that idea
I think there's vast improvements to be
made and I'm excited to see how fast
this technology develops</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
