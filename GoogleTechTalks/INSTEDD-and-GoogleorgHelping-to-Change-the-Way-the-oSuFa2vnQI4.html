you does anybody have to leave
particularly early because the last
slide is a slide is sort of okay you
know what does this mean to you and how
can you get involved so instead is the
first spin-off of google.org and for
those of you who don't know google.org
is the basically the charitable
operation of google.com and it has a
current asset base of about two billion
dollars that the founders set up to
pursue charitable activities and one of
the charitable activities that they
elected to get involved with was being
the founding grand tour for an
organization that will talk about today
called instead and we subsequently
receive support from a broad range of
other organizations but Google is our
original sponsor and the institution to
which we owe our existence what we want
to do with instead is to basically bring
the information age to bear on the
problems of disaster response around the
world and you're bright audience I'm not
going to spend my time reading what's on
the slides just glance through them
you'll get some feel for the kinds of
things that we hope to do most disaster
sations and and damn this appropriate
example of this are compulsive
individuals who are incredibly dedicated
to trying to reach out to people in the
world who through no fault of their own
find themselves in the midst of calamity
the difficulty is that disaster
organizations are organizations which
have a very episodic demand for their
services as a consequence they typically
are under-resourced and only when a
disaster occurs is everybody's sort of
say okay how can we help and and then
it's too late because when the people go
out the door to deal with the disaster
they don't have time to get connected
with the people who want to help you are
in a company that is immersed in
technology and you take technology for
granted most of the people in disaster
community are operating probably 10 to
20 years behind where you are when you
go back to your desk today and that's
just the nature of the business which is
also frequently compounded by the fact
that in a disaster setting frequently
access to communications is usually
degraded if not totally eliminated so
instead mission is to try to be a
facilitator to work with all the
disaster organizations in the world and
to give them better tools so that they
can be more efficient and more more
efficient and more effective in the
things that they have chosen to do and
there are literally tens of thousands of
organizations around the world who
perceived their mission being some form
of disaster response that disaster
recovery some of them are large
organizations like UNICEF others are
very small organizations and when a
disaster occurs frequently many of these
organizations will all show up at the
same place at the same time in an
incredibly uncor de nated but incredibly
well-meaning fashion and so what we hope
to do is to be a totally independent
entity independent of any company any
government any other institution and to
try to bring together all the tools for
the technology community has to offer to
help the people
are in fact responding to disasters
around the world and hopefully in the
process of doing that one of the things
we'll also do is increase the
probability that these organizations
will work more effectively together
because they'll be using the same tools
communicating the same way now the range
of disasters that we're looking at
infectious diseases man-made physical
disasters famine human rights abuses and
natural disasters and for each one of
those four categories the prevention
preparedness mitigation phase which is
the thing that you try to do ahead of
time to make sure that we as a world or
better prepared typically this function
is dramatically underfunded and we don't
do nearly as much as we should in terms
of prevention preparedness or mitigation
surveillance we do surveillance
reasonably well with infectious diseases
we don't do surveillance very well for
most of the other things that are listed
here there is in fact a famine watch
system that does a reasonably good job
we're getting a little bit better at
predicting things like earthquakes and
tsunamis that result is a consequence of
earthquakes we don't do nearly as well
with respect to human rights abuses in
fact most people would not normally
categorize those as disasters we as
human beings tend to think when an
airplane crashes and 300 people get
killed that's a disaster and yet in the
same hour that that airplane crashed
with 300 people there were many more
people killed around the world by
disease by famine by human rights abuses
and yet the human mind tends to focus in
and say well if it doesn't happen in a
split second at one point in time it's
not a disaster we have tried to define
the definition of disaster so much more
broadly than that so that's why we
include things like human rights abuses
in famine what were what were in the
process of doing working with companies
like Google and we'll talk about some of
our other technology partners it's
finding the best tools that you have and
making those tools freely
available to the disaster community not
only freely available to them but also
working with them to help them in the
adoption of those tools so we perceive
ourselves as facilitating the interface
between technology and human needs and
in crisis most of our original tools by
virtue of our birthplace being Google
our Google Apps was with which many of
you in this room are familiar and we are
in the process of doing something very
analogous to Google for educators which
is basically Google for disaster
responders and we're taking the tools
that exist here and I apologize for this
slide it's probably the toughest one to
read you won't have any more like that
but we're taking all the different tools
that Google has and we're trying to
package them together customize them so
that they meet the needs of the disaster
community and then making them freely
available to that entire community with
strong support from google one of the
things that we've been spending a lot of
time on the last five or six months is
talking to the customer making sure we
understand what their needs are and it's
been eye-opening because when you talk
to people who are actually in this
business on a day-to-day basis you begin
to realize what an incredible
opportunity advanced technology brings
to the table but you're also incredibly
impressed with what these people do many
of them without the kinds of tools that
you and I take for granted on our
everyday basis so we have six and
show projects the consultation which I
just described the tools in technology
which is basically what we talking about
developing a toolkit and with Google
being the main supplier but IBM and a
number of other organizations coming on
board I'll talk a little bit later in
this presentation about one of our
partners which is NASA and NASA is doing
some very exciting things with us and
with Google but having tools doesn't
mean anything unless you can demonstrate
that they work and so we have chosen
three test sites around the world one of
them is right here in New York City and
it's the one that down operates which is
the 24 hour emergency operation center
of UNICEF and we walk into that room you
see the tools that they have and you
realize that here's an incredible
opportunity for us to bring modern
information technology and high-speed
connections and all sorts of other kinds
of things in to facilitate them doing
the job that they do the second test
site we've chosen for a couple of
reasons one of which is its physical
proximity the second because it is a an
activity which if it's successful can be
easily replicated is we're working with
one of the 28 national urban search and
rescue teams the one happens to be
located in menlo park california quite
close to both the Mountain View campus
and instead headquarters in Palo Alto in
that urban search and rescue team is
that one of the teams that came here to
New York City for the World Trade Center
they went to Oklahoma City they went to
Katrina they were responsible for the
recovery of the Columbia astronauts in
each of these cases they went out the
door with road maps from triple-a they
had no basically high technology the
people at Google during Katrina were
pumping incredible imagery out the door
and it went down to a desk in Louisiana
and sat on the desk because nobody had
made the connection between the people
who are providing that invaluable
information and people are actually in
the field doing the work
and when we first introduced the people
from Menlo Park to the people from
google there was great sadness because
the people at Google said well we send
all the stuff to you and the people at
minimal Park said that we never got it
and nothing happens in a disaster
situation that hasn't been pretty well
thought through ahead of time the people
who go out the door go out the door with
the tools they have if somebody else
shows up and says I've got something
great for you to say look we don't have
time for great things right now we've
got a job to do and so there's a big
disconnect there and so that's one of
the challenges that we face in project
three and we'll come back at the very
end and talk about how those of you who
want to might get involved in project
three in general and particularly
getting involved in what we're doing
here with UNICEF and Dan and his team
project for is one of the efforts that
we're undertaking in the preparedness
mitigation area there's a reasonably
good chance probably a higher chance now
than any time in the last 20 or 30 years
that the world will see a pandemic flu
situation much like 1918 if that occurs
it will change the way that you and I
live it will overwhelm the health care
system not only of this country but of
every country in the world and one of
the things that will happen is that you
and I as individuals will be responsible
for taking care of ourselves on our
families without recourse to 911 without
recourse to doctors without recourse to
hospitals and we just made a decision
that one of the things that we would do
is create a online manual that any
citizen could use to figure out how they
take care of themselves and their family
in these circumstances and that will be
finished and published online on the
first of july of this year a federation
is being created of the technology
partners and the disaster responders to
come together to identify opportunities
for collaboration and needs and then a
situational awareness project one of the
things that we don't do particularly
well because we tend to look at
disasters as disjointed little things
that happen all
themselves we don't have a good overview
of what's happening around the world and
one of the most powerful tools for human
beings is to help visualize that thing
things like that are things like Google
Maps and Google Earth now when you can
just imagine the world where every
single hotspot is now shows up on on the
Google Earth presentation and you can
look at a famine overlay you can look at
a natural disaster overlay you can look
at a human rights abuse over line and
you can begin to get some sense of
really what's happening in the world not
just simply on by what you see on CNN
but by having hopefully raw data from
the point of the disaster being
transmitted and posted in such a way
that has all that information aggregates
we really get a good feel for what's
happening around the world we won't
spend any time on this these are the
team members so I'm one of the five
directors of instead I agreed to serve
in that capacity on with the
understanding that it was a one board
meeting a quarter and shortly thereafter
my colleagues said well gee Peter we
need somebody to run this organization
and I'm not spending about five hours a
day as a unpaid volunteer as the
president of instead which I hope is
going to be a temporary role certainly
my wife does and we also have some
people from the google.org organization
who work directly with us and spend
about half of their time each of the
three people listed there and these are
the organizations the response
organizations that we're dealing with
the donors and the technology providers
that we are beginning to collaborate
with in order to accomplish this mission
and one of them you'll see here is NASA
Ames and I've chosen that just simply as
an illustration and I apologize for this
slide it got a bit scrunched up but what
NASA Ames is trying to do these are the
people who basically are responsible for
running deep space missions
and so the route you know the people
that we deal with at NASA Ames are the
people in charge of robotics and it
seems like a sort of a strange thing but
these are people that are really very
good at trying to get information from a
distance and presenting that information
so that you can make decisions about it
and so they're taking the technology
that's been developed for the space
program and they're saying how can we
apply this technology to disastrous here
on on the face of the earth and what
they what they're doing is they're using
a lot of stuff KML overlays with google
earth etc to look at things like
landslides and Katrina and things like
that so that people now have really good
real-time information instead of sending
our people to Katrina with triple-a maps
we're setting it up now where there'll
be an immediate download once the alert
comes in so all of the laptops are the
people who are going out the door of all
the information it's available in Google
Earth and then we will begin to do
overlays so that they have contemporary
Gnaeus information it's updated over six
hours or 12 hours or 24 hours rather
than instantaneously because we're not
presuming that they'll have internet
connectivity so we'll have to do local
Wi-Fi kinds of things in order to reach
that last mile which in a disaster
situation is a very big challenge this
is a fascinating project that NASA Ames
is working on that sort of illustrates
the way that you can take modern
technology and bring it to bear on a
very real problem what you see here is
an all tear which is the NASA version of
what the military calls a predator very
long station-keeping time and the
strange thing about it is if you look
closely you'll see underneath it a pod
which has on the side of it the logo of
the u.s. Forest Service and what we've
done with this machine is we actually
took it to Southern California during
the fire season last year and we used it
to do real-time imagery of a very large
forest fire that was in an urban
wildland interface
and threatening a large number of homes
and a lot of people and what we were
able to do is to use the alt air in it
shows you the over flight patterns and
that was able to give the people on the
ground real-time imagery in terms of
what was happening because they were
operating with the number of different
portions of the of the spectrum so they
had infrared they had visual etc so they
could define where the hotspots were
they could define where the fire was
burning the fastest etc and that
information was pumped down with about a
three minute delay between the time it
was taken and made available to the
people on the ground dramatically
different real-time information than we
had in any of the disasters that I've
described to you so instead content
collaboration communication early
detection response a facilitator
independent source of information and
now we get to you folks what can you do
to make a difference in the instead
world well one of the things you can do
is you can become a Google volunteer
involved in some of these projects that
I've described another thing that those
of you particularly who on the
engineering side is recognizing as you
develop and I'm constantly amazed every
time I pick up the newspaper that
there's a new thing from google you know
my maps whatever it is they're just
amazing the productivity of the
organization at your part of but as new
apps come along ask yourself well might
this be something that we should put
into the instead toolkit you know would
this help the people who are who we look
to around the world to respond to
disasters also help us identify
technology providers as you interface
with other institutions and you see that
they have tools that might be useful to
the instead toolkit make sure that we're
aware of them and basically do the
introduction so that we can put more and
more things in this toolkit and identify
disaster responder organizations that
should be in the instead Federation
I am just stunned as we continue to talk
to people every single day there's
another organization that I've never
heard of before it's doing really
interesting exciting disaster work tends
to be very fragmented community there
are some big things like like UNICEF and
there's some big things like their world
health organization but they're just
literally tens of thousands of very
small organizations that are very
specialized one of the people we have
running project three Deepak Basu was
the founder of an organization called
net hope what net hope did was took a
bunch of technology companies and they
created a suitcase sighs internet
connection that you can take any place
in the world has a satellite antenna and
you you can create internet and
connectivity in a disaster situation
problem with it's a really low bandwidth
and its really expensive because you get
charged by the by the data bit but it
doesn't it begins to give us the ability
to go to a disaster situation any place
in the world open up the net hope begin
is what the roots called you open up the
suitcase oriented towards the satellite
and you have very limited but you do
have real-time connectivity so that's
the story of instead and Dan's here what
I love to do at this point is just
questions answers do any of you have any
particular ideas that you'd like to
share any questions about what I said
start in the back move forward would
love to see it more about how you have
stands working UNICEF the needs are
great here in New York and he listened
to talk as one of the connection gives
you the mind can
thanks um I'm kind of mr. disaster at
UNICEF there we have about a 2.7 billion
dollar prot program globally and about
as Peter said 40 foot five percent of
that goes for emergencies so it's over a
billion dollars a year we're in 150
countries we do about 350 to 400
emergencies a year from tsunami and
Solomon Islands last week to flooding in
Afghanistan and one of the points I
guess I would stress the Peter raised is
you hear about for example Solomon
Islands I hit the newspapers that hit
the press it was 20 people killed and
about 50,000 displaced this week alone
we had a hundred thousand displaced and
probably thirty four people killed in
Afghanistan from floods no press on it
no information on it because everyone's
focused on something else so it's a good
example of what he described of the
industry that focuses on the flavor of
the month if you will but the hot spot
that hits the news rather than the
ongoing and the big emergencies that are
that are ongoing every day our work
based here as videos that we have a 24
hour operations center it tracks the
world we have about eight people who
watch news in all different languages we
use Google Earth we use it also to
present to others in the organization
and elsewhere to say here's what's
happening and where we both track the
world and then trigger response and so
if I pick up on some of the points that
Peter raised what we need is is is less
what the typical person wants to give
which I literally this morning had a
woman screaming down the phone saying I
have shoes i want to give shoes I'd
frankly don't need shoes what I need are
better tools ahead of an emergency we
have some early warning systems we have
some preparedness kits we have school in
a box that we can transport out I need
that stuff before an emergency i don't
need shoes packed individually etc or
blankets that someone wants to give what
that are a hundred or a thousand
pakistan earthquake we needed a million
blankets so a few in santa barbara or me
city doesn't help me very much so I
think the things that you can do with us
really are to look at what are the tools
that we can use to track better we're
using things like if you go on the web
you'll see fuse the famine early warning
system of fao you'll see other types of
early warning we're trying to pull those
together it is a disjointed industry
because it's kind of let a thousand
flowers bloom approach except they're
blooming in 150 countries one of the big
changes which which peter outlined if I
look back 10 years ago I was the UNICEF
representative in r1 after the the
genocide there and we had some big
international NGOs we had a few national
and local NGOs if I then fast forward to
the tsunami in Aceh alone we had 450
NGOs working some very skilled some not
skilled and I think the industry needs
some better targeting on what we do some
better tools that are accepted across
the board and we need a better
integration of some of the stuff that
you do as a business which is the the
high-tech capacity to analyze synthesize
report and pull those pieces of
informations together I think that's
where some of the partnership is pretty
exciting for us here in New York we work
at a global level obviously I do a lot
of speaking but I do a lot of meetings
convincing people that for example Iraq
is actually going downhill much faster
than even you see on television and what
we need to do to prepare for that
because it's going to happen trying to
convince governments like Bangladesh or
India or Nepal that you know please
don't come knocking on my door to say
you're surprised by flooding this year
it happens every year we should actually
be prepared we should have people ready
we should have rosters of people to
respond both nationally and
internationally for that kind of context
and that's where I think some of those
things where was on the early warning as
well as the preparedness side and the
pre positioning side technology could
help us quite a lot so happy to answer
questions on specific emergencies or
other things but that's kind of a quick
overshot you had a question
all of us are engineers here and what
other types of actual and volunteer
involvement good question i don't have a
quick answer to that one in in big
emergencies we do need volunteers and we
need volunteers to man phone lines it's
it's not the sexy stuff the stuff that
happens in country we need doctors we
need water engineers we need
nutritionists and so if you have those
skills there may be opportunities to
deploy you in those kinds of emergencies
but there's a lot of background work
that happens in most cases in very big
emergencies so it's the tsunami it's
Darfur it's Afghanistan or Iraq smaller
emergencies the advantage of a place
like UNICEF because we are big and
global we have offices 150 countries and
so our job is to upgrade those offices
when something is about to happen or in
a pinch after it's happened and there
may be opportunities for that but I
would be honest instead have to get back
to you if I know more the skills that
skill set that you have because I would
also be honest and say we don't just
need anybody part of the problem in the
tsunami was we had too many people who
were had great intentions but didn't
necessarily have the skill sets we
needed a woman actually came up to me
with a suitcase full of teddy bears and
said anoche and said I want to help why
won't you hire me I didn't need 35 teddy
bears and nacho and so it is a question
of making sure that we're talking ahead
of time what are your skill sets what
can you bring and how do we match that
and one of the things that Google's
exploring and I can't speak for them but
I can speak about what imma weather
doing I had a program which was
originally called Google pioneers and
now it's going to be relabeled but it
basically where groups of Google people
would go overseas on a project basis and
one of the things that you saw in my
matrix was the recovery phase it's
important to realize that
people think that this tsunami is
something that happened over a year ago
more than half the people who lost their
homes that tsunami are still homeless
and yet it's off of our radar screen is
it yeah and so one of the things that I
think Google might well think about is
as an institution has incredible social
commitment now what about putting
together teams of people who are well
organized who are well disciplined who
would go in to a recovery period in into
a location in the recovery period and
make things happen the key to making
that work though is that you'd have to
organize it in such a way that you had a
sponsor like UNICEF that was able to say
to the people on the ground these people
are confident they are well trained they
are well-equipped and they can make a
difference you know they are not going
to show up with teddy bears they are
going to show up with the tools they
need to make a difference either to
build houses or to rebuild schools or
two or make a difference so for those of
you who are not on the engineering side
and want to get involved I would
encourage you to stimulate a discussion
internally about putting together a team
of people who could be responsive to Dan
and his colleagues when they had a
particular problem and who could be
quote certified ahead of time as being
confident and capable because one of the
real problems that we have in disastrous
is what we call convergent volunteers
and convergent volunteers are just a
nightmare a conversion volunteer is the
person who shows up with the teddy bears
or who says hey I'm a heart surgeon etc
you don't have time in a disaster to
figure out whether that person's our
heart surgeon you don't have time to
figure out what to do with somebody who
shows up and says I've got the answer to
your problems they may well have the
answer to your problems but you don't
have the time to sort that out so if
we're going to if Google for example
makes the decision that they want to
have a team of disaster responders or
disaster recovery people
need to organize that ahead of time they
need to assure its competence they need
to work with an organization like UNICEF
or the International Red Cross or some
mouse to establish a relationship so
that when the event occurs those lead
agencies know oh let's put a Google team
in there one of the things for example
we're doing in project three is we are
creating a mobile command post that can
go any place in the world that will have
the best connectivity it will basically
be a mobile information center that you
can put in any disaster in the world
that will have high bandwidth
connectivity and that will serve all of
the disaster organizations that are
there that might be a wonderful thing
for google to say hey will staff that
will provide the people that make that
thing work then we will train those
people ahead of time and we'll keep a
roster of people who need to go now the
reality of disaster response is disaster
response to be credible it has to be
twenty-four seven for example the urban
search and rescue team that I'm
responsible for we have to be able to
put 75 people out the door within four
hours to go any place in the world to be
self-sustaining for a week in order to
do that we have to have over 250 people
who are fully trained so that in that
four-hour window you can get the 75
people you need to send them out the
door so if Google for example said okay
we want to have a team a deployable team
of 20 people that would run an
Information Center you need to have 60
70 80 people who were trained and ready
to go so that when the call came in the
people who were counting on you move in
fact you'd be able to produce that
number of people yes
have some sort of communication in the
world that says you know these offices
are on alert so that we can know as
opposed to with a media focus on you
think it's the most important some sort
of list on your website because we need
a hundred fifty breast surgeons we need
these types of people right now in this
place bro so if you have any yes and no
UNICEF is also part of you that nations
and so when you read in the New York
Times the United Nations didn't do this
or they didn't do that you have to
understand that the United Nation is the
member states so sometimes when the
United Nations doesn't do something is
because for example the US stop it from
doing it and so on our website for
example there's very little that will be
politically sensitive we have intranet
so we have a and Peter Cena we have a
whole early warning early action system
that we share internally but publicly
it's okay to put up things like
hurricane is coming to the Caribbean and
it's likely to hit these these days you
can actually find that information on
lots of sites if I were to put up Iraq
is going to hell in a handbasket it's
really going to be at the bottom and
Cuba we're watching because Castro may
die and this this this may happen we
have some real problems so a lot of the
countries that i watch can't be on the
public site and be quote UNICEF's
estimate of what might happen so we are
talking now about for example putting up
which unfortunately have to be somewhat
sanitized versions of what we would call
our sitreps so whether it's sambhav way
north korea iraq afghanistan where we're
producing either weekly or monthly
situation reports of what's happening
right now we are actually looking to see
how we could put that up in a public way
we we have receptive take a bit out the
second part of the question on in terms
of people what we've tended to do rather
than say let's say we need 50 heart
surgeons or we we do not unlike what
peter has described we have what we call
standby arrangements and so we have
agreements with at the moment about
different organizations one in Australia
one in Sweden Norway India could
possibly have one here have one in UK
with the UK government saying here the
profiles of the kind of people we need
if you were willing to commit with this
kind of contract we would say you can be
part of the search capacity for
nutritionists for IT people we have a we
have an agreement with a group called
telecom cellphone chair which is it's
like Doctors Without Borders but these
are telecom people without borders and
and they are part of our search for
exactly some of the things that bagans
the the communications and IT capacity
and emergency so that's tended to be how
we've we've done it what we found is if
we say we need let's just say 50 water
engineers we get about 3,000 offers and
even just wading through that in
emergencies is pretty rough and so we've
used the standby agreements to to preset
who's cleared who's ready to go and
where can we call on for that expertise
so we do have that but it's sort of
standby ready to go partners which we
could could do for example with Google
grabs you got a question okay take the
biggest
Prince is the resource base you know we
tend as countries both the United States
and others to invest heavily in defense
we tend not to make the same kind of
investment in disaster preparedness and
response and disaster preparedness and
response is usually a very poor child
until the disaster occurs and then
everybody gets very excited but for
reasons that Dan and I both spoken to
that excitement at the time in the
disaster is very difficult to convert
into a meaningful response because it
hasn't been built in a way for example
it's not part of the his certified surge
capacity and so you can't just deal with
the fact that suddenly a hundred people
want to do something the the effort that
the people in Mountain View put into
providing data for to cover the Katrina
disaster was incredibly impressive they
basically set up a 24-7 operation they
worked with NASA they arranged to have
some special overflights done they
created all this information and they
shipped it down to Louisiana and it
never got to the people on the ground
because the people on the ground and the
people in Mountain View ahead of time
had not talked and said this is how you
know this is how we're going to just
circulate the information let me just
give you an example of how a trivial
thing has a profound impact California
task force three which is the task force
that I'm responsible for had the
responsibility for running the entire
water rescue operation in Katrina what
the urban search-and-rescue task forces
did years ago as they developed standard
standardized methodology when they
searched a building they marked the
front of the building with particular
information so people know it's been
searched what was found in that building
etc and so the next person that comes by
knows that that building doesn't need to
be searched again so here they are in at
Katrina and they're going up house by
house and marking the front of these
houses and then the next day someone
comes along
a helicopter can't see the front of the
house doesn't know where the house has
been searched or not put somebody on the
roof and searches the same house again
you know how wonderful it would have
been if everybody had a PDA with GPS
capability and they just entered that
information at the time they searched
the building and within 30 seconds that
went on to Google Earth and anybody who
is running in an airborne operation
could see what the seat the water based
operation had done and vice versa but
they had none of that capability we sent
these people out the out the door with
cell phones and satellite phones nothing
worked the cell phone system had
basically been degraded by the by the
floods and the satellite system was
totally tied up by the network's the
networks all showed up and they would
open up a channel on the satellite phone
system and they keep it open 24-7 there
were no channels left for the emergency
responders they had a self they had a
satellite phone that didn't work and so
you know those are the kinds of problems
you kind of solved ahead of time yeah
and if you don't solve them ahead of
time in the people in the field do what
they do was what they've got and one of
the real problems also is that the
disaster community is not a it's not a
community where culturally it's
acceptable to say I need this I need
that it's a group of people who are used
to operating under resource constrained
basis and so you have to talk to these
people for a long time before they say
well gee really would be nice if I could
have some water or some basic thing so
you have to push these people hard
because their attitude is look we signed
up to be in this business we're going to
go out the door with what we've got and
we don't spend a lot of our time
thinking about what we don't have and so
one of the dialogues that's taking place
in the consultation process is bringing
technology people together with
responders and you know you saw this
incredible operation that's been pulled
off by the NASA Ames people I mean
and you don't need a predator airborne
platform we had a meeting with the NASA
Ames people last week and they're now in
the process of creating a pod that can
be put on the bottom of a small
fixed-wing airplane or a helicopter and
basically we can take these pods and
give them to Dan or any place anybody
else and say hey take this any place in
the world put this on the bottom of an
airport airborne platform and the data
that's connected it's going to come down
it's going to be digitized photographs
or their GPS correlated and within 30
minutes we'll be able to put it up on a
on Google Earth and all you have to do
is just do a simple flyover and that
data will be collected and it will be
displayed if you ask a disaster
responder if they wanted that kind of
thing they'd sort of scratch their head
because there's no I've never had that
what do you mean but then you begin to
show them what we were able to do with
the Forest Service pod and it was
incredible because instead of the old
way of doing it is that you'd send out
each of the section bosses on the fire
line would do a physical map and
presented into the operation center and
people would then say ok this is the
this is where the fire lines were six
hours ago these are reports from our
section bosses and you had information
is typically six to twelve hours old and
suddenly we put them in situation where
they had information with three minutes
old it's totally you know totally
different world and dramatically
increase their ability to do their job
but it took technology people sitting
down with responders to say here's a
place where we can make a difference the
other point I'd raised how we are very
different from military and that's again
comes back this UN side we work with
governments a military operation
primarily goes in to take over and do
things and I think one of the the what
we see in most emergencies is that our
role is also to figure out how do we
help government do what it should be
doing better
whether it's Katrina we're units have
actually helped with some of the
education opportunities there or it's in
Afghanistan how do we make sure that the
government can provide education
services that it should be providing
anyway and in some countries they can't
for resource reasons and others they
can't for access reasons and so we're
not a foreign occupying set of people
where we're actually they're figuring
out if the Ministry of Health is to run
the clinics the way it should it may
mean that MSF for Oxfam or somebody else
has to run them for a couple of weeks
but the goal is to get the government to
be doing it again or be get private
sector to do it again and actually have
it be a self-sustaining system so that's
a big difference from sort of a military
force that would go in and do it and
leave and the other difference with the
military is that they tend to have
pretty much total control of a situation
in most of the disaster situations that
dan and I are familiar with no one has
total control it's almost chaos a good
example is Oklahoma City when the
bombing occurred there that was a
federal building on federal property it
was very easy to determine who was in
charge it was a whole new ballgame when
the World Trade Center occurred because
then you had the city of New York the
state of New York the federal government
the lines of command and control were
incredibly screwed up our guys showed up
as part of one of the many urban search
and rescue teams that came to New York
City and basically could not establish
any degree of rapport with local people
because they were perceived as being
outsiders because they were these FEMA
uniforms and so the first night did they
got here they said hey send us Menlo
Park Fire Department t-shirts they put
this on the next day totally different
attitude they were firefighters and
totally accepted by their new york
brethren interesting little cultural
thing and so those
the kind of issues that you face in a
disaster situation you have to be
incredibly sensitive to local culture
you have to recognize that what people
need and what you think they need are
sometimes very different it's one of the
reasons why it's really important that
the people you put in on the scene or
people who are who are properly
certified from properly trained one of
the real challenges are not chained was
that you had so many people there who
really had no business being there and
they became a resource deplete her
rather than a resource provider programs
educational or training or you know this
kind of service how to program to help
harness that man how is it exists I mean
I feel like especially nowadays well in
my generation really do find this you
know want to have the specific give back
one of you did not just write a check so
what kind of steps can we take to not
only become better educated ourselves
create programs that help to train
others like us and to do that aside from
the one you mentioned who both but just
in general there's such a big population
of people and it's nothing worse than
turning white people who want to help
when obviously they have something to
give but if they could be trained or
taught or figured out the best we use
them it can benefit everybody so it's
kind of impossible not well the
challenge that you did you raise is that
how do you marry that desire to make a
difference with the ability to present
yourself to the disaster manager as an
asset rather than a liability and my
many years of being involved in this i
began my life as a smokejumper for the
Forest Service literally jumping out of
airplanes putting up forest fires
and the only way that that kind of thing
works well is you have to have it
organized and you have to have a trained
in individual people who want to make a
difference by and large are a handicap
rather than an asset in a disaster
situation so I would say to you and to
other people who want to make a
difference what you need to try to do is
find a way to organize ahead of time
either in a corporate setting or in a
neighborhood setting so that you become
a known dependable certified resource
that other people can call upon on the
first of July for example when we post
this citizens training manual for
pandemics one of the things that you can
do as an individual is to take that
training manual and say okay I'm going
to work with my neighbors and I'm going
to create the ability for our
neighborhood to take care of itself
because if we have a pandemic you are
going to be on your own the world as we
know it is going to change we've run the
numbers in California we're going to
need 14 times the number of hospital
beds that we have well that isn't going
to happen and if you don't have 14 times
the number of hospital beds what's going
to happen it means that individuals and
families and neighborhoods are going to
have to take care of themselves and it
gets a bit grim because you know we have
a wonderful system in our country of
getting rid of dead bodies when was the
last time you ever saw a dead body being
moved from the place where the person
died it happens very nicely discreetly
if we have a pandemic that's not going
to occur one of the things you're going
to have to learn to deal with in your
community and your family in your
neighborhood is what do you do with dead
bodies because there's not going to be
somebody to come pick them up so if you
as an individual want to make a
difference in a disaster situation I
think you have to find a way to get
involved in an institution or create an
institution which is incredible and
certifiable and has a relationship with
someone like UNICEF the Red Cross etc
who is responsible for
responding in these disasters and you
become part of their surge capability I
guess I would add that it's also about
skills if I came to you and said I'd
really love to help at Google can I
volunteer three days a week you'd say
but when you're kind of old and to you
don't have a skill set and in disaster
prevention disaster response as dis
organizes as it is it looks and is it
sometimes is it is a business and so for
example my niece who wants to be
involved I've said to her one of the
things we need more of our people in
UNICEF are people who are specialists on
child protection how do you find kids
who've lost their parents and emergency
how do you help kids who've seen their
parents killed or their house burned
down how do you get kids out of the
military when they've been recruited
that's an area that is absolutely a
growth industry we don't have enough
people it's a new area and we need more
people who know it who have experience
in etc so there are some areas in the
business of disaster response where
there are opportunities if you're really
interested in going deeper and it
probably means doing a master's degree
or going out and getting some volunteer
experience overseas it's not just
something you can say I want to help and
so I guess I would say don't belittle
the we asked you for money because
without the money we can do it and that
is a tremendous contribution and the
second thing I would say is don't stop
your interest no talk to your friends
talk to about dinner or go to two films
and then and keep interested and get
other people interested the biggest
frustration I have living here in the US
having lived very long time overseas is
one of the most common questions I get
is house afrika how's the moon house you
know how do I respond to that that's
actually the wrong question to ask to
even start a conversation and so help
people figure out what are some of the
right conversations by reading more
talking to people going to lectures
whatever if that really is one of your
interests or if you're truly truly
interested you know do a master's degree
and whether it's business administration
because you want to do logistics and
finance and whatever or its child
protection or its refugee law there are
lots of different areas if you want to
go further than that you know again I
think I'd pick up on the point that Dan
makes about expertise and I think one of
the things that is most useful to the
disaster responder managers is having
groups of people who have very
well-defined certified skill sets
Doctors Without Borders as an example
the IT Without Borders is another
example this organization in San
Francisco that we're collaborating with
called the frist Institute and they
specialize in logistics I'm meeting with
them next week and one of the things
that I want to explore with them is can
we create surge capacity within
corporations we're Dan and his
colleagues say gee we need a logistics
team in country X send us a team of
people who can basically run the
logistics for this operation and these
are people who really are experienced in
doing that kind of thing and so they go
on the ground and they have the tools
and and their self contained and they're
not a depletion of resources but they in
fact help solve the problems and create
the problem so I think what you want to
do is you want to build around
institutional capabilities and you'll
want to recognize that the disaster
managers are interested in as Dan
emphasizes a capability and individuals
are very hard to manage in a disaster
situation it's just very inefficient if
you have to manage 50 independent
individuals much better to be able to
say okay this is a team of 50 people who
are self-contained self-organized we
know how they operate we know what their
skills are and we only have to deal with
the team leader and we can give them the
sign
minton off cycle and we know they're
gonna do the job right just just as
maybe a final concrete example of that
UNICEF is constantly moving millions of
tons of blankets and medical kits and
school supplies I just find it ironic
that every time we have an emergency I
have to find logistics teams and I have
a few around the world etc and we do
that for this emergency and yet I know
there's Unilever and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble
and DHL and all these other companies
that do that for profit and do it
exceedingly well and I keep wondering
why can't we figure this one out why am
I hiring all these people and I'd come
back to you I'm also trying to make sure
that we have communications and the
right kind of early warning and
prevention on the IT front and so I'm
kind of hiring in and trying to beg
borrow and steal in yet that's your
company's business and you do it
incredibly well so what I'm actually
more interested will I come to Google at
some point so you know I need your money
probably a mile so my job is fundraising
but what I'm what I'm really interested
in is how do we harness what is your
core business for different kinds of
purposes and that's where I think this
is an exciting partnership so other
questions and thank you so much for sort
of sticking with it we've gone a little
bit longer than the hour and megan has
my contact information those of you who
would like to be involved let her know
and she'll get you in touch with us
either danner myself and remember what
was on that last slide you know
basically there are lots of things you
can do you can get involved as an
individual but you need to find some
sort of structure to do that if you're
working on Google Apps constantly ask
yourself is there some way in which this
application can be useful and meaningful
to the disaster community and if so push
it to the instead team to make sure that
we included in the toolkit if you're
aware of other technology providers that
you think bring something important to
the table make sure we know who
are and if you're involved with any
organizations that you think could
profit from these kinds of things again
you know connect us to them so thank you
very much dan thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
