welcome to the open source developers at
Google speaker series this evening we
are privileged to have with us Michael
still who is a mythtv developer in
addition to his responsibilities at
Google as a site reliability engineer
and tonight Michael will be presenting
on practical mythtv Michael take away
thank you so my microphone works right
oh honey um okay so I thought I'd just
quickly start off by saying Who I am and
what I do here so I'm here because I
happen to write a book on mythtv turns
out there's a couple of other books on
the subject so you know kind of whatever
and I'm a site reliability engineer here
at Google which means I'm some sort of
combination of a software engineer and a
Linux system admin I happen to work on
our the clusters that you know run
Google's publicly visible product
products yeah not really well that
relevant so I thought tonight what we do
is I'll introduce mythtv breathe briefly
I'll talk about some of the stuff it
does in the currently released version
then I'll talk about you know how you
set up set up some of it and you know
how you get going that kind of thing and
then I wanted to finish off by talking
about some of the features that are
coming up in the next release because
there's some reasonably cool stuff there
so let's get started so mythtv is an
open-source PVR package which means it's
a lot like say a TiVo or you know
there's a bunch of open-source PVR's it
turns out sage and a couple of others
and what that means is it will record TV
off of the air and you can play it back
later whenever you want it's got all the
standard PVR features like rewind fast
forward causing live TV that kind of
stuff it's got a couple of unique
features that you wouldn't see and say a
TiVo like it can automatically skip
commercials it's got a web interface
that lets you stream videos wherever
that kind of thing so it's pretty cool
ah ok so the question question is is
there a rationale for the name mythtv
and what I should probably say is the
other the other thing is feel free to
interrupt and ask questions because
otherwise this will get really boring
it's a reference to the mythical
convergence pc so i think it was you
know back in the 90s people were talking
about how you know your lounge room
would living room or whatever would
become one machine and that machine
would do everything this was considered
a bit of a myth mythtv is that machine
it yo plays videos it plays dvds it will
you know deal with you know streaming
audio and pre-recorded audio it does all
of that kind of stuff in fact one of the
things I'll talk about later is the next
release will integrate with home
security systems and you can have closed
circuit video cameras around your house
and have those pop up as a picture in
picture display that kind of thing so
it's a reference to this mythical
convergence pc that people were talking
about a while ago so i think i've
mentioned that you know you can record
and playback TV you know you can do
audio and dvds and that kind of thing as
well another cool thing about mythtv is
it has a really strong plug-in system so
in the user interface it's not always
obvious which bits are built in and
which bits are plugins and it's actually
relatively easy to write new plugins so
for example there's a weather plugin
that will tell you you know based on
weather comdata what the weather is like
at the moment that's just a plug-in so
if you don't like how it works or if you
think of something that you want to do
with myth it's reasonably easy to write
new ones so I thought what I do is I'd
start off by having a poke around in
myth and seeing and showing you what it
looks like catch of course is I have
like six machines here so hopefully this
will just work unless the screens off
okay so mythtv has two major components
there's a back end and a front end so if
we just start up the back end I'll
explain a little bit more what the back
end in the front end are in a minute
we'll ignore the message saying have you
really read the installation
instructions and then there's the front
end now the other thing I should say is
what I'm demonstrating here is the
latest development release in fact the
latest from two days ago so if it
crashes that's not actually indication
of the stability of the real release of
myth they've at the moment this is still
tiny bit flaky but it's got some cool
stuff I want to show you so mythtv has a
theme system so this it just happens to
be the theme a run at home you can pick
whatever you want and in fact it's also
reasonably easy to define your own
themes if none of them take your fancy
media library is where you go to watch
pre-recorded video so recordings are
things that came off of live TV so you
know your comcast cable or your dish TV
or you know free-to-air TV or whatever
videos are video files that came from
somewhere else for instance videos of
you kids running around the park that
came off a handycam or you know ripped
dvds that kind of thing an image gallery
is kind of what it sounds like play
games is interesting you can run classic
arcade games on myth because it
integrates with name and this is the
screen that shows you all the recordings
you have so what I want to do is I'm
just going to play a random recording
so this is actually a news report which
is why it's in black and white because
it's talking about some stuff that came
out of the Australian archives recently
you can skip ahead and back now the
video here is blocking because this is a
downloaded video in avi format and it's
waiting for a keyframe before it will
correct and the user interface is
walking because it's matched the
resolution of the video number still
want to show you here that's the other
thing I wanted to show you that I kind
of missed there let's play a different
video for a second so one of the things
you can do is if you're playing and you
skip along and you have to walk away for
some reason then myth will optionally
ask you whether or not you want to save
where you're up to so if I select that
when i come back and watch that show it
will start up from that point again okay
so let's talk a little bit about myth
itself yep I've got a switchback so as I
mentioned before mythtv has two major
components there's a back end and a
front and the back end is responsible
for capture stuff so it's the thing
that's controlling the tuner cards and
making sure that all your shows get
recorded it's also the part that talks
to a sequel database that records what
recordings you want at what time you
know you your preferences you can say
for instance that the simpsons is more
important than you know the family guy
and only get the same family guy if you
know you've got an idol tuner that kind
of thing and then you have front ends
and front ends are the way that video
gets displayed around the house so it
means for instance that you can have
more than one back end if you know
heaven forbid you had so many tuners
they didn't all fit in one machine or
you know there's physical constraints
like you know you've got your dish TV in
one place and then you've got your
comcast in a different place you can run
two machines in different spots with
different capture cards and the front
and multiple front ends means you can be
playing back more than one video at once
so for instance at home I have four or
five front ends there's the one in the
living room the kids have one in their
bedrooms you know the laptops having and
that kind of thing so it's trivial to be
watching something in the living room
and watching something completely
different on a laptop somewhere else in
the house so the data is stored in two
places there's a my sequel database for
all them
data like program guides and what's been
recorded previously and your preferences
and that kind of thing and then there's
just a bunch of desk where you store
recordings that also includes things
like the videos you've downloaded and
you know mp3 files and that kind of
thing now the just a bunch of desk there
are a couple of caveats I use ext3 the
xt3 is not particularly efficient to
deleting large files so every time I
delete a recording there's a couple of
second pause there is an option you can
turn on that says hey delete these
things in the background but you'll
still experience a slight pause the
co-author for the book Stewart uses XFS
which is extents based which means it's
much faster at deleting large files ext4
will improve in this regard to but then
again you know it's true it's a little
bit biased because he worked on the team
that wrote XFS so I also said you can
playback DVDs with myth now it used to
be that what you'd use is an external
player and that still works excuse me
one second now the external players are
just command lines that get run when you
say hey please play a DVD so people in
the past would use E&amp;amp;M player and that
kind of thing now it's still possible to
do that if you have some special
requirement like neo DVDs in a weird
format that myth can't support or
whatever but these days you're probably
generally best off just using the
internal player the internal player is
based off in player and it's much nicer
than it used to be even one release ago
it wasn't particularly reliable yes yes
we'll get to that in a second it's much
nicer than it used to be in the previous
release for instance DVDs mean menus
didn't work now they just do and the
advantage of using the internal player
is all the remote control stuff maps
properly so one of the problems was that
you know mplayer didn't support menus
back back then I think it might now zeen
had different keyboard layouts all the
key controls would change if you're
playing a DVD if you use the internal
player than everything is consistent and
it just works and I think I've kind of
said all of that uh yeah an encrypted
dvds work although you have to install
lib dee dee dee CSS which depending on
your distribution may or may not be
shipped you might need to you know
download it separately and install it so
i thought i'd show you that working as
well one thing i forgot to show you
earlier actually so information center
is where the plugins hope so for
instance this is a movie x plugin that
isn't going to immediately work that's a
shame oh ok it's talking on the network
and this machine's not networked at the
moment oh yes cuz it's not on the
network oh yeah crash let's pretend that
didn't happen stable version yes the
current stable version of the internal
player is good enough i've been using a
home for probably a year now and it just
works so this is the internal DVD player
which will work when i ask it nicely oh
it's gonna be one of those days this all
worked of course this morning yeah
that's interesting
that's his life
um I don't know I think that makes it
happy so the question was why are there
two slashes but I think the problem is
actually that the doc on the laptop is
unhappy I think the Machine didn't
detect that it was docked when because
I'm demoing on a laptop not a real
computer okay we'll go back to that demo
and what I might do is when I'm talking
on the next slide I'll arm I'll quickly
reboot the machine and prove to you that
that works so nobody look just bear with
me for a second
okay so we'll leave that starting up and
we'll go talk about something else for a
bit
okay so the other thing I wanted to talk
about is commercial detection so mythtv
can now automatically detect commercials
and it and it will skip them if you want
it to that's configurable so what
happens is again configure ibly once a
recording has finished or once a
significant chunk of a recording has
happened this is commercial detection
program that runs on the video file and
what it does is it goes through and it
finds all the starts of the commercials
in the ends and it will map those and
then when you're playing back when it
reaches one of those will just skip to
the marker that says here's the end of
the commercial the commercial detection
is actually very reliable much more
reliable than I thought it was the only
problem I've really experienced is if
you've got a show that's very dark for
instance you know law and order has lots
of those black scenes that say hey we've
changed to the county court or whatever
it tends to have problems with that kind
of stuff then again it's really easy in
the menu system to say hey for this
recording don't use commercial detection
and it's also really easy to disable it
for a show forever you can say hey never
with law and order use commercial
detection now the other thing you can do
is you can convert those detected
commercials to a cut list cut lists how
you edit videos in mythtv so for
instance you can say now that you've
detected commercials and I trust you
that you're going to get it right remove
them forever and save me some disk space
which is kind of cool you can also use
cutlass to do stuff like if you're
recording you know a sports game and you
don't really know when it's going to end
once you've recorded it you can go to
the end of the actual game and say hey
throw away everything after this and
myth uses a lossless transcode system
for that so it's a little bit
complicated what happens with most video
formats is every now and then there's a
keyframe it's normally every few seconds
and then in between the keyframes they
just store differences in the image now
that makes the files much smaller what
happens when you're transcoding is if
you see chopped here let's say we're
going to chop this party up here we've
lost a key frame so myth needs to go
through and generate a new keyframe that
new keyframe won't be as good as the
original one because the compression
systems they use throw away data that
you can't get back it's called lossy
compression
so for this small portion you'll find
that the image quality isn't as high but
it's probably not something you're going
to notice on a normal television anyway
because the televisions tend to be fuzzy
and again it's just going to be for this
yeah this is probably a couple of
seconds so most people don't really care
about that kind of stuff so let's see if
my other machine has come back from
being kicked in the shin okay so the
algorithm is reasonably complex they do
stuff like they look for the station
logos that are at the bottom of sorry I
should go back and say what the question
was how does commercial detection work
and basically what they do is they look
for the station logo at the bottom of
the image they look for black frames
which often appear in between the
commercials and the advertising and I
believe they also look for the intensity
of the image like often you know ads
will be brighter than you know the show
or whatever so there's a bunch of stuff
they do to try and detect that yeah i'm
not sure if they use volume or not to be
honest but i wouldn't be surprised if
they do no i don't believe that the
route that the TV stations actually mark
commercials because that's probably not
in their best interests and it's also
not consistent globally right so you
know commercial detection works kind of
everywhere i'm going to have one of
those days i know is there any special
magic i have to do to get and maybe if i
select the right machine will work oh
they were there we go
special man yeah it's pressing the right
button but it's one of those things
right you do these demos at your desk 14
times during the day and they all just
work by definition when you get in front
of people they will fail in some
unexpected manner that's why you should
never do demos in front of actual people
i think yes you'd only have robots to
demo in front of so let's just start
meth up again this is running at a lower
resolution because the Machine detected
the wrong resolution when it started up
but that's okay
okay so as promised that I play you a
DVD let's see if the DVD drove on the
machine is happy now there we go so one
of the cool things about the DVD player
is it also doesn't honor the no-fly
regions a low disk say hey you can't
skip this bit you can in myth so all of
this boring stuff I don't care about
that's all good so we can start playing
a DVD and the menus just work so let's
turn on subtitles the subtitles in this
are actually quite funny because there
are not English there an alien for
reasons I can't fully explain yeah so
the subtitles are in crazy alien but
anyway so a DVD playback really does
work what was I meant to be showing you
know that's right commercial detection
so if we go back to my victim recording
my notes say that about six minutes
there's a commercial
ya know if I'm sorry I've just had a
request from the nice man ronke this is
pause for a second I can never remember
where I set screen resolution hey Andrew
where do I set screen resolution oh yeah
yeah okay right under screen resolution
my machine doesn't like you anymore okay
well we're just going to keep going so
at about six minutes there's advertising
I believe lamb there we go so I'd skip
two minutes of video because if we go
back there was some random ad
so so far i've talked about you know
that there's a back end there's a front
end records video yo yo yo the next we
don't want to talk about is user jobs
yeah
front end
mm-hmm
okay so the question was with the front
end be confused by the resolution
changing on the fly the answer is it
depends how it's compiled if it's got XR
and are installed it'll just handle it
so it should have just worked I think
the problem is that the laptop detected
what resolution the screen could do when
it started up and the screen for some
reason said something horrible okay so
the next we don't want to talk about is
user jobs so once the recording has
finished myth has this ability to run
arbitrary scripts and they're called
user jobs so for example one of the
things I do is I do a reasonable amount
of flying and I tend to watch videos on
planes so this is a nokia n800 it's just
a little handheld tablet thing and so I
have a user job that will transco my
video formats to the correct format for
that device you can also do it for ipods
playstation portable 'he's you know I
phones whatever and all the user job is
is just a command line that gets run
with arguments passed in so the
arguments are things like the location
the video is at on desk the title of the
video the subtitle that kind of thing
and that makes them pretty cool things
possible now most of the examples i'm
going to talk about a transcoding but
you can do other things as well so one
of the cool things is nerve export now
the export is one of the several ways
you can convert video formats from what
meth users which is often mpeg-2 various
formats suitable for other devices it
gets its name because depending on the
hardware you use myth will sometimes
store the videos in a format called
Apple video which has nuv as its
extension so another exports reasonably
hard to get going I ended up having to
patch the code so there's also a patch
at my site if you decide to go this
route and you need a new version of
ffmpeg for our ipods to work properly
now i mentioned that the command lines
have these flags you can pass in so
these are probably the four most useful
flags although there are others as well
so another export is overkill if all you
want to do is stuff like permanently
removing the commercials mythtv comes
with its own transcode
location called myth transcode that does
that cool lossless transcoding thing and
again it's just a command line that you
run but because these user jobs are just
command lines you can run random things
so if for instance you really really
cared about a particular show and you
wanted to get an email when a new one
had been recorded you could do that or
if for instance you know you wanted to
copy the video file from where myth puts
it on disk to the right place for it
automatically get synced with your
laptop you can do that kind of stuff as
well you can do basically anything you
can do in a shell script so I guess what
I'm trying to say is don't limit
yourself to just transcoding there's
some reasonably cool stuff you can do
with this the next release of mythtv
will also let you execute these with the
delay so the example they're using is
let's say you record everything in you
know high definition those files tend to
be pretty big and you go away for a
while now hard disk starts filling up
you can set rules in the next release
like if I haven't watched this video for
seven days then transcode it to a
smaller format doesn't look as good
which means you still have the show but
you're not using up so much disk so I
mentioned before that you can have more
than one front end now setting up remote
front ends is really easy what you do is
you just install the binaries like you
would normally and in the configuration
program which is normally called mythtv
setup although some distributions rename
that you just change the database
configuration to point to the back end
now at the moment you can run front ends
on linux and mac OS there has been some
work to get them working on windows
that's been going for a couple of years
and they don't have a good finished
product yet but maybe they will sometime
soon it's not clear to me that it really
matters because the web interface that
ships with the new version means you're
probably not going to want to run as
many front ends anyway and I'll show you
that in a little bit and I've also said
you can have more than one back end and
that's pretty easy to when you install
the second back end you just tell it
it's a slave in the configuration
application and tell it where the master
is and they'll go and negotiate amongst
themselves about who's going to record
what when you can also use the extra
back ends if you end up doing so much
transcoding
you need more cpus that kind of thing
you can also control your front ends
over the network which initially doesn't
sound all that useful but I found a
couple of ways that I think it's cool so
it makes a whole bunch of remote things
much nicer so what I'll do is I'll start
off by showing you the telnet interface
which is the default way that you
control it over the network is that font
big enough can you see that now the
catch with the telnet interface is that
there's no authentication or encryption
you're just you know but you can do a
bunch of really interesting things like
key down you can see that it's moving
down the menu or key enter which will
start the video playing maybe we want to
pause it you know that kind of thing so
this is cool if it's inside your house
but you wouldn't want to let this out on
the internet right because random people
are going to do bad things to your TV so
I have
now interesting just a second this is
going to need network so let's just
bring the network up so I have an
instant messaging interface that I use
instead that means I can instant message
my TV from work and tell it to do stuff
my wife finds its really annoying
because I'll be controlling the front
end while she's trying to watch TV let
me just find my notes so I don't forget
to tell you anything kind of so the
question is can you do fuzzy matching
stuff like you can on tivo and the short
answer is is if you can express it in
sequel then yes so there's this advanced
recording mode where you can say hey
record any show that matches this sequel
expression so for instance you could say
now record any show that contains the
word Google in the description for
instance but it's you know it doesn't do
anything like you know hey you like
action shows so I'll start recording
this random other one so it doesn't have
anything like that i'm going to have one
of those days on
we're going to talk about guide data a
little bit later because it's about to
change in the US as well in a way that
doesn't have absolutely everybody happy
actually we can just do that I know
that's not what I want sorry because we
rebooted the machine we ended up in this
no network so anyway so
so this is just a little Python
googletalk bot it connects to the google
talk network with an account that i use
for controlling my pc at home so i guess
you know you guys can control my pc at
home now too and if we just start up an
instant messaging client and let it
connect
and we'll get rid of that because this
boring I can now do exactly what I could
do on the telnet interface but over
instant messages so for instance yeah
that's right it probably wants to know
who i am i can unpause I can also do
other stuff like I can do on screen
display stuff that's a really low
resolution because this video is at a
low resolution but so the actual reason
I wrote this was so i could tell my wife
that I was leaving work now and not
after ring her all the time so there we
go so you can also control it with
instant messages which is probably a
little bit gratuitous but i thought was
fun
yes it's actually there's actually a
slide somewhere in here here we go the
next slide yeah so you can get that from
my sight again in fact i'll put the
slide deck for this talk up there later
so you may or may not want to write that
down i don't mind so I've done that I've
kind of already showed you on screen
displays the telnet interface doesn't
let you do on screen displays there's a
separate tool to do that which I'll
quickly show you and again it's yet
another command line so let me just flip
to the page for don't fat finger it and
make a fool of myself yet again now the
catch with on screen displays is you
have to be playing a video for them to
work but we will that's not that no by
definition will be the last one right
I'm just gonna open a new one
so mythtv on-screen display let's use
the alert template
and so you can just display on the
screen displays with command line so I
know people who do stuff like you know
detect that their CPU is running hot and
will pop something up on the screen
saying hey you know the machines heart
or you're running out of disk or you
know it's a little bit weird that you
haven't fed the cat in the last month
maybe you should consider caring for
your animals adequately that kind of
thing and so I think the last demo I
wanted to do is I want to show you myth
web which is the web interface now back
when I used a TiVo there was no real
equivalent to this now it's entirely
possible there is now though so we'll
just start up a browser I don't care
about my old session so myth web lets
you do basically anything you can do
with the front end in a web browser
so for instance these are the recordings
that I have on the machine at the moment
now again this is the latest release so
it has some stuff you won't see if you
just download the standard release at
the moment one of the things that I
think is insanely cool there's a put no
it's not
oh there we go sorry it was just slow to
load and I'm impatient have you gone oh
here we go so the latest the next
release of meth TV so the latest
development versions have what I'm going
to call a YouTube like flash player so
this can stream video from your house to
your desk at work and people will still
think you're working and this is
actually really interesting what it's
doing is it's transcoding the video on
the fly to the right format for the
flash player it won't do any of the
stuff like a commercial skipping but if
you're you know stuck in an airport or
something in a hotel it's probably good
enough so as I said before myth web is a
web interface that lets you do anything
that you can do in a front end so it
seems to me that I'm reasonably
frequently actually this won't work
because there's no guide data on this
machine reasonably frequently they'll be
sitting you know at lunch and someone
will say hey did you see blah and I'll
never have heard of that show because I
live under a rock or something and I'll
say no but sounds great so I'll just sit
there on my cell phone and start you
know recording it automagically for you
next time I get home so never again will
I be left out of lunch time
conversations about the amazing amount
of TV Guide record but never watch and
you know you can review can set up
recordings you can play recordings you
can delete recordings you can do all of
that kind of stuff in the web interface
now one of the catches with myth web is
that it doesn't have particularly
excellent security it just uses HT
access so your username and password are
sent in the clear so that might be
something to consider when you set it up
but it's just a PHP application you can
get it running in about five minutes so
I've already done that now there's some
other things I wanted to mention now it
seems to me that long term people are
going to probably stop getting TV from
traditional sources like you've got this
comcast thing or whatever at the moment
that you know it's very old fashioned
right some do digs a hole and drags a
cable to your house and you plug it into
this thing on your back your machines
very limiting there's a couple of ways
you can integrate things like YouTube
and Google video and other video sites
into myth one of them I wrote so clearly
I think it's cool it's called myth net
TV it lets you take RSS and atom feeds
it downloads them and then insert some
it's recording this instead of videos so
you get the full recording user
interface so you know I mentioned before
that some of my test videos or almost
all of my test videos are downloaded so
the ABC ABC 730 report is a news program
from Australia that I miss so I now just
download that oh I missed you know
diggnation is another online show that I
download Elephants Dream is interesting
because it's an open source video made
with open source packages that you can
just download for free but so myth net
TV is just this tool that lets you
import videos into myth so they look
like normal recordings
the family over a bit boring so it
doesn't support bitter at the moment it
uses HTTP the problem with bittorrent is
I'm not really sure when you should end
a recording right the BitTorrent clients
like hanging around and seeding other
downloads so if you did that then you'd
end up with all these BitTorrent clients
seeding other people all the time which
is probably you know socially
responsible but it's kind of Italy or
bandwidth forever it's hard to detect
when a when a download is finished but I
might be wrong on that I haven't really
played with bittorrent all that much the
other problem with bittorrent is
discovery right I'm not aware of any
kind of you know RSS feed of things you
might want from bittorrent so you need
some way of discovering the downloads
before you start downloading them
automatically so I showed you a video
that was downloaded that way but I
thought I'd also show you now at the
moment is just a command-line tool
so this is a list of the subscriptions I
have on this machine it's just in the
form of a text description which is a
show title that appears in the user
interface and a URL to an RSS or atom
feed and then you know you can say stuff
like hey go download me another show
this one happens to be coming from our
Google's public Tech Talk series and it
will download this it will then transfer
to the right format if it needs to then
we'll put it in the right place and
build a speak table and it will also
detect commercials on these recordings
so if some of them have ads it can be
skipped two yeah okay um the question is
am I going to talk about you know the
hardware side and the integration that
kinda thing I wasn't explicitly this
talk was originally a three hour
tutorial at a conference kind of been
pared down to an hour of which we've
been through about 40 minutes but I'll
talk briefly at the end if you want just
remind me if I forget oh yeah my life is
my research okay yeah but so I guess
it's more of a statement than a question
it would be nice to use my row I've
never seen it so maybe if you show it to
me afterwards or something okay cool
alright
so now that I've convinced you that
mythtv is cool you have a couple of
installation options there are packages
for most Linux distributions there's
definitely one fedora fedora there's
definitely one for Debian there's
definitely one for you bun to you can
compile from source which is actually a
good option even though it sounds a bit
scary there's lots of websites and a
couple of books that will tell you how
to compile from source the advantage of
that is you end up with codes that's
optimized for your CPU and your video
card and that kind of stuff which can be
advantageous you can get live CDs now
which are cool too so you know you
basically put a CD in the Machine and
blam you've got a TV and a lot of these
CDs will also optionally install under
the hard disk if you want to keep it
forever so some of the new stuff that's
coming in the next release and you know
I think I've already shown some of this
already I haven't gone through the
complete changelog recent recently
because it's like you know an inch thick
but some of the cool stuff that really
jumps out is there's now clocks in menus
which I thought was nice even though
it's little thing the watch list is cool
what happens is when you play a
recording myth decides what type what
doesn't decide it determines what time
of day you played it and whether or not
you played it to the end and it starts
suggesting recordings you'd like to
watch at that time of day again so if
you always come home and unwind with an
episode of something then when you get
there but watch list will say hey I've
noticed you really like watching this
thing at this time of day so how about
we watch some of that and then maybe the
kids watch something different at
lunchtime and it will just magically
know that which is kind of cool storage
directories are interesting in the
current release of mythtv videos are
always stored in one location that's not
always true in the next release you can
configure different directories for
different recordings and stuff like that
so you could for instance say I really
really care about these shows put them
on the raid array I don't care so much
about these ones put them on the USB
disk that's a little bit flaky or you
can set up rules and say hey you know
you can put videos on you know the
petition that has my home directories
but only so much I don't want you to
fill it and put everything else over
here and it's reasonably smart it can do
stuff like move stuff move videos
between directories to balance out load
kind of thing which is kind of cool
because at the moment if you want to
solve videos in more than one place you
have to move them and symlink them or
poke around in the database to tell it
that they're in a different spot that
kind of thing there's the flash player
and with myth web which I've shown you
and there's a universal plug and play
support which means a lot of these
little devices and you can buy things
that look a bit like a VCR except they
have no holes on them to the there are
all these devices that talk on the
network and just ask the network nicely
if there are any sources of content out
there like audio or video a mythtv can
now do that kind of stuff as well so a
lot of these devices you can just buy
you plug it into your TV and it says oh
I've noticed this video over there would
you like to watch some of that and
there's a bunch more like I said the
changelog is about an inch thick these
days now I really should talk about
guide data a bit and this is complicated
so I'm going to sit down so this only
really applies to the US Canada and
Venezuela I think it is the guide data
for mythtv and a bunch of open source
stuff was provided for quite a while for
free by a company called the zap2it who
had you know their labs site where you
can download this guy data for free as
apt to is owned by a company called
Tribune media services which it turns
out there's basically two sources of
guide data in the US Tribune and another
company I can't remember the name of now
those companies value-add is they take
all these data feeds from all the
different TV affiliates and stuff and
they unrolled them so they do stuff like
they put in descriptions of the shows
they make the spelling consistence that
kind of stuff and then basically
everybody else buys the data off them
because they've got lots of humans doing
this particular horrible job and they
recently announced it was probably a
couple of months ago now that they're
going to stop providing this guy data
for free they felt there was some abuse
occurring and they're just going to turn
off the site and I think it's the first
4 sep tember big panic thousands of
emails on a mailing list blah blah blah
blah blah eventually it comes down to
the guys who wrote myth and people
associated with a bunch of other open
source projects like XML TV have gotten
together and started a company called
schedules direct and this company is
going to provide this
guide data instead they've actually
signed a license agreement with Tribune
media services the catch of course is
they're going to have costs in hosting
it so it's no longer going to be free
it's going to be almost free I think
they're talking at the moment about for
the first quarter I think they want
twenty dollars for three months and then
they'll change the pricing based on how
many people actually sign up and they
they're saying they're going to try and
iterate down to it being as close to
free as they can get while still paying
their costs since they don't know how
many people are actually going to use it
and how much it's actually going to cost
and that kind of stuff so there is a
guide data solution but we're in this
transition phase they haven't started
providing go data yet and zap2it is
going to stop providing it soon so
there's still a little bit of panic on
the mailing lists but i think you know
long-term there'll be a real solution of
this I was talking to a guy a couple of
hours ago and my advice to him is
probably don't build a box this week I
would wait a couple of weeks and see how
things sort themselves out and then
decide what to do yeah so the question
is why did zap2it do it for free the
short answer is not very short to be
honest the way guide data happens in a
lot of other countries is a technique
called screen scraping you get a web
client you hit the web page like you
know for instance yahoo has a TV Guide
site that's quite nice and you parse the
HTML and decide what shows are on when
and then you know that probably doesn't
have the description so then you click
on every link for every show to get the
description and you know thousands of
hits later you have the guide data the
attitude that most companies have taken
to that is they yell at you and
threatened to sue you if you don't stop
because it turns out they're using lots
of bandwidth it's not very nice to their
machines etc zap2it said hey why don't
we just give you the data in a form that
doesn't suck and off they went now
ultimately you know that didn't work out
because you know one of the complaints
they had was that people were selling
machines with mythtv installed that all
used one account and the accounts have
attributes like hey please get your guy
data at this time of day so they can
even out the load but that didn't work
if there are a thousand machines all
using the same username and password so
you know I think we're going to iterate
to a solution that's reasonably good it
might
take a little time the other thing is if
schedules director doesn't work out
there's no reason that we can't go back
to screen scraping it's just someone
would have to write the code and whoever
get screen scraped is probably not going
to be very happy about it yeah so that's
true so is that too its business model
is they provide this data to other
people for lots of money now they gave
it out to the community for free and for
whatever reason and I guess it's their
right to they've decided not to so there
has been you know some accusation on the
mythtv mailing list there's a hidden
agenda here and you know whatever but
yeah ultimately it's their data they can
withhold it if they want to I suppose
yeah so we're channels in information go
to go to your room so they just treated
like normal TV channels with the zap2it
data I assume that will be true of the
schedules direct data as well one of the
things the schedule directs guys have
said is because they've signed a
contract and they're giving TMS money
they also get a little bit more control
so they have a contractual ability to
say hey we need the data format changed
because we're giving you lots of money
and you know they stand a lot more
chance of getting a change than just
random people who are getting it for
free so I think the takeaway is despite
all the panic there will be guide data
we're pretty sure it will come from
schedules direct you know hey I think
some patience is required and that's
about it so Oh get up again ah so that's
the end of my slides now you asked about
hardware right but if you got a quick
question first really if you don't have
to
you can schedule recordings according to
time and channel yes so so the question
was about manual scheduling it's a lot
like a TiVo if you don't have TiVo guy
data then you can say hey record at this
time on this channel for this length you
can do that with myth as well you won't
get any of the guide data information so
the system won't know what the show is
named or anything like that but absolute
worst case if you really really cared
about a show you could start reading
dead tree or something and setting up
manual recordings yeah so the question
was about hardware now one of the
reasons I didn't want to talk about
hardware is it's different for everybody
every video card is different every
remote control system is different and
some of them are fiddly and some of them
just great so for instance I had a lot
of trouble getting lir see which is the
standard way of doing remote control
working but then i bought a fancy media
center case like one of these home
theater pc cases that had an inbuilt
infrared remote and that just worked so
it kind of depends on your experience
your best bet is to look at the myth
site and see what hardware is
recommended I won't recite the list
because it's long most people in in the
u.s. at least end up with a whole page
capture card and they just work mostly
you need to buy one that's not branded
as a media center like you know windows
the ones rounded Windows Media Center
don't work as well as the ones that
aren't just branded you know win PVR you
you know they have an inbuilt remote
that works well with larc your video
card choice can matter a little bit
because some video cards are louder than
others for instance and some do you know
a video playback better than others so
for instance I originally had a geforce
card that didn't work very well and then
i changed to a different nvidia card and
that one worked well
things like if most content nowadays
seems to come on transport mechanisms
and requires an external direct TV thing
the smart card edit comcast cable box
how does the software command the
external decoder mhm a change channel
the short answer is yes but to rephrase
the question because I get to do that
because I'm Speaker I suppose there's
two really two questions there there's
what about devices you know the channels
that require external decoders like for
instance Dish TV or high def channels
that kind of thing and what about I are
blasting so external link external
receivers like that are supported often
you'll just plug them in with an s-video
cable or whatever then the problem is
mostly that control of the external unit
larc supports I are blasting which is
you know kind of the approach that we
used with TiVo's in Australia I are
blasting is not one hundred percent
reliable if you're reasonably assertive
with your TV provider you can insist on
a certain model of set-top boxes and
some of them have firewire or serial
interfaces which are much more reliable
to control and they're supported as well
in fact some of the high def set-top
boxes will just provide you the video on
fire wire if you ask nicely but that
depends on your local provider and what
set-top box they're using and that kind
of thing ultimately I think it comes
down to again looking through the list
of what your options are in your area
and making a reasonable decision there
must be one of the reasonably few people
still on analog cable here because it
just works with my whole page card
occasionally comcast will ring me up and
say you know for two dollars a month
will give you free channels and a high
def box and I say well until you have a
cable card that works in with Linux I'm
not interested but you know windows
media center has the same problem
they've only just released tuner cards
that can do high-def with the smart card
encryption II stuff and not all vendors
work all that reliably it's still kind
of iterating down to us
solution and once that's happened you
might see better support in Linux as
well so that like I said that's all the
slides I have are there any other
questions yeah so I'm very traditional
which is why I picked ext3 it's just
what I've used for everything any extend
space file system should be fine as long
as it's reliable so I'm not really
keeping track of where JFS is up to or
anything like that but um you know it
should be fine it's just a Linux file
system right as long as you trust it
with data you should be okay okay so
what about remote file systems they just
work it's the short answer if you can
mount it in Linux it will work bandwidth
can be an issue but then realistically
encoded video is not that much data per
minute like I think you know my
recordings are generally in the order of
two gigabytes an hour that's not that
much data when we were writing the book
we started worrying a lot about you know
how many tuner cards because could you
add before you saturated the desk or how
many front ends could you use before you
know started worrying about network
bandwidth and stuff and so we did some
tests and the reality is you're going to
have to try pretty hard I think like if
you had a slow wireless network you're
going to have a bad day but if you're
using like a wired network and you've
got you know SATA or ide disks or
something like that there's something
that's not you know 15 years old you
should be fine yeah so if you go
something like if you wanted multiple
capture cards say you've got one that if
I understand why the comcast works
around here you can get a lot of the
channels just with a normal
tuner but there are a whole bunch of
other channels that you actually need
their decoder for and it does it have
abstractions for okay I've got two
tuners but this tuner can only get
channels 1 through 50 and if you want
the other channels you have to use this
tuner and so right where tysons winners
in particular channel the really short
answer is yes the question is hey you
know so some channels might only be
available on one tuna it's also possible
I suppose that one tune is nicer than
another that kind of thing can you
configure all of that the long answer is
yes you can set up references you can
say always record this show on this tuna
always use this tuner if it's free this
tuna gets this list of channels and this
tuna gets this different list of
channels for instance I've got two
tuners and ones an old car they picked
up cheap off someone I met at work so I
prefer to not use that tuner so yeah you
could you can define all these
preferences around that kind of stuff
yeah she was Lois G for a series that
offers a full acceleration ok so the
question is a really specific question
about video cards that I can't answer
off the top of my head I'd have to look
it up to be honest I don't know if any
idea what you just said Leslie ok so if
you know if you play back HD or recorded
like a full HD stream is like two
megabytes a second so if you have a nest
box which is like
yeah so the comment was that a full HD
screen was what to make a second you
said yeah like I said I don't get any HD
because I'm pigheaded yes a comcast
offered me a free you know HD thingy i
plug in and it's horrible it's really
really horrible okay okay cool
advertising by this government you know
they're mandated so they have to have it
it's just it on advertised because you
want to sell you something yeah so the
other thing is comcast rang me up at one
point and offered me for literally zero
dollars a month but there was a price on
it was just 0 this little external box
that I'm pretty sure is doing video over
IP and it's using the you know the data
back channel that's on the the analog
cable to download video but it's
horrible like it's you know all those
MPEG compression artifacts where it goes
blocky and stuff it's like that the
whole time so I used it for about a week
and then I turned it off so bc dealer
basic it over like
channels ok cool so you know the
yeah you know HD piece you know you know
there's like this one another supported
card you can plug in your PC no self to
recording Mississippi you know inputs
like a regular analog and the HD
channels okay cool and they've also a
version where oficio gift to HD tuners
in a and an ethernet interface so you
can just see how basically you know
whoever can connect to the network and
you know recording yeah exactly that HD
homerun oh the hdhomerun is cool sorry
so the gentleman's mentioning the
hdhomerun it's also interesting because
it's a tuner that doesn't have to plug
into the pc so you can get these devices
that you plug into your you know cable
thing or antenna or whatever you got and
you plug it into the network and you
stick it under a couch and then the myth
box goes and get to the video over the
network so that's another way of solving
that you know my cable provider put the
you know socket in this horrible place I
don't want to put a computer that kind
of thing I think we should call it a
night if you've got any other questions
feel free to come up and have a chat and
Leslie wants you to come up and read the
back of my t-shirt I think I think
pretty sure that's what that said oh ok
yet so this is the t-shirt that Leslie
gave me it's lovely I actually have
written a couple but that's okay I've
also because i didn't want to shield the
book i know i mentioned a couple of
times but that was just my excuse for
learning about myth i also have the
competing book so whatever all right you
guys have a good night
you
