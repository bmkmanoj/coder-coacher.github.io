have dr. Eugene Levin he's an expert on
space tether dynamics and he's written
two books on the subject and he's worked
in the past with NASA Air Force and
other aerospace like organizations and
he's giving a talk on orbital debris
removal and an innovative new approach
to the topic so please give it one
welcome thank you for coming and that's
an interesting topic and you open
entertains there is not much glory in
removing orbital debris but I see this
as a as a focal point where many issues
come together and that we have to solve
and we want to go to stars but every
every time we head down to the front
door we step into this debris field
which reminds us we're not ready to go
anywhere until we sort out this mess
this is work in progress and I will give
you our latest perspective on this and
again it's open for all kinds of ideas
is one of the views this is my
comrades-in-arms Jerome Pearson's from
star technologies your Kaltura
applications
Jon Olsson well we have been thrashing
cleansing oceans for quite a while and
then 50 years ago we got to the new
frontier and we looked around and saw
this really big space and we thought
we'll it will leave couple things back
behind and nothing will happen so that's
what we did but this time we realized
that's a different that's a different
garbage pile and it's it's tracked and
catalogued it's visible to all its
international and mix dynamically and it
cannot be abandoned by international law
and amazingly it's close to capacity and
many
in many places in common life we kind of
think about garbage piles as being
anonymous and this is very very
different very unusual Outer Space
Treaty is an amazing document at the
height of the Cold War nations came
together and decided that space is
special
they said it shall have no national
territories nor weapons of mass
destruction or harmful contamination and
launching states are responsible and the
launching state is the one that either
launches or pays for launch or provides
territory or provides a facility and
it's getting complicated look at seal
launch this platform is Norwegian the
first in the second stage is Ukrainian
the third stage is Russian the payload
is somebody's else and the launch team
is mostly most American and it's
launched out of the ocean but all those
players are launching stage they have
responsibility Treaty says that if your
object breaks up you still own and are
responsible for all fragments small and
large you can see the breakup of the
Japanese probably turning to earth last
year
the liability convention it clarifies
that there is no excuse for hitting
something from the ground or somebody
and it's not an idle precaution because
tracked objects
reenter daily large objects reenter
weekly and some parts survive reentry
and he at the ground in March this
football on the Left hit the ground in
Colorado and it came from a Russian
upper stage at the same time this large
football on the right hit the ground in
Oregon came from American upper stage
the treaty says that in space is
different you can say sorry not my fault
and this is what happened with cosmos
and iridium cosmos was dead for long for
long
before the collision and it could not
many or alidium was operational it could
manual however predicted approach was
more than half a kilometer and their
standard mode of operation they really
don't don't maneuver it's a low ranked
conjunction so it did not and in this
case neither side is at fault what is
capacity and certainly we saw this
amazing images from from Pixar three
years ago like this massive field of
death satellites and and the Scout ship
punching through it is impressive but
this we are at capacity not in this
sense so that the density is still very
low however velocities are really high
so we the flux the the product of
density and velocity is getting really
high and if you look at the image on the
right ads it's a cross-section of that
debris stream horizontal 360 degrees is
a one revolution around the earth and
vertical 1,000 kilometers that suspend
and altitude and all those red dots it's
intersections with trajectories or
objects and every object crosses is
plenary or in half and we have to fly
through this is a pretty pretty
intensive cross traffic now low Earth
orbit is defined as up to 2,000
kilometers and we have been accumulating
fragments and satellites and rocket
bodies steadily for 50 years and about
four years ago things started happening
it's a different environment 2007 the
Chinese and anti cellar tests an old
weather satellite at 806 kilometers and
a missile launched from the from the
ground held on no explosive you don't
really need explosives here because the
kinetic energy of the orbital motion has
substantially more energy than you can
release from explosions the result they
said this body is literally shredded
each other into small pieces and
whatever
I call it shrapnel about one and half
tons of shrapnel and if you look at the
distribution of fragments about 3000
trackables fragments about a million
over one millimeter and what is most
alarming about 100,000 of fragments that
are in the centimeter region they can
take out the satellite we don't see them
but they are there the fallout most of
them are still in orbit four years later
they create about 600 conjunctions every
day within five kilometers and I took
the snapshot on July 23rd the
top-ranking conjunctions and you can see
with satellites you can see like
approaches several hundred meters very
high relative velocities relatively low
probability but it accumulates this time
what is shrapnel and and for each for
each object that we track where we have
about up to 50 on tracked objects in in
a centimeter range and you can see on on
it in the picture on the left that an
aluminum ball about one centimeter in
diameter can punch halfway through 18
centimeter aluminum plate and none of
the satellite cells have armor Datsik
and on the right you can see they're
about an inch sized ripped area on a
shuttle it was four years ago 2009
cosmos iridium collision again that was
not held and that was at 100 degrees at
11.6 kilometers per second
cosmos again was not operational iridium
could maneuver but conjunction was not
rank high so it was not different from
other conjunctions that satellite was
having everyday and also you have to
think about the region has a lot of
satellites that they are getting
thousands of conjunctions so they can't
really manure when predicted ranges is
half week alone they just don't do it is
standard practice the outcome exactly
same like like the Chinese a set test
the objects shredded each other one and
a half tonnes of shrapnel about two
thousand trackable fragments about a
million over one millimeter and again
about hundred thousand of those
centimeter range fragments that can take
out a satellite the fallout most of
fragments are still in orbit for each
tract 150 that we don't see but they can
take out the satellite and what happens
with steins or sorbus spread and they
kind of form a shell around the earth
NASA reported last year that they were
mostly dodging the their Earth observing
satellites were mostly dodging fragments
from cosmos iridium collisions you can
see in this table those orange orange
lines that those are for for cases when
they have to to avoid close approaches
with with fragments of course masoor or
iridium and this is four out of seven
and that cost few and this one was
chasing ISS so it's a relatively small
fragment about ten fifteen centimeters
and it was looping through the ISS
altitude every one and half hours for
two years and then finally it got too
close and in April this year they had to
manual spent seventy kilograms of fuel
so we can we can congratulate ourselves
we we actually deployed a slow-release
random target asset system without even
trying and if we Adeem the stars and
Brighton all this objects that's the sky
we will see and you can see there is
something congestion in the middle
that's around the poles because many of
those bodies are in in polar orbits I
call it a weapon of mass conjunctions
and you can say that like we have all
these workers overhead and we really
need to defuse or disarm this weapon so
catastrophic collisions between larger
objects will make more and more shrapnel
and even small objects can smash
satellites and rocket bodies into pieces
here you can see this Delta 2 second
stage compared to 3uq upset if they
collide Delta 2 will will will be
shredded into pieces it's not really
obvious but that's how much energy there
isn't in this collision and now if you
look at the probability of catastrophic
collisions it grows with the second
power of the number of objects and the
number of objects was growing with time
like approximately linearly and would
have we are heading to over 10 percent
per year over catastrophic collision so
like in next 10 years we'll have another
one we measure like we suggested some
time ago to measure the risk in
statistical yield of fragments you
multiply the mass of an object by the
probability of catastrophic collision
and then you take a sound for whatever
group of objects you want to look at
what we found at the highest risk or the
ability narration is around 82 degrees
there is like a large cluster and but
the highest number of satellites is
around 98 degrees which is a sensing
cluster and you can look at this chart
and say well it's good because there are
different incarnations but that's not
really the case when we look at
collision risk we will seal this very
distinct spikes one is at 82 degrees the
other one is at 98 but the interesting
part that the spike at 82 degrees is
produced by the barriers in 98
and the spark at 98 is produced by the
bodies in in 82 so they are threads to
each other why does this happen when we
look at the orbits and let's say take
two sample orbits 82 and 98 degrees
they actually rotate slowly they process
around the heiress's of the earth in
opposite directions and periodically
they they align in such a way that this
is head-on traffic and you can see on
the right how it looks like you have a
bunch of old rocket stages flying
head-on with satellites and this is
happening as we speak right now so how
much do we have to remove to like reduce
that risk again we measure the risk of
the statistical yield of fragments and
we will say we well we say that right
now is hundred percent and based on our
calculations we have to remove 2,000
tons we like by removing one or two or
three we make no difference whatsoever
we need wholesale anymore how do we
remove this 2200 their satellites spent
stages all over Leo 2,000 tons and this
is a very popular picture from last year
it's an artist concept you can see it's
a massive waste management so it's
supposed to come close yeah open the bay
there is a like robotic arm grab the
satellite positi encloses the bail it's
a statement it's a visual statement but
technically it's not doable this job is
not for artists because when we look at
the rocket equation there is an
exponential turn with with a Delta V
Delta V is how much you have to change
the velocity of objects to reenter that
Delta V is huge like we'll be looking at
like masses that are really not not
practical and this is an estimate we
looked at a wholesaler a mobile campaign
of all spent stages and desert lies for
four different rockets and you can see
those orange dots bipropellant and
to iron engines like whole thrusters and
what similar rationale is in development
I nobody knows when it will be
operational it could be really expensive
and really heavy so I kind of grade it
out and horizontal axis is the exhaust
velocity of the engine so basically what
I see Mary is this is where we push the
very edge of what the Rockets can do and
on the left you can see how how many
tons you have to launch you have to
launch massive amounts of rockets and
and we're being conservative here you
probably will have to launch more than
we estimate at the same time like from
from our standpoint we want to be aware
this Green Dot is we want to be on the
way you're right we want to launch like
about one time but you can see that you
cannot do it with rockets we just have
to start burning fuel to make this
happen and and there is a way to do so
electro dynamic propulsion what you do
is you collect electrons on one side you
drive them through the conductor and you
emit them on the other side you use
hollow cathode for a meter it's really
small device about this big you use just
a little Zenon flown many times and you
use just plain aluminum tape on the
other side it's really really simple
the current interacts with the
geomagnetic field and produces an pure
force that you can used to change your
orbit
now the question about closing the
circuit is is is practically resolved
because it has been demonstrated twice
plasma mount of generator it's 1993 and
Teller satellite system replied 1996 how
to think about it think about like
sailing you can change the direction of
the wind but you can operate or sail
it's it's really not widely known but
electrodynamics system was built by by
Joe Carroll and I was part of this
effort in 2000 to keep mirin or B the
problem was that
Russians did not have enough lunch
capacity at that time to supply enough
fuel to keep it in orbit so that the
orbit was was going down and it was to
the point where of no return so this
system was built it included six
kilometer insulated wire and one coolant
electron collector and some pallet
tether and at the end of 2000 it was
seeding it was growing through export
clearance and at that time decision was
made to reenter Mir so here we go we had
the largest man-made object reenters
hundred six tons of debris and all this
breakup and splashes in the Pacific the
system that was built for Mir is what we
call hanging system and because the
teller is always oriented toward the
earth like along the local vertical and
if you see it doesn't work very well at
trying to nations were most debris is
and what we came up with the idea to
rotate the system and that gives a much
better stability much better angles with
a field it's a relatively slower
rotation about 15 minutes per turn as
you can see with that spinning system
it's the best performance exactly where
all dbe's debris are and we can do orbit
about one ton object at ninety
kilometers per day that's pretty good
and we don't burn any fuel so meter
electrodynamic garbage truck we call it
electro dynamic debris Eliminator or
Eddy it's only hundred kilos twelve them
fit into S Plus a condor a payload slot
this picture on the right it you can see
the the primary payload on a very right
and then this ring that holds a bunch of
all these shaped containers that that's
is secondary that secondary payloads and
you can look at this box that that
sticks on the top you can fit two of
those in this box you roll the tape into
the thralls and they
nice in there essentially you can think
about this system as a bunch of nano
sized nano satellites taped together and
that's a aluminum reinforced tape like
you see in this picture that's the
actual tape release and this one can
move tons without burning any fuel again
technology where we stand we don't
require miracles all components are
fairly highly developed many flown and
the Naval Research Laboratory took the
initiative they will be flying terror
like the dynamic propulsion CubeSat
experiment next year to show this type
of propulsion capture it's a sticking
point like people are really afraid
about approaching this old debris but in
this case we we propose to use like
really large but real lightweight nets
and on each one and we can carry about
150 grams each we pass it about two
three we actually match the velocity of
the Entwhistle orbital velocity of the
debris we pass it about two meters per
second capture it in the net and and
drag it down below is where it decays by
itself well that's the presentation of
how wholesale debris mall campaign could
develop and you can see accumulation of
debris and like to 2010 that simulation
was it and ended then we sent well of
those garbage trucks up and they spread
out they go into their inclinations and
they start picking that objects and
dragging them down so they move up
pretty fast they then they grab
something heavy and they you see like
those yellow dots they would move slowly
now this simulation will show only just
less than a month for each year and
we'll just get to the point real really
quickly we certainly start from the
objects that are lowest and then like
work our way up
and this this vehicles they don't have a
problem to change orbital planes they
don't really need fuel for this it just
needs some time as opposed to rockets
like if you do it with rockets you have
a huge problem to change your orbital
plane now these guys are really like
they can go anywhere and you can see it
it takes less than seven years to clear
those 2,200 satellites and 2,000 tons of
garbage so that that's the end of the
story and it took only 12 of those
vehicles each hundred kilos we looked at
orbital debris removal as a service as a
commercial service because government
does not really want to be involved it's
it's it's like city hiring some some
company to remove waste and you are on
the left like vertical axis that would
be the cost per kilogram of debris
removed and the horizontal axis is a
tons of debris removed and this this
blue band is a typical cost of launch
and our point was if you are going to
remove debris and in some cost-efficient
manner it should cost much less than it
cost to launch and when we looked at
rockets we find that and some some
really like genius assumptions was put
into this we find that with rockets we
will be paying as much for amol as we
pay for launch and and if you have some
money for space activity will rather
launch and remove so we think it's it's
really not an attractive solution if I
have to be in this green area down the
road to be to be economically viable and
electrodynamic remove $10 now that's an
interesting perspective we can look at
debris as a resource not as not as a
just noise sense and
for example if you look at our stages
it's really simple shapes there are
lessons if it's just a couple of tanks
and some old mother highly clustered and
high can tender aluminum if you look at
this cluster at 82 degrees some 450 tons
of mostly aluminum what can we do that
material for example if there is about
thousand tons of again mostly aluminum
and those old upper stages and that is
enough to build a pressure structure
which will be about the size of the
National Air and Space Museum in
Washington DC it's not like we would not
not like it's not maybe not not the best
use but but it just gives you the scale
how much material do we have in orbit
and on the right you can see Hubble
inside the museum so basically Hubble is
a really big is a really big object so
it could be assembled inside such a
facility or service and you can actually
put the entire shuttle inside this is
how much material and then we can
actually see the scheme of space
manufacturing with that kind of thinking
about bringing materials from from from
the moon from the asteroids when over
has we have a field where we can mine
aluminum and that's a lot of material
and the only problem is we have to to
make the delivery of this material
relatively cheap which we do with
electro dynamic delivery so this scheme
does not to work with rockets because it
becomes more cost effective to launch
them from from the ground but once you
use like the dynamic field you can
capture it bring today to the processing
point you can melt it send to 3d
printers produce some parts and deliver
it to the customer so essentially you
you can jump-start the space
manufacturing character that garbage
pile if you will and the added benefit
you don't have to re-enter a lot of
large object because as we saw you have
a responsibility if if you hit something
on the ground
now the idea of delirium all it really
entered the public consensus and and it
gets popular we can see it in movies on
the Internet and next year we'll have
this IMAX movie space on 3d there is a
interspace interagency space debris
Coordination Committee it includes 12th
largest space agencies it reports 3m
they are willing players adopted debris
mitigation guidelines are not binding
internationally but like every agency
actually made unilateral steps to to do
something about this and by the way best
best implementation is is is in the US
and there is a growing understanding
that mitigation is not enough mitigation
means for example you you you get rid of
residual propellant in upper stage so it
doesn't explode so you don't remove it
but you kind of reduce the risk of
explosion for example so there is an
understanding that mitigation is not an
arbitrary single event like a
catastrophic collision can negate the
years of mitigation and we need active
debate anymore
what would it take and that's the very
latest I was surprised to see this
number hmm if if the members of this of
this committee decide to share the
expense it only takes seven million per
year pure agency to remove all all
rocket bodies within eight years and
then go to removing role space all
spacecraft which will take the full
campaign in twelve years and then
expensive and go down because you only
need to remove whatever is newly
launched and of course that has to be
open to competitive bidding and to
create this market because like we don't
pretend to be the best technology will
build against it but silence some other
people will be it may be was a better
system it's just you know
this is the set like a more like a
reference point if you will to say that
it's not that expensive
after all new rules yeah I have the sign
not working out the business hours the
problem is when you launch the Space
Treaty says space is free for everybody
so you can say don't launch here because
somebody left a lot of garbage and you
can collide so people should be able to
launch but after the useful light they
have to remove their stuff they cannot
really part in orbits that can be used
by other peoples and our view is that if
space agencies decide to to bear that
cause they should really buy something
for that cost and what they buy for this
is the bio regime where where states
participating states decide or agree to
remove satellites after their useful
life and that kind of rule is
implemented only in US but the span it's
called the 25 year rule you have 25
years to remove your satellite which is
too long but conceptually it's really
it's a really powerful statement saying
that you shouldn't really leave your
stuff stuff in orbit of after after
you're done with it so like we see this
kind of rule implemented with a much
shorter limit let's say you have one one
or two years to remove if you cannot do
it yourself you just hire a commercial
service and for this to make sense
commercial service has to be much
cheaper than launch so if you launch
satellites for let's say five thousand
dollars per kilogram you should be able
to remove it for like I don't know three
four five hundred dollars per kilogram
and and that's that's the last one the
point that I want to make well sail
debris mole is is a soluble technical
problem not much of financial burdens
the legal problem an idea that is
getting popular and it's not a matter of
deciding track thank you I was actually
surprised by this 25-year rule does it
mean that as soon as the u.s. launches
something the funds are set aside to
remove it in twenty five year time or
finding is assumed to come up from some
other source in 25 years and how does it
work now I have to like consider there
is no technical capability today to to
really remove something so what happens
is when a launching when the satellite
operator goes to get its launch license
he must present a plan how this
satellite with will either come down on
its own because if you if you launch
further the law 25 years is enough for
the satellite to just come down on
because of the drag or present a plan
where he would say I have enough fuel
left at the end of life which which
which I can use to lower my orbit to the
point where I will have enough time to
reenter but what happens is you don't
really know if your satellite will
survive until that time so it can really
die before you can you can still have
fuel but your satellite will will not
response like one of those bullets will
punch a hole in somewhere in your
computer than then you can't perform
this maneuver but that rule was
introduced with understanding that there
is no technical capability to remove it
when the satellite dies or it's high but
it was a statement in the in the right
direction saying you have to do this you
have to do your best to remove this but
now what we are saying when we have a
debris removal service then you can say
is you have to if you can't do it
yourself then hire somebody so basically
that rule opens this this kind of
thinking you
now it's not it's not like 100% poof
it's probably like only 50 I think that
compliance rate is is really not very
high because of technical reasons
thinking where we were just us it was at
first to say that it should not be that
way that you just leave it your stuff
there thank you I can imagine oxygen
ions being attracted to your electron
collector aluminium oxide isn't a very
good conductor yeah there is a problem
of oxidation and that that is a part
that it's still in in process of being
researched but I think that there is a
some understanding that you can have the
surfaces survive long enough because
those vehicles are not really designed
to operate more than maybe five years
and and the reason why I have such a
long conductors they are used as
conductors and collectors because we
really have a lot of surface so we we
probably will survive within those five
year period that five year period was
under gradation of collection and but
that that is a part of this technology
development where we have to see how far
we can go and with that given area so
this technique seems to be best at
removing large objects from space what
about the centimeter objects which are
not able to be tracked
yeah those the largest danger they are
however we don't even see them now so
right now I am not aware of any
particular technology that can be used
effectively there is a talk about using
lasers but with lasers you have
first you have to create a system that
will actually track those and and then
you have to be selective like you have
it you already have about half a million
of those in orbits so like in my mind I
don't really know or we're good way of
doing this and I would leave this to
people who know better but on our side
what we are saying let's not make this
problem worse and let people who work
with small debris figure out how to
remove them and meanwhile we just will
remove the source of future small
fragments but but that that's an open
question so that's that's what why I
said that this is very open to all kind
of new ideas like we're really in Ewing
in always in in like in technology in
tracking and in legal sense because we
we have to create some agreements that
did not exist before and we have to do
it cost effectively so it's like as I
said it's a it's a focal point for me
it's a focal point of many issues and
this is one of issues and like as we go
forward we'll find some solution what is
the plan to remove the devices that you
are used for removal remove devices that
are used for removal of space debris how
they will be removed or because photo
yes they will do orbit themselves
because like they are very agile when
they are not sharing the debris they can
do or they can move like almost like
thousand kilometers per day down so you
can reenter within a day so when you
decide and those like our electro
dynamic drugs they're designed as a
multi module multi segment design it
will survive cuts even if it cut into
pieces they are still controllable and
they
can't be re-entered in just a few days
and that's the whole idea once you once
you see that your vehicle is not
performing well you just reenter it
because it's so light it's it's
relatively cheap it's light you replace
it and when you saw this financial
projections what we put into those
projections is we'll use them for five
years and then retire and they replaced
with Bosnians
thank you well I guess I answered 12
questions in this case again thank you
for for listening and I invite you to
