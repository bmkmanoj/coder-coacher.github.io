I've been an engineer here for the last
five and a half years or so now but I
know that is not why you all came here
today you certainly didn't come to see
me so a few months ago I was on a plane
and I just happened to be sitting next
to this person who was started talking
about drug policy and and how it affects
society and and and some of the
implications of that and I found the
talk absolutely fascinating in fact we
talked I think almost the entire flight
which was about an hour or so so what
was even more interesting was was his
credentials
he was a 33-year veteran of law
enforcement and the executive director
of a group called Law Enforcement
Against Prohibition so of course at the
end of the flight I asked him if he'd
like to come here to Google and and and
give a talk on the topic and he agreed
so with me today is Neil Franklin the
executive director of leap so come on
first of all I want to I want to thank
Brian and I'm impressed by Brian I mean
what he has done to promote this and get
this moving for us here at Google I give
you thanks for that and also you might
want to thank him he supplied a
wonderful lunch for you guys I can I see
that way to go Brian that's pretty good
so that's a way to get him here and I he
didn't tell me that I would be a little
overdressed for the occasion but I tell
you what I'm going to do I'm gonna
loosen up a little bit all right and
we're gonna get there to see my my wife
she gets a little upset when I don't
loosen my tie tonight when I go to bed
you know it's not like she's trying to
get me to wear these things called
pajamas or something I get there
but after so many years in law
enforcement mainly for me in criminal or
narcotics investigation I agree when I
was in narcotics investigation I you
suggest a little bit more relaxed
looked a little different but once I
started going up through the ranks which
I'll talk about just a little bit about
the costume changed so kind of used to
this but I'll get over it real quick I
want to give you a brief overview of our
organization Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition and just a little bit of my
background as Brian touched upon can
everyone hear me okay okay Law
Enforcement Against Prohibition was
formed in 2002 by five cops retired cops
Jack Cole was one of those five and he
was our he was my predecessor as
executive director for Law Enforcement
Against Prohibition I took over in July
and Jack Cole retired New Jersey State
Trooper did a lot of time in narcotics
work for the New Jersey State Police and
it was into a lot of very interesting
cases but they had the the
forward-thinking and the courage because
it was their forward thinking they
brought them to the place of realizing
that there's something really wrong with
our drug policies in this country you
know after three decades of no successes
and being there on the frontlines they
realized it's something's not right it's
not what we thought it would be so they
formed leap Law Enforcement Against
Prohibition and we're thousands we have
about probably around thirty five
thousand supporters now worldwide we're
based here in the United States but
we're in 78 countries probably more than
78 countries now and not just cops we
have judges retired federal judges we
have prosecutors we have Corrections
officials we have a a current warden of
a prison who is on board with us and we
have a speaker's bureau
over a hundred members who travel around
to affect
dads need stuff should I expect any less
than Google but so that's what we do we
teach people about our failed policies
we teach about what occurs on the front
lines so that's a snapshot of leave and
and oh I can't forget this we are
completely non-profit 501 3 C so if you
guys want to help us out to continue our
message please feel free and I can give
you a little bit more information on
that but that's our website leap dot CC
le APCC and to make it easier to
remember
another way to get there is cops say
legalized drugs calm and that will get
your attention so now about me as Brian
said look over 33 years in the business
of law enforcement and and just so you
know make sure I was clear our
organization says we must legalize all
drugs in order to solve our issues not
just in this country but worldwide and
those issues I will be talking about
today now when you hear that word
legalize don't fall out of your seat
we're not talking about a free-for-all
we're not talking about like how you
guys get lunch here at Google I do like
it though but we're talking about
regulation and control we're talking
about taking taking complete control
away from the criminals and making sure
that it is regulated and controlled in a
responsible manner ok my 33 years I
started with the Maryland State Police
back in the late 1970s
a couple years after I joined a State
Police I became an undercover narcotics
agent worked primarily around the
Washington DC area from there I
eventually worked my way into management
eventually commanding a number of task
force's in the western part of the state
multi-jurisdictional Drug Task Forces I
think I had about 7 to 1 that time as a
lieutenant with the Maryland State
Police shortly thereafter I became a
regional commander for both narcotics
and Criminal Investigation I then had
the North East part of the state if the
state was divided in half so I had about
12 counties under my command and of that
I think there was probably about 12
different task force's from there I went
to become the commander of training for
the Maryland State Police which was one
of the two largest training academies
divisions within law enforcement in the
state of Maryland I then retired from
there in 1999 from there I went to
Baltimore I was recruited to go to
Baltimore which was my hometown I then
commanded their training division which
was the largest training division in in
the state I did that for four years
before leaving there and going to my
third is that a problem
I couldn't keep a job but I got over
that I think I'm at my last stop now
because I went to the Maryland Transit
Administration to command their
detective bureau their criminal
investigations Bureau during that time I
also had the privilege to be the
chairperson for a grassroots
organization in Harford County Maryland
which was called the heroin Narcotics
Task Force now no it wasn't cops it was
community it was formed by two moms that
had lost their sons their two sons to
heroin overdoses they were high school
students
and they were trying to get funding for
treatment in education it's a difficult
task very difficult task so it got me to
see from another perspective this issue
that we're talking about here today I've
been involved with mentoring children
throughout the years and and and also
the president for an organization on a
board for an organization called turn
around and corporated which was a an
organization in the Baltimore area for
domestic violence were advocates for
domestic violence child sexual abuse
sexual assault and it gave you and
you'll be surprised how this also spills
over into that realm as well you guys
seen the HBO series of wire I'll make
one quick comment about that except for
the community of Amsterdam that's right
on right on and many of those characters
and scenes and scenarios that you would
see in that were really taken from True
Life over a span of maybe a couple of
decades and they pushed it all together
okay real quick I got a question
I assume most of the people not all of
you here are familiar with our drug
policies in the country right for the
most part marijuana heroin cocaine that
stuff to illegal right to possess and
and so on just by a show of hands and
how many of you think that our current
policies are working don't be bashful I
mean you're among friends then one to
anybody okay and just for the record I
didn't see a single hand go up and it
was probably about 150 60 people in this
room here I asked that question for a
reason and as you'll see as we move
through the program so let's go ahead
and move through the I got a little
slideshow here that we're gonna we're
gonna roll through real quick
before 1914 heroin I can move around a
little bit
this good okay so before 1914 heroin
could be bought from any grocery store
and that's true before the Harrison that
but then we and this country decided to
start with our gun laws and back then
1.3 percent of our population was
addicted to drugs okay that's when drugs
were legal I talked a little about my
career but this is just some of some
visuals acid good-looking guy this guy
standing next to me asked my brother
he's the reason I got into law
enforcement and he was my instructor
that's when I graduated from the police
academy he was my instructor in the
police academy and he tell you some
stories there but there he is again
so we both that's when I went to another
agency that's when I went to Baltimore I
was a colonel there and he was a colonel
with the Transportation Authority after
he left the State Police I had to
encourage him to retire and move on
still with Baltimore and that's what
happens when you start talking about
this stuff that was the end of my career
with my last agency but uh they couldn't
find anything so I was set free
eventually so from 1979 to 2009 and you
know I mentioned the span because as
you'll see we'll be talking about you
know we're talking about the past three
to four decades and you know and that's
three decades for me and war on drugs
started a few years before that 1970 hmm
oh my god
so 1.3 percent you just remember seeing
that figure again okay 1.3 percent in
1970 people were addicted to drugs so
we've gone through we went through quite
a few decades and still at that same
percentage 1970 now we're talking about
deaths as a result of our drug culture
but 1970 that's likely then falling
downstairs in a drug den to die from
using drugs okay I mean
likely to die from using drugs from
falling down stairs falling down stairs
is more dangerous so stay off the stairs
use the elevator
same thing with choking on food so it's
not like the propaganda has been put out
there over the years that drugs are
dangerous they're gonna kill you Bob Oh
blah blah blah many more things in this
world that are gonna kill you believe me
stay waiting what I was going to name a
particular restaurant but I don't want
to be sued for slander so but you know
where I was going with that there many
of them 1970 soft drugs back then hard
drugs were virtually unheard of and I'm
going to start rolling through these
slides real quick because I think it's
very important to get some good dialogue
going but I want to give you guys a good
foundation for you know what this is all
about touch on a few areas so I'm going
to be clicking through rather quickly as
we get going
now here is a from the DEA briefing book
of 2001 and a lot of the stuff that we
use from the feds you'll see you know
goes back a few years but it's very hard
to get current information statistics
from the federal government and I don't
know why that is but so be it but if you
look at the two charts here on the Left
price on the right
purity and down the center we have years
beginning of 1980 going through 1999 and
we're referring to if you look in the
upper left it I'll say it's three
dollars and ninety cents and we refer to
as we're talking about heroin here we've
heard it at as a trade because back then
that amount that's what it costs three
dollars about three dollars and these
adjustments that you're going to see
inflation is including it's factored
into that so that we get a good
comparison as how prices change as we
navigate through the years so when a
purity side in 1980s three point six
percent purity for heroin when you
bought heroin off the street back then
1970 was about when you compare the
prices it was about $6 for the same
amount of heroin you can see in 1980 it
was 390 if you go back 10 years there's
about six dollars and 37 cents so you
can see that the price has been those
ten years went down for buying the same
amount of heroin purity back in 1970 was
1.5 percent so you see the purity had
gone up considerably
what I'm talking about here is is
supplying the man what I'm talking about
here is if we're doing what we're
supposed to do as it relates to the war
on drugs to reduce the amount of drugs
coming into the country the availability
first of all if less drugs were coming
into the country purity level would
either stay the same or would become
less because they cut it more they would
cut it more but if more drugs are coming
into the country then your purity is
going to go up it's going to increase
same thing when you compare gasoline
gasoline when gasoline when there's
plenty of gasoline prices do what they
go down limited supply price goes up and
I have somebody who will probably talk a
little about that as we move forward so
when you look at the pyridine 339 I'm
gonna move forward real quick I'm gonna
move up to 1999 that same amount of
heroin in 1999 was now under a dollar at
80 cents purity level 38 percent today
heroin purity is extremely high I mean
it's in some places it's almost pure
because we have not been effective in
keeping drugs out of our country and I
think after four decades of that trend
it's pretty obvious that we're not going
to be so you know just wanted to touch
on that real quick
all right drug users according to the
DEA 1965 four million two percent of
that two percent of that population
in 2003 112 million 46% of that
population money spent fighting the drug
war cases 1970 we spent 100 million 2003
70 billion okay this is what we're doing
in the law enforcement effort and I saw
that during my span of career as we
continue to buy more toys and spend more
money put more people into our narcotics
units going from like 10 and 15 people
when a unit back in the 1970s all the
way up to a few hundred in the late 80s
drug seizures you know back in the 70s
when I first came on I saw a working
undercover when I seized an ounce of
cocaine man I was big-time I got all the
Pat's on the back and I mean it was big
it was a big deal
announcer her oh my god big stuff
no quarter ounce of heroin in 2002 if
you wanted a good pat on the back you
needed ten tons of heroin yeah we
winning that war no doubt about it
how about 20 tons of cocaine so now
you're talking a container load at the
port and that's the truth once again it
shows that it's still coming in quite a
bit wholesale coke cocaine cost sixty
percent less wholesale heroin costs
seventy percent less prices are going
down just like I was talking about with
gasoline supply and demand it's here
let's talk about overdoses per 100,000
users in 1979 that was the day that I
think that year that I graduated from
the State Police Academy we're at 28
deaths per 100,000 look at that 141
deaths by 2000 so we're not saving lives
over these decades
that's for sure here's just a quick
chart on arrest marijuana arrests versus
total drug arrests in the u.s. from 1970
up to 2005 down at the bottom and see we
were arrested in 1/2 million people in
1970 quadruple 2005 1.9 million total
drug arrests 44% 89 percent increase in
marijuana possession arrests crazy we're
filling up our jails and that's also
costing us money to the tune of 37,000
depending on where you are so many
average around 29 30 thousand dollars
per inmate per year
sounds like a college education that's
not what they're getting coming out
better criminals so do you think okay
US stock tax dollars spent on
prosecuting drug work we spent over a
trillion dollars folks use your health
care program and there's this a graph
that talks about arrests of nonviolent
drug offenders in the millions in how
it's going off in 1917 to 2006 I'm
moving into the actual numbers
thirty-nine million arrests drug arrests
the most of these arrests I'm talking
about folks are nonviolent I'm not
talking about the folks out here
shooting and killing people two thousand
two percent of population addicted we're
still 1.3 man with all these drugs and
stuff in the country would go up to
about what I don't know 10 12 % 1.3 just
like back in 1914 so that's what I was
just talking about when it was legal
when drugs were illegal after 40 years
we're still around the same percentage
so ah this is interesting but senator
crimes cleared by arrest exceptional
beings what this is this is information
from our US Department of Justice as it
relates to across the country how many
crimes were solving
okay murder rape robbery you know all
those rural crimes against people 2006
as you can see murder clearance rate
sixty point seven rapes forty point nine
twenty five point two we are now have
unsolved out here 40 percent of our
murders go unsolved sixty percent of our
rates and arsons go unsolved
seventy-five percent of robberies go
unsolved now when they go and solve
these people continue to prey upon you
so what happens when you don't solve
crimes
eighty three percent of property crimes
in 1963 we solved 91 percent of our
murders today like I said 61% we're
focusing a lot of our energy on our drug
policies and enforcing drug laws in our
neighborhoods and communities so 30%
fewer chasing nonviolent drug users
that's where else is talking about
protect us from the important people now
as we get into the violence here how did
I come to where I'm at this is how I
came to where I'm at it's the violence
in the illegal drug trade that really
gets to me I know there's money involved
I know that we're losing money from
taxes not changing I'll probably put
this is what gets me and in in 2000
right after I retired from the State
Police and went to Baltimore City I got
a phone call in the middle of the night
about a trooper who had been shot
and it was a sky edy totally who was a
good friend of mine and that had worked
for me on many times but more
importantly he was and still is a friend
so Kate you can't see that he was making
an undercover Buy by in the Washington
DC area from a drug dealer while working
with the FBI and they were surveilling
all of this I mean they were right down
the street just was cameras in the car
and everything guy comes back out and
shoots at point-blank range in the head
to keep the money and the drugs guy gets
away and does in New York but we
eventually caught him so now his wife
and three kids are alone as relates to
that relationship but it didn't stop we
did it there are many police officers
that have met the same fate as my friend
and it continues and it continues but
it's not just us out there on the front
lines who are dying couple years later
in Baltimore on its corner row home this
is where that family lived on Preston
Street in Baltimore this is Dawson
family that's the mom up there Angela
and five kids the husband there's no
photo of the husband here but he was
also in at home on that night when the
neighborhood drug dealer set their home
on fire because she was working with the
police to get him off of that corner so
her kids didn't have to deal with them
so he murdered them see it's not just
Mexico we're in Mexico we over the past
since 2006 have had more than 28,000
Latinos murdered not because we have a
drug abuse problem in this world because
we have drug prohibition which creates
an illegal market dislike back in the
1920s with Al Capone and alcohol here in
the United States does
think we've taken a problem and made it
ten times worse by invoking prohibition
all right
schoolchildren report it's easier buy
illegal drugs marijuana than it is
alcohol and beer because alcohol and
beer is regulated and when a cake comes
to me up to me on the street and says
hey man can you go in the store and get
me a six-pack so you didn't lost your
mind but when he walks up to a drug
dealer on a corner or sends a text
message all they want to see it is is
money you won't see your driver's
license and as we've already seen the
drugs are increasing the amounts are
increasing every year it's becoming more
difficult for the cartel to transport it
across the border so now they're
groaning in our national parks and are
guarding it with they have guards up in
the trees with ak-47s as any DEA agent
he'll tell you that's what the illegal
trade generates 500 billion every year
it's more than that but we lowball it
that's a mere twenty two hundred and
fifty five million dollars that's in a
room of a drug dealers house probably
too much for the bank vault to handle
five hundred billion would cover a room
two thousand times that size check this
out
they don't count their money they weigh
their money seriously
they weigh it I mean you saw how much
money that was they weigh it and if you
can't see that $100 bills thirty seven
point one pounds equal million dollars
you might want to weigh your money one
day that's why we're telling you
if you're not already Wayne
alright so remove the profit move you
remove the profit load if you remove the
violence
alright that's it's plain and simple
after doing this for 40 almost 40 years
believe me I know that's what it's all
about out there in the street so you end
prohibition how you end prohibition you
legalize drugs deregulate and control it
that's how you get the profit margin out
of it for these guys just talk a little
bit about decriminalizing then listen
you know there's a difference to
decriminalize that helps the people who
are possessing it so if you're you have
a small amount or whatever it is you
don't go to jail that's a good thing but
it doesn't take the violence out of the
business because the dealers are still
out there to cartel is still out there
now they decriminalized in another
Netherlands in 1976 Portugal in 2001 and
in Portugal illicit this is for all
drugs not just marijuana or whatever
this heroin cocaine and what-have-you
Mexico 2009 a lot of people don't know
that they did that in Mexico Argentina
in 2009 but once again they didn't take
the full step to legalize the only took
half a step that's why they still have
the violence in Mexico
you still have your dealer if you still
have the illegal underground market
okay so won't legalization cause
everyone to use drugs what do you think
will it question of the hundred and
sixty some odd folks are you sitting in
this room today and use it in you that
are watching over the net how many of
you would use heroin cocaine crystal
meth tomorrow if it were illegal I mean
if it were legal
tomorrow it's it's legal you can go out
here and buy it from a safe place you
know and so how many of you would use it
remember I said you're among friends
not only that of the people you know and
I assume that you know people right you
like Facebook and Twitter you tweet and
all that stuff and okay
of those people you know how many of
those people do you know that we use if
the mark if you know any of that would
use it tomorrow they're probably already
doing it you get my point but the good
thing about if we were to legalize it
tomorrow at least you for those who do
use and currently buy they don't have to
go out into that dangerous market like
you saw in the HBO series The Wire you
don't have to go out into that market
and buy it additionally you would know
what you're getting because it's like
wood alcohol you know what the alcohol
content is excessive right on the bottle
there are certain standards there's
certain things they can and can't put in
it the purity level so for someone who's
using heroin you know because if I if
I'm using her when I buy illegally from
you today I'm not saying that you do
that but if I buy from you today you
might be selling me something at thirty
percent purity but you probably don't
even know what your purity level I mean
you you know you just mix it up but if
you're going to Marco's the police lock
you up then I got a buy from you you
might be selling yours at 80 percent
next thing I know I'm in shock trauma
you know well if someone gets me help
because I cause when you OD people just
don't run and get you help especially if
they've been hanging out with you they
make 40 50 phone calls first try to
figure out what to do before they get
you if they get you medical attention
cause it's cuz you're a criminal that
would make me a criminal I don't want to
go to jail even if it involves saving
your life that's a problem that's why we
have so many overdoses in the
Netherlands talking about if drugs would
leave in the Netherlands where you can
now in use get your marijuana at your
you know little coffee shops and so on
marijuana used by tenth graders 28%
marijuana use about 10th graders in the
United States
41% blow that out of the water by
lifetime prevalence in the US and the
Netherlands USA
37% Netherlands 17% they made it boring
to use pot old people use pot heroin use
lifetime USA 1.4 percent Netherlands
0.4% it's different mindset homicide
rate in the Netherlands the u.s. a 5.6
Netherlands 1.5 Portugal those use about
13 to 15 year-olds decreased by 25%
because in Portugal the Cato Institute
in case you want to look into this more
Cato Institute did a study on that you
can find it online in Portugal drug use
16 and 19 year olds decrease about 22%
heroin overdose deaths because now it's
okay to go get help and not only that
it's there's more money available for
treatment and education decreased by 52%
portugal HIV infections new cases of HIV
infections decreased by 71% check that
out as saving lives Mexico
I'm gonna skip right through these
because it's not much of error but this
talks about in Mexico and then I think
Argentina well police corruption and let
me touch on this real quick please
corruption yeah we have it in the United
States here it's profitable everybody
likes to make money no matter what you
wear the red a uniform or not now the
cases are few but you know we have cops
we have prosecutors we have other people
who take bribes who rip off drug dealers
who do whatever they got to do despite
the uniform they wear to make money okay
it's profitable and they take bribes and
they get passes the drug dealers and so
on
it's different in Mexico in Mexico first
we offer you the money you don't want to
take the money next we offer you a
bullet and we offer your family members
a bullet so if you don't take the money
believe me you'll take the second option
and you'll do whatever they want you to
do because they will kill your family
we're on time ok when talk a little bit
about incarceration rates because this
is important and this is per 100,000
starting with European nations
population 100,000 they are at or below
in Europe 154 100,000 incarceration the
United States by March of 2008 try 1009
an any buddy else in the world including
China the ones who live in China who
wants okay but you know you probably
been there before you know where to go
now be serious yeah no I'm not making
fun of China you like that says I'm
talking about how our country is
supposed to be had this wonderful
Constitution and freedoms and what have
you know what I'm talking about those
protections from unreasonable search and
seizure I can't go down that road right
now because we'll be all day but we have
issues there in this country federal
prisoners from 1970 to 2005 okay
the yellow or for non drug offenses and
you see they start low but they only
come up to about right here the red for
drug offenders so in nineteen seventy it
so you can hardly see it but then it
starts on this path and then we really
get into the drug war and it's off the
roof way up there about two hundred and
forty something percent by the year 2004
2005 so you can see it's greatly out
pasted other crimes yeah it went up for
other crimes as we continue to put
people in prison for other crimes but
for drug
fences off the roof and there are a
number of reasons
a lot of I mean and money is one of them
the grants and things that
law-enforcement agencies get from the
federal government for focusing upon
drug arrest and our other reasons too
and these are just the numbers in
relation to the actual chart so that you
can see there now that they increased
for regular arrests for non drug it
increased two hundred ninety four
percent but for drug-related arrests
increased two thousand five hundred
fifty eight percent so those are the
actual numbers correlated it and here's
a starting at the top we have Denmark
and we work our way down through Turkey
Georgia Greece the you cane and
what-have-you
United States of course is the one with
the bar all the way over here as it
relates to people we imprison per
100,000 so as you can see we outpace
everybody here's Russia of course in the
United States yeah anyway let's move
through that I think you get the picture
as far as how we put people in prison
there's also a disparity issue and I'll
touch on that real quick also real quick
but who uses drugs and before I get did
an experience all better who uses drugs
and these are we get these figures
majority of our figures from the US
Department of Justice from the feds
White's constitute for seventy percent
seventy two percent of all drug users in
the US blacks constitute for thirteen
point five percent of all drug users in
the US who gets arrested thirty-seven
percent of those arrested for drug
violations are black who goes to prison
sixty percent of those in state prisons
for drug felonies are black
81% in federal now federal drug
offenders or black that's in federal
prisons blacks are now serving an
average of six years for their offenses
while whites are serving an average of
four years of the convicted defendants
thirty three percent of whites receive a
prison sentence so when you're convicted
thirty one-third go to prison for whites
fifty one percent that's half for blacks
a black male born today has a one in
three chance of serving time in prison
to be introduced to the criminal justice
system one and three so we're talking
about disenfranchisement fourteen
percent for black men lost the right to
vote on average in Texas that's 31
percent hmm corporation rates white
males per 100,000 in the United States
nine hundred and forty three white males
per 100,000 in the United States
incarceration rate South Africa 1993
under apartheid for black males that was
851 and we thought that was atrocious in
the United States under prohibition in
2008 try 4919 for 100,000 there's a book
written by Michelle Alexander called the
new Jim Crow if you haven't read it got
it read it it really breaks this whole
thing down I mean she did a wonderful
job with that great book educated me on
a number of things
alchemy legalization now 1.9 million
less people arrested each year that's
what we'd had so you know how costly
that is to house one point nine million
people even if it's just for a month or
a few days throughout the year you know
how much money that cost and when turn
in are not paying taxes I guarantee you
because they're not working 70 billion
dollars would be saved each year so in
prohibition number two let's have
federal government and these are just
some light it have the federal
government producing these drugs now
this isn't a position of leap
however this talks a little bit about
regulation and control some of the
things that we could do that would deal
with quality control we talked a little
bit about that knowing what you're going
to be getting if you choose to march
down that road we do not condone the use
of drugs cently we don't drugs are
dangerous drugs will harm you they will
harm you but we've just made it 10 times
worse by subjecting people to prison
prohibition standardization okay you
know what the potency level is
measurement the potency like I said
reduce an end of overdoses all right the
three so drugs to adults from state
package stores or whatever models that
are out there let the states the
individual 50 states decide on how
that's going to be the feds get out of
it and let the state's decide how to do
it that's how the Constitution intended
it to be in the first place for those
drugs that might be too bad alright like
they do up in Canada with the Naomi
Project for heroin maintenance program
if you're an addict you can go in and
get what you need so that you're not out
stealing you're not lying to your family
members you're not causing problems in
your neighborhood you're not knocking
people over the head to get the money
that you need to buy from the illegal
drug dealer on a corner you can take
care of your issue without it costing us
and hopefully get your counseling and
get off of it and that's what I was just
talking about here Switzerland that's
what he do in Switzerland and the
Netherlands and Canada Germany to
Denmark oh there you go and under that
program not one overdose death since
1994 how many we have in here in the
United States once again does
great as it relates to AIDS and
hepatitis because they're no longer
sharing needles
all right crime was cut by 60% oh my god
so many benefits eighty-two percent
decline in new heroin cases oh my god
we're having so much sex two different
folks redirect the money just you know
that we save and what we get from taxes
but mainly from what we save to programs
of true treatment and education Daniel
solve the root issue which is your drug
abuse problem but we can't do it with
dumping most of our money into
enforcement then filling up our prisons
it just doesn't work it doesn't work 30
to 40 years it hasn't worked you could
do wonders with your education health
care and housing job training employment
livable wages list as long of what we
could do if we were to turn that corner
and head in another direction
rehabilitation centers oh my god there
you go all right redirect money you say
programs okay
talk about it I won't touch on this real
quick 1985 42% of us smoked tobacco
nicotine the most addictive drug that's
out there ask anybody that smokes and is
trying to kick the habit
however by 2003 because we launched this
massive program to teach people than to
make it uncomfortable for you to smoke
in places now it's only 21% mine you can
be effective in reducing use if you just
do it the right way Albert Einstein we
all know what he said
let me just get right to it but for
those who can't read this procedure
government has undoubtedly been lowered
considerably by the prohibition law and
he's talking about prohibition in
general for nothing is more destructive
of respect for the government and a law
of the land than passing laws which
cannot be enforced
it is an open secret that the dangerous
increase of crime in this country is
closely connected with this forty years
you can't enforce this law properly
prohibition and this was a picture from
back dealing with alcohol prohibition
just want to say real quick it was the
ladies that came out in full force to
reverse to reverse the eighteenth
Amendment and repeal it because they
want to save their children that's what
it was about and if you want to save
your kids today that's what we have to
do so that's my presentation I want to
bring somebody up real quick and then
we're gonna have questions but it's like
Robert want to come on up Robert listen
is from Australia and he is over at
Stanford over with the Hoover Institute
right at any Economics Department and I
just met him the the other day and I
told him I was having this talk here
with you guys a little discussion and
presentation with you guys and about him
to come along he is an expert in
economics and he can talk a little bit
about economics from a worldwide
perspective from a national perspective
here and I just want to have him here
available to answer some questions and
you want to take just a couple minutes
I wouldn't take up too much of your time
just a couple of minutes that was a very
interesting clear presentation I just
want to add a little bit by way of
economics in other words what does
economics tell us about the war on drugs
well I think economics is unambiguous
the income tax which is what I'm working
on the moment I'm working on the
abolition of being content so and
replace it as most economists do with
the consumed income tax the income tax
was the gateway drug to Perdition why
because in order to abolish alcohol you
lose an awful lot of revenue therefore
you need another source of revenue the
income tax was that source of revenue
now we'll see in a minute when I finish
this two or three-minute taught that by
reintegrated drugs into the legal
network where you also find ourselves an
enormous source of tax read I'm working
at the moment on a method of eliminating
income tax so it fits in nicely with
that research project okay so what is
the relationship between the war on
drugs and the war on terror one finance
is the other where the funds come from
to kill American soldiers from the war
on drugs where do the Taliban get their
hands from the war on drugs now there is
for proposition economics total revenue
equals price times quantity song
why do all producers form cartels it is
a very simple reason if you can form a
cartel dominate the markets you can do
what restrict supply why because if
you're dealing with a commodity for
which the demand is inelastic it is in
your interest to restrict supply what
happened in 1974 there was a four-fold
increase the price of oil why because
it's in the interests of OPEC to reduce
supply likewise it is in the interests
of drug suppliers to reduce supply so if
I was a drug dealer I will be out there
saying just say no to drugs
let's get tough on drugs let's get
serious with this war on drugs why
because it's in my commercial interests
because I'm an intra I mean the I'm in
the market already I'm paying off all
the cops I need but the last thing I
want is new entrance we want tough laws
to keep entrance out because new
entrants will lower the price lower the
revenue very simple proposition so
there's some very simple solutions here
Neela's outline son let me just give you
a couple in Artesia in 1974 Turkey not
Afghanistan was the source of heroin 94%
of heroin was grown in Turkey almost
similar identical proportion to the
proportion of heroin that originates
from Afghanistan the Turks decided to do
something very radical they put this to
the State Department of State Department
said you badger communists we're not
going to tolerate that what they wanted
to do is they want to legalize the the
production of poppies in Turkey now just
that happened then when that great guy
Richard Nixon got involved a little bit
of trouble in 1974 I can't my boy it was
perhaps I'll you can tell me afterwards
the Turks went ahead and did their plan
anyway because the State Department the
American government was caught up with
Watergate
what do they do they said to Turkish
poppy grows you could grow whatever you
like any quantity and guess what we'll
buy it from you and you know what
happens to that it's sold as painkillers
around the world a commodity of which we
are in tremendous shortage there's
millions of millions of people who are
dying painful deaths because we don't
have enough painkillers
now since 1974 and this is not a
research interest of mine but I have it
on good authority
not a single bust of heroin anywhere in
the world has been traced back to Turkey
now drugs passed through Turkey but I
understand non of the poppies grown in
Turkey
make their way into the illegal drug
market so there I think is probably
where I shall stop if we integrate these
dangerous commodities and drugs are
dangerous commodities back into the
legal fabric we generate an enormous
amount of tax revenue we minimize the
damage associated with this and we
destroy funding for the Taliban and
their criminal crony friends now if we
have got any chance of introducing
rational public policy in America we
should start with eliminating this
counterproductive nonsensical war on
drugs and use rational thought informed
by economic analysis and common-sense
rather than shallow emotional rhetoric
which is where the war on drugs
when I met you yesterday something just
told me you would be right for this so
that's why I bought to you so we have a
couple minutes left over I doubted if
any of you have any questions or
anything but we'll entertain some
absolutely seriously yes if you want to
come up
oh that's a good question what he what
he asked was what can you do as citizens
as folks here because well basically
what he said when a politician wants to
talk about this issue and they consider
it call it a third rail issue you know
like the Metro the third electrified
rail if you touch it you die it's a
third rail issue for politicians so what
can we do what can you do to get
politicians to I guess speak to this or
to come forward with this let me start
by saying that politicians are beginning
to do it because there are a number of
organizations out there including ours
which has been going to them and it's
becoming we're getting this more out in
the open
the first thing you can do is actually
go to our website and just sign on so
that we can keep you informed of the
good information all the updates that
are coming out all the the propositions
that are out there all the bills that
are out there related to this such as
what Senator Jim Webb is doing now in in
Washington DC as he's taking a good look
he's developing a panel that will take a
really good comprehensive look at our
entire criminal justice system and this
is a huge part of it so go to our
website sign up so we can keep you
informed and send you information the
second thing is find out many people
don't know who two representatives are
find out who you representatives are
then send them emails call them and say
hey I'm in your district it's okay for
you to talk about this because I feel it
needs to be talked about because as you
saw the first question I asked how many
of you think our current policies are
working no hands went up and that's what
you can say to them you know I was at
this you know forum and this
presentation of Google and they asked a
question how many think about our
policies are working and no hands went
up so as my representative what are you
doing to move in a different direction
if we out here believed it it's not
working so to talk to them about moving
in another direction yeah
there's a very simple answer that
question it's called tax competition if
drugs are legalized at a local level the
state or alert level then income tax and
other taxes will will fall
therefore the logic is you want the war
on drugs you pay for it with higher
taxes and tax competition will eliminate
the war on drugs from the money
perspective they understand taxes how do
you lower taxes well the first thing you
do is stop spending money that's the
first thing you do all right I mean
really that's that's balancing your
checkbook 101 stop spending evaluate
where you're spending your money and
right now we're spending according to
Jeffrey Mayer and who's out of Harvard
who's done a lot of studies as it
relates to finances in the drug war I
think he puts it at seventy six point
eight billion dollars a year alright so
we stopped spending that Robert just
talked about the taxes that you can
generate from doing it appropriately and
you don't have to start moving forward
with all these hard drugs I mean
marijuana
no one's ever died from ingesting
marijuana I think that's a good place to
start
compare that to alcohol maybe people
will start using marijuana in lieu of
alcohol and will will really save some
lives and thank you and in lieu of
tobacco I mean unless is long so start
there and I think through taxes stop
spending what we're currently spending
where we're spending it start letting
people look just stop putting people in
prison because you got to pay for them
you know pay for college education and
then it can start contributing to the
tax base instead of taking from it the
list is long and and there are a number
of studies out there that do speak to
this I would suggest that you go online
and Google Jeffrey Mayer from Harvard
and you'll see a lot of work that he's
done nationally and he's also begin he's
begun to break it down state-by-state
yes
oh I wouldn't be something I do but what
oh okay I see what you're saying here so
here's my suggestion we're in California
right there's a proposition out there
right now right make a statement folks
that's where you can begin because I
guarantee you marijuana
put 60 to 70 percent you see that big
room of money you saw 60 to 70 percent
of that money for the cartel comes from
marijuana what happens if you take that
much revenue from GM or from BP I like
that
but I don't think these guys are gonna
get bailout but that in and of itself
would would greatly cripple not just the
cartel members but the neighborhood
gangs that we have out here I mean
because it's the same for them as well
that's their biggest you know profit
margin comes from from marijuana yes get
you then I'll come back over here to you
sir
it depends on where you are what your
job is in law enforcement who you've
talked to how much knowledge you had the
folks in my circle get it because they
listen to what I have to say and they
know all the facts surrounding this
issue and how it affects your life and
everyone else's lives the higher up you
go the more resistance you find because
the more political that position becomes
the higher up you go in an agency in
some states like here in California
going to see opposition come out like
probably the narcotics union you know
what I don't I don't have a problem
saying because I was in narcotics and I
can say from firsthand that I liked
being in narcotics not that I really
like going out and resting lot of these
people I found out when I was in
narcotics in undercover work these are
really good people most of these people
I dealt with four really good people but
I enjoyed wearing the shorts man and the
t-shirts and the sandals and driving a
cool car you know Corvette or a five
liter Mustang or Mercedes I didn't want
to go back in the uniform pushing the
patrol unit so to you know their
incentives you know agencies get a lot
of money from the feds they seized a lot
of money in property every year
it's called policing for profit another
good study done by the Cato Institute
looked at up policing for profit and the
list is long so I in my circle one of
the first things I said to the folks in
my circle who wear the uniform is please
go back to thinking how you thought when
you first came into this line of
business this career why you came into
it in the first place to be effective in
a positive piece of someone's life
because once they've been off for a
while they become tainted so I get them
to go back to think that and if we if we
change this police relationships in many
communities would improve drastically
because we will no longer be an
occupying force in those neighborhoods
searching everyone search in their home
searching their cars profiling issues
and the list is long so we
repair that and become respected for the
most part again yes that's that's just
what you saw on a slide was just a
suggestion of one impossibly model they
were good okay that was just of one
possible model that just many different
models what I'm what we're saying at
leading is when you're word you'll then
have 50 states that could work on many
different possible models I was
referring to like the heroin maintenance
programs that they currently have in
some of the other countries where you're
no longer where someone doesn't have to
pay for what they need to get in to get
treatment I don't know it's whatever it
would be whatever we decide it for it to
be but the problem is we don't know what
it could possibly be because we have our
heads stuck in the sand we know what
what we're doing now doesn't work but
we're not moving forward we're not
creating faint tanks serious think tanks
to figure out the new direction that's
the biggest problem we're having right
now is that we're stagnant very simple
answer to your question Gary Becker oh
and the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1993
has got a fantastic article in the
Journal of Leo economy published I think
in 2005 where he demonstrates
conclusively that legal producers have
lower cost curves than illegal producers
so that it's more efficient and the
illegal producers will be driven out of
the market so it's a complicated
argument it's very mathematical and so
on but have a read of that I think
you'll find the answer to question there
that illegal producers will be driven
out of the market through
cost commits the inability to compete
with legal producers right right I'll
take two more questions and then we'll
call it I'm gonna take you and then I'll
come back to you sir okay is there a
reason why I never mentioned prop 19
well one of the reasons we're a 501 3 C
and we don't do too much and I you know
in in pushing legislation changes our
tax status but prop 19 needs to move
forward in my opinion it definitely
needs to move forward I think it's
critical that it moved forward not in
2012 but now because I'm telling you
after being on the front lines for over
three decades every day that we wait
thousands of people die and I mean I'm
serious about that I'm not just talking
about here in the United States I'm
talking about worldwide this is a
worldwide issue other countries look to
us in our policies we have huge
influence over the UN as it relates to
drug policy on it on a worldwide scale
the US needs to move forward do the
right thing
correct our policies and directions so
that other countries will follow suit
and will save will save lives and people
talk about the unintended consequences
of legalization God look at the current
consequences you know they're talking
about oh my god you know usage from
marijuana may go up 3% ok usage goes up
3% smoking marijuana doesn't kill anyone
if we stay where we're at I will have
another six seven thousand people die in
the next year
in Mexico in the United States we'll
probably have about another 10,000
people die and our neighborhood drug
wars and yeah we'll keep it illegal I
mean come on I mean and those that do
become addicted even if increased usage
does go up at least we would have the
money for proper treatment but I'm
telling you right now I from as a cop
would much rather take someone off of a
street corner to a good treatment center
then put them in a body bag and take
them to the morgue any day any day and
there's and as Jack Cole would say you
can get over an addiction you'll never
get over conviction you can't get
student loans you can't get housing you
can't get jobs and the list goes on and
on and on and what happens to that
person they eventually end up in jail or
somehow become draining to society
instead of productive in society all
because they decided to use a substance
and we're yes sir
there is none I mean they they try to
say it was related to commerce but
that's it's not it's up to the states to
decide what this should be see back when
he did alcohol prohibition that's why
they had to create the 18th amendment
they had to be a constitutional change
for them to do that so now there there
are some studies that you can read that
that speaks specifically to that and I
don't want to speak incorrectly because
you know once again my area is law
enforcement now you're getting more into
the economic part of it and
constitutional law I can speak to
constitutional law as it relates to
those like the fourth amendment and
fifth amendment dealing with law
enforcement and policing but not as
relates to interstate commerce and all
that good stuff but there you can find
that information as to what the
government is saying the reason it is
for
well and that's one of the things that I
know it's not you know safer than
Argentina that's where they ruled it is
unconstitutional and you ask anybody
that deals with constitutional law and
they'll tell you that it is in this
country it is unconstitutional but there
was something that they did or said that
kind of like skirts kind of like skirts
the edges of it and that's one of the
problems we're having that's with this
drug policy that we have it affects so
many other areas of the Constitution it
I mean we're ripping the ripping the
fourth amendment to shreds out here as
relates to searching people and in many
cases the Supreme Court is holding up
some of these searches that are done by
law enforcement folks out here on the
streets and when you look at these cases
and that's why as a matter of fact what
we're talking about right now and I
think it also answers your question it's
in the book that I mentioned by Michelle
Alexander the new Jim Crow speaks
specifically to that so you might want
to take a look at that too so I know it
kind of ran out of time here but I just
want to thank you guys for having me
here today
hosting me here today I had a great time
thank you and there are some pamphlets
or on the back there and I'll give you
my and you can probably find it on a web
site but I'll give you my email address
as well if you want to communicate with
me later it's pretty simple it's Neal
and E I ll at leap dot cc thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
