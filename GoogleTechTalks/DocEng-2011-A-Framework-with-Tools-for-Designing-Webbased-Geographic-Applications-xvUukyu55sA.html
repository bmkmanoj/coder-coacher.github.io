stop by a European our result to develop
a framework for designing web by zero
fee application
our readers Petra e on west by
geographic application for example a
teacher man likes to you a west by
geographic application like the one in
this fever the world of the this
application before explaining some
French geographic concept such as
chao-li but among and graffiti o only
but among yaso approvals inside the
country and cafeteria an administrative
town inside the bottom of this
application a mess up of a test in
French a mark containing facial
information and clean list of town the
but among and give it to mobile user
users are able to select a place in the
list when clicking on a place the
correspondent turn in the test in
highlighted and the Muslims in on
display for example well click get on
cam in the test of town the workers are
highlighted in the test and the Muslims
in on can the same way happens forbid it
but it's not easy to develop a whisper
in sea of geography application beside
with programming skills we is also
requires knowledge about geographic data
base and web services so this mean
proposing a framework for simplifying
the desire oppressed by geographic
applications after that great
introduction here not the overview of
the four parts of our presentation we
will start by Allah
our framework for designing web by
erotic applications then we will present
three part of our model for the thriving
Geographic application according to tell
if I set up the framework our proposal
heavy in the music in the wind mask of
the time which could be arrest in detail
we will then canoe by talk a little
about our future work we offer a
framework for designing geo application
like illustrated in this figure the
design of e-commerce up professors
starting from the knit up is I the data
of faith identified your data
manipulated by the geographic
application then the interface ice
builds up the graphic layout of the
geographic application finally the
interruption face define integrations on
the data content inside this player at
the interface after conducting three
phases the the designer can generate
automatically the geographic application
the geograph the gene generation of code
based on model-driven engineering in
keeping with the framework we have
considered a unified model that has
three parts corresponding to three
phases of the framework
this model instructor in 23 plus the
data part destroyed different content
category of data for symbol content and
an attention the interface park d Christ
different type of these players for
possible motley displayer test displayer
honest displayer the interruption park
this price different kinds of
interaction for example zooming in on a
map or highlighting all the tests we
used our TF smn2 uncle efficient because
this used for describing resource on the
web and eastern recommendation of google
web consortium it easy to come by please
share rdf descriptions audio a secret
semantic queries on rdf descriptions we
can see we consider to cut array of data
content and annotation contently first
to multimedia contents with her may
composed of several segments why
annotation refer to the nutrition of
named entities contain my horn several
innovations referring to specific
segments to date we have been taking
into account only that you all contents
and geographic inventions consequently
as presented in this diagram test may be
segmented into paragraphs and Hopkins
and annotation will correspond
jus geographic information of course
this model part may be extended later to
take into account all the multimedia
contents this is an RTF it's a medicine
ball that corresponds to the data model
/ this decision indicates that the
five-test doc TST contango one
annotation name annotation one this
annotation about an entity name can and
this entity is located in the first
paragraph a test at the night token and
this entity associated to geolocation
represented by a polygon and geo t.v
otay of tau in our model a graphical
user interface in make up of several
these players is this player may embed
several innovations until now we have
been working with only three ties of
this layer of course this model part
made me explain it later to manage all
the type of material such as calendar
istria image display or video this real
this is an rdf SML sambal that
corresponds to the interface model park
this decision show that the graphical
user interface ents some displayer
including a multiplayer
bye-bye Astarte bill chocolate hi and
with this matte layer content an
annotation name annotation one which has
been described in the data symbol given
that a user can interact with a rough
geography application we consider that
an interaction even an event and several
actions in general and even he
characterized by two elements the tie up
even for example click the proclick
mouse over and where the event occurs or
string and even material some ashes
which had a set of visual effects in the
graphical user interface such as
highlighting and zooming for example you
have an annotation about Molly Alicia in
the dead and in the map when clicking on
Molly on in the test the maxims in on
Molly oh so the King on Molly young in
the test and even and zooming in on
Molly on the map in action this is an
RTF is amiable uncoated and alteration
correspondent to the usual in the 50
dopa as usual at the recent name in one
I defy this in the Russian content and
even name even one and a national action
one this decision explains that if a
user click on any
an attention about how in the district
to the list of the display of one will
zoom in on this annotation here you have
the the overview of the unified model in
general annotation that can be
automatically extracted maybe you to
display information inside these players
and they may be due to define user and
the Russians now let's take a look at
our prototype name win mush this allows
the designer to ray and to generate
automatically interactive with by
neurotic applications as presented in
this figure 3 phase of framework happy
implemented in pre module data interface
and user and the Russian its model man
manipulates some earlier descriptions
the merging of all descriptions
corresponds to one in son of our unified
model in order to commit a west by
geography addition we have implemented a
code generator with cody's web pages
contain java's lip injections the data
module enables a designer Julie I
approaches in train called containing
different services for example this
figure illustrates a precision chance
corresponding to the to the aslam ball
presented at the beginning of this
presentation in order to realize this
position chain
you just crap and drop some suitable
modules for example you may start with a
test you call the play attraction
servers to assure automatically places
using the end identify places use you to
filter house and the batsman to select
two sets of an attention then from the
set of towels the refrigerator service
com boosts the list of researchers from
the list of house by clicking on the Run
button the processing chain is executed
for committing data says a b c d e they
are accessible at the bottom-left model
and we believe in the interface module
the interface module enables our
designer to specify the graphical user
interface oppressed by horrific
applications in order to view an
interface like illustrated in this
figure you just crap and drop some
display us into the workings own if you
want to display some information inside
this player from the menu you have to
wrap a data set and drop it into the
destroyer for example you may want to
put the data set places in test material
you may also want to display this data
set in to map this layer 3 list display
of show information of creative city's
department and literature
this is possible to customize the sky up
HD player such as position size etc now
we have implemented a your name like
sequin diagram you do back with you can
design an interaction this figure
illustrates one in the Russian when a
user click allow content in that display
of three the hotel this tau a holiday in
the display of one and the little too we
will zoom in on this town the principle
of the science or based on crap and drop
when you finish building the ship on
diagram using our code generator you can
give you the wet value of the
application by clicking on the preview
button if the generated application
issues table for Eunice you can say that
the application on the way you can come
back to the three models in order to add
modify or remove some elements with much
in now available online at it link and
we must suppose three languages
unleashed fresh and data meet for more
details please see is in the demolition
indique work we have a framework to
decide by Urich applications our
framework cover free complimentary faces
involving data manipulated by the
application graphical user interface and
user Anderson we have shown that a
notation under center of the design
process furthermore our proposed
framework had been implemented in the
grotto time finish this prototype
contains various modules with facility
the instantiation of our unified model
and automatically generated a West buy
you a free application for for our work
we would like to in 10 the user in the
Russian model for design and mainly in
the Russian of an application
currently our project I'm only use with
tattoo or content across the data model
may be extended to deal with all the
multimedia contents such as video audio
or photo furthermore the geographic
information manipulated by winn mash can
be invested from other repositories for
example from linking data to date with
mashed generates only cited applications
we will take into account dynamic s best
to generate ridden web 20 applications
finally we plan to us both generated wet
by geographic applications in this HTML
and rdf a dis able to take advantage of
the Semantic Web thank you very much for
your attention
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
