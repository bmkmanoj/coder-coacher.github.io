with whom we work many years ago in
Borland and she was having a website
named web of culture is it still alive
yes so that's where you can find like a
lot of very interesting and like well
amazing information about how different
cultures are perceived in other cultures
so it's so it's a big matrix and now
Eileen wrote a big like hmm yeah yeah
this big and deep book with like very
long word that I tried to read and well
so it's it's worth reading but it takes
time and so she came here to give a talk
so
hello everyone um I hope you can hear me
can everyone hear me okay um I also have
handouts for everyone let me just get
those
okay as Vladimir says thank you for
inviting me today Vladimir Vladimir and
I have known each other for many years
starting back in its foreland
international about 10 years ago and I'm
going to give you a little background
upon myself and then we're gonna go into
the chat about global business
leadership and geo leadership basically
how culture affects leadership and how
leadership affects culture so and so
let's begin so I'm just a little
background about myself my educational
background I'm a BA in European studies
master's in International Management and
a doctorate in management and I
concentrate on cross-cultural
communications and on organizational
leadership then I spent 20 years in
corporate America in marketing and
management roles 10 years here in
Silicon Valley with Berlin International
I didn't put it up there but the
ill-fated point cast of anybody
remembers pointcast Nobel and Siebel
systems which of course now is Oracle
and then I have taught for the last few
years doing teaching business management
and organizational leadership courses at
such schools at the University of
Liverpool and at UC Santa Cruz and if
you like you can ask me questions if
there's any words you don't understand
or any concepts you'd like explained and
then after the chat you can also ask
questions as well
ok so let's begin what I like to do in
the beginning is sort of give it with
everyone a flavor of how the term or the
concept leadership is looked at in just
other cultures and just in other
languages what are the words for leader
or leadership so for example in German
the word is fooding and that means
guidance and within corporations
it means consisting of someone who
reduces the uncertainty in the situation
then in Arabic the work would be did
basically
shake and that means literally a matter
of a40 however in the Gulf regions and
in Saudi Arabia it means a person from
the royal family but if you go to Egypt
it means a scholar of religion so you
can even see within certain regions
there are wide variations in words in
French the word is called UK and that
means a leader is someone who guides
one's own behavior and guide others and
they command action and then if we go
into Chinese the character set for
leadership is here and that means the
leader and the lead the leader is one
who walks in front of the followers and
guides the group by teaching away so as
you can see just around the world
there's just many different perceptions
of leaders so I really like this slide
because uhm then other people will say
well in my culture this is the word and
this how we look at leadership and
especially when you look at a global
corporation like Google and you're
working on global virtual teams and
maybe everyone takes a turn being the
leader you might have very wide results
on when somebody from one country it
takes a leadership role and somebody
from the other one another country takes
a leadership role and even though you're
all working on the same team for the
same goal okay so for the purpose of
this study there are many many different
different meanings or definitions of
leadership but for the purpose of this
discussion leadership is what I've come
up with is leadership is a relationship
between the leader and the lead for the
management of resources through the
vehicle of respect because at the bottom
line leadership is all about
relationships it's how people lead how
people follow then what is culture I do
think it here chat and a intercultural
conference in Spain
and I 500 different definition than what
a sculpture but for the purpose of this
study culture is somebody the proceeds
and deal to the world from a foundation
of common linguistic and mental
characteristics so whether we know it or
not or realize it our national culture
that we were brought up and it that's
how we make decisions
so I'll sure initially I only 100 sure
okay just just want this oh thank you
now we're more official okay oh I'm
better okay I always say culture is a
one present that your parents gave you
that you can't give back
so what culture really does initially in
your in your life provides the survival
tools to how you're going to interact
with the world and I call it your
cultural comfort zone so many people
will say well I moved to another country
and I'm from let's say I moved to
Malaysia and I'm from India and let's
where can i buy the best Indian
restaurant people want to know what's
familiar to them so I've deemed this the
cultural comfort zone and with my
students to really get this point Drive
at home I ask them these three questions
I would say where were you born when
were you born into which house for you
born and so I could just take myself for
example my parents are from Ireland my
husband is from Germany but I'm my
parents from Ireland but I was born and
raised in Los Angeles but if you could
call a bicultural existence I was even
though I was raised to school in the
United States I still grew up in an
Irish house so it's classy cultures
constantly in your mindset you know you
want to be true to certain extent to the
values you were given as a child but
then you realize you know but now I'm
living and working in this culture how
can I be successful here and I did some
research when I was working in Silicon
Valley a lot of Engineers basically were
from Oracle and they were from India
and I would say to them when you have a
big decision to make in your work or
even in your life upon what cultural
values do you base it is that the native
cultural values your parents gave you or
is it the US values that you're learning
or is it say the corporate culture of
Oracle and they would say well you know
I try to encompass all three to see
what's the best result that I can make
however if there's a really important
decision I don't know what to do I was
in 95 percent of the time I will go back
to the values my parents gave me because
that's what I know that's what I'm
comfortable with and that's sort of how
I grew up to see the world and I just
find that very interesting because more
often than not that's exactly but they
say is basically I think with the age of
10 there's a very famous researcher in
terms of cross-cultural communications
he's Dutch his name is Garrett
Hofstadter and his assumption or his
thesis is that people's cultural values
are ingrained in them by the age of 12
so I always talk about you know what
language do you pray in and what
language do you count in so say you were
raised from the age of 12 in one culture
let's say you're raised in Kenya but now
you work in you live in the United
States these are this I say what
language do you count in and they'll say
you know I count in my native language
whatever that might be because that's
where I feel comfortable so I call that
the tripartite cultural variable is the
culture you grew up in the culture
you're living in and also the
organizational culture you're working in
and I'm sure here at Google you see that
every day and then a term that came to
be from this research is geo leadership
and heel leadership is leading across
cultures and geographies and it really
shows how culture affects the bottom
line and I'm sure within the
internationalization and localization
fields you see this all the time because
you're obviously making it your product
and your system your software your
coding at the end result it has to be
culturally acceptable and also logical
for someone who
you know you may not have the same
language and comment or whatever so
that's what geo leadership has evolved
to me to mean
okay now global business leadership
it's if you you have a handout here this
will go into the model here on the other
side of the card here is a handout and
then what we're talking about is this
book here that came out a couple of
months ago it's published by Elsevier in
Oxford England and the the research
studied that the data initially was sent
on in the book was a doctoral
dissertation they all the data from the
study of this research is in chapter 10
of the book and what we what we try to
do is put in the research and then apply
to case studies and what I've done for
the case studies today I have quite a
few but I mainly chose technology
companies because we're at a technology
company today there's I have lots of
examples but I want to make it more
relevant to what you're working on today
so if you want more information on it
this is a website that you can go to and
Ashley
Wladimir I'll give that to you if you
want to pass it around if anybody wants
to take a look at it okay
so again that goes in queue the geo
leadership model which you see on the
back of the card the research came up
with seven key competencies that us is
basically for the United States that US
business leaders need to know and how to
compete in a global marketplace and
there are seven key competencies that
came about from this study and they are
capability care change communication
contrast consciousness and context we'll
go into each one of those and then I had
several case studies for those as well
so you can see them more Illustrated
this is a model if you go to the website
global business leadership comm you
mouse over the model as well you'll see
the competencies you'll see a brief
description and when you mouse over
you'll see I'd leave a more in-depth
description of each competency okay so
the more details about the study was
this it was the first ever web-based
Delphi study focusing on intercultural
leadership competencies and the way
people were chosen for this study were
that they had to have at least 10 years
of intercultural experience in either
consulting or teaching or writing they
had to have published at least one book
on intercultural communication they had
to be fluent in English because the
survey was in English and they had the
access to the Internet because it was
done online and they because it was
Adelphi study one of the protocols for
that is that they did not know each
other I own I was the only one that knew
who they were so if you look at the
bottom line for this these are people
who are experts in cross-cultural
communications and in business and we
were talking to them about leadership
through their work what what are the
competencies that business leaders need
to have going forward
so the participants right now there is
26 participants for a Delphi study
you're looking at between 25 and 30 and
so we had 26 we're very happy
and this is the breakdown of the
questionnaire as they answered and there
were 11 women and there were 15 men and
they were from six of the seven
continents so we had a really wide
variety of people which is very good so
the research design if you're not quite
familiar with the Delphi study but adult
by study does is there are three rounds
of questions and we'll go through the
questions going forward but what you
want to do is you want to go to them and
say here's my question what are the you
know the competencies u.s. business
leaders need to have going forward in
terms of culture and then you ask them
three rounds of questions you give up
the first round they answer it you
distill the information the software use
for that is in vivo analytical software
for qualitative surveys then from that
those answers you give it back to them
and you say this is what you all said
the first round now do you agree with
this do you want to change anything what
do you think then they answer it again
you just steal the information again you
give it back to them one more time and
at the end of the three rounds then that
is your data sets that they have all
come and to have a consensus upon so
adult by study does is it gets consensus
among a group of experts for a
particular question and that's why this
was the methodology used for this study
the Delphi study rather methodology was
pioneered at RAND Corporation in the
1950s in Southern California so Randa
may know it's a large think-tank in
California so again we're going back to
the main question that they all had to
answer is what are the intercultural
leadership competencies for us business
leaders in the era of globalization and
to arrive at that final answer they had
to ask rather answer a series of
questions so and then from those
questions the answers that came about
were these so the
basically we asked was what can what
competencies can they learn to develop
to compete globally and the very first
one they said the leaders have to be
self-aware and so in terms of then that
translates into the geo leadership
competency of consciousness so it's a
leader needs to be self-aware of their
own cultural background and their own
bias and we'll go into case studies
going forward and you can see where
sometimes where the leaders did that or
companies did that all right sometimes
they didn't for this particular case
here it means a geo leader must expand
their consciousness because everything's
changing around them in a very fluid
environment especially virtually at the
speed of technology so the example this
is a new example I have and it's of
course from Silicon Valley I think
Facebook is just across the street
but it's Facebook in mice and MySpace in
Japan and I'm not sure if you've heard
about this so Facebook and MySpace try
to go into Japanese market or have been
trying to go in there if it's about the
last year or so however in Japan
currently there is a large social
networking site called mixi which is
strictly Japanese I mean it's not an
export from the United States it's an
in-country product and what's happening
with Facebook and MySpace is they're
having a lot of problems trying to
tackle or get into the Japanese market I
mean they're there but they're not being
successful as the in country version of
a compass
the fitnah the network called mixing so
what happens is but MySpace and Facebook
have come to realize is that
communication in Japan is a lot of is
very nonverbal so they went in basically
they took their US versions and they
plopped it in Japan and they said okay
this is how we do in the US and will
localize language but we're not really
going to take a sort of a 360-degree
view of it and
get some of the cultural variables that
are very important that a lot as we know
to a lot of this stuff is unseen it's
unspoken but it exists so with Facebook
the CEO of Facebook said you know
Facebook is so unique in that we use
people's real names and their photos and
profiles so they can network with each
other kind of like LinkedIn LinkedIn now
has photos but in the Japanese culture
more often than not the web users who
are trying to avoid this sort of direct
you know emphasis on the individual
whereas more of a collectivist culture
so but with the mixi Network they
already have a high trust as invitation
based social network and it's all in
terms of it is already sort of
culturally maximized for the job for
Japan so it was the in-country localized
version of something that wasn't a US
export but but also Facebook and MySpace
failed to even on the business side fail
to realize is that they didn't offer an
optimized version for Japanese phones
for handsets and in Japan the mobile web
is much bigger than the PC web so the
bottom line here of Facebook and MySpace
we're losing market share still because
they're not recognizing their own
cultural bias they're not saying you
know we're from the US and we're going
to go in there and we're going to try to
change things it's more you know we're
from the US we're going to go there
we're going to try to figure out how
we're going to do this correctly
according to the culture there that is
consciousness and this is just I just
put up a screenshot a mixie right now
and I actually I didn't have the one for
a Facebook it's very very simple at
Facebook but this Japanese colleague of
mine was telling me that when he saw a
Facebook Japan he's on mixing so right
away he just felt more comfortable with
the mixi version of the social
networking idea because he could tell
that it was more in tune with what he
understood so and
that's just not the translation either
so the next one is in us business
leaders but how can they recognize the
concept of culture and what the expert
panel said is you have to have cultural
immersion you have to go you have live
work be in that culture you just when I
worked for a couple of companies here in
Silicon Valley they thought they could
manage the world from a cubicle in San
Jose they never really want to go to the
country they never really want to
interact in country and so what this
sort of cultural immersion goes into his
idea of care its ballast interest so
you're looking at profit and
stakeholders but you're doing it through
respecting and mutual understanding of
each other and so of course bottom line
for any business is to make profit but
you want to retain profit while still
serving others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
