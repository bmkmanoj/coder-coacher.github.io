massage therapist at Google for over six
years I've been in the field for over 16
years and i am a workshop enthusiast
three years ago I went to a course for
continuing education and craniosacral
therapy through the uploader institute
in berkeley and our guest speakers
unique teaching style stood out at class
as an educator eric is direct and leaves
ample room for students to think for
themselves eagerly I registered for the
next course he was interred instructing
at Esalen and at that time proposed he
came to talk at Google Eric lectures to
a variety of audiences here and abroad
and a joys discussion he enjoys learners
and I enjoy that about him so I'm very
pleased to introduce Eric Moya his
background I should tell you a little
bit it is as a massage therapist in a
mental health counselor he's been
teaching and lecturing internationally
for the upload your institute for 13
years and is a form of director of
education at the Esalen Institute in Big
Sur in addition to teaching he currently
maintains practices in San Francisco
Santa Cruz and caramel all in California
he's going to talk to us today about
manual therapy which it's a big topic
all right thank you awesome alright how
are y'all doing today how's lunch
alright cool well thank you so much for
having me here today as Angela said my
name is Eric Moya I do basically have
made a career as self-identifying as a
manual therapists it was just
interesting walking around here as
Angela's been telling me I understand
that the topic of manual therapy is a
big one around here I've also been
informed that Google has a push right
now to kind of help its employees with
work-life balance and then even though
things I saw that there was an
advertisement for craniosacral therapy
in the bathroom just now as well and
I've also been told that there's some
curiosity here at Google around
craniosacral therapy or other forms of
manual therapy massage therapy is fairly
understandable the most people you know
when you somebody talks about
tahj we know what that is and yet there
are some skills out there and some
techniques which look really different
some of them called craniosacral therapy
some of them working under other titles
and so I understand that there's been
some interesting discussion about that
as well you know hey is there any
evidence to support craniosacral therapy
what is this all about why does it look
the way it does so I'm essentially here
today to talk a little bit about manual
therapy you'll notice I didn't actually
specifically call it craniosacral
therapy because craniosacral therapy is
a wonderful modality but it's just one
way of looking at things and the reality
is is that there is a whole wide world
of manual therapy techniques out there
that I thought I would try to introduce
you introduced into this lecture a
little bit as well and then we'll see
where we go from there one of my
favorite things of all time is I love
meeting new people and i really love
learning new skill sets and i always get
kind of curious of when people have a
skill set that's radically different
from my own and so to that end it's a
real gift to be here at Google and to
get the chance to talk to all of you all
and at least for the next 40 minutes or
45 minutes or so hopefully to kind of
introduce you into the world of manual
therapy a little bit and then entertain
some questions and see where we go from
there so my goals for this particular
lecture what I'm hoping that we
accomplish within the next little chunk
of time is I definitely with them hoping
that we give you an introduction to the
world of manual therapy a little tiny
bit and I'd like to suggest some
possibilities for how manual therapy
might be able to help you you know help
you physically help you mentally maybe
with the mind body my hope is to give
you enough information to help you
decide if modalities such as
craniosacral therapy or manual therapy
are right for you and then if you do
decide that's the case my hope is maybe
to offer a couple of suggestions for how
to get as much as possible out of your
sessions and then we'll definitely have
some question and answer at the end
where the floor will really be open for
whatever you have in mind so let me
begin by just giving you a little bit of
an overview of a lecture and then we'll
get started with the presentation I'm
going to begin by just defining manual
therapy a little tiny bit then
and in the short period of time we can't
cover the entire breadth of manual
therapy but one subject I would like to
talk a little bit about today is
specifically a type of connective tissue
called fasha and the reason why I'm
going to kind of anchor our talk and
fasha today hopefully will become
clearer it becomes kind of a linchpin
for understanding manual therapy in
general and so we'll talk about that and
it also kind of a straight route their
top okay oh can you all mute please oh
wow look at that cool all right these
are all people who are joining us from
elsewhere all right on that's cool ok
back to where we were so we'll talk
about Vasya kind of as a linchpin for
kind of how we understand manual therapy
and also kind of grounding our talk and
concrete stuff stuff that we know stuff
that we can point at things that we can
touch it that we can touch we will we'll
try to build an overall understanding of
tissue health that is deeply holistic
rather than reductive when a kind of my
agendas or goals for the day hopefully
we will do in illustrating exercise with
some finger cots where we'll actually
have you participate in that one a
little tiny bit it's real simple though
you can just do it right where you're at
and then I want to talk about basically
contributing factors and how problems
arise in the body and just kind of
shifting our point of view a little bit
from how we might normally think of
massage therapy and then we'll offer
some concrete ideas for how manual
therapy works some suggestions from what
to expect from a session and then we'll
close our talk and with with hopefully a
little bit of time for Question and
Answer and then I'm certainly planning
on sticking around a little bit as well
to just entertain whatever conversation
topics you happen to have all right so
without further ado let's go ahead and
get started with the presentation a
little tiny bit I remember when I was
going through my master's program for
counseling I had one of our professors
really left me with three questions that
I thought would be good questions to
kind of help build our lecture around
today
and when you go through a master's
program in counseling you know there are
lots of different approaches to how to
work with people and how to kind of help
them understand themselves and each
little way of looking at things can be
radically different and people can get
into big fights with each other about
the best way to do things and my
professor would basically say that any
healing modality any system of work
that's trying to help people any healing
modality worth its salt is essentially
trying to answer three questions really
well and the three questions are what
makes people tick what makes people sick
and what makes them well again and if
you think about those three questions
they're wonderful questions that you can
apply to any healing modality out there
whether it's acupuncture or chiropractic
or Ayurvedic medicine or physical
therapy or any other approach just try
to keep in mind those three questions
what makes people tick what makes people
sick and what makes them well again I
wanted to share that with you because
then basically used a does a little bit
of a template to build our lecture today
and that's basically what I'm hoping
that we keep coming back to a little
tiny bit and at least in a small way I'm
hoping that we might touch upon those in
the next half hour or so as well so with
that in mind that went ahead and created
the three questions up here in the
presentation just so that we can see
them of course what makes people tick
what makes people sick and what makes
them well again let's look at this from
a manual therapy point of view and
before we really dive into that let me
just give you a little bit of a
definition of manual therapy as well so
I teach craniosacral therapy most people
tend to think of me as a craniosacral
guy however I self-identify as a manual
therapists because it's actually a
broader term it's a term that
encompasses way more than any one
specific modality I specifically choose
to use the term manual therapy as
opposed to the term massage therapy
because massage therapy tends to connote
certain meanings whenever we use a term
massage therapy people naturally have a
tendency to think in terms of taking
their clothes off they naturally have a
tendency to think of oils and creams
involved and there are lots of kind of
images that sort of come along with that
whereas the reality is is the breadth of
manual therapy is huge there are lots of
really highly intelligent people out
are working very hard to constantly
create new ways of trying to help health
and to work with people in the most
effective ways possible and so I use
manual therapy kind of as a bucket term
as a larger term that encompasses more
than any one modality might mean now my
definition of manual therapy is pretty
concrete it's basically therapy that
involves touch if you have a
practitioner that's touching you and
that the end that somehow that touch is
supposed to help you heal or help you
get better in some way shape or form
then we're going to refer to that as
manual therapy was just to give you some
examples of manual therapy soft tissue
Mobile's mobilization anytime that
you're moving the soft tissues and
trying to help them become loser that
would be manual therapy joint
mobilization where you're moving limbs
around and helping joints come into
healthier relationship with each other
that would count as manual therapy
basically working with the bones muscles
tissues nerves blood vessels basically
anything that can be physically touched
we can sort of refer to as manual
therapy and then of course as you can
imagine with my backgrounds both as a
massage therapist and as a mental health
counselor I'm a big fan of the mind-body
effects too i absolutely believe that
the mind of body are connected to each
other and so we're going to have some of
those benefits as well in the whole
process alright so let's go back to our
roadmap a little tiny bit of what makes
people tick let me get your
participation in on this let's just
answer that broadly if you would just
toss some stuff out there what are some
ideas you have for what makes people
tick what makes people function please
let's get some food right on love it
especially at lunchtime what else water
absolutely food water sleep movement
save more who said movement could you
say a little bit more which in which you
imagine by that absolutely exercise nice
relationships that's an important one
nature I'm good perfect yeah you guys
are great I'll just I took a stab at a
few myself but I mean you can all answer
that in to some extent we're going to
answer that a little bit uniquely for
ourselves a couple of the ones that I
just tossed out there meaning and
purpose connection
basic life needs of course which would
be the food and water aspect health
community some of you noticed I took a
moment to double-click on the whole
movement comment they're different and
when as in manual therapy there are
different ways to look at movement there
is absolutely movement in terms of
exercise and gross movement there's also
movement on the subtle body level as
well some of my osteopath friends
sometimes have a saying where they'll
say you don't grow old you just stop
moving and when i hear them refer to
that they're to me i always hear them
say that in terms of a physical exercise
level but also that our bodies are just
characterized by movement and we'll
actually get a chance to revisit that a
little bit more later as well so now
coming back into the topic of i mean we
just sort of answered the overall
question of what makes people tick in a
general way because this is a topic
about manual therapy let's talk about
what might how we might answer that from
a manual therapy point of view and on
the tissue level this is where i want to
talk about the to where i want to talk
about the idea of Faja or connective
tissue called fasha just a quick show of
hands how many of you here have ever
heard the term pacha before oh good nice
that's a whole bunch of you and you know
what having been in this field for just
under 20 years people are more and more
familiar with the idea fossa than they
ever have been before and that's part of
the reason why we'll talk about it today
it's increasingly becoming that thing
that helps us all understand what we're
all working with no matter how we're
approaching it now if you're not
familiar with the term fossa pasha is
just a word that refers to a very
specific type of connective tissue we
all know there are different types of
tissue in the body there is muscular
tissue there's nervous tissue there's
epithelial tissue and then there's
connective tissue in our case we're
talking about connective tissue it's all
the tissues in your body which connect
stuff to each other and specifically
we're talking about one type of
connective tissue called fasha if you've
ever for those of you who happen to eat
meat if you've ever bought a chicken
breast and taking it home bashas
basically that covering that covers the
chicken breast if you've ever eaten a
piece of beef jerky and you pull the
pieces of the beef apart and have those
little white fibers a little
that's basically fasha it's a connective
tissue that really connects everything
in the body together so I did toss a
couple of pictures up there just to sort
of give you a little bit of a visual but
really if you've ever just kinda pulled
apart a piece of beef jerky or cut open
a piece of chicken or just somehow in
your background pulled apart a muscle in
some form or another then you pretty
much have an idea of what we're talking
about with Pasha oh and by the way since
we're having lunch I made sure to put a
whole lot of really gory dissection
slides in here okay I'm joking no this
is about it actually you'll be thankful
to know I saw a couple of smiles when
they put that picture up alright alright
so let's ground or talk about Pasha a
little bit more what is fossa things for
you to kind of know things free to just
be aware of it's a type of connective
tissue that means it connects stuff in
your body one of the things I hope you
really understand is that Pasha is
everywhere in the body it is prevalent
everywhere in the body just to give you
an idea Pasha forms the immediate
environment of every single cell in your
body it wraps every it wraps every acts
on the wraps every nerve it wraps every
muscle fiber asha is a way to basically
say that the whole body is connected to
itself and increasingly in the world of
manual therapy when people start talking
about the dynamic interconnectedness of
the body they start talking to fossa
because it's the tissue means by which
you can have a problem in one part of
the area or you can have a problem in
one part of the body that's actually
impacting the entire body rather than
just that one local little area and
that's one of the ideas that we're
trying to really build on a little bit
today as well now in addition the
connecting stuff asha allows human
movement basically you can think of Faja
as layer slipping and sliding past each
other when i do something as simple as
take my arm and move my arm up above my
head a whole lot of really amazing
things have to happen in my body all the
muscles have to change relationship with
each other they have to slip in slide
and move around past that bone and yet
at the same time i need to be able to
get blood flow to my extremities i need
to be able to have nervous innervation
to my extremities all this movement has
to happen and yet every
team still has to function just fine
fasha is the reason that that can happen
it enables everything could slip and
slide around past each other another key
thing I'm hoping that you kind of walk
away with when you think about Asha is
that we have nerves that go to Tasha so
what that means is that your fasha is
under control of your nervous system
when your body needs your fasha to
change it will it also means that you
receive information about your body
through your faja as well you feel
through your fossa part of your sense of
who you are part of how you feel comes
is information that comes to you through
this connective tissue that we're
talking about another point that I'm
hoping that you walk away with on this
one is to basically know that Tasha is
constantly changing its dynamically
adapting the situations as your life
changes around you your connective
tissue is trying to adapt in order to
help you more appropriately work with
that part of you and then the last point
and I've already mentioned this the
reason why we're talking about today is
this is the stuff that is connecting
wildly different approaches to the body
this is the conversations and dialogues
around Pasha is what helps people make
sense out of Massage Therapy
craniosacral therapy visceral
manipulation and all these other
different modalities alright so thank
you for that little piece now let's move
on to our next little question of like
what makes people sick and if we can
let's get your participation on this as
well again let's start out big and then
we'll move into manual therapy if you
would let me get some from you all what
makes people sick lack of sleep terms
abs I love it bacteria germs lack of
sleep I've heard what else stress
definitely Brahma definitely both
psychological and physical of course
yeah immobility yeah well then that
would go back to that dynamically
changing Pasha I mean if we're a couch
potato and we if we sit on the couch all
day long our connective tissues going to
change dynamically to make us better
couch potatoes mm-hmm that's a fully
appropriate yes
okay all right hmm airplanes commuting
yeah all right so now let's answer this
from a manual therapy point of view a
little tiny bit from a fossil point of
view we're going to talk about
restrictions basically if ash is meant
to move if it's meant to be mobile
anything that basically stops the
movement from happening is going to
start creating a problem and so in this
case a restriction is just a simple
place where there's no longer mobility
where there once was you can think of a
restriction as stuckness immobility
where there once was no ability or that
there should be mobility now this is
where we start making a little bit of a
paradigm shift and a little bit of a
worldview shift a little place in your
body where your fasha is stuck is not a
big deal it's medically insignificant
it's not going to show up on the test
it's not really something to even really
be concerned about but in manual therapy
we're not really concerned about
individual restrictions what we are
concerned about is we're concerned about
the sum of all the restrictions in your
body let's be clear you have
restrictions in your body right now I
have restrictions in my body we all have
restrictions it doesn't necessarily mean
that we're having symptoms or problems
we only start having symptoms or
problems when your body can no longer
compensate for them so that's where we
start saying things like a symptom is
merely the bodies and ability to
compensate any longer and that when your
therapist is starting to put their hands
on you and they're starting to work with
you what they're really concerned with
is the sum total of the restrictions in
your body rather than any individual
restriction and that kind of makes
things a little bit more complicated so
here i have a little picture to kind of
illustrate sort of the idea of a fossil
web it's a little bit of an
oversimplification but it's a good one
and you can see in this picture here
it's basically a picture of a person
with sort of a body stocking on and then
they have a hook kind of coming along
and pulling on that and hopefully what
you're looking at are seeing is that
even though you can see where the source
of the restriction is its where the hook
is contacting that body stocking the
impacts of that are really going to be
global I mean that's a person who might
come in
of left shoulder pain or perhaps inner
thigh pain on the left leg or something
else along those lines if you would just
right where you're seated just grab your
shirt right there just grab your shirt
on the shoulder and just pull it to one
side and that's a pretty good example
it's like you can see it's like where do
you feel it in my case I feel it right
here even though we all know that that's
where the problem and absolutely if I
have this for a long period of time and
I come to you for some help I'm going to
want you to touch me right here but yet
all the work in the world right there
isn't necessarily going to make it go
away long-term the only way it's going
to go away long term is if we actually
address where the source of the poll
seems to be coming from so let's just
double click on that point for just a
moment in that part of what we're trying
to do or a little shift that we just
made is to significantly d couple to
uncouple sources of problems and
symptoms that symptoms are different
from what's actually causing them and so
it also means that another kind of
paradigm shift has to happen where we're
now moving away from cause and effect
and we're now moving into more of a
whole system's picture or kind of a
complicated picture who did we lose the
presentation there get that back on
there there we go okay and that instead
of since the whole language of cause and
effect doesn't really work anymore then
we start adopting a different language
where we talk about contributing factors
and something that I'm hoping we're
getting to as well is that solutions are
nonlinear when you have a causal world
it's easy to say hey when this happens
this happens over here so if you don't
do that then this doesn't happen but
once you start talking about dynamic and
dynamically interconnected systems it
doesn't really become that simple so if
we can I actually want to take us
through a little bit of an exercise and
can we get you all to hand out the
finger cuffs so what your what each
interview is going to be receiving is a
little tiny finger cot and don't do
anything with it yet just kind of hold
it in front of you and then we'll all
work with it together great Thank You
Angela thank you
let's see let me go ahead and stop
sharing this and once again just take
one finger cot and don't do anything
with it quite yet this is usually about
the point where the jokes begin yes we
all know what they look like so for
those of you who might be watching a
recorded version of this basically a
finger cot is just a little piece of
rubber that looks like a little mini
condom basically and so what we're doing
and if you have one of these at home or
wherever you can totally try this at
home and so what you're going to do is
if you would just take that finger cut
and what like you do is to actually just
roll it straight down the index finger
some people are always embarrassingly
good at this skill and some people are
always embarrassingly bad at this skill
alright so once you have the finger cot
rolled down the finger just write down
the finger does everybody have one by
the way we're good alright so if you
would what like you do is to just kind
of well just always wear the jokes begin
so if you would just kind of go internal
for a moment just kind of tune in to
yourself I mean you can leave your eyes
open but just kind of pay attention to
your internal States a little tiny bit
if you would maybe put the food down or
letting the other outside distractions
just go away for just a couple of
moments and once you feel like you're
kind of internal and your kind of paying
attention to how your body is feeling at
the moment what I'd like you to do is to
just kind of hold your hand out in front
of you like so and don't rest your elbow
on the table or anything we just kind of
want a little bit out in front of you
and just start doing this with your hand
and what a while you're doing that I
want you to pay attention to all to
basically your proprioception of your
arm in other words what does your hand
feel like right now what does your wrist
feel like right now what does your elbow
feel like what
your shoulder feel like you might even
go global how does your overall shoulder
feel how does your back feel just really
tuning into yourself while you're
flexing your hand like this and once you
feel like you have a good sense of how
your body is operating at this
particular moment now what I'd like you
to do is to take the finger cut and just
really twist it around and the trick is
going to be to twist it around enough
that it's actually kind of uncomfortable
where you can actually see it twisted
and torqued around your finger you
should be able to both see it and feel
it torqued around your finger and once
you have it torqued around your finger
pretty significantly again go internal
and start doing that with your hand and
notice what changes you feel in your arm
and your wrist right now and if you
really tuned in and you have it torqued
pretty well what you're starting to
notice is that your arm is actually
wanting to kind of twist undo it all
right all able to feel that yeah it's
pretty significant and what you might
notice is your arm will really be
working to undo that twist until it kind
of can't go any further and then it
might try going the other direction and
if you would just keep doing that for a
while and tune into that sense of your
body trying to undo that twist all on
its own and then not only pay attention
to your body trying to undo the twist
but if you pay really close attention
you'll notice that there's some place in
your body that seems to be taking the
brunt of that compensation one little
part of you that's tightening up a bit
more than anywhere else in my case at
the moment that happens to be in my
lower back but where it's going to be
for you is going to be unique to you
alright so your homework is to wear this
for 15 years and then come see me for a
session no not really alright you can
pick it off if you want thank you for
that so just a couple of conclusions to
a couple of things to point out about
the exercise particularly if you did
feel your body trying to undo that twist
now in that short period of time I think
your body trying to undo that twist is
primarily a neurological event in other
words it's your nervous system trying 10
do it but please remember that our
muscles and their bones and our fasha is
constantly dynamic and adapting so if
you did have that on your body for a
couple of years or even a couple of
weeks your muscles would start
transforming your tissues would start
transforming your very bones would start
changing in order to try to accommodate
that restriction another point i want to
bring out about that as well for some of
you when you had that on your finger
somewhere along the way you probably
would have noticed some place in your
body that seemed to be carrying the
brunt of that twist it's interesting to
note that maybe you're feeling it in
your shoulder maybe you're feeling in
your elbow but you know exactly where
the restriction is stemming from over a
long period of time you would be going
to practitioner for help where it stops
not where it started to take this
exercise to even another level let's say
that you did that with one-finger cotton
then you did that with the second finger
cot what you would feel is the place
that takes the brunt of the compensation
shifts in your body to another location
and they could do a third finger cot and
it shifts again and the fourth and it
shifts again until you're sitting there
with 10 different finger cots on your
fingers and somewhere along the way
you'd end up tuning into one part of
your body that seems to be carrying the
brunt of not just one restriction but
all ten of those if that were maintained
for a long period of time you'd be going
asking for help for that part of you
that starts to paint a little bit of a
picture I think of the world that manual
therapists are trying to work with how
the help a person kind of work with
those theoretically let's pretend that
you could have two people with the same
identical right shoulder pain of such a
thing were possible one person's right
shoulder pain might be a result of 10
years of restrictions accumulated
another might be a result of an injury
that happened a couple months ago for
the person with the simpler problem it
might be a matter of relieving a couple
of restrictions or shoulder pain feels
better and they think you're a miracle
worker for the other ones that might be
a matter of working with the
restrictions over and over and over and
over until eventually the person gets to
the desired outcome of being free of
shoulder pain all right so thank you for
that contributing factor for that finger
caught exercise this is one of the
reasons why I start making it that we
where we make a shift away from talking
about cause and effect everybody wants
to know it's like I heard here
is that well the Y gets to be really
complicated answer for just a very
reason that we were talking about and so
instead when we start talking about
contributing factors we've got lots of
them you have biological ones who you
are how your body is built what's your
genetic history we have psychological
factors are you happy are you sad or Y
under stress are you well rested all
those factors go into your experience of
your subjective experience of pain and
discomfort you have environmental
factors you have social factors you have
lifestyle factors you have spiritual
factors from our point of view we have
to work with all of that and so now once
we're considering all of that then we
eventually have to go back to the
question and back to the whole purpose
of why we're doing this lecture once
again is what makes people well again in
manual therapy missa ok let me back up a
little bit massage therapy probably take
off clothes oops sorry sorry about that
probably take out yeah there's a little
surprised they're hurt so massage
therapy probably you're thinking you
take off your clothes you probably are
thinking that there's going to be some
massaging of the muscles that's pretty
clear to understand but how do you make
sense of it when the practitioner is
just holding a part of the body really
still for a while or something else
along those lines more typical of types
of work such as craniosacral therapy or
other light touch manual therapies
generally speaking you can take all
manual therapy techniques never created
across all the modalities and you can
basically classify technique since as in
one of two categories direct technique
and indirect technique direct technique
is anytime you tighten tissues and try
to make them softer that way indirect
technique is anytime you soften tissues
and try to make them get better that way
it's that simple they're both both
techniques are talking about the same
type of restriction just different
approaches to it most of what we think
of is direct technique massage therapy
you find a tight area you push on
that would be direct technique you have
a tight muscle you stretch it that would
be direct technique most of what we
think of as body work is usually direct
technique the idea of direct technique
is simple it's tight you tighten it some
more that gives some information to the
nervous system this is how I'm
uncomfortable and the hope is is that
the nervous system processes that sends
the signal says okay let's loosen up we
don't like it anymore that's direct
technique indirect technique still just
as effective but it's the opposite
approach the idea with indirect
technique is you find a tight area you
soften everything and d stimulate it
it's like giving the nervous system
information that says hey look how nice
this is to not be tightening more
wouldn't you like to have that be like
this all the time nervous system then
process it sends back information makes
an adjustment and softens up the whole
area two different approaches to the
same restriction both of them very
effective sometimes you might choose one
sometimes you might choose the other but
literally you can divide almost all of
manual therapy into one of those two
categories though the explanations for
both of those involved working with the
nervous system and indirect techniques
tend to look and feel slower and gentler
when you have a practitioner working
with you with their hands still for a
while chances are that they're actually
softening up tissues and trying to give
your body a feedback loop that show is
it how nice it is to not have that be
tight anymore or if they move your limb
into a position where there's almost no
discomfort whatsoever that's a technique
that's trying to help things soften up
in that event in that fashion alright so
we're getting close to a time where we
need to move to question and answer we
just have two more slides and they
really appreciate your attention but let
me just do a couple more points and then
we'll take some questions here four
types of work such as craniosacral
therapy or other light touch manual
therapies in addition to focusing more
on indirect technique they're also tend
to be some really core values to the
work core values that your practitioner
is likely to have or beliefs that
they're likely to have in the process of
working with you and I just want to make
sure they share
couple of those with you as well for
some of you these values might be really
attractive for some of you may um of you
maybe not so much one of the really core
values to modality is at 10 such as
craniosacral that tend to really rely on
indirect technique is a belief that the
body has a tremendous amount of
knowledge about how to heal itself and
stay alive it's like this chorus dance
hey guess what your body knows more
about how to keep you alive then I can
never know as a practitioner and my body
knows more about how to keep me alive
then you can never know as a
practitioner and so that's sort of a
deep value that really informs that type
of work also because indirect techniques
tend to look slower and gentler they're
usually tends to be a strong value of
minimal invasiveness it's like hey if I
have a choice between using five pounds
of pressure to make the restriction go
away or five grams of pressure to make
the research and go away often times the
value would be well I'd rather choose
the five grams and the idea behind that
is that with the minimal invasiveness
it's more empowering to your body to
figure out how to heal itself rather
than me as a practitioner trying to do
that for you another one is meeting the
client where they're at really believing
that hey if you have more information
about how to heal yourself and stay
alive the best possible therapeutic
stance i could take is to really listen
to you and meet you where you're at and
find out what's most important to you
another core value the body is
interconnected hopefully that's not a
tough sell especially after the whole
Tasha talk that we just did fracture and
function are intertwined you have parts
in your body they're designed to do jobs
those are intertwined in a really deep
way and try to work with that in a
productive fashion and then last one and
this comes back to her point from before
this idea that movement is help and it's
this idea that from the moment I'm
conceived to the moment i die i have
this body that is characterized by
movement because i don't have roots that
pull up nutrients from the soil and I
don't have chlorophyll that converts the
sun's energy into sugar so the own my
only tie to life is basically moving
around from place to place and putting
things into my mouth and beyond that
that's just the beginning the movement
we
masticatory movement that chews up the
food we have peristaltic movement that
moves it all throughout our system we
have a nutrient transport that moves it
into the blood we have blood transport
that moves it everywhere else and we
have elimination movement that gets to
waste out of our body as well and it's
this core idea that what ties us to life
is our ability to move not on the gross
level but on the cellular level as well
the why so what can you expect to
benefit now we're moving into the
concrete stuff what can you expect to
benefit from by going to the massage
program here at Google or trying some of
the other modalities that there are out
there as well your muscles your muscles
become softer that be normalization the
muscular hypertonicity your muscles get
softer particularly the tight ones next
one your fasha the tension in your fasha
gets softened up so that way there's
better movement better blood flow better
lymph flow better movement muscular flow
in your body increase joint mobility
particularly in areas where your joints
don't move as freely as they should
decrease pain common one that a lot of
people tend to experience increased
strength when your muscles are a healthy
length they're able to function more
optimally and then I want to point out
that with massage therapy we generally
tend to think of massage is working with
muscles in contemporary manual therapy
you have systems of work out there that
can really work with every single body
system out there you have people
developing techniques that work with the
nerves the work with the brain and
spinal cord that work with the organs
and the viscera work with the fluids of
your body including the lymphatic system
as well as your musculoskeletal system
so quite literally there's no part of
your body that can't be unaffected by a
skilled manual therapy practitioner and
then of course given my background I'm
always going to want to talk a little
bit about my body effects as well there
are lots of claims that can be made
about my body effects and so I'm just
going to keep this as concrete as
possible in a nutshell you have your
nervous system there are some functional
divisions to your nervous system called
the fight-or-flight response or they
pair the rest and digest response and
they're really core divisions to your
nervous system that were designed a long
time ago to basically keep you
fight or flight for all those portions
of your body that get activated when
you're in danger rest and digest or
those portions of your body which are
activated when you have the luxury of
being safe in the therapeutic session
when you're on the table in the dark
room with a practitioner in a relatively
you know and what feels like a safe
environment that's the opportunity where
we get to experience all of those
parasympathetic rest and digest benefits
so the benefits such as better
relaxation better sleep if you're under
a lot of stress even if you're under
stress a good chunk of your day even an
hour break out of your day goes a long
way towards helping d stimulate that
nervous system and give your body a
different experience than what it's been
doing it's like a very important little
break and so that also helps with
digestion when you're under stress you
can't digest your food well you're a
body's ability to heal itself is
actually governed by the rest and digest
system because from your body is logic
healing is a luxury of being alive in
other words if you're being chased in
the woods by a tiger your body isn't
concerned with properly healing that cut
that you got yesterday it's more
concerned about keeping you alive so
please remember that your ability to
heal is dependent on your ability to be
relaxed and rested proper elimination
and proper reproductive function all
your reproductive functions all your
sexual functions are basically tied to
your ability to relax and digest as well
and then physical compensation do have
mental components as well alright so
what am i hoping that you really kind of
take away from this whole presentation
most of all receiving sessions provides
a much-needed break to your body in your
mind I'm hoping that you're realizing
that the effects are longer than just a
hour that the effects are both
short-term and long-term if you choose
to go for sessions here at Google or try
craniosacral or try try massage or
whatever you choose to do to get the
most out of your session relax as full
as you fully as you can and you are
fully entitled to expect it to be
entirely about you often time
the best way that you can kind of
approach a session is sort of a here and
now focus a present moment focus so I'd
encourage you be open to whatever
thoughts memories feelings sensations
you have basically it's like a
meditation or mindfulness process the
more aware and tracking you are going in
your own body it actually helps the
releases happen quicker believe it or
not and then also you given our talk
about Pasha and dynamic
interconnectedness I'm hoping hoping
hoping hoping that what you are walking
away from is that the solution to your
personal health goals might have
multiple contributing factors so I'm
hoping that you're not really looking at
cause and effect so much as like wow
what are all the factors going on in my
life that might be contributing to my
problem whatever that happens to be
alright so we'll go ahead and shift over
to some questions again just really
thank you for your attention and your
engagement thank you for being willing
to do that finger caught exercise yeah
if you need more information you can go
on there I do I have not put it up yet
my intention is to tonight put up
basically a list of works consulted and
works cited for this presentation
tonight so that way if you're interested
or you want to pursue a little more
information you can go check those out
alright so any questions you betcha
thank you please
in the past I've benefited from so as
massage are there similar modalities
that go down into deeper tissues in
other parts of the body absolutely I
would actually say there are probably
lots of modalities that really get very
deep believe it or not some of the even
the lighter touch modalities actually
get there very deeply just get there in
indirect ways but I'm really happy to
hear about your experience with so as
massage that having those deep flexors
worked can really kind of open up whole
body lines yeah if she says that was
very helpful with pain control
absolutely yeah we don't I think so as
work can often be a good example of the
body being interconnected to itself
because we can end up with pain in the
back or pain in other parts of the body
that we wouldn't naturally connect to
that muscle way down deep in there yeah
great yeah and willing to go one step
further as well muscles don't always
fire when they're supposed to as well so
sometimes having the contact and the
stimulation kind of helps them fire when
they should do great thank you please
mm-hmm sure just comment on the
craniosacral rhythm and the nervous
system specifically or her
I would say that the craniosacral rhythm
is a very important premise I don't know
that it would actually call the main
premise I mean a lot of the techniques
that we that we use in that modality
actually aren't dependent on the cranial
rhythm at all and are more accurately
described in terms of the manual therapy
stuff that we've talked about now there
is a rhythm in the body called the
cranial rhythm there's dispute about
that but it's it's a rhythm that least
practitioners believe that they can feel
are trained to palpate and it's a rhythm
that essentially expresses itself in the
form of an external rotation and an
internal rotation of the body and
basically an overall expansion and
contraction of the cranium the belief
and the perception is that it is a
physiological and the physical rhythm
that just happens at a level too small
to see and so that so craniosacral
practitioners will palpate that rhythm
in an effort to basically identify
restrictions now there are different
approaches to craniosacral therapy and
the one where we tend to focus on most
of all the argument would be that the
perception of the rhythm in the body is
actually a fossil tone response a gentle
facial tightening and loosening based on
what's happening in the central nervous
system and so the practitioners that we
train our tuning into any areas in the
body where there is a lack of rhythm as
basically being a place to identify
where the fossil restrictions are and so
therefore it comes back to being a
fashion modality at the end please is
there or I'm not sure they got your
answer your question fully but oh right
on yeah mmm-hmm great you bet
okay um i would say different approaches
put different focuses on the importance
of that rhythm samode allottees really
make it front and center others not so
much so other than to say that very much
is an important part yeah great please
yeah thanks I so I was just curious
about the cranial type of massage like
what really is that and what does it
mean and then I just have a comment for
anyone here in the office on Monday
we're having a speaker come in who wrote
a book called mind over medicine and it
dr. Lissa Rankin so if everyone's
interested in this please come to the
talk it's a continuation of how your
mind and body are connected with how you
can heal yourself yeah oh that's cool
that you're having Lisa come in yeah I
know her okay I'm sorry I got focused on
but the question is what does that
create like what is the actual look what
is that technique mean and like what is
the cranials type of massage uh overall
I would say that craniosacral therapy in
its most advanced form is the
practitioners are basically looking for
restrictions in the body and trying to
make them go away with the chosen value
of using the least amount of influence
necessary to get the job done so as a
modality it tends to look very slow it
tends to look very gentle i would say
effects happen basically with subtle
pressures over a long period of time but
even though the work is called
craniosacral it's actually a whole-body
modality so it's working throughout all
your body systems now on the portions of
the modality which are on the head hence
the term craniosacral it tends to look
slow so you'd have a practitioner
basically picking you know you have the
different bones in the cranium and so
you'd have a practitioner trying to
basically pick up a bone help it get
good relationship with the other bones
of the cranium and then also use it as a
handle in order to stretch out the
membranes underneath as well and it's
one of the places where it's
gets we have to look at it at the holes
like you can't release only a frontal
bone to make only a headache go away in
a sense but so much of like trying to
work with the whole system of which the
techniques in the cranium might be a
really important part of that that
helped go all right well let's go ahead
and close thank you so much everybody
have a wonderful afternoon and the
wonderful day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
