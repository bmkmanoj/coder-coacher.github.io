afternoon my name is blondie Northland
I'm French as my ex
and I'll try to tell you a bit more
about the energy world tour which is a
project that in redondo and myself did
last year we traveled during seven
months in 17 different countries to try
to meet with people that innovate in the
field of energy and so in this
presentation I'll try to tell you a bit
about why I think it's important that we
talk about energy how we try to promote
these questions and raise awareness in
France on this topic and then go through
a few projects that we've seen during
that wall tour before just telling you
very briefly what we've done after that
please interrupt knew it was any
questions that you may have and and let
me know if I speak too fast because I
tend to get a little excited when I talk
about this project sometimes so let's go
ahead so what do we need to talk about
energy and what how is it into
environment and development in general
for the past 30 and 20 years more
especially people have been getting more
and more concerned about the fact that
human activities are having a big impact
on the environment and I can we can date
like a strong commitment to trying to
make things better from 1987 when the
brinton Commission put together a report
which were whose name was our common
future and which st. as the formal
definition of where sustainable
development is a development that takes
care of economics social and
environmental aspects of development and
enterprises ten years later the Kyoto
Protocol which you all I have to heard
about I guess took into account the fact
that human industrial activities are
sending more and more greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere and this is measured
in terms of concentration of co2 and the
atmosphere and that has been raising an
increasing from 280 ppm before the
Industrial Revolution in Europe to more
than 350 ppm today and a lot of
awareness has been giving to that topic
because this is related to global
warming so tons of graphics have been
set a foot together to try to explain
this correlation this one here just
gives you the co2 variation and shows
how it has been increasing
in the last few years so the as you can
see that the graphic is in years ago and
not years in the future that's all we
already usually set so not only have we
exceeded the concentration that were
reached in four hundred thousand years
before today but we've we've by passin
by a huge amount and this is linked to
temperature variations that could become
quite a problematic for the development
of our planet how is co2 linked to
temperature well this is a greenhouse
effect that you know about and a lot of
people are asking so what's the problem
with it there's several aspects of the
problem when is a temperature variation
has consequences on the environment such
as rising sea levels changing climates
increasing patterns of dc's
proliferation etc but how much can we
expect this increase in temperature to
be and that's the second problem we
don't know there's a lot of uncertainty
on how much temperature change will be
accounted by the increase in emissions
and this is a chart put together by the
MIT drone program on the science and and
policy of climate change and tries to
tell you well you know this is a climate
to will it's like a roulette wheel we
don't know but there are probabilities
associated to each of this temperature
rises given a certain pattern of
emissions so if we don't put sorry if
you don't put any constraints on our
emissions and continue the business of
usual patterns which is really
increasing very fast as shown on the
previous graph well there's a very
strong possibility that will exceed 2 to
3 degrees because that's how all the
rest of the chart is a possibility of
going to a temperature increase bigger
than 2 to 3 degrees to give you some
idea of what this means the last glacial
age was only three degrees in
temperature lower than today and a
change in five degrees was associated to
the largest extinction of species when
the diner's etc died millions of years
ago the change was only a five degrees
and that change occurred on the period
for several thousands of year we're
talking about it change that would
happen in a century so it's not only a
big change but it's also a very rapid
one and it's quite unlikely that living
species could add up to it as easily as
they did in the past when ninety-five
percent of them got extinct so what
would happen if we did not follow this
business of the usual pattern will try
to constrain our emissions 25 50 ppm fat
50 ppm is about twice the level of
pre-industrial age and when we do so we
realize that the probability of being
lower than two degrees which is a target
that the European Union has committed to
as I say we will try to curb our
emissions so that we can reach a maximum
of two degree increase in temperature
becomes about fifty percent so this is a
motivation for a lot of people to say
well even if we don't know exactly what
will happen even if there's a slight
possibility that by doing nothing we
would stick to two to three degrees it's
much better if we do something because
the probability of getting things
constrained in a reasonable spectrum are
much higher it's like an insurance
policy basically that we're buying by
trying to curb our emissions so this
will affect climate but there's other
aspects to the environment not only
climbing in 2007 last year too big
reports were published one was by the
IPCC the international panel climate
change who's the agency that well rather
the panel of experts put together by the
UN to full of climate issues and this
report stated very strongly that now we
know that human activities have an
impact on the climate and also try to
put a number on the temperature
difference that we could expect that
2100 which as I mentioned before is
uncertain basis between one and six
degrees with different probabilities
associated to each rise in temperature
the severe consequences of this rising
temperature were highlighted but the
second report came afterwards and was
not as much promoted and publicized
although it was quite important to as a
geo for report by the UN EP the united
nations environmental program geo stands
for global environmental outlook and
this
one was trying to say well we have
several crises going on not only do we
have climbing but we also have
biodiversity crisis land use crisis and
there are all linked to the development
crisis that is affecting a wired portion
of the world development energy and
environment say this report are
interrelated issues and knowing that
they calculated what's called the
footprint which is a way to try to
convert our use of natural resources
into an area and saying well what do we
use on what can the planet provide
sustainably as you can see we're using
the equivalent of almost 22 Hector's per
person that's an average globally that
means in Europe in the US were using
much more than that and the Earth's
carrying capacity meaning what she can
sustainably produce in terms of
renewable products livestock like
fisheries accessor and not being
exhausted there's only 16 acres Hector's
so we're using much more than we should
getting back to energy is easy when once
we've made this picture because we
realize that energy as a major
contributor to greenhouse gases
emissions I highlighted here power
stations which provide electricity
residential/commercial Manila sources
which is mostly heating fossil fuel
retrieval processing and distribution
transportation fuels are all related to
energy and as you can see there are the
most direct sources of greenhouse gases
emissions that you can think of this
graph was done for the emissions in 2000
they have changed a little since then
but not much then we take into account
some indirect sources where you need
energy like industrial processes land
use and biomass burning knowing that
biomass is burnt in developing nations
as a cooking fuel for ninety percent of
the time then you realize that energy is
a big issue when you talk about
environment so we want to reduce the
emissions linked to energy the obvious
thing would be to say well let's not use
energy however this is not very easy to
defend because energy is intimately
linked to development this graph shows
the Human Development Index
which is an aggregate of a life
expectancy access to schools and access
to health plus GDP so it's a slightly
better measure than GDP of how people
fair in their countries versus the
annual consumption of electricity per
person in those countries so as you
would have guessed the African countries
are low on the graph the industrial
countries are high on the graphs on
those aspects so I'd like to ask you a
question what does this graph tell you I
think it tells us two things at least
and I'm sure you would find them just as
quickly as I would sue would anyone
guess or say something what would you
say what does it be graph to tell you
that's something that we could get as a
complete admit you get is that confusion
first we say that the developed
countries have higher energy
consumptions you know very basic and
that the higher you are on the
consumption chart the better you fair
somehow right this graph is a increasing
function so the more you consume energy
the more the better you fear there's a
second thing that is refs tells us and
it's linked to this 4000 boundary hear
about this boundary except for a few
countries like South Africa Russia and
Saudi Arabia whose political context is
a bit different and my Delta X explain
why the Human Development Index is low
although they consume a lot of energy
when we go higher than those four
thousand kilowatt hours per year per
person then there's not much change in
the human development index there's like
a threshold that you don't need to go
higher than this 22 to have a good
development so if we want to take those
two two things that we just discovered
although they're quite obvious and see
how can we lower our emissions the first
thing is we must increase the access of
the poorest countries to modern energy
forms like electricity because then they
would rise in development and as an
ethical and also economic point this is
something that we need but if we want
them to do so
while keeping at least the average of
our consumption at the same level if not
lower we need to increase the efficiency
of the intermediate countries of the way
they use any electricity and energy in
general in this bunch you see countries
such as Kazakhstan Poland Chile Mexico
Ukraine their industrial framework can
be modernized and you could have much
better use of electricity and energy in
those countries without affecting the
development much and even eventually
increasing it and obviously we must put
into we must do energy savings and
reduction of energy use actions in the
countries that fared better and where
waste can be more easily trimmed so
those are the three actions that I think
we can keep in mind and try to keep in
the back of our heads well I'll try to
show you a few of the projects that
we've seen during that project so let's
go but I'll just present you briefly
promethea Prometheus in English as a
name of a nonprofit that a few friends
and I put together in june two thousand
six trying to raise awareness and the
questions that we've just discussed and
try to promote knowledge and will to
take actions on energy and greenhouse
gases reduction so three fourths of
man-made co2 emissions come from fossil
fuel burning knowing that and knowing
that those emissions are linked to
environment and realizing that energy
challenges in the 21st century check a
specific form that has in our opinion at
least three feet one is global warming
the second is increased scarcity of
fossil fuels and the third one is a
challenge of helping developing
countries go higher in the development
index we wanted to try to explain to a
lot of people how complex this problem
was and how easy although it's complex
it can be addressed if everybody gets to
work on it so we wanted to foster
interest on those questions and empower
people that are not technicians and not
engineers who don't always know about
energy technologies and what they can be
used for to understand the issues that
they see on the headlines of the
newspapers was that always knowing
what's behind so to do that we created
this NGO permitted like the
titan from the greek mythology that goes
up on the mountain to fetch fire what is
fire fire fire is knowledge we're not
saying that we are promises but we say
that everybody can be one and can go up
the mountain and reach the knowledge and
take it out of the grasp of the people
who say they know and don't want you to
meddle with their fingers etc so it's
somewhat of an ideal democracies that
we'd like to see apply to the problems
of energy and technology knowledge so to
do that since we're not big there was
only four of us at the beginning we
decided to find a very concrete a
practical target and those were
elementary schools mantra schools are
easy to get rich too because they have
the obligation in France to do an
education to sustainable development and
environmental issues so we were
providing them with class material that
they could use in this context plus in a
mantra is called you only have one
teacher teaching all the different
topics so since energy technologies and
development are very growing issues that
have to be dealt with multi disciplinary
knowledge it's it was obviously a good
choice to find a person that you could
talk to and not have to talk to the
seven different tissues that can teach
math French as physics etc at higher
grades so we had seven classes in our
partnership there were French but France
the French schools are a bit of
everywhere we were working with a French
school in Japan the French school in
Iranian island which is a part of France
but that's in the Indian Ocean and and
and three schools in France so when we
visited those schools we try to do
energy projects with them so that was
our visit to the Iranian class in a
windmill farm and when we were in
different countries we also had the
opportunity to do a few talks to a local
pupils and this was for employing
Pakistan in multan it was a girls school
where we talked about energy and try to
religion experiments on how you get all
out of the Koran using coca-cola and
choke that was fun this is a class
material that we developed so it's
organized in seven themes what is energy
where the electricity fossil energies
nuclear energy renewable
how to use energy and climate and it's
organized with comic strips opinion that
it are supposed to bring the attention
of pupils to the topics that we're going
to talk about so for Hannibal this one
is taken from the what's energy topic so
this little guy who is one of the heroes
of our comic strip is trying to
understand the difference between
kinetic energy solar energy thermal
energy etc and that's the way that we
try to bring the students to the stop
picturing the whole thing it's done it's
downloaded don't you it can be
downloaded on our website and for now
it's only in French but we're trying to
do new partnerships to get it translated
especially in English and Spanish so
that we can have a broader audience this
was complemented by the wall tour that I
introduced before so join seven months
to travel in those countries trying to
see different projects and trying to see
what's new in those projects so what we
called innovations were not only
technological innovations not only the
new ways to produce or use energy it was
also how innovative the people were in
trying to implement those technologies
the typical example it has to do with
solar panels solar panels are well-known
technologies I've been around for almost
four years now but using them in Africa
to bring electrification to isolated
villages is more a challenge regarding
the institutions and the financial
barriers that you have to go against
then regarding the technology itself and
so finding projects in Morocco in Zambia
where people succeeded in deploying them
was very interesting to us but we also
looked at research labs and have they
dealt with this problem especially in
the US and I'd like to mention if you
this afterwards so we had partners which
were numerous and very generous and now
I'd like to show you a bit more pictures
about the project that we've seen so we
were not only looking at new energies
not only renewable energies because we
know that energy is for eighty percent
of its world use is from fossil fuels so
this is a project in Angola as the
company total operates an fpso which is
this big boat it stands for floating and
produce floating production storage and
offloading tanker
so it's basically an oil tanker that's
been converted by adding a plant on top
of it so that it could at least pretreat
and purify part of the oil that's
getting extracted so why do they use a
boat because this is 135 kilometers away
from the African coast so as to deep you
can put a platform here I just put a big
boat that they anchor at the bottom of
the sea and then they send robots to
drill the the wealth well the oil is
extracted so what is new in this project
it was not only the fact that making
those platforms work as a logistical
challenge what was interesting to us is
that on this project they want to avoid
that they don't want to flavor the get
gas so in an old reservoir you get both
oil and gas and gas represent about ten
percent of the old production so usually
when you don't have access to a gas
market when you don't have liquefying
plants when you don't have a
distribution infrastructure you would
just burn the gas because you have
nowhere to put it especially if you're
on a boat you don't have a big storage
thing that you can use so you flare it
and flaring a gas worldwide represents
about six percent of the world use of
natural gas so it's a huge waste and
it's also a big source of greenhouse
gases emissions because the gasping
burnt is well become co2 but in this
project what they were going to do was
to compress that gas and reject it into
the reservoir so there are several
advantages do that first of all you
don't burn the gas when the environment
is happy secondly you enhance the
slightly the the production of oil
because you maintain depression the
reservoir so the old continues to flow
and thirdly the host countries are very
happy because maybe one day gasps and
all will be so expensive that it might
be confine an shal available to actually
build a liquefied liquefy liquefying
plant or a pipeline so that you would
use that gas and then sell it to
somebody and it so happens that more and
more countries that have access to this
or older servers are trying to put into
that contracts the obligation from the
exploiting company to actually do that
that was quite interesting
we also went to no way and know where we
saw this interesting project which wants
to put windmills except they are see
male somehow of the coast so that they
would produce electricity by using the
tidal currents so tidal current has
several advantages one is that is
regular so it can be predicted in a
position to end up which you can't
really know when you will have when an
electricity from there they're also
under water and water is a ten hundred
times more dense than air so you need to
have you don't need to have as big meals
as you would when you're using wind and
of course it's not very widely used
today because there are few constraints
associated to the to the environment
that we're working with sea water is
very corrosive so it's interesting that
this is happening in Norway because
nowhere has extensive knowledge of
offshore deep offshore oil production
and the knowledge acquired by those
engineers was then used to do those big
steel structures that are now put down
the sea and have to resist it all of
corrosion etc they also turn very slowly
so they don't cut the fish into small
pieces what is your the interesting the
ones the drawbacks is that they take a
lot of space so you need to put them in
places where you have enough water that
the ships won't be put into trouble when
they go through or you have to use this
kind of devices that are being tested
now in Ireland and England so that the
Seas can actually see those towers and
try to go around them without hurting
them so this is useful and interesting
but it's not the solution to the energy
world Christ because it only works in a
few places it's good for isolated
communities runnable this project
happening in Norway was meant to work
for village of 300 houses that was too
far away from the grid to be connected
there and we'll be displacing a diesel
plant so in a few cases they can be very
interesting you will all heard about
solar PV photovoltaics that are usually
made from silicon and more and more made
from thin films most of the sin film
technologies are from inorganic sources
so when you would use indium solution
geleyim
different sources of semiconductors and
try to make very thin films of them and
this project is a bit different in
system that it wants to use organic
solar cells so they're made from
polymers I said don't have
semiconducting properties per se but
have an energy gap that they can use
prints excitons that then becomes
electrons and you could produce
electricity from them so the advantages
that are very cheap polymers is are easy
to get and get there easy to manufacture
easy to display in rolls so why aren't
there everywhere today because they had
first of all very low efficiency they
only convert about five percent of the
energy from the Sun into electricity
compared to the fifteen to twenty
percent of conventional solar panels but
that would be okay given their very low
price the biggest inconvenient today is
that they don't listen very well the UV
radiation from the Sun so they would
become Union unusable very quickly so
people are working on trying to improve
their resistance to time and irradiation
and also trying to make new
encapsulation techniques that would
protect them further and and also they
don't like oxygen too much so being put
up on roofs that would be a problem and
they're not well protected but this is a
very promising technology people hope
that it would be in 10-15 years
available commercially and that you
could use them you know put like
t-shirts with plastic bands that could
recharge your iPod frontal one thing
that so it's quite interesting in the
sense I did we have very broad
applications even though it has a quite
low efficiency and this was happening
sorry in Germany joey is a little town
in the south which is called freiburg
and freiburg has a very interesting
history that i'll present further but
they're basically the solar capital of
europe even though they're in germany
which is not the sunniest place in
Europe and they had this great
technology center called the Institute
found offer for solar energy that is the
biggest research lab in Europe on Sol
technologies and that is developing
those those solar panels talking about
the Sun there's another way you can get
harness the sun's electricity sorry the
sun's power to make electricity
this is you then concentrated as
concentrating mirrors so on the right
oops sorry on the right is a plant
that's not very far from here on the
u.s. Kel it's in the mojave desert north
of los angeles and it's the biggest
thermodynamic plant in the world it
produces 165 megawatts of electricity by
concentrating the the solar arrays by
those thanks to those mirrors on the
axis of the parable that they're making
and through this axis is circulated an
oil that gets heated and is sent to the
central power plant that then transfer
the heat from the oil to water becomes
steam and thus produces electricity
through turbines and although it you
know it doesn't seem very convenient
because it takes up a lot of space
problem with solar energy that is the
same problem work for windmills solar
panels biomass which are all forms of
solar energy is that they're very very
diffuse not dense at all so it takes a
lot of space but desert are places with
lots of space and lots of Sun so that's
not so much of an issue except when you
can get rid of the investment work and
in the case of California is very useful
because they produce their peak
electricity in the afternoon which is
also the peak of electricity consumption
in California where everybody puts their
conditioning on so solel the Explorer
exploiting company of that place sells
its electricity at a very high price
2000 Edison and this makes a lot of
profit and the huge return eleventh of
on investment the second project is
quite different as in India in a place
called oroville oroville is a tiny city
in the south east of india that has the
very idealistic goal of trying to put to
promote a new kind of society where you
would not need money where people would
be happy and live together and work
together to promote a better world and
one of their objectives is to be
independent from the grid for their
energy water and waste distribution
systems so in this case this is a solar
kitchen so this big
this big some aspherical bowl is made of
locally main mirrors and they
concentrate the Rays of the Sun on this
axis through which is circulated water
and a big copper coil covered with
aluminum and this produces team and
steam is used to cook rice and so this
device produces that reduces the
consumption of diesel that is normally
used to produce esteem by twenty percent
over the year because you don't use it
in the evening and the science not
always here etc but it's a fairly big
reduction of their consumption for not a
very big price since everything was
locally me so those are were interesting
ways of using the Sun to provide energy
but yeah I know their form than the ones
that are mostly seen all the source of
the solar energy includes biomass those
two projects are from Stanford from the
G sap which is a big project that the
stanford university has committed to
work on on energy and greenhouse gases
reductions so this project here aims at
making electricity from plants and it's
very unusual because the idea is to go
and get the electrons from the
photosynthesis and from those electrons
make a current so it seems quite new
topical but it actually works you can
making a current of for PECO emperors
which is super small but quite
interesting in the way they did was
developed so nobody believes that this
can ever be a big source of electricity
because you will need millions and
billions of tiny chloroplasts to get a
significant amount of energy but there
were all the technologies that have been
developed to actually have access to
that current meaning nano scale
electrodes a way to get the chloroplasts
to be kept non moving for a time long
enough that you would actually be able
to get the electron into them and not
destroy them the all the imagining
devices that were used to be able to
monitor exactly where things are and how
you can have access to them all those
things could be very useful for other
applications so he
energy is a way to get funding maybe and
find something more interesting
afterwards the second project is more
realistic so Chris Somerville is very
well known in the plant biology sphere
because he was the promoter of a big
chain of a big project which was the the
genome project for plants so he his team
and the people who work with them were
the first to decipher the DNA of one of
those plants which happens to be very
used in biology because it grows fast
etc and now he works with ebi which is
the big biofuel lab that has been set up
in Berkeley with a big round from BP of
five hundred million dollars and what
they're trying to do is lignocellulose
is ethanol you all know that ethanol as
it is produced today is not very
sustainable because it uses corn and
that's eatable plus it doesn't have a
very good energy balance overall but if
we could use everything in the plant and
not only starch and sugar then we could
have much higher yields and that's what
he's working on the idea is that you can
get so low loose to be broken down in
sugars and then fermented to make fo but
the solar loose as it stands today
implant is completely blocked by lignin
lignin is a very ramified an aromatic
made compound that is very hard to break
there's actually what makes plants tend
and not just crumble and this old window
the rain so you have to kill and break
the lignin before getting access to
cellulose and that's very difficult so
some people are thinking well let's
engineer plants that have less lignin
and more cellulose to do that you need
to know how cellulose is made and even
though it's one of the most abundant
polymer from nature we don't know that
yet and we don't know how to sell some
excel loose and a sweat professor
Somerville is working on so it seems a
bit far-fetched from energy but it was
just a way to show to people that a lot
of fields have to be pinned together to
solve this interesting problem that will
have in a few years to come waste can
also be a big source of energy so here
are a condensed form of three different
projects on the left here is
landfill in Brazil so ways that are
being put in landfills ferment without
oxygen and they produce methane and a
few other gases and recuperating this
methane first of all I avoid it to be
released in the atmosphere and given the
methane is a very strong warming gas it
has 20 times the warming power of co2
you have a good impact on the
environment and secondly if you can use
that methane to produce electricity or
heat then you have a double a double
positive impact so in this case they
have engineers and and fields that you
would be able to refer that methane so
there's plastic sheets that are being
set underneath so that you eliminate the
the fact that all the water etc will
leak out with lots of toxins into it
then you put a layer of dirt the layer
of waste a layer of dirt a layer of ways
to make a big sandwich and you put tubes
and pipes through that with holes in
them so that I would record the gas yes
and then the gas is sent to an engine
that burns it and makes electricity or
in other cases this is from a university
in Brazil where they've actually
collected the manure and the sewage
water from residence for students and
they ferment it in a much smaller scale
than the landfill one and then put
everything into this big tank where from
where it's then put into an engine that
produces electricity or you could have a
different setup and one that we've seen
in india and the punisher engineering
college well they use the gases produced
for cooking purposes so instead of using
co dung or would they can use gas and
he's cleaner to burn doesn't make smoke
doesn't have bad health impacts and also
once again is released and avoids its
release in the atmosphere and thus
diminishes the impact on the warming
power we've talked a lot about energy
production but looking at the energy
balance you have to look both at the
production and the consumption so if we
can increase the efficiency with which
we use energy will be just as well off
as if we can increase the amount of
energy that we produce
so here is just a brief presentation of
ways to reduce energy consumption in
buildings here is a ceiling and a lamp
from BC IL which is a company in India
VCR L stands for neither change which is
a motorbike ND but also for bio
conservation in the india limited and
they have a very interesting business
plan in the sense that they want to make
houses that have very little embedded
energy so the materials that are being
used are very low on the production
chain meaning they're not cooked they
will never use bricks because bricks
have a lot of embedded energy they use a
lot of wood they use stones and they try
to use local materials another aspect
that they're working on is trying to
make their building the building that
they make sustainable in the sense that
they don't take too much out of the
environment from the bowl water what r
is a big problem in some parts of india
so when be CIL tries to build a plot of
residences they first of all SS the
quantity of water that falls onto that
plot every year and from that they
calculate how much people how many
people can live out of this water it's a
very interesting way of thinking because
usually people will say well you know I
have this plot of land people will pay
so much in too much or have this size
and I can put as many people that the
line is I want and then I'll bring water
from other sources whereas in this kind
of projects the water is collected put
into boreholes treated and then used in
the in the houses and so it's completely
independent from the grid same with
energy same with waste treatment which
is very interesting in a country like
India where the services in some places
are not always very efficiently if a
gently crew thank you efficiently I'm
met by the municipal services etc so and
also i have to mention that there has it
they built normally you have very low
embedded energy but they also have very
low energy consumptions because i have
good isolations the cooling which is
very important there is provided through
common services so you have economies of
scale going on and also with quite
intelligent designs
that provide shade and things like that
that diminish the need of air
conditioning this project is in very
different places it's in Tokyo very
industrialized urban area and once again
it tries to increase the efficiency with
which they with which energy is used so
those big cupboards are fuel cells and
reformers so the tiny ones is transforms
natural gas or kerosene into hydrogen
that is being then oops that is then
being used hmm well I hope you remember
how it looked here we go there isn't
being using this big thing which is a
stack of fuel cells and so the fuel
cells transform the hydrogen into water
heat and electricity the efficiency of
the conversion to heat and electricity
is eighty percent it's only thirty-five
percent if you only consider electricity
but since you're also produce heat that
you will then use in the house to hit
their house and hit the the water that
you will use in battles and and
dishwashers etc the overall conversion
has a much higher efficiency as if you
were bringing the electricity from the
grid from a plant that was far away from
your home whose heat was released in
environment so you're basically making a
local power plant that is using the same
input as what the big power plant was
which is natural gas but you're also
using the heat that's generated and thus
you have a much better efficiency that
is quite interesting this is Freiburg
again the same place as the solar panel
the organics whole panel was developed
in this case it's a whole neighborhood
that's called global which was built
with very stringent standards as far as
energy conversion was conservation was
concerned this was built in two thousand
and at that time they were lower than
all the standards that were being
applied elsewhere in Europe and still
today even though it's already eight
years further in time they are one of
the most efficient places so in this
case said they the architects were
selected to develop a new area on
basically standards that had to do
is energy production and consumption so
you have very good isolation larger
windows the materials that are local and
very happy people in general because
they live in a place where commuting is
very easy where everybody believes that
energy should be produced locally so
they have tons of solar panels and
usually their houses are also very
comfortable and modern the last project
here is in Hong Kong so the Hong Kong
municipal state municipality has set up
a competition that is called energy
efficiency Awards the who to which
everyone can contribute can apply as
long as they are commercial and public
offices this is in the University of
Hong Kong and this picture is being
taken the toilets so in the toilets you
can see the energy consumption of the
University through time so increasing
until you reach summer etc and the point
is that putting it in the toilet
everybody will see it and if everybody
sees it then you can more easily tell
them well you see we've consumed so much
so far and that was our target we've
exceeded the target so please don't
forget to put out the light when you
leave and it's actually works very well
they were one of the winners of the
efficiency hours program because not
only they promote efficiency through
behavior change but they also set up a
few technical changes like switching the
lights to more efficient lights changing
the air conditioning because in Hong
Kong is very humid and very hot but air
conditioning is used not only to reduce
the temperature of the different rooms
but also to dry the air and you can dry
the air with much more efficient means
like dehumidification then using air
conditioning so this was also a good way
to decrease their energy consumption but
let's get back to the problem that I
stayed in the beginning that is
development 1.6 billion people in the
world still lack access to electricity
we that number would be bigger if we
young if you also took into account the
fact that people have electricity but
only intermittently or with very low
quality several programs have been set
up to try to change that state of the
world and foreign pole in Morocco where
solar panels are being set in rural
areas and
in India where biodiesel and
classification plants are being
distributed in the villages to try to
change that this was just to remind you
that now we're talking about this part
sorry of the graph that I think puts
forth the question and and the the idea
is feasible to get people to have better
access to energy well while increasing
the their their GDP so so here is a
graphic which is done by the
International Agency for energy if you
look at everything before 1975 then GDP
and primary energy use were completely
coupled there's no difference between
the two lines however after the energy
crisis we see that GDP grows faster than
energy consumption so we can uncouple
growth and energy use and that's by
providing more efficient energy services
what's important in is not the fact that
this lamp is 10 watts or hundred watts
what's important is that it gives you so
many lumens the service is more
important than the actual use and that's
something that people have been very
slow to realize because we tend to think
in terms of what we the initial input
and not range the output when it comes
to energy so just to show the is
feasible the this graph here shows
different countries that have been going
through industrial revolutions trade
rich in the u.s. Germany France Japan
and showing the energy intensity through
time energy intensity is the GDP per
amount of energy used no energy used per
amount of gdp sorry and the lower it is
the less energy you need to get more
growth so the idea that I a lot of
people trying to get developing
countries to be low on that drive so
that they can have better energy
services at a lower cost so a since we
don't have much time left and I think
yeah I like I add I would like to answer
your questions I'll go a little fast
through those slides because lots of
texts on them and but we can come back
to them through the questions if you
want so um
it is evident that sustainable
development requires proper energy
management the goal of it would be to
increase the standard of living of
people who don't have access to good
energy services and to do that we must
focus on modern forms of energy that are
basically gas for cooking and
electricity for other uses and try to
provide high and high quality energy
services what's a high quality energy
service it's a service that relies
mostly on renewable forms of energy so
you would decrease the carbon intensity
of our energy mix that includes them and
management so conservation measures use
of efficient use of energy having
industries knew the grade when they when
is less used by other people etc and
promote energy efficiency in in the
technologies that are being so
certification programs label ization of
items that are being boot etc several
barriers exist to those in fish into the
two that the diffusion of this ID
especially in developing countries where
financial markets are not very efficient
so access to capital is restricted when
you need to change a production a pearl
it's quite hard to do so because you
don't have the money to and you can't
borrow it at a low interest rate and the
lack of technical knowledge and in some
places might also be a big obstacle
let's comment the pictures that be
easier so if we want to promote a real
electrification there's several ways to
do so extending the grid is the major
one because the grid has the advantage
that you have as much electricity as you
need and you usually pay it at a lower
rate however it has a high initial
capital cost so using smaller devices
that are and the individual or village
scale can be more efficient in terms of
the use of resources in maroc available
in 1997 only seventeen percent of the
rural population had access to
electricity ten years later in 2007 that
number jumped to ninety-seven percent
how was this made the statement made a
strong commitment to extend the grid
for most of that percentage increase and
for the most remote areas where it was
very difficult to bring electricity
lines etc then contracts were passed
with private companies to deploy the
solar panels and maintain them so the
state got into contract with companies
for 10 years they had to implement to
set up the solar panels they had to
maintain them and they would collect
revenues from the local populations it's
very interesting to see that the state's
you know said I'm not able to do it so
I'll get a private company today and
that's something that's happening one
more not only through social
entrepreneurship but also with big
companies that got into contracts with
the state and provide expertise
technical knowledge and also they're
well to make profit so they are mature
to make the best investment possible in
India and China a lot of gasification
plants have been set up the advantage of
gasification plant is that they can use
any kind of feedstock as long as you've
got some carbon in them so you can use a
cultural revenues you can use so dust
you can use wood you can use coal put it
into the gas fire turn it change the
chemical energy into of the organic
products into chemical energy of a gas
because you produce hydrogen and see you
and the little methane and that gas I
design then being burned in a motor and
in an engine that produces electricity
so that's very convenient at a village
scale to increase the efficiency of the
energy use several programs can be put
together some of them rely on the
diffusion of more efficient technologies
for examples efficient lights some of
them also try to promote the fact that
tuning up your vehicle maintaining your
fridge changing your pump are also very
good ways of promoting electricity so
electricity conservation energy
conservation so for animal this is an ad
that was passed in a Pakistani newspaper
where the government has set up garages
equipped with computer assisted tune-up
centers where people who drive in get
the
car auditors and then they can pay for
the different changes that need to be
made to make the car more efficient in
places where people don't buy cars every
year and usually end up having the
oldest ones it is a very efficient way
to save energy this is another kind of
program that can be done if it can be
done it's basically showing what's a
proper way to do things this is in India
is called the retreat center its centre
from that Terry the Energy Research
Institute has built to make its
conferences and with hotel rooms etc and
it's very impressive and all the energy
conservation measures that it has done
especially they have natural ventilation
natural cooling natural treatment of the
waters solar panels for electricity
generation and being there as a way to
show the things are possible and then
you get more people interested in that
question and actually realizing new
project this is a Chinese certificate of
energy conservation is the equivalent of
Energy Star and using certification and
standardization programs it is also a
very good way to change behaviors
because people will be using and
identifying the products with the less
energy consumption and therefore promote
the diffusion in the market and
therefore change the way the producers
work and and present more and more
energy efficient products then we can
also try to increase the share of
renewable energy on the market so this
is biodiesel made from jatropha curcas
which is a non edible plant and it's
very interesting to a few countries
including India and Zambia who want to
plant Hector's of this thing because it
grows on not very good souls and doesn't
need a lot of water or trying to promote
solon energy for an appalling gas
stations in Pakistan where this solar
energy is used to heat water that then
cleans cars and therefore thanks a lot
of people go to gas stations they see
that those panels are working in that a
big company is investing in them so
maybe that's a good idea and I should
i'm at my home such ideas are also
interesting ways to defuse technology so
other confusion what have we done
resolve that so far alodia window who's
not here today she's in front myself
have written a book to try to talk about
the different energy innovations
unfortunately it's only in French but if
it sells well in French with her
physical gets translated to English
we're also participated in a few
conferences and set up a photo exhibit
that it is travelling through France we
were lucky enough to find people in
California very interesting that project
and trying to set up a local chapter of
our NGO who is hoping to reach to
elementary school kids through using the
class material that we developed and
getting it translated and maybe I do
when we have time a startup that tries
to promote the diffusion of energetic
emotions in developing countries so I'm
sorry I took so fast and I hope there
were some interesting things in there
for you so if you have questions I'd be
very happy to take them and an answer
that in your craw
energy use as you points out or the top
or the most developed countries have
pretty consistent levels of you know
development development shop a wide
range of energy consumption and that
idea why but looking at it struck me
that it seemed to be a combination of
climate population density and seems to
me that a lot of developing countries
will also have prime Russian population
density issues that would kind of put
them towards the right hand side of that
graph is there are you have any thoughts
on how you can plug that development to
get around for every issues are that are
causing problems for Canada in the US so
I thought about it a lot and a
population and density I think would
would be good explanation if the graph
was only about energy consumption in
general but this was only electricity so
formal doesn't take into account
transportation which is not electricity
based so that doesn't go for explaining
for the density however I do think that
the the big the biggest country they're
higher they go on the graph is explained
can be explained by by the this idea
that you need to commute and entrance
for energy etc some longer distances
however see I think the the spread in
developing countries is big enough that
you have places like Zambia with very
scarce population and that's that could
be higher on the graph and places like
Bangladesh which have very high density
but there are the same level in the
graph in terms of development index so I
think that at all young tall has been
given to why development happens in
places or not and geography is one of
the big explanations as points out
Jeffrey Sachs when Paul his book about
the end of poverty you saying if you're
in a landlocked country you don't have
exchanges you come to trading and that
will know where your development is
because trade also have a big
contribution but trying to link it
directly to energy I think it's a bit
harder because and you know what is the
electricity used for it's used for
lighting issues for industrial purposes
it's used for health devices it really
is not related to climate or
that doesn't density i think so i really
don't have to answer your questions i
think it's a very interesting one but I
apologize for not being the right person
to ask you to so in your talk you showed
a lot of great ideas and great efforts
that different people are using to try
to solve this energy problem in
different parts of the world and many of
these solutions are adapted to the local
region so have you seen anything that
seems like it might be relevant to the
entire world where by that solution will
go a long ways towards solving the
global problem I think the main takeaway
from our travels and our experience was
that there is no one shot solution the
success of the projects that we've seen
was I did identifying the local needs
looking at the local constraints and
then finding the best way but we're
showing that we have a wide array of
solutions to pick from and that is
feasible in each situation to find a way
to go around the local constraints and
meet the needs for Almanza mia zambia is
a very poor country it's number 166 out
of 177 in the different rankings at the
UN puts up and and people there have
very little revenues however a company
is able to sell them soul panels and uh
no subsidies they sell the solar panels
that are very expensive you know it in
Europe in the u.s. everywhere they've
subsidized in this way they don't need
to subsidize them because there's a need
they there is no electrification and
people want access to electricity not
for lighting not for cooking but for
communication they want to be able to
charge their cell phones they want to
have access for a few hours a day to
internet and so they will be ready to
pay whatever it takes to get that solar
panel so they usually go into some
microfinance scheming and get the
company working with them to see when is
the best time for them and what's the
best price they can pay every month but
then it happens and this will not happen
in Spain or in Europe and that's I think
something very interesting that we are
provided by history and by
invitees of a lot of people with tons of
solutions that we can get inspiration
from and then adapted local a bit I
don't think there's like a big one shot
solution people have been promoting CCS
carbon capture and sequestration as an
intermediate term solution to our
problems because you could store the
carbon from coal plants which are
majority Rita day into the earth and
thus get rid of the problem that you
don't have get rid of the emissions
problem by still using electricity but
this will not be helpful to the
developed countries for ample even
though it would be a big step forward
for the US who have a very reliant on
coal friends and I'm sure there was a
good answer in the red that's the best I
can get well thank you very much for
spending that time this afternoon was me
and we have a website especially in
French but there's a few pictures and
you don't need translations for those
thank you
