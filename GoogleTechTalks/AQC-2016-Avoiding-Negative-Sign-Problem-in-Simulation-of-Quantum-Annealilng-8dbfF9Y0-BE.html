MASAYUKI OHZEKI: So I'm Masayuki
Ohzeki from Kyoto University.
It's an honor to be
here, and thank you
for giving me this opportunity
to talk about our recent study.
So the title of this talk is
&quot;Avoiding Negative Sign Problem
In Simulation of
Quantum Annealing&quot;
or quantum Monte
Carlo simulations.
So I will give you
a take-home message.
So we have performed a
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
for a class of
nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
So, for example, this
is a typical example
of a nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
So this term is a
transverse field,
and this term is
antiferromagnetic xx
interactions, so
all-to-all connections.
So we have performed this
quantum driver Hamiltonian
case.
We have performed as a quantum
Monte Carlo simulation.
And our method
can be generalized
to the class of the
nonstochastic Hamiltonian
in the form of these functions.
And we propose two
methods, two strategies
to simulate a quantum
Monte Carlo simulation.
One is adaptive quantum
Monte Carlo simulation,
and one is a data
analysis approach.
So this is the result.
So we have performed a
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
for the ferromagnetic
interactions,
all-to-all connections,
and with a magnetic field,
and a transverse field,
and antiferromagnetic xx
interactions.
So this is nonstochastic
Hamiltonian.
So this is a result
for the energy
and longitudinal magnetization
and transverse magnetization.
So the red point denotes the
result of the quantum Monte
Carlo simulation.
And the blue curve,
blue [INAUDIBLE] curve,
denotes the exact
solution, because this
can be exactly solved by use
of the mean field analysis.
So we choose this model for
validation of our method.
Of course, we can generalize
any systems for something
like the spin glass
model in the z-axis.
And we may use quantum
driver antiferromagnetic xx
interactions.
And we propose two methods.
So this is the second one.
So this is the second
result. So similarly, we
obtain the consistent result
with the exact situation.
So of course, you are
interested in my study.
So I will actually
talk-- I will actually
do a talk on quantum
annealing and its improvement
by use of the
nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
So you know, all of you know,
so this is a standard way
of the quantum annealing.
So then we consider the
target Hamiltonian like that.
So then we add the transverse
field as a quantum driver
Hamiltonian.
So then we trace the ground
state, instantaneous ground
state.
By slowly tuning the strings
of the transverse field,
we can obtain the ground state
of the target Hamiltonian.
But sometimes we encounter
the phase transition.
So if the second-order phase
transition exists there
during the quantum
annealing, so then
this is characterized
by an energy gap
closure in the f behavior.
So then the computational
time is longer and longer
in the sense of the
parallel behavior.
So sometimes we encounter the
first-order phase transition.
This is an obstacle, so the
first-order phase transition
involved in the exponentially
closure of the energy gap.
So then the
cross-computational time
will diverge exponentially.
So this is a bottleneck
of the quantum annealing.

But a few study-- a
few change for avoiding
the first-order phase transition
in the quantum annealings.
So the Japanese researchers,
Dr. Yuya Seki and Professor
[INAUDIBLE], introduced some
elaborate quantum fluctuation.
So in this case, they
introduced antiferromagnetic xx
interactions, so a
nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
So these terms is a standard
quantum annealing procedure.
In addition to these
terms, they introduced
antiferromagnetic
interactions like this.
So then they have succeeded in
avoiding the first-order phase
transition during the quantum
annealing, so in some sense,
for a class of the problems.
So they have succeeded in the
case of the p-body Ising--
ferromagnetic Ising model case
and the [? Hopfield ?] model.
So the [INAUDIBLE]
model is a crossover
to the spin glass models.
So this is a kind of
the phase diagram.
So the red color denotes
a phase boundary involved
in the first-order
phase transition,
and the green color
denotes the phase boundary
involved in the second-order
phase transition.
So according to the standard
way of the quantum annealing,
so they trace these lines.
So therefore, they encounter the
first-order phase transition.
But if we introduce
additional [INAUDIBLE]
antiferromagnetic
xx interactions,
we can avoid this phase boundary
involved in the first phase
transitions.
Of course, you know as in
the Hamiltonian [INAUDIBLE].
So antiferromagnetic
xx interaction
or nonstochastic
Hamiltonian will
be helpful for pair sampling
of the ground systems.

But, however, the
antiferromagnetic xx
interaction or
nonstochastic Hamiltonian
will generate a
negative sign problem
if we perform the
quantum Monte Carlo
simulation in a standard way.
For instance, the
transverse field terms,
we decompose these terms to
the ferromagnetic interactions
between the different
[INAUDIBLE].

So then the antiferromagnetic
interactions--
if we perform the [INAUDIBLE]
decomposition to this term,
the result leads to
the negative sign
and the minus of the polarity.
So, therefore, it is difficult
to perform the quantum Monte
Carlo simulation.
And this is a
difficulty to estimate
the accurate estimation of
the [INAUDIBLE] expectation.
So therefore, this is the
motivation of this study.
So can we simulate the
antiferromagnetic xx
interaction or a class of
nonstochastic Hamiltonian
in quantum Monte Carlo
simulation anyhow?

So this is a part
of the solution--
so how to simulate
nonstochastic Hamiltonian.

So we set our program--
so we deal with this class
of the Hamiltonian.
So this is our
target Hamiltonian,
and this is a quantum
driver Hamiltonian.
So f of x is any
function, but the argument
is a collection of the x terms.
So this is an empirical
average of the x spins.
So this includes a wide range of
the nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
So, of course, including the
antiferromagnetic interaction,
xx interactions like this.
So f of x means gamma x
minus small gamma m power
to the [? m ?] over n-- over 2.
So this is a
transverse field term,
and this is antiferromagnetic
xx interaction terms.
Of course, we can
generalize these terms--
[INAUDIBLE] xx interactions
and [? full-body ?] xx
interactions, et
cetera, et cetera.
But they do not include
locally different interactions
like the spin glass interactions
in the xx interactions.
zz interaction is OK.
And they do not include
short-range interactions.
So , for example, in this case
antiferromagnetic interactions
is long-range and
all-to-all interactions.
So this is a speciality
of this model.
So then we show some
[INAUDIBLE] point.
So we use a useful technique
in the mean field analysis.
So in the mean
field analysis, we
define the order
parameter of the systems.
So in this case, f of mx-- mx
means transverse magnetization.
So then we consider
it as a constraint
by use of the delta functions.
So then we introduce a
auxiliary in variable like this.
So this is a constraint
of resistance.
So this is the order
parameter of resistance,
and we consider it
as the integral form
of the delta functions.
So then we obtain the
effective model like this.
So this is after
performing the [INAUDIBLE].
And we obtain a effective model.
So tau denotes the number
of the [INAUDIBLE] numbers,
and the beta denotes
inverse temperature.
And this is our original
target, the Hamiltonian.
And this is a quantum
driver Hamiltonian,
but we decomposed
these terms like this.
So then we find this
model is-- effectively,
is the same as transverse
field Ising model.
But the barrier of the strains
of the transverse field
can fracture it.
So then we use
subtle point method.
So the subtle point
determines the strength
of the transverse field.
So the transverse
field is determined
by f prime, the derivative
of the function of f,
and determined by the
transverse magnetization.
So, therefore, this
transverse field
can change, can
fluctuate, according
to the instantaneous value of
the transverse magnetization.
So this is a cartoon
of the main idea.
So this model has adaptive
transverse magnetic field,
in some sense.
So usually, we consider
the fixed barrier
of the transverse
field independent
of the local transverse
magnetization, so like this.
But in this case, if
we simulate a class
of the nonstochastic
Hamiltonian,
then the effective
transverse field
can change, according
to the barrier
of the instantaneous
transverse magnetization.
So, therefore, we propose
a faster strategy,
faster method to
simulate a class
of nonstochastic
Hamiltonian like this.
So we named this
method adaptive quantum
Monte Carlo simulations.
So let us consider the usual
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
for the Ising variables.
So the strains of
the transverse field
is determined by [INAUDIBLE].
So after simulating the
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
for evaluating the transverse
magnetization-- so after that,
we changed the values.
We changed the strains
of the transverse field,
according to this [INAUDIBLE].
So, therefore, we
summarize this scheme.
So the antiferromagnetic xx
interaction or the other term
of nonstochastic
Hamiltonian we consider
the integral representation
of the order parameters.
So then we use the subtle point.
So then we obtain
the effective model
with changing the barrier
of the transverse field,
so this magnetic
transverse field
is determined by the
instantaneous barrier
of the transverse magnetization.
And we perform the usual
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
to obtain the estimation of
the transverse magnetization.
So this is the result
showing, again-- so
yes, this is a
close-up of the result.
So this is a case of the energy.
And we plot our
result, depending on--
according to the system
size, minimum size
equal-- no, spin number, the
number of spins-- 4, 8, 16,
and 32, like this.
And we also plot exact solution
with a gamma equal nonzero-- 1.
So, yes, this is a case of the
longitudinal magnetization.
So like this.
So this is an exact solution.
So if we increase the
number of the spins,
so we obtain the
asymptotically accurate result
consistent with
the exact solution
also in the transverse
magnetization.
So we obtain the consistent
result with the exact solution,
and we can perform our method
similar to the standard quantum
Monte Carlo simulation
under the transverse field.

And we also propose
another method.
So this is a
data-analysis approach.
So remember the [INAUDIBLE]
point of this method.
So we obtain the effective
transverse field Ising model
so that this is our
original target Hamiltonian,
and this is a quantum
driver Hamiltonian.
So the [? m2 ?]
there is changing
according to the
tentative barrier
of the transverse magnetization.
So the strains of
the transverse field
is equal to something like that.
So, therefore, we perform the
quantum Monte Carlo simulation
by changing the
value of the strains
of the transverse field.
So then after that, we released
results of transverse field
Ising model.
So then we find consistent
result with strains
of the transverse field is equal
to, given by this equality,
so depending on the value of
the transverse magnetization,
so like that.
The latter point
denotes the results
obtained by the
quantum Monte Carlo
simulation for the transverse
field Ising model-- stochastic.
So then we plot some functions.
So this function, generated
by the disequality,
so the strains of
the transverse field
is determined by the f of--
derivative of the function f.
So in the case of the
antiferromagnetic xx
interactions, the f prime
inverse of the functions
is linear functions.
So then we plot the
linear functions that for,
given the variable of the
gamma and the small gamma.
So then we find
some cross-point.
So then we obtain the consistent
point, consistent result.
So then we replot-- sorry,
so we replot the cross-points
of [INAUDIBLE].
So then we obtain
the nontrival result
for the nonstochastic
Hamiltonian,
just from the trivial
result for the Ising
model or the transverse field.
So this is the results scaled
up, the result in a [? z ?],
and longitudinal magnetization,
and transverse magnetization
like that.
OK, so we obtained
the consistent result
with the exact situation, and
we can generate any result
for the nontrival value
of the small gamma
and the large gamma,
depending on the parameters.
So we summarize our study.
So we have succeeded in avoiding
the negative sign problem
for a class of the
nonstochastic Hamiltonian,
for example, the
antiferromagnetic xx
interactions.
So one method is adaptive
quantum Monte Carlo simulation,
and the [INAUDIBLE] method
is a data-analysis approach
for the trivial Ising model
with a transverse field.
And this method is not
already a simulation
in [INAUDIBLE] computer.
So, of course, we
implement a changing coding
to the instantaneous
variables of
the transverse magnetization.
We may implement hardware--
D-Wave, and Google,
and [INAUDIBLE],
something like that.
And we may test the effect of
the nonstochastic Hamiltonian
for the transverse sampling
of the ground state.
And we can implement
antiferromagnetic xx
interaction or a
nonstochastic Hamiltonian
to the [INAUDIBLE] computer.
So therefore, we may generate
fast, constant, [INAUDIBLE]
algorithms.
So therefore, we open
the way to understand
a nonstochastic
Hamiltonian for a class
of nonstochastic Hamiltonian.
That's all.
Thank you.
[APPLAUSE]

AUDIENCE: Hi.
I don't understand why you
think that the system has
sign problem.
Is it because of the
sigma x sigma x terms?
Can you go to the
Hamiltonian, this one?
So OK, perfect.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Oh, yes, yes.
AUDIENCE: So what if you change
your x's to z's and your z's
to-- it doesn't matter what
is x and what is z, right?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Mm-hmm.
AUDIENCE: So when you
change x to z and z to x--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Of
course, of course, yes.
But this Hamiltonian
is, of course, trivial,
but just for the
test of this method,
we can generalize our method
to the case of the spin glass
asymmetric problems.
AUDIENCE: So but you agree that
this Hamiltonian has no sign
problem.
Would you agree?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: No, no, no.
This Hamiltonian includes
a negative sign problem
in the standard way, yeah.
AUDIENCE: What do you
mean in a stand-- I'm just
saying that this Hamiltonian
has no sign problem.
It's very easy to
efficiently simulate it,
because you just change
bases from x to z.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, yes.
AUDIENCE: When you
do that, then you
get-- on the diagonal terms, you
can get the antiferromagnetic.
And in the off-diagonal
terms-- so you
see the minus j will
multiply the sigma
x sigma x terms, which makes
the matrix elements negative,
as you want them to be in
the stochastic picture.
So what I'm saying is
that maybe your method
has a generalization--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, yes, yes.
How about the case of p-body
interactions, xx interactions?
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI:
p-body xx interactions.
AUDIENCE: On the contrary,
if you move x to z,
then you can take 12-body xx--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: How about
the case with a spin glass
Hamiltonian?
AUDIENCE: OK, so
I think if you're
saying that your method works
for the spin glass Hamiltonian,
that you probably should have
tested it on this Hamiltonian,
because this one
certainly-- at least looking
at the Hamiltonian, maybe I'm
missing something-- does not
exhibit the sign problem.
But maybe--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI:
But maybe that is
a problem of the definition of
the nonstochastic Hamiltonian,
because usually the
nonstochastic Hamiltonian
is discussed in the
computational basis.
If we do some tricky
transformation
to the bases, of course we
may remove the negative sign
problem.
But we-- a priori, we do
not know how to solve,
how to remove the negative
sign problem in a general case.
But at least in
general, our method
removes the negative
sign program
with like-- sorry, just a
minute-- this kind of subject.
Very strong, very-- range,
wide range of applications.
AUDIENCE: I'd be interested
in seeing them, but--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes,
of course, of course.
Yes, yes.
For this class, we may find
some trickier transformation.
Of course, I agree
with you, yes.
AUDIENCE: Actually, if you'll
allow me, I have two questions.
OK, so one is about-- can you
go in your definition of an m
tilde x?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI:
Sorry, again, please.
AUDIENCE: Can you go on the
definition of an m tilde x?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: m teeta?
AUDIENCE: m tilde x.
Your--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, yes.
OK, sorry.

This one?
Yeah.
AUDIENCE: So it's the
Lagrange multiplier
from the delta function, right?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Mhm.
AUDIENCE: So, and you're
saying that you get
m tilde from a subtle point?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes.
AUDIENCE: But a
subtle point-- I mean,
subtle point is good when the
thing in the exponent is large.
But if tau is the number
of [INAUDIBLE] slices,
that's large, right?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, yes.
AUDIENCE: And in the exponent,
you have something small.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Tau when the--
delta over tau is small, yes.
But the prefactor exists as
a system size [? m ?] over n,
yes.
AUDIENCE: So this works if your
system size is larger than--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, yes, yes.
AUDIENCE: OK, so--
because I think,
effectively, it's working
because f is quadratic.
It's a quadratic function.
So there are--
MASAYUKI OHZEKI:
Of course, but we
generalize this function form.
AUDIENCE: And you still
think that the subtle point
would be a good approximation?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI:
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]
approximation, because in
a sense of the exact sense,
we have to perform
the [INAUDIBLE]
for sampling the continuous
value of mx and m to the x.
But we consider the system
size infinite limit,
so then we take the
subtle point, yes.
AUDIENCE: And the other
thing is about the efficiency
of this thing, because I
saw that the largest system
size that you consider is 32.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Again, please?
Sorry.
AUDIENCE: The largest system
sizes that you consider is 32.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: 32?
AUDIENCE: Yes, in your-- just
go-- your largest n is 32.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes.
The answer is a yes.
Yes, this is--
AUDIENCE: OK, that's not big.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: But
very good result.
AUDIENCE: I mean, you
can do [INAUDIBLE]
if you want at that size, right?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Mhm, but--
AUDIENCE: So what's the
efficiency of your method?
Do you think you can go
to larger system sizes?
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Yes, of course.
But usually we
hope that we would
take some asymptotic limit of
the system size, a large limit.
So, therefore, this
is just-- of course,
this is just a finite
size simulation.
But we hope that we get
the asymptotic result
by extrapolating the result.
AUDIENCE: But because
this is a simple problem,
on other problems
you might not be
able to see the asymptote
unless you go to n
equal 200 or something.
PRESENTER: So maybe
one last question?
Anyone?
No?
OK, then, with that, let's
thank our last speaker.
MASAYUKI OHZEKI: Thank you.
