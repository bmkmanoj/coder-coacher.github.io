I'm the first speaker I decided to also
use it a little bit as a little
introduction to stop to towards the
other speakers so first a very brief
quick refresher how some of the IP
networking is done in mobile networks
it's very very simplified so don't take
everything too literally on my slides
but it gives you a good idea if you if
you're not familiar with the situation
about the important topics that mobile
providers have to deal with regarding
ipv6 then of course I have to show a
little bit about where we are regarding
our support in our equipment and also
where Nokia support is some common
problems that we are discovering because
we are now in a face where we are
working a lot with providers to actually
start to deploy ipv6 and I added a nice
conclusion slide because why not i had a
time right so the important thing about
a mobile networking is especially for
the for the for the IP part is that we
run everything out for a tunnel and
since we run everything out for a tunnel
and I showed you the the current 3gpp
free version for a for 3g networks but
because we run everything everton a lot
of things actually got a lot easier
because that means that everything
that's underneath the doesn't matter I
mean we can run that on a private ipv4
network or whatever but the user will
never see that and so that also means
that we really only have to deal with a
bit of tunnel and make sure that
everything there is going to be like
ipv6 compliance there is a nice draft
recently written by a colleague and some
other goalie sexually of mine and they
detail a little bit more about all this
and they're so I've listed here almost
slides don't write it out for the site
are available on the web and it's it's
actually nice introduction Eric section
that gives you a little bit more about
details about all the other nice
keywords that i will be using the other
important thing is to set up a
connection you have to set up in the PDP
context and that is the relationship
between your mobile device and the core
network to end up this all about like
which gateway am I going to use what IP
address am I going to use and what kind
of quality of service level the reality
the colossal service levels are not
really used that much the important
points I really what IP address or IP
address prefix or whatever am I going to
use the but it's an important difference
and back you'll hear a lot of mobile
people talk about is this PDP context is
the fact that you can only have an ipv4
PDP context or an ipv6 PDP context that
makes things a little bit more
complicated because she cannot just open
like a dual stack PDP context all at
once at this moment luckily enough
there's lots of work going on to fix
that but at the same time you know from
a computer science or computer
engineering kind of perspective it
actually really doesn't matter you just
open to PDP context and you will have an
ipv4 and an ipv6 address no problem but
there are some consequences of course
because this is mobile networking and
consequences from some overheads state
overhead etc and sometimes also some
crossover I have because and Famers want
to have some money based on licensing
the gateways so the important thing is
that it's a v6 you're going to get like
a fifth or only connection you're going
to get a physics only connection and if
you are really going to do both of them
you will have to open to PDP context
otherwise we actually really don't have
that many problems in in a in a mobile
network because of all the stumbling
that we are already doing the thing is
that you will see a lot of people saying
like well because we have to do this
extra work it's actually it's more
attractive to go one friction of IP
because it saves us from cost etc but
the preferred model for many people
still they will stack and it's actually
fairly doable and luckily enough we are
working on a dual stack version of the
PDP context of the don't have this
problem in the future anymore
let's see I'll just get this slide to
then for address configuration for like
a laptop I'm or like a cellular router
for dialogue purposes one of the here
it's already shown basically in PDP
context that actually does v4 and v6
because it will be there in the future
anyways but for a dialogue purpose that
it will be just like like you will use
like a PPP connection look at a fee for
NF e 6 address and you're basically done
or actually if he seeks prefix of course
because that's what we do important to
note here is also that we do it based on
normally on / 64 prefixes pair you bear
use your laptop whatever you want to
call it and that's the simple basically
old fashion model obviously there's much
more of a trend nowadays to go a little
bit away from old stelco models of
dial-up I mean it's a bit silly you know
in a wireless network to still talk
about dialogue but that's really really
what it still looks like and we're
getting more and more incentivized to
actually do something more sensible and
make a mobile devices router in that
case you will see that the PDP context
actually gets terminated on the mobile
and the mobile can then just lower
router advertisements to the to the
laptop and do do something like net PT /
or net to actually deal with the before
part but even in that case is pretty
clear you can just do dual stack and
without too much trouble the only so now
we go a little bit too like more
implementation details again we're doing
petty goods there I mean it's like
there's a couple of different major
mobile operating systems I mean we
there's one by Google for example that's
the workhorse nokia used a lot of simeon
of course i have to show you symbian and
we can each
they do they're now in an open ipv4 PDP
context we can do an open ipv6 PDP
context so it's actually easy for an
application to to do physics networking
or to do fee for networking from a dual
spec those stack perspective there are
some strange effects though and that is
people you know on a mobile you are much
more likely also to open like a PDP
context like for one application so you
won't really be using like ipv6 and ipv4
like from one application you will be
using either one and in practice I don't
think that really is a problem or
something like that but it can sometimes
lead to confusing situations when people
are working with this kind of stuff I
mean we are much more used to like a
single application that that has access
to the older networking components on
the device then we have the memo series
of devices which will soon be called me
go because that's got merged its
interest Linux implementations there we
are a little behind in the sense that
it's fee for is not physics is not quite
supported in production versions of the
software yet but it is available on the
nets the web link is here so just take a
look at it if you're interested and
download it I'm not going to say a lot
more about this either because actually
young is going to show demo about how
this stuff actually can can be used and
be using ipv6 despite that's officially
not really released yet but it can all
be downloaded this is slide with our
product support I'm very quickly going
offering because I want to actually show
you the more interesting stuff this is
just more for reference if you're if you
want to know all the details about our
sporting hardware that you want to know
then just look at the appendix likes and
take a look at it so deployment status
we are getting more and more focused on
deployment I mean as a vendor we have
seen a lot of questions for people
coming to us like this ipv6 thing is not
that important stuff like that and and
in the beginning actually we were one of
the early guys I mean
in 2005 2004 we already had like ipv6 in
symbian Viet ipv6 in our ggsn sgsn so we
could do all this stuff but it wasn't
really that much the month before
actually too early but luckily enough it
now and start not to see that life has
actually gotten easier for us because we
don't have to push anybody anymore
people are asking us and we are ready
for it so there's a demo from young
later about their deployments I mean vc
t-mobile USA now deploying tele I'm
sooner i already had like for a long
time ipv6 in the network enables but we
couldn't talk about it or people didn't
know about it now now it's like public
so we can we can mention it this the big
thing that we see in those deployments
and all the testing that we doing that
with other profile dices that's of
course we we could discover books and
finding works is important and it's we
need more deployment to find that but
you know one of the mantras that people
which uses like dual stack is fantastic
and we need to do it that way and then
we are done of course what we are seeing
now is more that there's also some
different approaches possible and I
shouldn't Cameron is going to talk a
little bit about that as well where
maybe you should just offer like v6 only
and just be done with it perhaps as a
cheaper service or whatever but that's
the topic that's that is getting more
attention now and you're getting more
question about it and it might be
grounds for a little bit more discussion
how the common problem i means as we
mentioned already is like the business
case for ipv6 has always been fairly
difficult because it's just hard to
quantify how much money you really are
going to save in long term versus all
the costs that you make in the short
term and the big thing has always been
that a lot of this kind of deployments
were just a single individual who did
something and then individual goes and
moves to another company and nothing
happens to that anymore we kept that
routing on the internet etc the good
news that we are seeing at the moment is
that this is actually less and less of a
problem I mean we don't really have to
explain anything to anybody
anymore it's just like oh we need it
because we have heard we're going to run
out and to me this is actually very
important milestone I think here for
each people speak you just don't have
these problems anymore that we have to
continuously talking about the why and
the vote and etc it's became the oldest
show makes just necessary and just
continue from there as I said from our
perspective it's actually yeah the
packet forwarding the support in the
hardware etc is actually not that hard I
mean there's a lot of ancillary issues
lots of network management problems lots
of other things that we would like to
have ipv6 enabled but they're not
necessary that's critical to start
waitin to get deployed right away and
one of the biggest things that we keep
running into is actually not just the
network because the network is all
beautiful and nice etc but it's actually
the overall structure of a corporation
the overall support that you need in a
corporation and i put here bond exam
very simple example on the slide about
eliana Shannara where we had for example
problems where the subscription
management system didn't know that
somebody actually had like also
subscribe to ipv6 servers so every night
and the subscription management services
will do their thingy the ipv6
subscription will be wiped out and there
we wind again and that kind of problems
it's like of course it has been solved
on this not a big deal but there's a lot
of this kind of little problems that you
find everywhere and people just keep
running into it and it's just while the
networking people and the IP people know
about IPC section know how to deploy it
it's this almost all the little pieces
of the corporation of no idea what
you're talking about you're talking
about support people etc so from our
perspective there's a lot of they are
more real user experience now necessary
we need to need to make this next step
to from just testing it to actually let
it lay on the loose tour to real normal
users let's see i have a brief
conclusion too because he wants me to
finish up
and so for us from our perspective dual
stack is still preferred we like it it's
simple we have good experience with what
we have deployed so far but with other
providers but we also see some people
you know sometimes having a little
slightly different requirements we see
some operators that said we can do offer
a difference on what different service
by doing physics only we see some people
that say like we just like the
simplicity of not having to deal with
either v6 or fee for of course we like
them not to be able t for any more but
that's a different story of course
there's things like dependencies on alts
handsets that are still in the fields I
mean one ends we we are working in the
industry where every six months
everything gets replaced but on the
other hand there's of course a lot of
people they just keep all their old
equipment around and it's going to cause
trouble so you still have to support
that so just saying like a double stack
so close everything though obviously
doesn't for this kind of cases let's
skip it and then yeah basically the
other thing that I already mentioned I
mean we we actually don't see that much
problem actually any more of its yeah
the pure networking part of the story I
mean be we still want no more vineet
into Moodle more testing we know that
books are found I mean we were working
with young on the tooth mobile network
we did find a lot of issues here and
there but you know those things can be
fixed I mean there were no major
stumbling blocks all those things can
get fixed but we are now getting into
the face where yah where we have to
spread out this knowledge into other
parts of the company but also very
important and where it's not always so
well received because they don't care
about things like v4 or v6 wats that
they is they just don't know about it
and that's it any questions
any questions thank you exok moving
crates great to have Cameron burn from
t-mobile here thank you you know just
take it straight on here thank you all
right so first and foremost I want to
really thank Eric and Lauren's are for
putting this on also for their efforts
at Google is made a huge impact on the
awareness and a huge impact on my
ability to go throughout t-mobile and
say you know we really need to move
forward and the contents there the
iceberg is fine with the chicken and the
egg problem so big thanks to google our
google specifically Eric in Lorenzo and
lots of other ranking nice example
involved yes and we also like to thank
comcast a huge huge huge mover on the
fixed-line front a facebook yeah guys
and symbian because i want to be able to
do a whole lot without handsets that
work so i'm going to move really quickly
through this deck i have a lot of slides
a lot of things i want to touch on but a
high level thing is that mobile is easy
to do ipv6 with as David just pointed
out there's all these tunnels and things
that make my life easy for deploying
ipv6 I don't have you know access
networks that have a high degree of
variability in them it's very uniform
there's all these tunnels the traffic
moves around inside of tunnels what's
inside of those tunnels whether the
traffic be ipv4 or ipv6 doesn't really
matter that much from the architectural
perspective t-mobile's path forward is
ipv6 only so in we have product cycles
committed now for timelines of handset
settles ship to stores that will be ipv6
only it's not soon but it's pretty soon
it's within product lifecycle scope type
soon so we are planning on bringing ipv6
only handsets to users so that's
important it's especially important
because some things don't work with I
cv6 only network and we'll talk about
ipv4 literals and what they mean to
content network providers today on our
network we have an ipv6 only service
that's nationwide so 200 million covered
pops or people in the United States can
get ipv6 service through t mobile
wireless network today so I'll start in
to the side so as David kind of pointed
out here's like the general just to the
mobile architecture as you can see on
the diagram to the right you can see
that there's a South site it aggregates
up to an a local aggregation point and
then it aggregates to the mobility
anchor all those links between these
steps at the cell site aggregation for
mobility and the mobility anchor are
encapsulated in ipv it are encapsulated
an IP say it's ipv4 it's called gb for
kind of close to the access side and
gina and closer closer to the core stock
close to the course ID so i was able to
turn on ipv6 two handsets without
actually telling anybody in the RF
network engineering group touching any
south sides touching anything the core
aggregation network all I had to do was
change the IP anchor the ggsn node as
it's known to support ipv6 so at t
mobile ipv6 is a priority this is this
is my main message that's why I'm coming
in and talking to you today is to say
that ipv6 is a priority the problem
statement is we've run out of IP
addresses mobile providers do lots of
things that mobile network engineers
would think are crazy reusing 10 / 8 you
know multiple times bogen addresses all
kinds of things that are unhappy and
people talk about CGN but really CGN is
already in the mobile world today we do
a tremendous amount of that um as does
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon starting to just talk
to the gentleman from sprint they don't
do it yet but they're staring down that
barrel so it's very common to have a lot
of matin network
so we're going to need ipv6 to continue
growing we can't keep up with the net we
don't want to reproduce 10 space over
and over again because that killed and
then services like sip or an IMS which
are really the future of of mobile
telephony so we need ipv6 and then dual
stack doesn't really work out for us get
that next slide but um the address
environment today is there's bogans keep
growing need ipv6 end-to-end I'm very
optimistic about end the year 2011 that
fifty percent of my traffic can be ipv6
that's because I send a whole lot of
traffic to Google like I I got lot and I
send a lot of traffic to Facebook and I
send a lot of traffic to yahoo and those
guys are in this room and they're
thinking about ipv6 and they're moving
that that rock up the hill foot forming
so I am very optimistic that there will
be a 50-percent content tipping point
for my network knowing what what
protocols my network has who my
destinations are I feel very confident
about that so I need you know the the
long tail that come along too but for
the long tail I have technologies that
will help me a bridge that that'll be
nat64 DNS 64 there's a presentation
tomorrow on that it's good for the
network guys and the content guys to all
understand how that's going to work
because it's important some stuff is
broken today major things are broken
today but we're going to keep moving
forward there's no traditional business
case for ipv6 so this has been a problem
usually how things work through a
telecom network is that there's a
forecast and as a product guy and they
come up with this plan and they get
together with the forecast and the
budget in the marketing and they they
move it through and there's money in
this project manager and there's no
forecast for demand for ipv6 there's no
revenue it's kind of more like a bit
there's a little bit of a business
continuity thing you can say that you
know our business going to fall apart in
2015 because we can't address anybody
and CGS going to you know won't won't be
maintainable so
the entire business is lost you can say
something like that but it's it gets
hairy so it really has to be championed
by individual contributors kind of
taking the initiative to say hey this is
easy and we can do it in and really it
is low-hanging fruit as I said I I
rolled it out to you know 20 million
people that are in radio coverage or
join a million people that are in radio
coverage so really it's a small team
that can do that I understand it's
harder and allow the access networks but
wireless 3gpp it really is pretty easy
so what the IETF has been telling us for
a long time is that the way that move
forward is with dual stack dual stack as
David pointed out costs more money for
mobile operators it's more complex and
when I take more money in my particular
instance it costs exactly two times as
much money so it's not very easy to say
to my VP that hey let's do ipv6 and it's
going to cost twice as much Courtney not
going to work so we're we're really
eager to find solutions of our ipv6 only
and with this friendly user trial that
we've had we've been able to position it
it says come on David um well twice as
much money for your jejeje sent gateway
entire packet core the entire effective
core you know that's the parenthesis do
twice as many PDP's will mean twice as
many I UPS twice as many mobility events
it really trickles down into exactly
twice as much money goes especially when
you pay for your packet core by PDP yeah
that part I understand sperryville but
there's a lot of older parts where it's
probably not quite as bad right well so
when I say entire now I mean entire
packet core so but that comes in release
eight and release nine so we're not
there also so that the question is what
about dual stack PDP context so dual
stack PDP context is defined in 3gpp
release eight for LTE networks and in
3gpp release nine for non LTE networks
so yes absolutely
you can do that in those networks but I
don't have a release 8 network I don't
have released nine now we're compact
nobody but nobody has a release eight or
nine network today so but i do have
address problems today so the address so
if you define the the issue as I'm
running out about IP addresses I don't
have IP addresses to provision of my
subscribers today that are good I can't
get them public address I can't even
give them 1918 addresses if you define
it like that then it becomes dual-stack
doesn't solve my problem because I still
need an ipv4 address don't have an ipv4
address so that that's you know
strategically we want to be correct in
choosing the path for ipv6 and
strategically everybody agrees the end
stages ipv6 so let's go the end stain
work backwards and see how we can get
there and if you look at that without
the all the notions that duels text the
way to go you don't see dual stack on
the path so quick diagram about you know
how this how this all works cell site
radio access network sgsn these things
all work it's kind of detailed but the
idea is that here's my friendly user
trial Network everything to the left and
that where it says ran sgsn IP backbone
notice that there's not really a lot of
changes there you know there's the
database that authenticates you have to
say you can do ipv6 the feature has to
be turned on in your sgsn everything
else is the same the lab network is the
ggsn nat64 dns 64 that's all on my
control so it really is pretty easy from
an access network perspective to roll
this out nationally and in fact it has
been rolled out nationally so friendly
user trial finding so it works email
works websites works whole lot of apps
work some apps don't work the fact that
there's a whole lot of apps work this
points to the notion that you can do
everything over ipv6 today ipv6 only
networks and you can do everything
within reason overrun at 64 presumably
anything you can do with / / n at
network today you can do over net 6
or but you know some things aren't going
to work we think that good programming
practices which there's a there's a talk
on that tomorrow about how to make that
work we need to get everything over to
this camp that works so things to keep
in mind i'm here to really talked about
content providers because i'm an access
network so i can do all the excess stuff
the content stuffs that stuff that
that's out of my realm and I really need
to cooperate with the content guys I
want to be a really great partner to
bring your content to our shared
customer ipv4 literals are all over the
Internet today ipv4 liberals are IP
addresses embedded in XML documents HTTP
HTML it's when you have a IP address
like one dot one that one that one or
whatever your public IP address is for
your service that that's embedded I
can't it breaks nat64 Dean that 64
there's a taco we'll go over that
tomorrow about how those work but the
key is if you have IP addresses in your
systems we need to work together to fix
that otherwise there's going to be some
breakage so in an easy way to fix it is
to use an fqdn ftv ends are a good idea
anyways so the quicker you can get des
better here's some slides I just want to
share from to help spur some questions
and some comments so here's a major
online retailer that also deals in video
streaming notice that they are passing
so you see all this traffic here it's
all ipv6 it's all dns 64 not 64 it's
working great page loads great I go to
the launch the streaming and here here
comes this ipv4 address transmitted
inside my ipv6 packet in something
that's labeled HTTP XML and it says
connect us this IP address this ipv4
address it could be a name it could be a
name you're exactly right if this were
an fqdn it would work
huh okk that's right but by the point is
that this is this is breakage here and
we've worked a lot of great people that
to fix this breakage in various places
myspace had this with akamai we work
with them they fixed it they roll down
the production network it was great
they're great partner yahoo had the
similar problem they fixed it great
partner hulu had the same problem before
we reached out to them they fixed it so
in part of my regression testing you
know I want to have my customers to have
a good experience so I periodically go
through the alexa list of the top 100
sites to see what works and which breaks
hulu fix it on their own so they had a
new video player out so they fixed it
but there are people out there that are
broken you know there's other sites that
don't work for various reasons I don't
know why here's another thing that I
want to kind of put out there in terms
of what ipv6 enables so today as Dave
was saying it's very hierarchical how
this traffic moves off the network as we
grow with 4G and we start getting 100
megabits per second to the handset type
of thing we need to start not taking all
that traffic into centralized nodes we
need to start xing in it closer to the
cell site so ipv6 allows us to get there
because we no longer have to a grenade
all the traffic for address purposes we
can exit it out you know the cell site
may have a jeep on connection itself and
it'll get you going faster to where you
need to be instead of back calling your
traffic to some far-off city where we
have a big aggregation site so look at
that slide and think about it these are
things that work today amazon coms web
page works there's west george and i'm
in my facebook he works there in that
top of the v6 version that's the dns 64
not 64 version so you know i can make
these pages work in my lab today this is
an ipv6 only experience some things
don't work IMDb it doesn't work it's not
an ipv4 little but I don't know why
doesn't want
it's on the top 100 website so we need
we need to work through that and all the
other content players need to help us
work through that the best way to work
through it is what Google's done really
do an ipv6 announcing their qualities
because the fact is that if you're a
content provider and you don't announce
qua days and you don't announce your
traffic as a as an over v6 transport I
will and I'm going to do with the CGN
I'm going to do with the DNS 642 at 64 I
want it to work either way but my guess
is that it's going to work better if you
just do it natively here's another thing
about n den and we talked about this and
firewalls a little bit quicks offered a
innovative service for video sharing
they're doing it over or they have to
deal with mobile subscribers over neck
when they have to do that they have to
take all the traffic into their servers
and they have to pin hole it through the
net you know whether it be you know an
AT&amp;amp;T subscriber or a sprint subscribe or
something like that if you weren't doing
that you could send the media and to end
and you don't have these capacity
problems you're just you know doing the
signaling for session set up but when
there's NAT you have to send the media
through some rendezvous point of a sort
and and make it go so future scalability
would definitely be better with ipv6 um
just a slide about how / 64 / you ease a
lot of traffic or a lot of addresses and
that's it questions thank you we have a
few minutes for questions five minutes
for persons or so please i really like
questions yeah yeah Martin levy
hurricane electric you glossed over
something arm but I want to just bring
you back to it and you talked about the
fact that each cell site can have enough
address space and you don't have to
bring stuff back to NAT it in a central
location that's phenomenal and that's
the fundamental difference between v4
and v6 do you have any idea how that
will change traffic patterns for arm for
mobile players i mean i'm on i'm not on
your network I know I know half my
packets are going to Atlanta
even though I'm sitting here and I
probably know who your provider is
anyway can you just can use address that
because that that is a fundamental
difference ready for and be safe
absolutely whichever fax us network wise
absolutely so you know it's obvious that
you know one of the things that we've
done a tmobile over the last five years
is we've really decentralized our
network so that we probably are more
decent draws than any other player in
the United States in terms of having
users be closer to their mobility anchor
point where they exit out to the
Internet this brings us down to the
south side it comes down to an issue if
you have 300 or 3000 South sites in
Manhattan each one of them is capable of
doing over 100 megabits per second where
are you bringing all that traffic to
naughty not not even the geographic
location but you know now you have a
site that's carrying you know a physical
location with you know 3,000 times 100
sites worth the try that's a lot of
liability if you can and that's a lot of
backhaul cost to huge amount of bad call
costs but I can exit that via Jeep on or
something like that at the south side
it's a better user experience less
latency and cheaper for me because now I
don't have that a big honkin data center
and move all these bits I can distribute
them out closer to closer to the user
and get them routing shortest path as
quick as possible Kenny home from Cisco
is t-mobile in conversations with other
operators to understand the inner
operator dependencies in roaming and
local breakout scenarios yeah so the
local breakout stuff is is is in the
3gpp as it's called sip toe and life in
lip depot or lipa those those things are
more kind of near the homie no be so
that it's absolutely part of the 3gpp
process but what I've been proposing is
not necessarily a new standard but
terminating the existing s1 interface at
the cell site so that it works with
existing works with existing standards
for the LTE scenario but it's um it's
not gotten a lot of traction because a
lot of the legacy vendors like to do
things legacy way but
the roaming cases ipv4 roaming is so far
out you know we've reached out to
roaming partners about ipv4 or ipv6
roaming and they've all responded no
even though we know that a lot of their
networks do ipv6 roaming today as per
Frederick's testing including TTC so
honest and you launched this service
file Wallace all of your users I do that
on the existing APM I did you went ahead
and create a new APN for those
user-selected have to change the APN
settings in the terminal so I'm sorry if
I was confusing this is for a friendly
user trial so this isn't all my users
this is all my network but only a
friendly user group of users in intel
com we call beta a friendly user trial
okay so you go ahead and manually
provision geez these users in the hlr
with great the specific PDP type okay a
second question have you found any other
terminals than the symbiont base
terminal that would do v6 no I've this
is it kind of goes back to when Lorenzo
and I first started talking about ipv6
we he said you know I'm going to put it
on Wi-Fi because that's easy to do and I
have a Wi-Fi access point if you build
me an ipv6 UMTS network I'll start
working on it so I said okay yeah so
hopefully they'll some Android
developers around here listening today I
hope so too it it's definitely theory
theory I build it and they will come so
i built the ipv6 network bringing
terminals I blame Qualcomm my nexus one
what do v6 and that's because the radio
baseband layer won't do it it's
supported by its supported for thee I
believe the proprietary protocol that
the Thera OS uses but if you want to use
the raw access to the chip you can't do
it it's not supported so on the nexus
one it's a non-starter and I just like
to point out that in the last month
t-mobile met with all of our handset
manufacturers and all the chipset
manufacturers that we purchased from and
told them our plan so that they can
align the road man but I want to ask
another question can you quantify the
impact on latency of the what you said
before a terminating v6 traffic locally
whereas you have to back home before to
a central net location because you don't
have enough space and I asked this
question because
there are certain counter providers that
do care about latency and saying that
you know quantifying actually
quantifying the latency changes and the
impact on geolocation and things like
that oh yeah this will give you a very
granular geolocation so exist out if we
could quantify that in some way then
that certainly does become a good reason
for content providers to do b6 mmm yeah
so it's quantified just in the latency
backhaul between that you would have to
have it so you know whatever the latency
backhaul is between a salsa and that
application in the regional aggregation
node which would be 20 to 30
milliseconds on a round trip right so
you can los tovar the ipv6 address
assignment a little bit at the end you
envisioned particularly for the privacy
challenges do you envision that the
device will have a permanent address for
a long time or or what are you seeing or
is if you have a privacy feature so it
doesn't look like a cookie etc so I I
personally have a lot of I choke on the
idea that you know every ue needs to get
a / 64 I accept that that's the industry
and I'm not going to pick that fight but
at the same time I have the numbers here
that you know I I can easily go through
30 bits of space you know the you know
did this this is my initial plan for IP
addresses is that I'll use 30 bits and
that that's it so that's a lot of it
from my perspective it's a lot of
addresses but you know I'm not going to
pick the fight about you know go back
didn't you know rii standardized
everything the fact is is that all the
vendors for 3gpp gear have hard-coded /
64 as the interface type that every
mobile subscriber will get so it's not
an option yada yada co ericsson um I
went to touched upon this be four
address later le sue and we've seen that
as well and while I didn't personally
feel that that's a being on a v6 only
not 64 network for a couple months you
know I didn't feel that that's a big
issue for me personally but we've done
some measure mins and i'll talk
them more tomorrow and and there are
some but what I want to point out is
that that seems almost like a one-time
effort that we go through Alexa million
and and we fix everything we complain
you know that probably I mean we've done
part of this work already but probably
need some cooperation because me as a
research guy in some vendor organization
doesn't really can go to Amazon and
sailing you must think this but when
someone who has millions of users behind
them probably kid so right I'm
cooperation may be needed right net
that's exactly why I flew down e i
usually don't attend conferences and
travel but this the ipv4 literal issue
in content will will cause breakage and
I want to work with the content
providers to partner with them to make
sure that there isn't breakage so you
know it were over a year out from from
where I would ideally like to see ipv6
handsets in stores but I so you know
what Google is done that's the best way
to do it you met you publish qua days
you host your traffic as ipv6 your 100%
there that's amazing you know what
they're my number one content provider
that my subscribers go to so I got it I
got a real big win in my side pocket
about how much content I can move on
ipv6 but there are major websites out
there we have to camp right there so
that that were were there passing ipv4
addresses have you considered have you
considered a building am NOT a wall of
shame but uh that sort of a a
collaborative website which / would
perform periodic monitoring of a high of
high-impact websites to identify the
problem and help them fix them it
wouldn't have to be a tmobile effort /
say you could coordinate with other
interested parties yeah its depth as you
see here to there in Pattin side packets
not on URLs all right it's in these XML
documents are interactive so it becomes
it becomes pretty difficult but you know
we definitely need to get there as my
friendly user trial matures and gets
larger on
definitely the kind of exchange I want
to have because that's the purpose of
the friendly user trial get the users
the content network together let's all
make it go HTTP is an important protocol
but there's all other protocols that IP
address but urls in them that we also
need to get fixed or have applications
deal with good point okay so no
terminals besides symbian yes one for
you that's also rendering internet movie
database for you so fixed that one and
if you don't want to use quick you can
use blink TV instead that works so there
are solutions and I have an Android two
dot one cellular ipv6 phone right in
here if you want to become part of the
friendly user trial and help us move
this rock up the up the hill please
contact me I'm always willing to help
help get folks in the community together
to get on ipv6 thank you thank you very
much my name is Ben Parker I'm the
director of wireless network planning at
verizon wireless obviously I just kind
of use verizon wireless as a as a
tagline actually work for Verizon
corporate so I'm just kind of get to
fake that I work for wireless
periodically so just a just a quick
background on our problem so we have
around we actually have more than 40,000
sell or 45,000 cell sites way more than
90 million subscribers okay and end with
LTE as a tmobile as mentioning our peak
sector good put is actually going to be
upwards of 80 megabits per second three
sectors or more per cell sites that's
some pretty big backhaul the cell site
to the mid so requirements are huge
interestingly enough you're the only
other person I've ever talked to on the
planet it talks about local break out of
the cell site I'm just absolutely
thrilled about that by the way and then
we have about 200 you know greater than
250 cell sites permit so in the normal
problems so if you look at today we are
backhauling in the old IP backhaul
network around 600 megabits per second
from all of the cell sites a sign of
that MIT so to the MIT so as we step
forward to later this year that goes
greater than 20 gigabits per second so
not a big amount of bandwidth and what a
lot of the service providers consider
but it's a huge step for a wireless isp
and wireless service provider so what we
did so back in the Bell Atlantic mobile
days we had an analog wireless network
called CD PD and it was extraordinarily
popular with police departments and what
was interesting is the the police
officers would look up your your
driver's license or whatever and they'd
get information back and periodically
the police department would actually
reach out to a police car on announced
over the IP network so we needed a
globally unique public IP address to
every single police car well that seemed
really popular and reasonable back when
we had about 10,000 police cars on our
network nationwide then we moved up to
1x RTT and the decision was made to
continue to use globally unique well
then all of a sudden we scoot forward a
few years BlackBerry's getting a little
more stress than droid shows up and
there's no IP addresses to be found so
we very quickly actually started to
federate the network and deploying that
44 and so we're we're now we have 40
overlaps of the RFC 1918 space
nationwide and and are pretty well
distributing that so this is kind of a
the good news the bad news the good news
is we have plenty of 44 Matt resources
to go for a long time but we are
certainly pushing towards v6 pretty hard
so as far as the LTE when we launch
later this year LTE is going to have do
everything is going to be dual stacked
and of course the are the ipv4 address
is going to be 1918 the v6 address can
be public / 64 all devices going to have
to IP addresses ones always going to be
registered with the VoIP network and the
other is going to be
for the the data APN so the the first
ipv6 devices are really going to be
available in 4q and yeah this
compliments at qualcomm working really
really hard with the vendors to make
sure that we can support v6 in the
devices and as soon as LTE comes online
that's really the the DMark point
handsets will become more and more
prolific with v6 starting in the first
quarter of 2011 so that's our reel or
real drop-dead dates so because we're a
cdma network and we're moving towards
LTE which is 3gpp2 moving towards 3gpp
it really represents a green field
environment for us so as we move from IP
backhaul to Ethernet backhaul every one
of the cell site routers is addressed
with an ipv6 address it's every single
one of them all of them it says all the
aggregation routers are all ipv6
addressed just we were able to literally
re address the entire network in about a
year simply because it was a green field
the MPLS core it's six vpe that's been
completely turned on and life is good
and the only bad sign is that the legacy
infrastructure the evdo and wax ATT
network is going to remain ipv4 up until
they are shut down there's it's never
going to change it's not even worth the
effort there's not a lot of network
elements of so on so as far as the
network services what we're really
looking at here is to is to create
islands of ipv6 so the IMS core that's
absolutely be v6 it always has been v6
it actually really isn't supporting v4
we're going to nad everything into it
via session border controllers or
whatever is appropriate the over-the-top
services or ipv6 when practical we're
working with all of the content
providers and various other folks to
make sure that's ipv6 from the start and
we're really pushing hard for all of our
existing services to be migrated by by
the end of year 2012 and it's a fair
number of services but there's a small
small number of asp's that are going to
take a while to my grades so we're
giving them a couple years the asp s
they're being driven home
as well and of course the internet we're
going to have the six and four internet
available from the from the get-go DNS
we are DNS is a huge issue for us so we
haven't we're deploying the DNS servers
out towards the edge right now
reengineering the caching architecture
supporting the initiatives that yahoo
has been pushing forward and then we're
also going to start actually asking for
the white listing programs to start
coming up in the next few months our
biggest challenge quite honestly is that
we went from from circuit-switched good
old-fashioned ds1 serving every single
part of the network to all-ip in less
than two years so the folks who actually
operate the network didn't even have
time to get used to saying ipv4 before
they had to start saying ipv6 so we're
really having a great deal of problems
manage that migration we're really
leaning on our vendors very very hard
but the folks are coming up online
training is a big deal the academic
training you need to send them in a
class and teaching them that that's
really great the memory of that last i'm
estimating about 17 minutes as soon as
the first beer gets in their hand the
everything i learned in class goes away
that's fine the web based classes
everybody asks for him again the value
of those is almost as much as the
academic classes what we're really
happening is how to just as soon as we
have an outage people learn really hard
we're going fast and they never forget
that so it's actually really kind of sad
we're this last few week we've got a
couple of interesting outages that are
really really quite complicated really
something that I wouldn't have predicted
and in so well there are lessons we've
learned and will never ever do again so
a few of the executives are really
pissed off about it but at the end of
the day I'm glad the outages happen
today rather than six months from now
and LTE launch but basically that is
what we're going to be doing we're dual
stacking every one of our device is
going to be a smartphone starting on the
four gene or the 4g network and and
that's where we're at so
that's quick and easy dirty got all the
t-mobile questions done yeah thanks
Allah Grace's go hey have you got time
for questions we do absolutely no we
brought him out here so I missed a thumb
were you gonna have the dual rapper
you're going to be tunneling to v4 over
v6 you said dual stack like you just
quickly ran through that and catch what
you were doing so so each phone is going
to have dual sac so I'm gonna have to
rap to PDP context is absolutely you're
not concerned about comment that was
made about cosmo beef is available I
thing and but I mean quite honestly I am
NOT concerned in the least because the
cost of losing a customer is way more
than the cost of my ran so I'm willing
to throw money at the problem to make
sure that doesn't happen it's actually
kind of funny is we actually asked
there's a business case for this for an
h.323 alg to be put on the carrier-grade
NAT the business case one to actually
have it developed simply because the
fear of a potential customer having a
323 running over the network a guarantee
that nobody's running through 23 over
the network will never use the alg but
we're going to pay enough you know pay
for it just simply to mitigate that risk
so it's pretty scary thanks Ralph walls
would command control you're the second
person to come up and say that training
has some challenges mm-hmm and we just
got done doing a training course of
implementing ipv6 in securing ipv6 for
DARPA and the missile defense agency and
we did this in a way so it was in the
format of a transition plan right you
know letting meet people know okay this
is how you get familiar and here's a
common language and then here's how
we're going to be securing it but this
is all preparatory to actually going
into a transition right we did this in
partnership with the DARPA in in
partnership of understanding their
interface types of things like that we
got a lot of great comments back saying
holy crap
right how can people haven't told us
this before the lack that you had a poor
training is it because as you said yours
at repeat because people don't use it
was it the sequencing the training
timing and rods we you said earlier
about your training to is it the same
thing about sequencing of setting things
up so I think I mean if I had my
druthers from a sequence perspective is
I would have all major outages on a
predictable schedule and I'd have
training events you know training events
would end at seven o'clock right before
maintenance window started when these
outages would occur the problem totally
is timing it's it's simply the atrophy
the holy crap part we get that all the
time the other thing that I get all the
time is one they hat when we do have a
v6 related outage or something like that
it's well why didn't we have training
well we did it just you know that the
relevance of the training is dictated
based on that particular outage so it
becomes once you get hands-on once you
characterize once all of these things
happen so much becomes so much more
becomes relevant and that's that's what
I found in fact my experience the
military you can you can go to you know
for derwin and go to wherever need white
you can do all the training you want you
can spend months on the field you never
learn anything until the first day you
actually go go live and somebody
shooting at you that's when I reported
my first ship they said okay forget
everything you learn now you're gonna do
it right exactly I I know to me but I
had a so I spent in a lot of time doing
a network ray architecture project and
one of the guys on the team's a former
submariner and he says we can you can
work out all the problems but they'll
just make a dumber sailor and so you
know um you just can't win you know it's
just yeah i would i would love to know
the answer two questions so one is do
you anticipate firewalling the ipv6
addresses of the users
based on current p.m. oh yes what that
really looks like is TBD stone I think
it's going to be fairly light at the end
but there'll be a staple though there
will be stateful devices between you
ease and right ya know it right now at
each one of the gateways there is
absolutely a stateful device that has
taken a look at that my concern is that
well how much you know what do we really
need to do how much do we really need to
actually do that as compared to ipv4
where there are some really pretty
interesting attack vectors v6 is a
little bit tougher so what are the
attack vectors that we need to worry
about and I think that that's like
training you know we're gonna we're
going to see a lot more evolved over
time and we've reached out to folks
about in gsma and some other
organizations about v6 roaming so have
you seen anything back as when we asked
we you know pretty much the roaming
people are like you know there's
somebody thinking about ipv6 and some
carrier somewhere they're definitely not
at home do well yeah but so we always
when we talk about roaming you know
we're specifically talking about LTE so
it doesn't anybody don't even go to
these six so we get big guttural
laughter coming from people and when you
talk about LTE roaming because the the
network's reeling are coming online for
a while so we're going to have start
having the discussions more and more i
would expect next year and then people
are going to start talking about v6
after that but the last conversation I
had related to roaming and or v6 there
was just it was a non-starter I'm glad
I've seen the same thing it's
unfortunate so but so what we have to do
is in our hands that's we've been going
back and telling no it went in a roaming
scenario you know fall back to an ipv4
EPN and that's all I mean we're just
planning on that so that you know and
we're pushing one voice right because
the the the the call server is a little
bit obviously a problem so in one voice
that is exactly the the scenario there
and I think that data will naturally
follow that path one question following
on forney early on if you don't if you
don't plan to
if you plan to introduce stateful
devices between the ues and the rest of
the network how are you going to deal
with you ease forming random ipv6
addresses and sending you traffic and
overflowing your state so well in
because that's allowed by 3gpp right the
ue is free to do whatever it likes and
send it packets because it's got its own
size 64 it is allowed the issue is so
all packets have to go to the Gateway
and so the issue is allowing the the
package to move horizontally at that
point so in our current network today it
is not allowed unless under specific
agreement at that point can have at it
welcome and throwing and things like
that so that that is totally a marketing
issue and so when marketing turns that
on then those rules and those questions
get answered that if you just look at a
basic subscriber today the answer
generally be it's not allowed so as
tethering comes on we're going to see
more and more so so the 3gpp compliant
specification sort of device forms
another address and another address then
it's not going to work and it's that
yeah it's just that their issues here
right so it's right but wait we should
take it offline probably but sorry it
comes down to is just permit any out and
deny and any end so that's how that's
how these scenarios look but as soon as
you have that staple device it really
comes into looking a lot like CGN with
ipv6 on both sides and there's a lot of
state now yeah yeah but I think so if
you're effectively saying that you can
only allow one / 128 coming up from the
handset unless you pay more in your
license agreement then he writing code
for android is going to go okay well if
I've got a it you know I can do that
anyway I can I can allow tethering but I
have to build in a nap and we did that
with before let's not do it via no no I
don't think we're gonna say build in the
NAD I think what there's they'll do it
anyway right
wait so so there's an interesting thing
that happened actually complement so
that part of the community in here is
with the open networks so with that open
networks you can do whatever you want to
our network the side effect is you get
billed for it I've read the latest
version I've read a recent version of
the publicly available specs right um it
is a little it's vastly better than it
was right it's a little confusing in
some place it says shall shall chale
chale chale should where it says the
view should form only one IP address and
i'm a paragraph full of shells so it's
but yes so that that is my concern
because um even you're talking about it
as the guy who wrote the v6 code in
android I've been you know talking with
other device manufacturers and how they
would do v6 on LTE and and and they're
saying well but if we need to implement
tethering what are we going to do and I
said well the most natural choices for
you to bridge and so you just send out
the RA and whatever to have the device
behind you will connect and you can
limit the number of addresses but you
can't limit what what they're going to
do so if they limit to just one address
that will result in that right and and
that is that is not what applications
are going to expect and be 60 it's going
to break applications right so since I'm
one of the guys writing the standards
for free DPP actually what we are doing
is trying to get out of the situation
having not 66 so that's why we recently
also introduced in release 10 prefix
delegation for ipv6 so no one can say
but I only get 1 / 64 so i have to do
not 66 and this is also one thing that
we need to discuss further in the
community is what is ipv6 address waste
is it weighs 22 do prefix delegation to
mobile phones where where is the limit
or what what's the situation here but to
answer your question here and so it's
it's allowed to have any kind of
whatever bits you want in the in the in
the 64-bit bits lower 64 bits you can
have whatever you
but then we feel for sending any kind of
firewall or whatever then that's up to
the operator but the specs doesn't say
that you this is this is an option and
about shell and and it should I people
yeah right it's it it's a political
organization sometimes a shell is too
hard for someone to to bear so then it's
going to shoot so that's why yeah we can
and that document is you know as you've
seen that is a living breathing document
ID I would expect that we're gonna get
some more specific questions related to
tethering and that'll get worked out
when it's coming hopefully quickly
Rajeev coolio Cisco part of Cisco which
makes our mobile gateways which I
deployed so the / 64 is what you hand
out the link local address is the only
one where the IID is provided by the
gateway but beyond that the mobile can
use whatever the lower / 64 it can use
great leg pain 6 thank you you're
fortunate enough to have young you came
all the way from Slovenia this time yes
yeah all right well thank you hello I'm
yawn source from Slovenia I'm good jet
lag so sorry if I if I miss something
okay I come from go six dot si that's an
Institute for ipv6 in Slovenia and
initiative and let's see if this is
working I wrote this on mac and i have
bad experience with pcs ok this is the
agenda few words about what we are doing
there it's about awareness and putting
people together and i will present what
we did we were like a catalyst 24 hour
to mobile operators in slovenia to
deploy v6 and i will show you how we did
it and i will at the end try to do a
demo off from this phone i think this
phone is becoming the most famous phone
on this
inference lately so let's see Robert and
the gang from from ripe labs did the
ripeness measurement or they they they
said that Slovenia is most ipv6 prepared
country in Europe you can see it there
that's chimney that's Slovenia and we
also have the most traffic on the
physics in you in Europe so I've been
asked to explain on the right meeting in
Prague how we are doing that so we found
that the go 6 Institute I like an ipv6
initiative in Slovenia where two million
people we are small nation we literally
know each other so we are not-for-profit
organization and we have strategic
partnership with armies and Allah TFA
ordinance is our academic research
Network and LT FA is a laboratory for
telecommunications on our faculty of
electro technics and the open platform
we based on membership we have all major
ISPs mobile operators content providers
and integrators and everybody else
aboard and we are financially supported
by our members they pay annual fee and
so we can do our job the glowsticks is
steered by expert counsel which is
formed from representative of the
government's talkin post regulator from
academic research network faculty
industry and me as a chair so we as an
expert counsel we sit down we talk to
each other we settled out things and
when we go up apart government does
their part of the work regulator does
their part of the word
and so things get done ipv6 is being
deployed so our activities have our
physics working group we organize cyber
v6 summits Martin was keynoting one of
them jail AV and that was a brilliant
job thanks Martin yet this slice up from
from right meeting so third third was
it's already over so what else we do we
do six deploy workshops I don't know if
you know c6 deployed its ye you stuff
for for for doing the presentations and
courses all over Europe we are hosting
the 6th apply lab we also involved in AP
a plus P draft be trendy and friends we
are formed at the go six Academy and we
are testing lots of stuff we would also
like to have Erickson's not six for
implementation to test and see what's
working or not not working so what
what's what's our goal what's our
mission when we make people talk to each
other about the six this is the main
stuff people need to talk to each other
basically we need to aggregate knowledge
and make it available between the
members of those six platform and this
is the most important one we connect
government regulator IC and Industry
between each each other we make them
talk to each other we make competitive
competitors talk to each other about v6
and this is the main driver for
deployment there so he became a holistic
pivot points in Slovenia and apparently
it works so from this point on I'm a
proxy presenter I run the go 6 Institute
and we made
these guys deploy physics on these
mobile networks together so at the end
you will have the addresses for more
specific questions if I can't answer
them all then you can mail them to to to
that stuff so this is to Shinobu network
this is a very small mobile provider in
slovenia they even have they even don't
have the the coverage in all slovenia so
but they did they deployed v6 and these
are pictures of the phone where I just
went to to to to the ripe net page and
you see that it's coming from from the
ipv6 address and i tried the the imap
log in and send some emails from from
that phone and you see that this thing
is actually working this is the network
this is there ipv6 pool and basically
it's it's like most of the pictures you
saw this day um there is a trick I don't
know if if Nokia fixed that but they are
we they have the redirection hack
because currently in nokia sgsn or ggsn
they can't have dual stack APN so they
redirect the traffic to two different ap
ends so yes it's X thanks David I knew I
will hear this
so these are versions of the software
used you can just download my
presentation later and and and copy it
we are here we are already using not
just for testing we don't know currently
the list of applications that that are
broken with it not but ericsson device
with spoken said they said that we will
update the list between each other so i
think this is going to work so this is
the other one this is mo betta they have
different stuff going on but still it's
working and mobital have the coverage in
all slovenia so if you go out to the
woods or run on the on on the walk and
you go out of touch mobile coverage you
connect to roaming in roaming mode to
mobital but v6 is still working so we
have national ipv6 roaming totally
working this is their network they gave
me the the picture that is pretty
complicated and small to read but this
is what i got from them each terminal
gets like / 64 at that time these are
pictures from beginning of this year so
it's mainly for months ago so some
things might be fixed in between but
there was some problems with with DNS
and there was limited terminal support
nokia e + n serious okay mobile windows
mobile no support data cards natively no
support versions used this is ericsson
stuff sgsn and ggsn and mpls cisco
version 12 to
so this is what we've been doing in
Slovenia ah what is still missing
there's no white support in mobile
terminals currently this content based
charging I know that David will will
stand up and say it's fixed is it ok so
there is still no content-based charging
and there is limited or no support for
dual stack in terminals in this yes but
I will show this to you later so yeah ah
it can be seen there so the questions
regarding the go six Institute's I'm
here questions regarding ipv6 in touch
mobile you have the address here and
mobitel there anything else it's me and
now I will try to show you something
what can I do with my phone here from
the states don't type this address in
yet because you will kill my
presentation so I will not be able to
reach it from from this one so this is
nokia n900 with a power colonel from my
email garage and I I thank team of
savolainen from nokia for for helping me
with this we did this together and also
guys from push mobile and this is this
is not a normal phone this is a
Scandinavian from so there are
procedures to be followed
let's let me see so I tried it several
times and apparently the DNS here in
Google is not always returning the the
same just a second yeah let me try so as
you can see here who will hold the phone
come on Eric here is a apache server
running on this phone and this is the
tail minus f of the lord is it okay so
what what we have been doing here is
this laptop is connected to the local
wireless with v6 and this phone is
connected with to PDP context / AT&amp;amp;T
network I don't know why but it's AT&amp;amp;T
and connected to APN in Slovenia so here
are Slovenian ipv6 addresses and this is
the this is the apache server responding
with the script saying GPRS 0g Paris one
which IP addresses are currently going
on you see that wireless interface is
down and we can even do the trace route
from this device from that phone to this
device and these packets are flowing
through slovenia currently see
that is a trace route from from that
phone to the machine here so um oh yeah
yeah it's a border control so um what
we're trying to do here is we are we can
serve the content from the phone and
when I was building this setup for this
demo I had no idea what will come out
and now I see that if i flash the the if
I take the picture with this phone why
should I upload it to the Facebook or
summer where I don't have the control
over the content you can come to my
phone and see it and I have the control
over my content see and it was very very
bizarre when we were doing this setup
when I went with this phone in my pocket
to watch a football game my older son is
is playing football and I was up there
somewhere in middle of nowhere and Teemu
savolainen from finland was was hacking
this to the scripts over ssh on this
phone that was in my pocket that's quite
bizarre stuff yeah so I think this is it
listen news from Europe thank you thank
you
excellent we actually need to yeah we
need to make a coffee break but hey one
so the you had the Slovenian IP
addresses on your handset my guess is
that AT&amp;amp;T doesn't have a roaming
agreement right so it's just well too
bad agreed to a lot of the good thing
about Frederick has a lot of pictures of
himself on the internet around the world
doing international roaming of ipv6 and
I guess he's he's not getting charged
for that because the semantics of the CD
ours for the roaming aren't supported so
that I I no no no so this is the dirty
little secret but at the same time we
have to recognize that there there are
people that are doing ipv6 roaming which
is number one thing we need to realize
number think number two thing we need to
realize is that hey it works and nobody
had to do anything but number three is
that there actually have to be follow-up
to you know eventually and I don't know
who's going to instigate it but they'll
have to be follow-up so that there's
actually charging in it I hope the
follow-up isn't that the people who when
I hate will probably follow it hmm the
people who want to get paid will
probably follow up I TJ how it works oh
now now now the half of this room will
ask me to bring them a sim from Slovenia
know it okay thanks anyone else oh ok
thank you in testing thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
