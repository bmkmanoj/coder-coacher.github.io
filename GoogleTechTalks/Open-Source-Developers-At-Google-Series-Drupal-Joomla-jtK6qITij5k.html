are pleased to have with us this evening
three students from the google Summer of
Code program all of whom I know and
think you're absolutely fabulous miss
Angela Byron with the Drupal project she
was a Summer of Code student in 2005 and
went on to be the program administrator
for Drupal in 2006 and here we have
laurens van der wit and hanas papenburg
both joomla Summer of Code students for
2006 so I'm gonna let these guys get to
telling you all about what their
respective projects do a little bit
about the student perspective on the
program and then after that we have beer
and Dutch candy it's awesome okay
welcome everybody we are going to start
with presentation about content
management systems in general and then
about joomla and drupal in in the
specific area and later on we are going
to talk about our Summer of Code
projects and your first slide
so for us joomla guys lawrence yeah I'm
start with you I'll arsenal boots I'm
from Belgium and I've been terrific
student this is well Hannah's papenburg
and he's also a storm of grad students
and well since I think december this
year we have been invited in the
development working group of joomla
who's well actually doing the current
development of the upcoming release
cycles of jummah so yeah okay so i'm a
student applied computer science in love
and in Belgium I've been in open source
since 2004 i started with memo which was
actually the previous tumor but because
of some problems we two three
tuna I'm graduating in software
engineering so basically just a big
bunch of programming and software
software development and web
applications and well my main goal in
juma 105 is implementing web services
and well extending the power of of tuna
in a horizontal way so that
implementation with our systems is quite
easy and convenient
yeah i'm studying IT engineering and
physics in moon sets in western Germany
and I've been in open source since 2002
and not was memo or Joomla but with PHP
bullet board and I joined the ranks of
general users in 2005 and yeah I'm my
project was a user and access management
joomla is a bit restricted in that area
and when i when i joined joomla that was
my first concern so i started working on
that and cut to the project in the end
okay so what the agenda is for this part
of the talk is a first we're going to
talk a little bit generally what content
management systems are then we'll dig
into what joomla is a project in know
how where it stands and that sort of
thing we'll also get these guys to talk
about their Summer of Code projects that
they did and then at some point I will
be jumping in to talk to you about
Drupal which is another content
management system so just so you can
have a broader picture so okay so okay
so when we talk about this is chapter
one good one joomla is uh what's called
a content management system what that
generally refers to it can refer to a
lot of different things which is why
it's such a kind of a weighted word but
in general what it's about is making
your content all in a centrally managed
place so forums polls you know articles
all that kind of stuff in one spot where
you can administrate it centrally and
it's all dynamically generated as
opposed to back in the old days where
you had to make a bunch of little static
HTML files and if you wanted to update
the header to look different you had to
go into 15 different files and change it
it tries to eliminate a lot of that so
you can focus on what your site does
well which is
generating content rather than the
backend that makes everything work they
also generally very modular so you can
extend them to do event calendars and
knee commerce and all that kind of stuff
all from the same basic framework yeah
as well as templating you can will just
basically switch a template and like two
minutes to generate the complete
different look and feel of your website
in a very well easy and convenient way
so it's also a friend were quite big
purpose of conformational systems
okay so joomla I don't know if he goes
if you guys know member member c and s
well yeah memo actually was a
complimentary system which was released
by a commercial company so they put it
on the open source market with a GPL
license and because well last year we
had some troubles with the company so we
basically from from from embo to
Juna and well the complete core team
left juma and moved left left member
sorry and move to Joomla so basically
it's the same project with the same
thing but well just weren't a different
map a different name so joomla extent
the power of tuna in a horizontal way I
think that's a quite important sentence
that that described that describes
joomla joomla is all about extending
extending its platform and implementing
as many technologies as possible in a
very convenient way so what does this
mean it means like implementing
interface suspicious such as web
services web dev very easily so that the
communication with other systems is very
easy that's not only for the for the
horizontal extension of joomla but as
well for the actual content it has to be
very very easy and very convenient
basically that's what what i doona is
all about is well it's already
simplicity so that's very important in
tumor
think first then react it's quite
difficult to get things organized in in
in a large open source projects such as
Juna therefore it's very important to
really start discussing and starts
communicating with with all the members
in in all development work and in all
the working groups and really discuss
the the items we want to implement from
from various perspectives such as
developments such as accessibility
documentation and so on so it's not
about just I have an idea and I want to
implement it now you have to really
discuss it and start communicating with
all the working groups there is there
are quite some challenges in in the
joomla open source project first of all
all the different members the core
members and the D&amp;amp;D work group members
they're all over the place in the world
so for instance when you want well when
you have a developer who is living in
America here in San Francisco and a
developer that's living in Europe well
basically the guys in Europe go asleep
when the guys in San Francisco wake up
so it's quite a challenge to get
everything organized to work in
effective and well Purdue civ way so
that's well quite a challenge and we've
got we've got a forum and we've got
mailing lists and we use IRC channels to
chat and it's yeah it's it's pretty
standard but it's it's just a matter of
good communication yeah if you have good
communication things well things will
work out on well you can work in an
effective and productive way that so
and well another challenge I'm a very
nice thing actually is that your get a
chance with people you've never seen in
joomla it's not well it's not a change
when you're working with people that
you've never seen for like one or two
years I mean it is the first time that I
see Louis Landry's the lead developer
it's the first time I met here in San
Francisco so it's really nice about this
project you work with these guys for
like a year you start developing you
really get to get to know them on
internet on skype on on IRC but well
once you just meet them it's very nice
and well just see the person in real
life that's also a challenge but it's
also a very nice thing of open source
projects a mighty thin so
to create an open source CMS in an
accessible way accessibility is life
these days if you if you have like CMS
that's very very powerful but that's
just not accessible users want to use it
because the main purpose of the cns of a
content management system is too well
just simplify the way of organizing data
and if the system where you well which
is basically fact around the data isn't
accessible the main purpose of CMS
systems it's just it's just gone so it's
very excessive it's very important to
create an accessible way of providing
the manner of well just a manual they
give it chance to the users to to start
integrating the data to start organizing
the data an advantage of joomla is the
easy interaction with with third-party
systems and components the joomla CMS is
is built on a framework that allows you
to enter it very very easy at
third-party components for instance
there's a large firm it's called as an F
it's just a third party form you can
perfect integrated in June because of
its API so that's a quite take advantage
of the of the general API and well last
thing is that well since the 125 release
cycle joomla has been completely
rewritten and there has been a PHP
framework developed such as these and
PHP frameworks and actually Yuma is
built on top of this framework so for
instance when you take a look at joomla
and you think like okay joomla is nice
but it's way too big for me you can
still use the application frame of the
PHP application framework to just
develop your own your own application
without using joomla directly so
basically juna is just an application on
top of the on top of the frameworks so
that's quite important to know
okay about the the summer of code so
Hannah's on I have been a student and
the summer of codes in 2006 and well it
was fun I mean you you write the
proposal you get accepted and you just
start communicating you start working
with all those current members and it's
really fun you get chances to really do
well to start working together with
others core members who get full support
from the core team you get appreciation
from the from the community it's a very
very fun a thing which was quite unique
in my case is that I had a life mentor
most of the googles of the Summerfield
students had a mentor which they had to
meet over over the internet so they had
to make an appointment apartment and
then starts communicating over RC /
skype / what doesn't matter the
advantage of a live mentor is that you
just go see em you're sitting in front
of the computer and you start discussing
problems and I think that's a very
effective way of problem solving in the
summer of codes if you have a problem
you just look together to the problem
and you solve it and that's a very big
advantage i think if i adn't a life
mentor the deliverance of my project
with have well twice a small likely so
it's a really big advantage sorry don't
upon another word founders of the of the
google summer of code is that you
actually learn something when you go to
college for or university most of the
time you just get an introduction on
various subjects of well object-oriented
design and when it gets interesting they
have to switch subjects because if not
they're gonna run out of time when you
are doing the summer of code you're
really making
a piece of software that will be used in
a real-life environment you really have
to make sure that it's accessible that's
well the that it's bug-free that it
doesn't crash when you click on the
submit button and so on and that's a
complete different experience than just
making some exercises at college or at a
university so actually the motivation is
also completely different when you when
you create a project in the summer of
code environment you just create your
project and you know that it's actually
practical it will be used in the context
of the of the skin in the context of the
product which is joomla in our case so
the motivation and the perspective is
completely different than going to
college and making or exercises because
you know okay so I make those exercises
but well I'll be probably forgotten them
in three or four days so that's a
completely different parts of the of the
feeling you get with with the summer of
code and with well actually just to take
part in a open source in the open source
project um it's also good practice for
general team play and I mean when do you
learn in school or university to really
start a project from beginning like
planning what do the guys want out there
and what can I achieve in all this all
the time I have and what are the
features of my code and some of code
really provided this area where you can
gain experience and yeah basically
you're just on your own when you make
some exercises at school there's still a
lecturer who well might help you if you
have some problems and there is like a
red line in in all those exercises when
you do a summer of code project it's
well ok make this piece of software good
luck with it so it's it's completely
different and well it's nice
okay maybe and watch it
I guess I'll do my spiel yeah
good
okay hi I'm Angela Byron from the Drupal
project and today is December 24 anyway
so Who am I imma as I just said Angie
byron I was a summer code student in
2005 for the Drupal project and then in
2006 I got bumped to being a mentor /
project administrator for Drupal so it
was kind of a long way to go in a year
when I had first started with Drupal I
had never actually played with Drupal
and touched it I had heard about it
because of the spread Firefox project
was running that as its back end and I
was like oh that sounds cool and then I
just kind of went on so when I was
looking for an out organization to apply
to that one grabbed me again because I'm
very interested in activism and things
like that so from there I've gone to on
to be a mentor I'm currently employed in
a Drupal consulting firm called lullaby
and they do websites for sony and mtv
and people like that that use drupal as
a back-end it's great because we get to
funnel all these corporations money into
making the platform better so you know
hey they need a module that does X great
so we'll throw that in CVS and get the
community so they can use it to and it's
a really neutrally beneficial thing so
see I started tech I started hacking
Drupal and doing open-source development
both because of summer of code now get
into more of my experiences with summer
coat a little bit later but that's
basically an introduction who i am i'm
from montreal so not that far away for
that whoo canada so what is Drupal
drupal's two things it's a content
management system so for regular users
it's a way for them to go into their
website and write an article or blog
entry or something like that and that
kind of stuff it's also a content
management framework so it's for
developers who want to they want to use
all the base features that Drupal gives
them like user management and
you know access roles and things like
that and they don't need to worry about
that they just build their technology on
top of it so Drupal is running things
like news publishing systems or like a
track or you know like some kind of
project management replacement there's
it can be used in a lot of different
ways just like the joomla guys were
talking about how they built in a PHP
framework that you can use so we're kind
of the same thing our focus is mainly on
architecture so everything has an API we
have a form API we have users can be
manipulated we have basically anything
that's a thing in Drupal has some sort
of API to tie into it we also focus on
sort of bigger picture things like for
example Drupal supports multi site
hosting which you can use to deploy
Drupal to create a bunch of little sub
sites a lot of bigger companies like
that because they inherit all these tiny
little websites that are everything from
a static HTML webpage to you know a big
community site with forums and
everything and they can bring them all
under one centrally managed umbrella so
they like that a lot there's also a big
focus on extensibility we have what's
called a hook system so at any point
during the page lifecycle there's maybe
13 or 14 different places for you to cut
in with your own module and say yeah
instead of doing that do this instead so
it's kind of well written that way it
also has a flexible theme system just
just like we're talking about lawrence
was talking about it allows you to make
Drupal look like anything as opposed to
just a little three blocks sidebar thing
that it comes with out of the box it has
a small focused corso core is duma earth
I'm sorry Drupal out of the box is very
small and does basically only a few
things provide sort of library tools
that everybody else can use and then you
have hundreds of add-on modules that you
can stick in there instead
for doing extra stuff so here are some
of the people using Drupal you might
recognize a few names either Colonel
traps one spread Firefox of course iBM
has just written a whole series of
articles on why they chose Drupal and
they've got all kinds of cool articles
about that sort of thing these are a
list of Drupal's 2006 our code projects
we're kind of half and half as to how
many of those have kept on as projects
and how many of them haven't but a lot
of those people have stayed on in the
community to help with Corps hacking and
stuff like that which is to me the most
important thing because those people
become integrating the project and sort
of help out for life and then this is
about my SOC experience so I was just
graduating from Community College in
2005 and I basically had no confidence
in myself and I was like oh wow that
open sourcing sure looks really cool but
I would never be good enough to do that
you know and sort of thought that was
the way it was gonna go and I was just
gonna get a job doing you know
accounting packages and dot net or
something so and like one of my
instructors told me about this program
so I was like okay well they're
expecting people to be students so
probably not like really wizkid people
so I was like all right let me try so I
basically lower the barrier entry so I
didn't have to be as good as all these
people ahead up on pedestals and so I
applied and I got accepted which I was
like what yes so ended up spending my
entire summer working on Drupal and that
was a big challenge for a couple of
reasons one was that I had never as I
said it never actually worked with
Drupal before but another reason is that
in school they don't really prepare you
for working with other people's code
that's like cheating you know you're
supposed to just kind of coat everything
from scratch and then you know so I was
really good at that stuff but when it
came to getting into another project me
like whoa what were they thinking when
they wrote this it was a little bit
tricky to figure that out and then stuff
like version control systems we hadn't
been exposed to stuff like working
around different time zones and stuff we
hadn't been exposed to so here's a
really it was an awesome learning
Arians and I got all kinds of things out
of that so now I went from zero newbie
person to now i'm on the documentation
team I'm on the security team i'm doing
Corps hacking i'm working with the
drupal association which is an upcoming
thing that we're using to centrally
manage some of the fundraising and
things like that so yeah and i get to do
this full time now and get paid by
corporations to kind of make duple
better so it's basically everything I
ever wanted and thanks guys
okay so chapter two my google of google
Summer of Code projects well a film as
you might have seen the previous session
given by and by Lewis and we'll go the
Java xml-rpc application what's called G
explore but since there was some
confusion about the name of another
component that's joomla explorer we had
to change it do assignment but it
doesn't are so basically excitement is a
desktop application that allows you to
administer the content of a to my
website so what this means is that you
just have an application you double
click on it and you get a nice graphical
user interface a very native graphical
user interface that allows you to
administer every single content item of
a website it is built in a model modular
way which means that you can build
extensions for it in Joomla you have yo
we are also the ability to write
extensions so for instance you have tuna
and you write an extension for a a
weblog for a program and so on actually
siteman has those same abilities when
you write an extension in June you can
write the well the actually same
extension in incitement that allows you
to just administer that data of the
tumor extension from a desk open
environment and well the communication
is over xmlrpc so it's basically all
about web services it is cross platform
which means that you can run it on any
platform you want such as neck windows
linux solaris and one basically every
single platform you can imagine it is no
best games which means that well every
every item every content item a weapon
link an article will be treated as a
note and you're gonna add some
characteristics do that noise one of the
problems we we have in tuna and which is
actually a little gift week as for memo
is that we can only create like like
three levels in in
in the indie content not a Taunton
component so for instance you have a
section you have a category and you have
an article that's it you cannot make
more levels in the in this date
estructura so in incitement I developed
a data structure with which basically
allows you to nest as many items as you
want an MBS is also planned for joomla
to toto and the advantage is that you
can just take the NBS from juma and dump
it right into sight when so you don't
have to go for it all the all the actual
items when to not do and now it's and so
on you just take the structure and you
dump it into into joomla it will be a
quite well quite huge boost of
performance yeah it's of course open
source software it's really strong with
the common public license and it uses
web services so basically when you start
up sighs man it starts gathering the
data format human our websites using web
services so it's make a connection to it
makes a connection to the server and
over XML all the data is gathered from
all different in June our websites
websites a few well decides to use that
I'll give a demo think that will be a
bit cleaner than
so actually the nice thing of of Google
is that they also well about the Google
Docs which is widely is that they also
implement a xml RPC interface which
allows you to basically push content to
every CMS that has the same interface
implemented so for instance a new
document so I love to program for
Microsoft so when you publish this you
have like publish to the internet which
basically just generates a link but you
can also public it to publish it to your
blog basically this right this google
docs program has implement has
implemented the deep blogger api and a
blogger api is just a uniform set of
functions which any well CMS system or
blog application can implement so with
that if you have a blog application you
can connect to any application that has
the same blogger interface implemented
so just have to check my blocks my
settings yeah although so it's my own
server it's basically just the the URL
slash joomla / xmlrpc which is the
location of the xml RPC server so just
contestants
ok
so if i push okay and post it well
actually i'm just going to refresh this
one
okay so these are just the articles on
on the Joomla website so when you push
this to to a drama website okay the the
article basically just gets posted from
the from the google doc server to my
local drama installation at least it
should so
yeah it should okay hear this so using
web services using xml RPC this document
has been published do it to a joomla
website which is a complete different
location so but well there is something
wrong with the sentence so if i open my
source code project and i just select
the indeed location as a server it
starts loading the data from from that
website using xml RPC so basically all
the data text into a xml and velocity
gets get sent over over HTTP and on the
client which is this one here on website
and well he puts it in a data structure
in order to do manipulate it so when I
go to the news and well let's just
change this one google
open-source officer and just save it
it should be modified
okay so I go so basically that's that's
the thing of sidemen you you edit your
website from a desktop environment the
the advantage of of this application
when you compare it to a blogger
interface is that it's much more
extensible extensive than 10 bloggers
you can change the authority as you
create or the access level the
publishing data stop publishing things
and so on and basically this this user
interface is a is a copy of the backend
of joomla so it's very very common for
you my users also a nice thing of this
application of well basically of a
desktop application is that you can very
easy easily implement offline editing so
for instance for for for web design
offices who who are well or quite often
and playing their representatives or
like countries where the entrance is
very expensive they just create their
website and well once all the guns in
this prepared they just click on
synchronize and other data get pushed on
the only joomla website so that's quite
a big advantage off of this application
and auto advantages that when you are
editing your website and you have like a
very slow internet connection you just
start editing click on save and select
the next article click on save again and
it's it's possible that the process of
saving the first item is still is still
well it's still ex is still executing
basically all the LD queries are put on
a stack and they're executed well sing
synchronously so you don't have to wait
until the process is finished when you
have a web application you have to wait
until the process has finished and well
after is finished you can start editing
the the next content item or article so
that's also a quite big advantage of a
desktop application is saying for image
management for instance when you have
internal animation
and you want to insert an image you
first have to upload it but it's quite
hard to implement cropping and well just
optimizing of the image when you have a
desktop application you can create like
a small game for photoshop or something
you implement cropping locally on your
machine you can use all the resources of
your desk of application and once the
the image is manipulated well this book
when it's corrupt when it's optimized
you upload it over ftp which is also
implemented in joomla and you would just
insert it so it is much more effective
too well to use a desktop application
with a CMS because of the well you can
just basically use the power of a desk
publication which is not the case
whether with a web application and also
another thing which I forgot to show
that I'm not show this year
you can do gmail authentication so
@ gmail.com
so what it does is make a connection to
gmail server and he is going to check
the user credentials so if he sees that
okay we have this year's when a data in
our database with this passwords if
that's okay give a give it or something
so that's also implemented in June and
can be quite right you well in in the
same in the same manner of same methods
used in incitement so you can use all
the functionality of tuna incitement
just by using xml RPC the last thing is
that well like i said everything is
modular everything is a plugin so for
instance when you take a look we have
like like web links which is a plug-in
to manage web links with content which
is the currently active active plugin
you see you have a user interface plug
in which is basically the general
roughly out of a of this application for
instance when you have the tree on the
right side of the screen you just create
another plug-in and you activate it and
everything will still work and the last
weekend is the xml RPC you can also
change that for instance when you want
to have communication or for soap or
over web dev you just create another
plug-in and the plugins such as web
links and content will still work so
ok so that's about my summer for
projects
okay now about my some of code project
it's a bit more theoretical than the
sideman project because yeah it was a
research project for joomla 2.0 and to
start with the current joomla
authorization system is a bit restricted
we have seven user groups these seven
groups yeah they all inherit their
rights from the lower groups and they
are fixed you can't add another group
you can't move the groups in the trees
and yeah we have also three different
ways of checking of users allowed to
access certain object and there is no
way to restrict two different groups to
different contents so I can't say this
group is allowed to view this category
of articles and this group is only
allowed to view the other group of
articles and yet my project was about
researching in that area how to
implement it in joomla to point in a way
that these rights can be set more
granular yeah the goats for my Summer of
Code projects were to implement the
function of infinite groups in
completely random structures and to make
the access rights each group has totally
adjustable
and actually up till now you can't
really say okay this user this group has
write access to the content and this one
also is able to delete it and that it
doesn't have this Exodus rights on
another content object so there the
content should be much more integrated
into this yeah and one of the main ideas
was to make this system exchangeable so
in in the real implementation I used PHP
GA CL which is a free library and but
you could also write an adapter and use
ldap or mysql authorization and all that
stuff whatever way you like it yeah the
achievements I said I don't have a
really fancy application like Lawrence
hairs but because mine my stuff is more
inside of joomla and it's the
achievements were a class structure for
joomla to point where we can implement
all this a manager to add and delete
these groups rearrange them and at users
to them and yeah the function headers
for all the different for the API I
created and yes you
yeah basically what did I miss ya think
you want to take over here well yeah
that's basically a a last coat which I
find really interesting as we are moving
to a world in which the in the 21st
century the most important activities
that were this Akira not in factories
and not by any individual initiative but
in communities how together by software
and I think that's what open source
software is all about it's about the
communities which work together on a
great application and yeah I just want
to end with it so thanks
here we have for the drupal go again
yeah I figured I'd let them kind of do
their thing you know like but yeah so
does anybody have questions on any of
this
for you guys so what with your initial
expectation we went in to supper code
well that's it actually we didn't know
what to expect of the summer of cards it
was like okay so we get paid by Google
to to work in open source software it
will be fun so yeah basically it was
getting a chance of working with the
wittig our team of a of a open source
project and it was really hard to expect
what actually would be done so for me as
I said before I've joined the joomla
team or the joomla project in 2005 and
started working with it and in March
about much I was I thought it would be
nice to implement this ACL management
and this summer of code gave me a real
reason to to start with this and it was
a way to contact the guys from the team
and it was also a first step just to get
a chance to get integrated in the actual
projects itself because of the summer of
code because the invitation to join the
development working group and I think
without disarm of codes this we don't
have an impossible so that's also a very
nice thing about this remark code yeah
it allows project projects like drupal
joomla and to the interview there yeah
then you people yeah and and you can see
okay they are capable of doing stuff
they are intelligent and they yeah it's
it's neat because you know so many
people come into this and they like they
don't know what suspect even if you've
been working with the project for a long
time you might not know what to expect
because it forces you to kind of go
through it with different eyes you know
what I mean because you're you're being
you get to work with all these really
cool people who are totally integrated
in the project that you normally would
just know kind
the mailing lists or stuff like that so
it gives you some one-on-one time with
those it gives you a chance to really
get integrated with the not only your
own community but just open source
development you know in general and
things like that so do you think you
would have worked with the source
wasn't for summer coat yeah absolutely
yes I would have tried I don't know I
don't know I don't think I wouldn't have
the confidence to try because I have a
very low self-esteem but it's a little
bit better now so so thank you again
what's that it's a lot better yes it's
true what you can't see my hands doing
nice Ryu so what was your expectation
you're into it
2005
be sure to cover some of that review
said yours very surprised that were
accepted and
so then so what were the next steps have
happened after this you got accepted we
started working on Drupal to represent I
worked on a module to extend Drupal but
yea jus workin on Drupal was part of it
um in the next steps then we're kind of
figuring out communications and stuff
with my mentor he was in Germany and I
was in Canada so that there was a time
difference there and also we drupal has
a to IRC channels and one is called
pound rupal which is our development
channel and the other ones pound drupal
support for support questions and I made
the very big cultural snafu of asking a
support question in the wrong Channel
and got flamed that I was like oh so it
was part of it was learning like the
cultural boundaries and things like that
and and also just kind of meeting all
the new people and it was really a neat
experience because and I still do have
these guys up on pedestals because I
know they're really brilliant but it was
neat because I got to see that hey
they're really smart people ask
questions to you know and it's not there
there wasn't this huge imbalance like I
figured that there would be you kind of
get that from looking on the outside in
you you think all these people are gods
they look at they've done this awesome
open source project thing and I'm just a
weed you know and you get to kind of
experience working with them you know
face-to-face over the internet and it's
just it's just neat like you you're out
the first time I was able to answer one
of the core hackers questions I was like
oh cool you know and i found my very
first bug ya know is this it was neat
and it really it helped me kind of get
down to earth and like realize that hey
we're all just people that care about
this project and want to see it go come
to life so I don't know were you guys
that kind of the same thing that I found
yeah yeah when in the last weeks i was
asked weapon by my dad a few times why I
did open source because to him hey it
doesn't pay and it's a big waste of time
and all and I said
let's wait it'sit's experience and later
when i'm applying for a job here I've
been developer joomla and all said yeah
okay okay and now I've been invited to
the joomla day in Germany to the joomla
day in the Netherlands and now to san
francisco and i doubt that i would have
gone to San Francisco this year without
being invited by google thank you very
much and so everyone who says open
source doesn't pay i'm currently on
holiday here in san francisco would be
even more well yeah there you go it does
pay but you just have to work some
patients so it's that's a nice thing
about open source then it's not even all
just about the green either it's it pays
an experience it blows and learning to
work with other people like just what
you were saying earlier how like you
didn't get a lot of teamwork and
university right yeah so never what were
your impressions of quality
and what I'm sorry follow the code of
your own car came in Hey look who I've
got an object I mean compared to like
when you can see as a student were you
impressed that the code was high quality
precedent over what are you depressed
pretty bad quality how do you deal with
a page in in joomla one point the code
is ok ok but in joomla 1.5 is really
great and at the beginning when I
started coding for summer of code it was
yeah my mentor wasn't really okay with
it and he really beat it into me so at
the end I think I learned a lot about
code quality and the result was really
good i think it's it's it's a joomla
standard in the Senate is really high
that's also a nice thing about open
source it doesn't matter who you are
when when you get in get in the project
is well you really have to go and based
on that go to get a reputation and
that's not in light like closed closed
code environments so I think well that's
a really nice thing of open source if
you write very nice coat on and good
coat you just get some appreciation and
you well you get the reputation you well
yeah just get a reputation from from the
quality of your coat so yeah so it's
good incentive for people to write easy
to read and you know efficient code and
things like that I was pleasantly
surprised with my project because they
enforced stuff like you have to phpdoc
all that just the same as javadoc
basically but document all the functions
and their arguments and things and it
was well commented there was a lot of
documentation others happy about that
cuz i would have been you know otherwise
but but then i've seen other projects
that are like
18 lines of regex and not a comment in
sight and it's a little bit you know so
it varies I think dramatically between
projects but so are you guys looking
forward to being entered a seven or if
you have a project 10 episode Emma Tori
yeah yeah because it's such a nice
experience just being part of this on
ref codes well I'm absolutely looking
forward to to mentoring and I've
students this isn't really sort of code
related but why do you think there are
so many CMS's up there I think because
everybody again everybody has their own
idea of what a content management system
should do yeah you know Jim was a lot
better looking than gerbil out of the
box I was amazed he was showing me the
administrative interface and I was like
oh there's like pictures and stuff it's
like cool where we were more focused on
like from out of the box we have this
really basically there's we were talking
about this to joomla zhou community is
made up of a lot more percentage-wise of
users then drupal's is drupal's is
mostly developers so you tend to get
these you eyes that are sort of passable
but the functionality of the hood is
really great and flexible and extendable
and stuff like that where joomla is
really focused on making the polish look
sharp and they've done a great job
making that look it's awesome and now
they're kind of going hey we need some
of that flexibility in there too so now
when you in Drupal herbs or in June 11.5
it sounds like you're really heading in
that direction so well and actually when
you have open source CMS they all have
the same title but in fact are
completely different for exact products
Drupal is a complete different products
than joomla actually you you can't
compare those those two products so yeah
well at their core they both manage
content do it in completely commenters
are very wise why
right so it's very difficult to compare
those two same with WordPress or we type
between there are just some different
products better that have their
advantages and disadvantages so you just
have to make a decision upon those well
criteria so plus it's fun to write a
content management system you know so
other things that Google never knew it
is dealing with a lot of unstructured a
content management system by definition
it's pretty structure you have like you
were explaining you have different
categories and sections are
whether your respective projects doing
to deal with mr. data from large sons
Drupal has a feature in it called
taxonomy there's a taxonomy module and
with that you can do structured
hierarchies how n length is deep you can
do a flat hierarchy you can you multi
select four categories and things that
you can do tagging so they've really put
a lot of thought around the
categorization and structure of content
every piece of content whether it's a
blog or whether it's a pole or whether
it's a forum post whether it's an album
or whatever comes from a base type which
is called a node so they kind of SAT
back and said okay all these things what
do they have in common they all have a
title they all have like a teaser and
body they all have a create datetime
author let's pull that stuff into this
core thing and then everything else gets
added on externally so at its base thing
everything in Drupal is a node which is
one thing and then other fields or
images or whatever pulled in extra
through the hook system so that's how
Jubal's approach that problem yeah
joomla is has some legacy with this and
the old man boo system isn't that
flexible in that area but we are moving
towards that too so a node based system
and 2.0 will be completely based on this
yeah joomla just has a lot of modules
like drupal and has to cope in that way
with a random content so basically you
just have to put your content into
sections and a section has some
categories and in a category you can
just nests on some articles which are
just like a big wrench off of text so
but like like taking isn't isn't really
really possible with Joomla I think
that's also a bit none of the core
yeah well the thing is possible there
are extensions will do a session yeah
but that's well yeah just a different
approach of joomla versus turtle Walter
opolis in my opinion at least do police
used for a lot of blogging application
community sites and all that stuff while
joomla is used for well very complete
sites where you just manage the contents
and just just leave the content so it's
a bit a different approach than 10 true
does that answer your question cool
more questions come on yeah everybody
does want beer does candy yes where the
groups that you were joining has a sense
of a Google
oh my didn't get that did you in gym la
they did the summer of code in 2005 too
so I don't know what it was at that time
but when i joined it was no problem and
there were no i don't know these these
conspiracy theories are such an joomla
is really open yeah i mean they're
definitely what I saw that on like the
administrator mailing list and stuff
like that but that was just bizarre
everybody that I knew from whatever
project it didn't matter was really just
grateful for the opportunity because
they could see far term like this is
great it's going to help strengthen open
source and if you guys got some
complicity out of it was like good you
know like you should because you're
throwing money yet into this great
ecosystem and stuff so i don't i know
there were people that were looking for
the ultimate agenda and things like that
photos you always have those kind of you
always have those people but i think
they are a few and far between in
general my agenda was really
classmates at me why just had graduated
so I didn't really have any classmates
but but just before I had entered summer
Kota got in a big argument with one of
the guys about he was i was saying i
wanted to program open source and he was
like you'll never get paid doing that ah
you know this kind of stuff and i said
yes i will somehow and then this ended
up happening so i should go find him
again soon with me it was when i when i
first got into open source was ok yeah
open store it's nice but you can get a
living with it and well past week when i
said i got the opportunity to go san
francisco's was like okay so yeah it's
really fun in the end similar with me so
yeah they really and we know okay
Oh
I just wanna join as an
some recur 2005
people's reaction is its first of all
wow you spend your summer doing that how
dumb I did nothing yeah that's that's
the first stage of the reaction and then
the second stage was after I now
intergroup so second stage was after I
got the internship at Google partly
because I already you know the people
from some good then it was I hope yeah
maybe I should have been that team and
aside from that well that's that's the
base reaction people who going go into
software because pays well
none of the other people just find finda
fantastic and most of those who did by
the fantastic went
it's all about getting the passionate
people who like live breathe this stuff
and yeah it does a good job of ferreting
those people out
oh I like every moment I seem speed
before I have to disagree with the
statement there because open source
offers all about individual initiatives
individuals contributing and await their
comfortable
well Evans a very smart man don't mean
under my
my own experience with open source
software and will incorporate but how
many open-source projects survive that
are only depending on one single person
so it's always to the community that
pushes forward and collection of
individuals right yeah yeah but it's not
it's much with the enforcement an
amorphous blob of community pride its
people it's that would deal through the
 question I think it's a Susumu I
would agree with that yeah I think
that's true but I think that it's
important to have that collective bunch
of individuals doing stuff because if
they didn't have that you just go and do
your own individual collective thing
over here they wouldn't have those big
open source projects such as well I'm
sorry people have people doing stuff
that they also
my point exactly
