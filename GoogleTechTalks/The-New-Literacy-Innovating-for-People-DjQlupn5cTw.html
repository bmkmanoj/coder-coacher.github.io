It's a pleasure to be here.
Thank you.
It's truly an honor to speak
with you all today.
I want to talk a little bit
about the &quot;I&quot; word--
innovation.

I feel the way you do.
It's a word that's sort of
misused and egregiously
overused, but don't want to
throw the baby out with the
bath water.
I think it does mean
something.
Or as one of my employees so
fondly put it, we talk all day
about innovation, but it's like
pornography-- you know it
when you see it.

In particular, I want to talk
innovating for people, and I
want to talk about innovation
the way LUMA sees it as really
the emergence of this
next literacy.
And I do mean that quite
pervasively, and in terms of
math or reading and writing as
a sort of human competency.
I'd like to talk a little bit
about that today and some
things that my company's doing
within that space.

We're just a two-year-old
company.
We started up in 2010.
We've been incubating this
idea for about 2008.
We're from Pittsburgh.
And really emerging out of the
need to sort of global
imperative, if you will, for
everybody to level up in
innovation, so I want to talk
about that a little bit today.
And why we exist is there's
seems to be an unmet demand
around getting better at this
thing called innovating.

But I don't want to
start with that.
I want to start with
a story about math.
In 1201, a guy named Leonardo
of Pisa, better known as
Fibonacci, published a book
called &quot;Liber Abaci,&quot; which
means Book of Calculation.
The left-hand side is a picture
of that manuscript, an
image from one of the pages.
And it really changed the
world-- this was in 1202--
because for the first time, it
was the discipline of Arabic
numerals, the Arabic math,
codified in sort of very
simple terms, so people of the
day could apply these new
methods, this new way of adding
and subtracting and
multiplying and dividing
and so forth, to
their everyday work.
OK.
And this was huge back then,
because back in the 12th and
13th centuries, the primary way
people calculated or did
math was the Roman numeral
system, Roman math.
And while Roman numerals are
great for counting, adorning
clocks, and naming Super Bowls,
it's a very difficult
way to do simple math even like
addition and subtraction
let alone higher forms of math,
and so this arithmetic,
Arab math, was a much better
way of doing that.
And we have Fibonacci, Leonardo
di Pisa, to sort of
help us do that.
Now, it wasn't until the
Industrial Age and the mass
exodus from field to factory
that math became a pervasive
human literacy.
And the reason is because the
industrialists of the day
needed workers, a workforce,
that was literate or somewhat
competent in math.
They needed people to count, and
tell time, and make simple
calculations in order to run and
work in their factories,
and so the industrialists
and leaders of the
day followed suit.
They created an educational
institution that honored math.
And I think it was 1825 that Sir
William Curtis coined the
term &quot;the three R's,&quot; reading,
writing, and arithmetic.
That's where that comes from.
And so it became the sort of
fundamental pillars of
education for all the
industrialized nations.
And so it was because, thanks to
Fibonacci and the hundreds
of years of improvement over
top of that sort of Arabic
math, the way of doing math,
that humankind was able to
adapt and rise to
the occasion.
When the Industrial Age
beckoned, we need people
better at math, there was a
ready curriculum for them.
Now I just want to point out
that Fibonacci didn't invent
Arabic math, right.
It's Hindu-Arabic numerals.
But he working back in the day
as a trader with his father in
the Mediterranean region got to
learn this Moorish way of
doing math and understood
to be far
superior than Roman numerals.
What he did, though,
was codify it.
What he did is say, this is a
much better way of calculating
than the way we're currently do
it, and it was because of
him and the abacists of his day
that we have right now--
basically, why we're all
literate in math.
It was a combination of there
being a codified simple way of
doing this is kind of complex
work, and then also the
demands of the time, the
Industrial Age, demanded that
we all or a lot more people
be good at it.

Today, we find that there's
another pervasive mind shift
afoot called innovation, and it
like math, which was once a
peripheral human aptitude--
it's not like innovations
never happened before.
The demands of the time are
causing this to become
something that--

positioning what I think is
the next human literacy.
I do think that there's
certain socio-economic
conditions today that are
causing innovation to become
something that we all need
to be good at or
better at and so forth.
And the fact remain, though,
getting better at it has
become a global imperative.
As these references indicate,
of 12,500 business leaders
interviewed, most of them rank
innovation as the third most
important skill in
the organization.
This is something we've
come to know.
We have a gentleman over
here who teaches
innovation inside of Google.
This is everywhere
in the world.
All the organizations everywhere
trying to level up
with this idea of innovation,
and it's just kind of born out
by these facts.
Forbes says that 81% of Fortune
500 companies, they've
appointed individuals who are
responsible for driving
innovation, chief innovation
officers, VPs, and so forth.
Even in China-- this is not
germane to the West--
China's pouring billions of
dollars into research and
development.
Their current five-year
plan is about--
forget made in China.
It's going to be about
invented in China.
They see that for obvious
economic reasons.
There's probably a lot of
reasons why innovation has
become so important
to the times.
The three that sort of strike
me, and I think you will
agree, as number 1, we have true
global competition, and
because of that, national
competitives
for the first time.
It's not about just
manufacturing in China or
second or third world countries,
but these places
now can manufacture
as well, can offer
prices that are lower.
Companies everywhere,
particularly in the West, have
to do more than just be able
to make stuff and sell it.
They have to bring value, a
new type of value, because
you've got companies everywhere
that can do the
same thing for a heck
of a lot cheaper.
The other reason is mass
infrastructure entropy.
We see this everywhere,
certainly here in the US.
You've got a lot of local
governments that are on the
brinks of bankruptcy, and so
they're challenged with how do
we do more with less.
Our infrastructures like our
roads and our sewage systems
are crumbling, because they
haven't been innovated in the
past 50, 60 years,
and thus decays,
right, good old entropy.
But not just physical
structures, I mean, let's look
about our education system.
Hasn't been innovated upon
in over 100 years.
Why is it broken?
Because it hasn't
been renewed.
Health care is another.
So it's not just physical
infrastructures, but all
infrastructures seem
to be at a point of
decay in our history.
And the third one is just this
idea of hypercomplexity.
We live-- welcome to the
connected age, right.
Not just devices, things to
things, but we're connected
not just digitally but socially
in many ways, and
with that comes a lot of
complexity that we now have to
manage and have to deal with
at the end of the day.
There are other reasons, but I
think these are some of the
main reasons why public,
private, nonprofit
organizations are trying to
become more innovative.
The problems are harder.
Life is not like it was
in the 20th century--
21st century, we have some
different rules of the game.
Let me ask you a question
though.
So it's clear that organizations
are asking
people to step up and
be more innovative.
How many people here think,
like, they're fluent in
innovation, that they're an
expert in innovation?
Raise your hand.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, interesting, right?
I mean, here we are, the world's
demanding that we step
up and be more innovative, but
yet, here I am at Google, and
I get the same answer
everywhere.
And a couple hands go
up here and there.
You've got the experimenters,
the people who think they're
innovative, depending on
how they define it.
But nobody really feels like
this is one of their core
expertise, that they're as good
at innovation as they are
the thing for which
they want to--
and got a degree in for four
years or eight years, or even
math, something they've been
studying from K through 12.
And that's right,
and it shows.
I mean, welcome to the club.
We're all in this together.
Those same stats I showed you
before, in spite of all the
focus and effort, many of
these same organizations
claiming the importance of
innovation and trying to do
something about it also claim
that it's not really
working quite yet.
Of those 12,500 businesses
interviewed that rank
innovation as the third most
necessary skill in the
organization, 50% consider
their organization's
ineffective at doing it.
And that depends on how you're
defining innovation.
84% of those who said they are
a [INAUDIBLE] individual
responsible for driving
innovation, 84% of those say
they have no effective approach
to innovation or
well-defined innovation
strategy.
And in government, some recent
studies have borne out that
much of the billions of dollars
they are pouring into
it is wasted.
Too much is going into the
development, which China is
very good at, and not enough
into the research.
So, we're kind of all
in this together.
And so when the Industrial Age
beckoned, we need math, there
was a curriculum, a well
codified discipline around
math called arithmetic in place
already, so we could
make that transition
as a species.
Today, by all accounts, the
innovation imperative I think
is sort of taken a little
bit by surprise.
The sudden demand for innovation
has I think in many
ways outstripped our
capacity to do it.
I think if we went through the
room and everybody even
defined what innovation is, we
would get very different
definitions of what that is,
let alone a curriculum or a
qualified discipline.
We have different
interpretations of what we
mean by innovation.

And that's where we
sort of come in.
That what we're trying to do at
LUMA is really come to the
table with a discipline that
takes the mystery out of what
this thing called innovation--
how do we, in a sense--
what is the thing that is in
between us in the 20th century
in our ways of doing work and
us in the 21st century?
And so we call it innovating for
people, and it's based on
the discipline of human-centered
design.
And again, that's
why we exist.
My company goes around the
world, and we work with
different organizations teaching
the fundamentals of
what we call human-centered
design, which is basically the
discipline of designing things
in the service of people.
Now let's talk about innovation
just quickly.
I don't want to give a
definition of innovation, or
what it's supposed to
do, and so forth.
We do have a philosophical
perspective on it, and to the
extent, I just want to
share what that is,
because it does support--
it is the sort of philosophical
underpinnings of
why we what we do.
The first point I want to make
simply, and I think as I look
around the room, many people
might agree with this.
There are many types
of innovation.
We look at it quite simply.
I know there's different
models of the types of
innovation, but we look
at it on two axes.
The one is by form, and there
are intangible forms--
things, tools, collateral,
products, software,
environments--
but they're also intangible
forms--
services, processes, business
models can be innovative, a
policy can be innovative, a
type of government can be
innovative.
All have the potential to be
innovatively done so or not as
opposed to this other axis
of the degree of change.
By the way, we simply define
innovation the way they did it
in the 15th century when
they coined the term.
It comes from the Latin meaning
innovare, which means
simply to renew, to
make new again.
Simply as that.
How do we go about the process
of making new again, and why
are we often making
things new again?
We're making it new again
for people, to
improve their lives.
So this little change is that
thing new incrementally so, a
little bit?
Or is that thing a big change?
Is it a radical departure from
what proceeded it typically?
And every now and then if you
go all the way on this line,
we have this thing called
invention, something that's
truly new, but they're pretty
rare these days.
Glue was invented 200,000
years ago,
banking 9,000 years ago.
It's very rare that something's,
I would say,
invented like out
of whole cloth.
Usually things are innovative, a
departure from what preceded
it by some degree of radical
incremental.
And we see some wonderful
examples here, right.
The reason we like to show this
is because when you throw
out the word innovation, a lot
of people on the street kind
of go with, oh, you mean some
kind of radical breakthrough
product, right, like
the iPhone.
They think of a thing, and they
think of something that's
sort of transformed the world.
Well, that's certainly an
innovation, but really our job
is to go in organizations, and
say, hey, your organization is
trying to help you be
more innovative.
First thing you've got to do is
see that this is something
that's for you.
This is something within
your grasp.
I don't care that
you work in HR.
HR policies have the potential
to solve problems in
innovative ways.
I don't care that you
are a lawmaker.
I don't care that you
work in software.
Whatever it is you do, you have
the potential to do that
innovatively so, and it doesn't
always have to be
something that's
a breakthrough.
Why?
Because there are a litany of
wonderful examples in the
world of what I would call more
evolutionary or emergent
innovations that are
quite successful.
Swiffer--
what that meant to P&amp;amp;G
back in the day.
I mean, it's not radical.
It's not that different from the
mop and bucket, but it's a
wonderful design, and to P&amp;amp;G,
it meant a 5% increase on
overall global sales, which
for P&amp;amp;G is enormous.
And for the people that consume
the Swiffer, it really
changed the way fundamentally,
not radically, but in small
ways, the way they clean and do
that particular behavior.
Khan Academy is another one.
I think it's a wonderful
innovation--
radically different from
lecture-based and so forth
where you still have a lecture,
but utilizing the
technology today.
It is doing some wonderful
things.
It's really transforming
education in a wonderful way,
as opposed to things that are
really more breakthrough, or
what Leighton Christian might
say is radical or disruptive.
The Kodak camera when it came
out in 1880 was a huge
departure from what
preceded it.
Well, how do we know this?
Because photography at that
point, you had to go down to
the local photography store on
the corner, get all set up and
gussied up, take a picture,
and then somebody who was
trained in this particular art
had to go in the back room,
use a lot of expensive
chemicals,
and create your picture.
Now it could happen in a box,
so the kids could go out and
take pictures in the backyard
and so forth.
And the result of that, we saw
the decline in that kind of
photo industry.
Kodak had a great 120, almost
130 year run until of course
another digital phenomenon
came and ate away their
business model.
Not just iPod but iTunes was a
very radical business model.
I mean, it disrupted the
whole music industry.
That's why we sort of celebrate
that as a sort of
more radical innovation.
And let's not forget our
own US Constitution,
the design of that.
I mean, think about it.
Why do we know this
is a radical--
back in 1787, our
Constitution--
why was this a radical
departure?
I mean, it was revolutionary.
People died.
It was a model of government
that hadn't been innovated
upon since the Magna
Carter, 1215.
So examples of the different
types of innovation by form
and degree of change.
And it's meant to say,
hey, you know what--
because we teach everywhere.
We're teaching in consumer
product goods companies, we're
teaching in federal governments,
we're teaching in
industrial automation
companies, high tech companies.
We all have a role in this.
You could imagine just all the
many Google offerings and
where they might position
themselves on this landscape
of innovation.
The second point I want to
make quickly is that
innovation begins and
ends with people.
All good stories of innovation
begin with how a group of
people discerned a need from
other people, and exceeded
those desires fundamentally--
all good stories.
And the question is, how
do we get good at that?
I mean, I took the icons now
and replaced them with
pictures of Swiffer, and Khan
Academy, and iTunes, and the
Constitution, and this wonderful
ad from the 1880s,
or turn of the century, called
Let the Children Kodak of kids
just using the simple box.
I mean, what's the same
about all of these?
What's the one thing
that's common?
People.
We the people.
It's fundamentally about that.
The point is this--
if you want to be good at
innovation, seek first to
exceed people's desire.
Material gain and other forms
of success will follow.
That's are sort of philosophical
standpoint.
You start with that.

Another way we like to say it,
if you're not innovating for
people, then what the
heck are you doing?
All right, Charles Ponzi
was innovative.
Ponzi scheme.
The ladies and gentlemen that
worked on the hydrogen bomb
were innovative.
But what kind of innovation
are we talking about here?
And this last point I want
to make simply is that if
innovative people are good at
exceeding people's desires--
if we're going to agree that
really innovation is about
innovating for people, and
it's about how we see a
current condition or an
opportunity to exceed those
desires, you exceed them--
then the way to get better at
innovation is by mastering
this discipline of developing
solutions in
the service of people.
All that human-centered
design.
I didn't coin the term.
It's been a phrase that's been
around for quite a while.
Now, we say this in the
utmost humility.
A lot of great books have
been written about
innovation to date.
And maybe you've read some of
them-- &quot;Innovator's DNA,&quot;
&quot;Innovator's Manifesto,&quot;
&quot;The Other Sid of
Innovation,&quot; and so forth.
There's tons and tons and tons
of books on innovation.
I haven't read all of them.
I've read some of them.
And if you take all these in,
they're all written sort of in
the same way.
They're written in this way
where they interview so-called
innovative people and companies,
and they're saying,
what are their behaviors?
What are their key traits of
these wonderful people and
these wonderful organizations?
What are they good at?
What do they sort of do?
What kind of what I would say
is their characteristics,
[INAUDIBLE]?
And this probably doesn't
capture it all, but you'll
read the things like, well,
innovative people are
empathetic, they're curious,
they're persistent, they're
experimental, they're humble,
they're risk enthusiasts,
they're imaginative, they're
good problem framers, they're
very collaborative, they're good
pattern finders, they're
great networkers.
The list could go on.
We kind of know that.
You read these books and
you'll get that sense.
The question is, though, we're
a company that teaches this
stuff, and your organization
that teaches it-- how?
If I'm a leader, I just
can't say, hey
guys, go be more curious.
Or if I'm an individual, how
really do I get better at
being experimental, or how do
I become more of a risk
enthusiast, because I'm kind of
risk averse right now based
on my training.
Or how do I get better at
problem framing, and pattern
finding, and all of these
wonderful things?
And so what we have developed
is, well, if this is the
characteristics of innovative
people, and we can all kind of
see that and define it, then
what's the skill set of
innovative people?
What is this?
And this is this discipline of
human-centered design, which I
want to share with you now?
And why we think it is--
and our particular take on it is
the sort of cornerstone, if
you will, of developing the
competency of innovation
[INAUDIBLE].

Let me ask you another
question.
How many people here design?
Raise your hand.

Over here.
Yeah.
Everyone.
Good.
Oh, good.
I predicted that.
I'll ask that question a lot,
and depending on where I ask
the question and who's in the
audience, I'll get anywhere
from 99%, which I think
I got here, and 5%.
Most people don't see themselves
as designing, let
alone a designer.
And what I want to talk
about now is that--
and I think because you raised
your hand, I think you all
maybe share this definition,
because we've talked to a very
diverse, broad audience.
When I say design, people
are kind of hesitant.
I don't know if I'm
a designer or not.
I certainly don't wear a black
turtleneck and have that sort
of aura of design.
Not talking about that sort
of design profession.
We kind of borrow from Herb
Simon's definition, Nobel
Laureate, cognitive
psychologist, polymath,
professor at Carnegie Mellon
University where I was a
professor for a while.
&quot;Everyone designs,&quot;--
quote from one of his books--
&quot;who devices courses of action
aimed at changing existing
situations into preferred ones.&quot;
If you think about the
fundamental definition of
innovation, of renewal, kind
of sounds like it, right,
where everyone designs.
And so we have this saying, I
don't care what it says on
your business card.
And if your job is to come to
work and lead or collaborate
with other people to get new
and improved things in the
world that change existing
situations [INAUDIBLE]
ones, you are designing.
Everything's designed.
Products are designed, processes
are designed, places
are designed, policies
are designed,
perfumes are designed.
If your job is to come to work
and get something new in any
of these categories, that's
fundamental design.
And so what we like to say is,
first and foremost, we get
everybody in our workshops
wrapped around the rhetoric
of, yeah, OK, I do that.
Maybe I wouldn't call myself a
professional designer, and
that's fine, but I come to work
every day, and yeah, a
good portion of what I do
is design, damn it.
And the reason we do that is
because, OK, what I want to
show you then, how do we get
better at innovation is by
doing something a little better
that you already claim
that you do.
It's not some radically
different thing I'm
going to show you.
It's kind of like when Fibonacci
came along and said
this Hindu-Arabic way of doing
math is a heck of a lot better
than this Roman numeral way.
And let me codify it.
Let me show you the baker, and
you the seamstress, and you
the contractor, and you the
architect how to use this new
math to do what you guys do
every day and help you guys do
that stuff.
It's kind of like that.
And in a lot of ways, I think
the reason innovation remains
an elusive goal for all of us is
that in most organizations
around the world, we don't teach
it like a fundamental.
We were talking about
this earlier on.
We don't see this idea of
design innovation as
fundamental to being human.
If we're all saying that if your
job's [INAUDIBLE], how
are we not doing
that every day?
We kind of see it as fundamental
as reading,
writing and arithmetic.
And we want to teach, and we see
the world demanding that
everyone kind of get
good at this stuff.
If you go to a lot of K through
12 schools, they're
not doing this, because they
don't know how to measure it,
they don't know how to teach
it, they're not even
sure what it is.
In the 21st century,
we're going to see
this trend that way--
that this discipline of
developing solutions in the
service of people.
I want to talk a little
bit about
human-centered design now.
That was enough about
innovation, but kind of take
you through the rhetoric of why
we think human-centered
[INAUDIBLE]
particular design is informed us
of the sort of fundamental
core of what we need or what
we're looking for a discipline
of innovation.
How do we teach this stuff?
How would I answer the
fundamental question when we
started the company?
And we're like, well, there's a
clear need for this, but the
fundamental question is if I or
my team or my organization
is good at innovation, what
exactly are we good at?
What is that?
We didn't really have the
answer, although we kind of
did it every now and then.
We're like, no, we need to go
study this, and so we did.
Design methodologies,
human-centered design, design
thinking if you want to call it
that, that's great too, has
a long, rich history that goes
way further then Business Week
talking about this starting
10 years ago.
Way further along than IDO,
whose been sort of the poster
child for this as a practitioner
of this.
A lot of the methods I want to
share with you go back dozens,
if not hundreds, of years.
And so what we did was
we did a survey.
We talked to all the major
schools teaching this stuff,
Stanford B-school, Carnegie
Mellon University, [INAUDIBLE]
Academy, the list goes on--
IIT in Illinois.
What were the professors
teaching the students that
purportedly made them better
at innovation and design?
What were you guys teaching?
So we collected all those.
We also talked to a lot
of consultancies--
IDO, My Design in Pittsburgh,
Design Continuum,
Smart, list goes on.
What were you guys doing when
corporations hired you that
made you good at innovation
design?
The other thing we looked at
was how about some of the
companies--
P&amp;amp;G and Unilever were just two
examples of organizations that
for several years have
incorporated these
methodologies into their work.
We know that, right.
What were you guys doing to
help you get these great
products and solutions
and so forth?
Even the federal government,
US Army uses a lot of these
methodologies now, have been
for several years.
What was everybody
using and doing?
And we threw all the methods
up on the wall, and we
uncovered at the time over 200,
and since then, we've
uncovered a couple other ones.
But the theory was, well, if we
can understand what people
are doing and teaching, maybe
there's some message or signal
in the noise here with all these
different methodologies.
Is there a way of categorizing
these or looking at these in a
way that would begin to give us
a taxonomy or structure for
how to about teaching this.
Because I need to know what it
is I'm teaching you as opposed
to just picking a method
here and so forth.
And so lo and behold, we studied
this for a good two,
three months.
We kept moving around.
We actually used one of the
methods that we wound up
teaching called a [INAUDIBLE],
which helps us find patterns,
and lo and behold, all of the
methods, every one of them,
fell into one of three very
distinct pillars.
They were either methods, which
we kind of shorthanded
as looking--
methods that helped us observe
human experience, looking and
listening, better.
All of these methods are about
fundamentally that.
I'm like, OK, so our first
insight was, well, if you want
to be good at innovation, you
have to be good at observing
human experience.
Makes sense.
The second one is, well,
understanding.
That is methods for analyzing
the challenges and
opportunities before us.
All of these methods here
are really about that
fundamentally.
I was like, OK, the second
insight was if you want to be
good at innovation, you have to
be good at understanding,
of analyzing the challenges and
opportunities before you.
And the third area
was shorthanded
making, this third pillar.
What do we mean by making?
What we mean by envisioning
future possibilities.
Design is always the invention
of something that doesn't
currently exist, doesn't quite
exist in the form.
It might be a radical departure,
or it might be a
sort of incremental departure,
but doesn't exist today.
And so all these methods are
really about envisioning
future possibilities.
So that was the third one.
I was like, well, I guess if
you're good at innovation, you
have a way of envisioning
the future.
And all these methods, you
can see dozens of them.
And the other thing we noticed
is that there were different
ways of looking, understanding,
and making.
And really what it came out,
there was these nine basic
categories that all the
methods-- and to date, any
method that we have uncovered
since then
fits into this model.
So it hasn't broken yet.
Maybe we'll find one that kind
of breaks the model, but so
far this is our current
understanding and what I would
say is a taxonomy or basis for
teaching people to be more
innovative.
So for example, under looking,
there were three ways that we
found, three types of
methods for looking.
For example, OK, we are all
familiar with ethnographic
methods, and a lot of you are
familiar with those, probably
practiced those-- contextual
inquiry, and interviewing, and
walk a mile, and so forth.
That's what we called
ethnographic research.
Thank you very much
anthropology.
A lot of those hail from that
particular background.
Not to be confused with more
participatory research
techniques.
Whereas ethnography is studying
people in their
natural context, this idea of
participatory is having the
people your designed for make
something with you or for you
and then studying how they
make it and how they talk
about what they make.
Very different, but nonetheless,
a way of looking
and understanding what do people
want, what do they
need, what are they thinking.
As opposed to [INAUDIBLE]
research, usability testing,
think aloud testing,
heuristics and things
like that.
How do I evaluate the
effectiveness, the usability,
the usefulness, the desirability
[INAUDIBLE].
Same thing for understanding,
right.
Lots of methods for
understanding, what, people
and systems.
Why?
Because we're often designing
systems for people or we're
designing something that's part
of a bigger ecosystem.
We better damn well understand
what that is.
Or patterns and priorities,
what's more important?
People need this, features list,
all that kind of stuff.
And of course, don't forget
problem framing.
How we ask the question's
very important.
Lot of interesting methodology
about how we frame the problem
in the first place.
Are we designing for this or
we designing for this?
If I frame a problem like, hey,
we need a new glucose
meter, well, a team will
probably nine months later pop
up with a better looking glucose
meter, and it will be
easier to use and it'll take
less blood and et cetera all
kinds of improvements we
could imagine over a
current glucose meter.
But, however if I frame the
problem differently, I say
well, we need a better way
for managing diabetes--
hold on--
you don't necessarily get
glucose meters as an answer.
You might get something
like a whole new
business model or service.
So the way you frame
problems it turned
out was very important.
And of course making.
Making what?
Making ideas.
Concept ideation, modeling and
prototyping, and design
rationale, which is rhetoric,
your ability to be persuasive.
This one really surprised us.
We didn't have these in mind.
We just let the data kind of
emerge, and say what's the
sort of theme that kind of makes
these all hang together.
This idea of design rationale,
your ability to sell an idea,
your ability to persuade other
people that this thing needs
to exist in the future in order
to unlock their support,
their funds--
very important method,
and a handful of
methods just for that.
Now over 200 methods--
OK, so when we teach this stuff,
we knew first off that
we're going to go to
organizations or even schools,
you can't teach all of it.
And there's some wonderful
books out now--
The 101 Design Methods,
and all this stuff.
We're like, what do
we want to teach?
What's the basic set?
We always go back to math.
They didn't teach you Bayesian
probability in first grade.
Counting-- well, some kids.
Maybe some of you.
Not me.
Addition, subtraction,
multiplication, ratios, that
sort of-- what are
the basic set?
What could I base my literacy
in this discipline on?
And so we asked a couple
questions, because first of
all, we knew we were going to
go into a lot of places, not
just places like Google, but
places like the federal
government, some product goods
companies, all these different
places that were designing
a whole slew of
things trying to innovate.
And so we came up with an
algorithm, and of each method,
we asked the following
questions.
How universally applicable
is the method?
That was important to us.
There's some great methods out
there if you're doing GUI
design, but maybe
nothing else.
We wanted to make sure that if
we're going to offer up a
teaching method to a corporation
or an organization
that they can apply it
in multiple places.
The second question is how easy
is the method to teach,
learn, or apply-- what
I call portability.
I mean, it's got to be
easy to learn, easy
to apply, and effective.
I want something to have a very
high ROI, return on my
investment.
If I do this method, it's
going to yield some
qualitative or quantitative
advancement for what I'm
trying to do.
The third question is how
effective/useful has the
method been to organizations
in the past?
It mattered that places like IDO
or the federal government
were using these methods year
after year after year that
told me that was probably
working.
And of course, how unique
is this method
from others like it?
If I'm going to show you an area
like evaluative research
or problem framing, I want to
make sure the cluster of
methods, whether three
or four, are
different from one another.
They're not shades of
gray different.
So you get a sort of survey of
four really good or three
really good problem
framing methods.
So if you learn these methods,
you could say, yeah, I'm a
pretty good problem framer.
I know how to go about that, and
I've got different methods
to use in different
situations.
Or I'm pretty good at modeling
and prototyping.
I've got some different methods
here that I can
utilize in my process.
And what you're looking at here
is sort of the--this eye
chart here is our
basic structure.
It's the final 36.
Why is it 36?
Don't know, to be honest.
We kind of went back and forth
and felt like this was a
reasonable set, and basically we
were trying to come up with
a set that basically said,
look, if you want to get
better at innovation, just learn
these and practice them
for the rest of your life.
You will increase your
chances of coming up
with innovative solutions.
You will be a better
human-centered designer.
You'll be innovating
for people.
Are there other great methods
that aren't included up here?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

So what I wanted to do
is just quickly--
this is a more pictorial
representation.
I have some samples that you
guys can leave with.
I have a little poster of the
36 we teach, but I wanted to
talk a little bit about why
these 36, because that's the
first question--like, well,
why not all 200?
That's the story
of [INAUDIBLE].
And quickly again, these
methods for looking--
so ethnographic, studying human
behavior in a social
setting; participatory, learning
from people through
cooperative [INAUDIBLE]
activities;
evaluative; et cetera.
So just kind of quickly walk
through, understanding.
I've already talked about these,
but just more of a
pictorial representation.
So this is what we think is a
sort of basic curriculum or
framework for--
look, you get--
we like to say, what's that
sort of magical number of
hours one must do something
to become an expert?
10,000 hours.
Here's what you do for 10,000
hours to be a bit more of an
expert or an expert
in innovation.
This is tangible.
This is tangible stuff,
et cetera.
Storyboarding, visioning
future solutions, other
ideation techniques beyond
brainstorming.
Brainstorming is one of dozens
of methods that aid the mind
in thinking.
We don't teach that.
It's a well known one, but we
teach four other ones that are
very good, in some cases,
better than traditional
brainstorming.
Sitting around a circle, and
everybody knows the rules of
brainstorming.
Things like round robin and
creative matrix and
alternative world.
Now, this is not an arbitrary
set of methods.
This is a curated
set of methods.
There are a lot more other ones
that didn't make the cut.
And, you know what, two
years from now, we
might refine this.
Who knows, it might be less.
It might be 27, or we might
swap out a method of two.
We're learning that over time.
We're evolving it as well, but
this is our best guess at the
moment and this is what
we currently teach.
The other one--
and the idea is that
understanding these, what
these can do, and really
practicing them and getting
good at them really turns on--
this is how we become better
collaborators, better problem
finders, more risk
enthusiasts, very
experimental.
Pick your innovative
trait du jour.
And again, these wonderful
books about that, but the
question is, I need something
more brass tacks.
How do I get better
at these things?
These things kind of point
to these directly.
The other thing this is not
a prescriptive process.
I know that a lot of
organizations teach design
innovation.
Here's our innovation process.
There's nothing wrong
with that.
I think that's OK.
We take a different tack for
a couple of reasons.
The first reason is
that, again, we
always go back to math.
I mean, if this is a fundamental
discipline--
the world is just
way too complex.
There's way too many kinds of
design innovation challenges
for a one size fits all process
to work in all these
situations.
What we're designing, how much
resources and time we have,
who's working on the project--
I think you'd be hard pressed to
take one process and use it
over and over again in
all the situations.
That said, I mean, there are
certainly house styles--
maybe Google has some in
different quarters, which are
done that way.
What we have is-- and the other
reason we don't do it is
the last thing people want
to hear when we walk into
organizations, hey, I've got
another process for you.
Well, we've got processes.
What we do is look at
like, well, we're
kind of process agnostic.
I don't care if it's a agile
model, or stage gate, or
blend, or spiral--
that's good.
To us, that is you're specific
way of how you go through a
pretty simple thing of
beginning, middle and end or
front-end innovation or back
innovation, whatever term you
want to do it.
You have to go through this,
and this is sort
of a generic one.
You do some kind of research,
and then you come up with a
concept, and then you develop,
and then you launch and you go
back again.
Maybe your process has seven
steps or four steps, they all
are a kind of variation on the
theme, and how you go through
that is your business
and it's good.
And there's many reasons
for that.
When we come in, we say well,
how do you go through that?
What we want to say is that it
matters how you go through
that, and we want to show that
here are all 36 methods sort
of turned on its side.
And just in the research phase,
how many are applicable
to help you do better
research?
How many are applicable
to help you come
up with better concepts?
How many are applicable to help
you with development, to
quicken and improve in the
development cycle, the pilot,
the lauch, and do
it back again.
So we want to present this
as not a process but as a
discipline, just like math.
You probably used math 30 times
today, and you didn't
even know it.
If you were driving to work and
you looked at your gauge
and it said half full,
you just use ratios.
If you bought something,
you used math.
It's kind of like
the same thing.
These are the things--
it's sort of a way of thinking
and doing every day.
How do we go about making
[INAUDIBLE]?
And so here's some sample
combinations.
So the reason we say this is
there is a tendency to see
look, understand, make
as [INAUDIBLE],
understand, make, watch.
And what we want to
say is no, no, no.
These are modes of thinking,
that sometimes we're looking,
sometimes we're understanding,
sometimes we're making a
little something.
It doesn't matter where
I'm at in the process.
And so sample combinations
for maybe a front end.
I might do something called walk
a mile immersion to gain
some empathy for the people
I'm designing for.
And then from that I might do
some alternative worlds that
kind of help me think about
some different ideas.
And then I might do some
abstract laddering to help me
frame the problem differently.
I might do some work ideation
and so forth.
What we teach is understand the
36, but what we want you
to be is masters of
combining them.
This is a combinatory.
This is about non-linear
thinking.
If you want to master
anything, it's about
non-lineary thinking.
Think about it.
Novices follow processes.
I can go home, and I can coo--
I'm no chef, but I can follow a
recipe, and I can make that
recipe and there's nothing
wrong with that.
But really about innovation,
how do we come up and make
people more virtuosos at it.
Well, we have to teach them
non-linear thinking.
You don't want to limit your
ability with say, OK, step
one, we always do factual
inquiry and this is how we do
it and so forth.
Nothing wrong with that, but I
think the world's demanding
that we be a bit more agile
about, OK, how do we
understand what we're
doing here?
How do we do research here?
Factual inquiry is
a fine method.
We teach it too, but let's take
a look at the sort of
suite of other methodologies
that are out there to help us
understand what we're looking
at, because these other ways
of looking might, in fact, cause
us to see different.
I love this quote from
Heather Fraser up
at the Rotman School.
&quot;Design is not a one
shot vaccine.
It's a innovation fitness
program--
I love it-- it puts
an organization
on top of its game.
Not an event.
It's a way of thinking,
communicating, and doing every
day. &quot; And so this is really
how we sort of tee this up.
The slides I just showed you are
the sort of fundamentals.
They're the things that if you
talk to everybody K through
CEO, we believe is the
fundamentals, is the
foundation for what it means to
go make things for people.
Now, the other points I want to
make here very quickly are
that innovation can only
flourish in an environment
that values these ways of
thinking, making, and doing.
We can teach people all
day, but if the--
I love this.
Actually, this is a real sign.
Can anybody figure out what's
wrong with this picture?
If I don't live in an
environment that's conducive
to practicing these things and
doing them and cultivating
these things, then it's
not going to work.
I get that.
So there's a whole other
equation part of this that
LUMA's about is defining the
sort of core curriculum, the
sort of agreed upon language,
agreed upon methodology of how
we do these and what skills
we're actually developing.
But of course, we have to think
about all these sort of
intangibles and tangibles in a
company that allows for this.
We can teach this stuff all day,
but like the golfer here
on the left, if where we work
isn't conducive to it--
I could teach somebody to--
I can't, but somebody could
teach me to play golf like a
professional, but if I don't
have the place to go practice
this stuff, then it's not
going to take root.
I'm going to be playing--
it'll be like me teaching you
how to do something but going
to play golf in an
urban setting.
Or you've got to have
people that are
serious about education.
It sounds like this is very much
the case here, which is
why Google had me come
in and talk today.
How we learn or even
that we learn--
it's kind of for an organization
to just put
people in front of life right
now as complex as it is
without giving them the proper
tools to go innovate, it's
like sticking a kid in front
of a board filled with
different kinds of equations,
quadratic equations and so
forth, and say go do this.
What?
There's a certain
responsibility
that goes with this.
We have to teach this
in a systematic way.

How we work, the management.
I mean, micromanagement's not
really going to cut it in this
day and age.
I mean, you have to value,
hey people, this
is a complex problem.
You've got to get people to sit
in the right direction in
the room to breathe and work out
these, use some of these
tools and others to
figure it out and
chart the path forward.
And of course, how we
incentivize, how we reward.
Again, preaching to
the choir here.
A lot of organizations see
success and failure as
divergent paths.
They're not.
They're not mutually exclusive
paths at all.
In fact, they're one
in the same.
We all fail early an often.
Why?
So we can learn.
And so you have to have an
organization that rewards the
ability for someone to
go rapid prototype.
Here, build a prototype of
that and go test it out.
Yeah, we want you to fail, but
fail small, fail quickly.
And so a lot of organizations,
they see like successes this
way, failures that way.
That's not right.
So we understand that these
kind of mindsets and the
environment has to come into
tune as well, but we also,
what we desperately need I think
is a codified, clearer
curriculum around this stuff.
And it is the same
curriculum, these
same tools are universal.
The same 36 tools that we teach
help people solve these
very diverse problems.
How can we help people manage
diabetes better?
How can we have a productive
kick off meeting?
These are some of the questions
that our customers
we teach, they're
trying to solve.
What do our customers
really want?
How do we increase sales?
How can we improve education?
How do we build better
leaders?
These same tools are applicable
to all these
different question.
They're that universal.
Of course, real benefits,
we all know about this.
There are a ton of stories
about the application of
human-centered design, design
thinking methods to good end.
I mean on the sort of 20,000
foot view of this, the
benefits of incorporating
human-centered design into the
DNA of the culture, it provides
a framework from
which to foster a more
innovative culture.
Culture depends upon that we're
all speaking the same
language and have a shared value
of what these things
are, what we call them,
and how we do them.
And really, it's about helping
you get to the right solution
to market faster.
We get, and I think everybody
gets, time to market's
important, but it's not.
Time to market traction
is what's important.
How fast can you get something
to market that people love is
really the challenge, and so
these methods are about
understanding that as opposed to
just getting something out
into world.
It enables you to compete
less on price and
features and more on value.
What do people value?
Gives your team the tools
to [INAUDIBLE]
highly complex problems.
We've got a lot of different
things we have to deal with
these days and these tools are
about understanding the
problem differently, working
through, understanding pattern
priorities, really kind of
thinking through the problem,
executing, iterating,
and so forth.
And the other thing is that key
strategic driver of top of
the line growth.
Couple studies, some by the UK
Design Council, has basically
stated that companies that imbue
or incorporate a design
approach to their businesses
outperform the major stock
indices typically by 200% or
more, two and a half more
times likely to grow
top line revenue.
And really, thanks to
Tom [INAUDIBLE]
lower overall development costs
and risk of big failure.
Why?
Because we're experimenting.
One of the major tenets of
human-centered design is
learning from them, building a
little, and going back to the
designing board and say, how's
this, and break it down and
tell you what's wrong with
it and so forth.
It's about those little leaps of
logic as opposed to leap of
faith a lot of companies
and organizations take.

And it's used widely.
The Gates Foundation utilized
these tools I think in
conjunction with IDO to
improve safe access to
drinking water around
the world.
It's used by DARPA.
This was actually a project
done with my design in
Pittsburgh, which we're
associated.
Helped the US Army deploy a new
digital command system.
What's that?
Well, yeah, it could be applied
to the way people find
water, to the way the federal
government goes about
deploying mission critical
emissions.
P&amp;amp;G we know use this stuff
too, [INAUDIBLE]
the Swiffer and so forth.
So radically different
types of problems,
same fundamental tools.
And again, this is
the choir here.
I know who I'm sitting
in front of today.
And so I thought I'd wrap up
with some things that we've
learned, because I know we've
got some folks in the audience
that actually teach this
here at Google and are
concerned with this.
And so very much [INAUDIBLE]
wonderful to have the
opportunity to share what
we're doing.
The first thing we learned in
doing this is that processes
are necessary and good
but don't teach this
start through a process.
Be careful of that, because what
you're teaching them is
one process, and those processes
aren't going to
translate to multiple
situations.
Or anybody coming in with
an outside view,
well, here's our process.
When you teach it, just
be careful of that.
There's some good stuff in
there, but the reason is that
you want to be careful not to
limit your own and other's
growth or transformative
abilities.
Again, novices follow
linear processes.
Experts think non-linearly.
They lead, change, and adapt.
So what we want to do is, look,
I want to teach you how
to add, subtract, multiply
divide, ratios, so you can use
it when you need it.
And so what you're looking at
in those nine categories,
looking, understanding, making,
how to problem frame,
how to envision future
possibilities, how to do
ethnographic research.
What we're doing is teaching
you the basics and
fundamentals which you
can pull out--
I don't care if you're designing
your new kitchen at
home or you're designing a new
policy that will affect
millions of people--
the same fundamental acts.
We've also learned that
you need to be
explicit about this craft.
The more other people see what
you do as a mysterious art--
we talked about this earlier--
the less value they'll
place in it and you.
There is logic behind this.
And if you've grown up in an
arts school and applied arts,
it's taught and it's understood
that there's a bit
of mystery to this,
and there's not.
We found that out.
These methods exist and we've
codified them and there's a
very clear taxonomy and if you
teach kids and your employees
these ways of thinking and doing
and acting, well then
you will get better at the thing
which they purportedly
help you to do which is
design and innovate.
Bring rigor to your craft.
I've been doing this
for 25 years.
I'm still perfecting.
Even the simplest,
interviewing.
Everybody's been in an interview
and interviewed, but
man, can I interview like
a journalist yet?
Can I interview like
a CSI agent?
No.
I mean, there's so many ways
to get better at these
fundamental things.
It takes a humility, there's
a humbleness to this, and
continuously improve the breadth
and depth of these
skills and knowledge.
People at the top of their game
are notorious for this.
Right before a golf tournament,
what does Tiger
Woods do for an hour or two
right before he goes on.
He practices and practices
and he has
coaches, constantly refining.
It's the same with
us and this.
It's not innovation, yeah,
once in awhile.
It's like we have to bring
a sense of rigor and
professionalism to what we do
and innovate professionally.
And so I think we always-- we
all, me included, can improve
in many of these areas.
And the last point is--
next to last point-- is if you
seek better multidisciplinary
collaboration and teach
everyone these skills,
everyone designs as we just
discussed, and these are
skills for design innovation,
and who
really isn't doing that.
This is why we kind
of [INAUDIBLE]
literacy.
Everybody's got a hand in this
and can derive value from
practicing these skills
with each other.
And the last point we've learned
is that there's this
70/20/10 model in learning,
and it's
true but kind of backwards.
And the last point I want to
make is that the 70/20/10
model stipulates that most
learning happens on the job,
real world application.
And I think everybody might
agree with this.
Think about what you know.
Most of what you know really
happened because you were out
there applying it, learning on
the job at your various jobs.
20% was from feedback, peer to
peer, and 10% from traditional
course learning and
things like that.
I think most people I talked
to was like, yeah, that's
probably about right.
But it says that the 10% isn't
important, but it's vital.
The 10% starts.
You have to have an agreed
upon language in the
curriculum from which
to teach.
Again, we'll take the
golf analogy.
If I go out there and I expect
to learn to play golf at a
professional level just by
whacking at the ball, that's
not going to happen.
I need the proper pedagogical
training in what is this
discipline around-- how
do I hold a club?
How do I hit the ball?
What are the different
situations?
Same thing with innovation.
What does it mean to
be innovative?
What is the scope
of methodologies
that one can perfect?
And then once I know the
fundamentals, then peer to
peer, learning from others and
applying it on the job, that's
how I really have got it.
So that sums it up for words I
want to share with you today.
And you're welcome to follow
us on Twitter.
I've got a new book out called
&quot;Innovating for People&quot; that
you can check out.
We're doing a workshop at the
tech shop, actually, on
Wednesday and Thursday
of this week.
You guys are welcome to join
us up there if you want.
[INAUDIBLE]
talk a little more about that.
But, it's been a delight here.
