University of Texas yeah texas A&amp;amp;M so
good morning everyone I'm into and my
advisor is Android current and we are
here to present our work on
interoperable metadata semantics so what
has metadata semantics so we define
metadata semantics at the conjunction
between a document and its content its
descriptions its operations and its
relations so let's look at an example
like this this is an article from New
York Times we see that in addition to
its content we have those descriptions
like region and and the relations in the
form of hyperlinks and operations like
share email so that you can send it to
your friends and also there are all the
kinds of metadata semantics on the web
in different forms like RSS feeds like
pattern repository and digital libraries
and products and so on so these these
metadata semantics are useful in
applications but there are some problems
with it to use you them in applications
like one problem is that most of the
metadata semantics are represented in
HTML files which you cannot use directly
technically you cannot use direct
director in your programs and different
sources may use different forms like
even they are using the same schema so
if you want to use metadata semantics
from different sources you need to deal
with them individually which is not
convenient so this makes it difficult to
obtain to use and to exchange between
systems so we have some people have
proposed thistle
oceans for those problems like we have
all the metadata standards like dublin
core and mark and others and so metadata
semantics in those written in this
standards can you can use them with
without knowing those sources and
however the standardization process is
slow so it cannot scale up it can hardly
ask you up with the web well then we
have the Semantic Web approach which is
a very very general way to describe
metadata semantics however the the
availability is quite limited at least
on today's web we have also those
alternative Semantic Web ways like like
piggy bank which uses JavaScript atis
creepers to scrape metadata semantics
from documents and we also have Micro
data which allows publisher to embed
semantics in HTML page so our objective
in this work is to implement
interoperable metadata semantics which
is obtained from different sources but
translated into a consistent
representation that you can use directly
in your program and also without knowing
the sources and so we have this software
called meta meta data which is a
language for alternative a purse
wrappers define this metadata schema and
extraction or presentation jewels and it
is also an architecture for extracting
and translating metadata semantics from
documents to your application and take
actions on them basically action our
operations and it is also a repository
of authored wrappers so you don't have
to start from scratch every time and it
is open source software so
you can use it here is it as the
overview of the architecture and I will
go through the details with the use case
of integrating search results from
different search engines let's look at
the authoring process first so this is a
typical search result from google which
has a heading a link and the snippet
from the document it refers to and we
can user this wrapper two models its
metadata schema it's pretty
straightforward here you can see the
heading snippet link there with this
definitional search resort we can define
a search as the as a collection of
search results as you'll see here is a
collection of search resort and this
semantic action basically our iterate
over each search resort and go to that
URL and to see if there are new
semantics we can use it's basically a
crawling action and the other rappers
are actually make up a cross language
type system with support for inheritance
here each rapper is corresponding to a
type so like so with the general
definition of a search we can derive new
types subtypes from the search for each
individual source but in this way we can
handle each search as just eat of them
as just a search so we can handle all
the metadata semantics in that a
consistent way up here is a wrapper for
Google search we see that in addition to
the metadata schema we see this selector
here which specifies the mime type or
URL pattern of documents for this
wrapper so the system can know which
rapper to use for this kind of documents
and we have
those extraction jewels here we use the
XPath parser but it's not limited to act
paths we also have PDF parser like at
HTML parser XML parser this is a wrapper
for yahoo buzz search and bing search
and / search they are not very different
from each other except for different
extraction rules and in the compilation
time those types defined by rappers they
are translated and they are compiled
into programming language types which we
call metadata classes like we support
different kinds of languages here shows
a Java class for search resort and also
this is a c-sharp version of search and
these metadata classes serve as a
mapping between the metadata semantics
in the documents to your application
like our active domain objects at
runtime the system select the given URL
the system selects the appropriate
wrapper for that document extract the
metadata semantics and the tick actions
on the extracted material objects those
objects are just ordinary programming
language objects like defined here so
you can use them in your application and
the those objects can also be serialized
in two different forms like XML or JSON
and transferred through network or other
medium and deserialize the in another
system or language so the semantics can
transfer across the system boundaries
and you can also render them into HTML
with micro data embedded here shows an
example of the rendered HTML in which
search results from different engines
are
integrated together and we think that
the meta meta data transforms the web
into a ecosystem of interoperable
metadata semantics so that you do not
rely on publishers to publish those
formal semantics for you to use you can
just extract them and it supports the
application development by helping you
to extract the molecular semantics and
transfer them between systems so it also
comes with a reusable repository so you
can reuse the schema and extraction
rules defined by other people there it
is currently used in several
applications we release it as an open
source software it is founded by google
Summer of Code this year and we also
have we demoed the our creativity
support and since making two which is
called in phone composer now and here
shows an screen short of it this is a
image clipping from form our second
paper and the here showed all the
metadata semantics associated with that
paper in the future we will work on some
more applications using the software
especially trained service change
surface applications which transfers
semantics or cross surfaces and and we
will promote interoperability with other
techniques techniques like RDF and we
encourage people to try the software and
proposed newest new use cases for the
software to evolve so that's it
questions
i won I'm wondering about the
relationship of your meta data model
with with RDF constant and do you have
some some equivalent relationship
mechanism such as a subclass property
and so properties relationship you know
billion between different type of
metadata oh we currently we are I think
the relationship between objects are
mostly impressed in like the field name
like like the reference relationship
between the scholarly articles papers it
is there is a field called references in
the scholarly article which is a
collection of a set of other scholarly
article so this represents the
relationship and we are working on
connecting this kind of relationship
with RDF it it will be pretty easy for
us to generate RDF but our inherent
approach is based on the idea that you
should use abstract data types to
represent complex data not kludgy things
like triples that um you know that you
have to then translate into abstract
data types ultimately to operate on them
in programs we propose and have
developed this quite substantial
mechanism for using abstract I two types
directly to represent very complex type
systems and graphs of interconnected
semantic data tasty thank you thank you
Moselle questions
let's thank our speaker thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
