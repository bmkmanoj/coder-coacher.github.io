visiting him back around 2003 and it
wasn't called spore yet it was called
sim everything and he showed me a box
and the box had cover art on it it had
like what system requirements which were
like something crazy like you need this
many teraflops and this many you know
much like terabytes of memory and crazy
stuff and graphics processors it didn't
exist and and he showed me and I said
what is this and he says this is the box
this is the game and he says we always
start by doing this first and then of
course we have to like then make it
possible for you to open the box and so
I'm holding this thing and they're
saying so you mean the game doesn't
exist yet and he says he says no no it's
in the box you just can't open it yet
and I thought that this was a very
profound way of thinking about things
that it's kind of up to us as the people
who make things possible to be thinking
that way and I I've been thinking about
this whole getting computer graph
actually I have this little I just
remembered this little character that I
carry around with me he was like the
first thing I ever made first thing I
ever made on a 3d printer it was very
proud as I was like hanging out at the
banff centre for the arts and i'd been
making these like interactive animated
figures and doing procedural character
animation at some point if i can just
print this thing out and I got to the
bamf Art Center for like a little summer
thing oh they have one of these things
and so I started taking all of these
cool things on my webpage and I started
and I started printing them and what
would you realize is when you print
things out in a 3d printer is that
suddenly your computer graphics thing it
comes out of the screen you like in the
ring you know comes out of screen and it
said not as scary and it has a size
which is fascinating you know cuz all
this time how big was stuff now I knew
how big it was so I started making
little I made a little zoetrope you know
you spin them around and I'm is like I
posted that online people could see
little movies move I started doing with
4d objects and I started thinking that
this excellent reminded me of
of my formative influences I'm sure all
of you have read Snow Crash right you've
already know crash like you have to add
red snow graft and if not that's your
homework assignment and basically Neal
Stephenson in 1992 a year before what we
now think of as the web said let's posit
a world where people just can share this
reality which is unlike the web the way
it ended up showing up the next year is
like our physical reality except of
course we can enhance it and so I had an
in the earlier work that I was doing
that that Jeremy first two I had been
doing things like thinking wow ok I'm
really interested in a bad picture of it
but I million stood making things that
are like the physical world but somehow
have magical qualities about them like
why can't things rise up out of the
water and turn into shape and so I
actually went and ordered my own little
3d printer which I now have at home
sitting on my living room couch so I
actually now make stuff at home in a 3d
printer how many people have a 3d
printer at home awesome of course you do
it's great he's actually the first
person who's ever actually said yes
which is great so it's just you and we
gotta talk afterward which one do you
have okay oh it's fancy Overmind so um I
would actually argue that the person who
wrote these books is probably the single
most influential person in the last
decade not only for getting millions and
millions of kids to read which in itself
is very important but also JK Rowling
did something really interesting she
said ok let's just talk about what do we
want we want newspapers or people wave
back at you we want maps where when you
look at them you see where people are
and you just writing this in 1999 like
13 years ago and she just like what
we'll just we'll just say oh it's magic
it's okay but it's exactly what people
want things just do what you want and in
some sense what she was doing was
educating a generation of kids to say
what should HCI be what should you mean
computer interfaces be well what do you
want them to be forget about like how
they work first
we want and now in fact 13 years later
we take it for granted we have
newspapers where things move we have
maps where you can see where people are
and they're just they're not even
considered out of the ordinary the world
caught up with this vision but the key
was she was doing basically what Alan
Kay has always said which is the best
way to predict the future is to invent
it and of course arthur c clarke had did
the same thing with geosynchronous
satellites you just talk about stuff and
you start bringing it into your world
now what I noticed was that for the most
part the people who are most wid the
program on the stuff were the other
artists this is like a section from a
shot from a video that this art student
did online where he starts just he
basically starts making things happen in
the air in front of him as he talks to
you and this was actually done by you
know lots of pre-planning and then 60
hours of post-production but he's
creating this vision of suppose
information were right here and I was
having a conversation with unisys
started showing up in computer games is
heavy rain there's this lovely short
film called world builder where a man
actually just builds an entire world for
his beloved by creating a mented reality
right in his hands and there and there's
this actually really wonderful guy he
workshop is down the block from our lab
at my you Marco tempest who does these
wonderful magic tricks where he mixes
reality and augmented reality and and
and plays around with it but of course
there was someone who was thinking about
this well before any of these people and
that was George Lucas I don't know if
you remember anyone see this movie this
was back you know back when he was
making good movies and the interesting
thing about this idea is that we see
this and we immediately get why we're
interested in this because this is
promising a world in which these guys
just sitting around they're having their
conversation they're not like now we
have to go look at the screen there
looking at each other and they're
talking and the information is showing
up in that ambient space so you know
when when c-3po is playing with the
Wookiee and they're just playing a game
and the stuff showing up there when the
the Death Star you know circling around
and door is you know what's interesting
about this shot it's fascinating
the shot is that dumb you see all these
people not even thinking about the fact
that there is this holographic thing
floating in mid-air between them like
that's perfectly normal right remember
this film was made like what 77 and yet
they all have these little monitors with
these displays and you got to ask
yourself why did they need monitors with
little displays if they lived in a world
where projected Holograms could show up
anywhere and of course the reason is
because in 1977 if you didn't have
little monitors everywhere audiences
would be very confused because they were
they needed to see things that they
recognized but in fact the promise of
this you know is it shows up over and
over and over in in pop culture of
course a bit later than this you got
star trek the next generation which
introduced the holodeck and and really
really cool hairstyles I'd like to point
out by the way that this Lucas did not
come up with this idea this was a film
from 1957 can anyone name that film it's
uh uh give up it's forbidden planet and
that's dr. Morbius played by Walter
Pidgeon and there's and there's an
Francis floating in mid-air because dr.
Morbius is using the advanced technology
from mysterious extinct race the crowl
to kind of project an image there and
there's a Leslie Nielsen as the intrepid
young hero before he turned a comedy and
and what's interesting is that Lucas not
only took the idea of a young chick
floating in mid-air without a swing he
actually stole the shot I'm sorry he
borrowed the shot as de nemoj to this
earlier film that was 20 years old at
the time so a lot of people have been
trying to do things like this at NYU we
had this this project that we did
earlier about obit that 10 years ago
called holla dust where the basic idea
was that we would scan with a laser an
infrared laser into dust and every time
we scanned and we hit a particle we like
we'd flash a visible laser and sort of
light it up when we got some some
interesting low res stuff
happening with that so the point was
that you could actually put your hand
right into the display a USC has been
doing some really interesting work where
they have this very very fast spinning
disk and everybody can see a different
point of view so this is beyond what we
were doing because we were just creating
something that floats in the air and
everyone sees is glowing particles
they're actually creating a separate
view point for everyone and is
interesting that Joss Whedon in his 2009
sci-fi mini-epic dollhouse basically
reiterated the kind of hollow dust idea
there are these are two mad scientists
and love and you can tell they're in
love because you know he's examining the
floating blade brain you know and she's
looking at him you know that duration
and he's I think he's looking at her
brain activity it's all very wonderful
and romantic and so but of course those
great futurists who came before the
brothers were Chomsky said well why
don't we just stick plugs in the back of
people's heads which you know just do
this kind of stuff I mean it's very rich
people's brains are very rich we have
all this leather very rich mapping of of
where that what the different parts of
your brain map into it turns out is a
flawed idea partly because when you pull
out of you know the acceptable lobe
there and you go through the whole optic
nerve and the retina these are actually
very very important parts of your brain
processing so the sixth something back
there is actually really a bad idea
because you're missing a big big part of
the of the image processing that your
brain does the best thing is actually to
try to like go in the front like let you
do and it's it's actually then you get
full use of the whole of the whole brain
and also there are these issues it's
actually quite difficult to do this well
brain tissue rejects implants after a
few weeks um but so and you have to go
into the skull which is really not
consumer friendly but nonetheless
there's this promise that we want to be
able to see fantasy superimposed on
reality of this burning issue to have
like these we know that this would
change our world we know that you know
if only we could do like I said
things like find that pizza wherever he
wanted this is what people really really
want and they want it now and they want
it with extra cheese so so um there's a
video I'm not going to show you because
you can find it online and I don't have
time but there's a wonderful cautionary
video that this guy did about making tea
in the future when you're just wearing
augmented reality goggles and as you
walk around it's taking you through
every step and you realize it becomes
this nightmare it's like he's just got
everything floating in front of him and
then he's like hits this moment of quiet
to make tea and then all the ads show up
again and and by the way was that I just
curious I don't know if you're allowed
to answer this was that new york times
article leaked or was that did you guys
want people to know about that then you
know what I'm talking about oh that's
right good point there's a new york
times article visit that's a google's
coming out with augmented reality
glasses in june and i was just curious
if the new york times did but they
usually did which is like will just
write this and if they don't say
anything well hey we win um so that's
that's the press for you so I'm so so
there may be things that people could
talk about or not talk about
meaningfully with quite with silences um
but I want to talk about the form factor
of such things I mean here are you
seeing from this guy's point of view but
what does it look like when he's went
when he's wearing this device and so
hearing aids when people wear hearing
aids they try really hard to make them
invisible and why are they trying to
make them invisible they're trying to
make invisible because nobody wants
anyone to know that your heart a feeling
you know you consider a dysfunction it's
nobody's business that I've got this you
know this thing that I'm working on but
there's something else that people do
like the early kind of you know wireless
you know hands-free headset some of them
just look like this you know it's like
hey I'm just walking around wearing this
big honking thing because I look at the
air traffic controller because I'm cool
so there's something else going on here
here and then I'm trying to make it
invisible trying to make it very visible
and in fact there is this concept that
when you have say the hands-free head a
headset at some point it becomes fashion
you know what the jawbone display is the
jawbone headset
fashionable you want people to know that
i'm cool i have this because being able
to walk around and talk to people and
keep your hands-free is not a
dysfunction it's a superpower so one can
actually argue that fashion is very
important here that the goal is not
necessarily to make the glasses
invisible but to actually make them into
a cool fashion statement and that
actually helps with the transition you
know as you know before we get to the
magic contact lenses so in fact just to
illustrate the importance of fashion
this was a very very very good device
that came out in 2001 that nobody wanted
I'm and that of course is the tablet pc
um and people were like why do I want a
PC where I can't even type something
what's it for who is it for and then of
course they're their competitor came out
with something about seven years later
where they built an entire ecosystem of
desire around the iPad so the iPad like
wait nobody's thinking oh it doesn't
have a keyboard what they're thinking is
I just want it it's got this pretty
rounded corners and I wanted and it's so
smooth and it's glass and of course it
was built not as a computer at all it
was billed as a consumption device and
they redefined the the economy of how
you consume information and they did it
at the right time they did it when you
had the videos that you know that that
you guys actually help with and and all
of the music store and cetera etc that
are in games so now how do you get there
how do you prototype these things well
the technology for doing this exists but
the technology for things floating in
space in front of us it's still being
worked out and so there's this long
history of people trying to you know
like let's just build a you know your
University of Illinois you know they
built a cave they started this movement
where you just put a big projector on
each wall and you track people's heads
and then they feel like they're in a
space and then you can start creating
these holodeck like possibilities you
know early early on back in the days of
EPL in the mid to late 80s people were
just doing everything they could even
though the technology wasn't right that
this is not a consumer item this will
not be a consumer item but they were at
least saying what
going to be like with available
technology for me to like reach out here
and see a cyber version of my hand and
it was very valiant that people were
doing this and I think we always need to
do this and sometimes these things work
out well sometimes they don't work out
well at least they're trying not
available at any store and but but then
you get to these questions of what are
our goals and if you argue that the goal
as a shared social reality certain
things are interesting that they don't
get you there like you know so musics
has this wonderful kind of thing except
you can't see the person's eyes so
that's a problem because you're not
there able to see a reality but you
can't actually really just look at them
and a really significant part of our
brain is is devoted to you know we've
got this whole priety lobe in the middle
here that's like there's stuff like
that's physical it's like what are my
fingers doing you know what my fingers
are doing you know this gaze detection
there's like subtlety of movement we've
just got this immense amount of
special-purpose hardware that we've
evolved to just do the physical thing
face-to-face then we're actually not
using any of one we're just staring at
you know web browsers and so so views
exciting but it's still I would argue
this is not the social interaction
because people still can't see each
other's eyes so you're seeing things out
of your eyes but you're not able to read
somebody's expression so of course
people started doing retinal displays
you know the hit lab pioneer there's a
number of people partners where
basically you try to have them the
unobtrusive display that and then you
have these innovations which in
themselves look clunky but they
represent important things like the
significant thing to me about this is
that even though this looks clunky that
element right there actually allows you
to see his pupil which means you can a
future evolution of this you could look
directly into each others eyes so that's
sort of starting to deal with the social
question of I want to see you because I
want to be able to read your facial
expression and you know and then there's
the the micro optical has has these
displays with some people using now and
and the air Scouter and but I would
actually argue and I things can get
smaller and smaller like you know in a
few years we could do something like
this this is a this is a
this is me in a paint program by the way
we don't actually have this as a working
prototype but you know so you know it's
just something floating in front of her
eyes and if you make it fashion then
maybe that's okay um and the other part
of this isn't just display the other
part of this is tracking so there are
problems with you know the inertial this
is that's those are not inches those are
centimeters so that's about to know this
big in the longest dimension and so the
problems with these things unless you
make very expensive they're super super
low latency but they'll drift and even a
little bit drift over time is
problematic because it multiplies very
quickly over or a few minutes like the
things pointing the wrong direction
however we have another technology at
least another one other technology which
is really really good at preventing
drift and that's you can use like little
miniature cameras and put them on things
and so so this guy is basically getting
you your 200 frames per second like
response time that you need to lock the
virtual objects you know so that this
could be a real object or virtual object
and as I move it staying in the right
place and this guy is basically
presenting further adrift and for all I
know you guys are working on the stuff
but what really what people would like
to do is and you know and Babbitt parvis
is working on for example at University
of Washington are things like this this
is actually a very very early-stage
prototype electronic contact lens only
designed to see whether its large
because he puts it on the eyes of
rabbits and then he sees how long the
rabbit can wear it and it turns out the
rabbit can wear it for 20 minutes and
I'm not sure how he checks in with the
rabbit to find out that the rabbit is
complaining but apparently the rabbit
complains after 20 minutes and was like
okay fine here's your 20 bucks test
subject um but we do ultimi I mean it is
interesting to eventually move these
things and to be completely unobtrusive
and so eventually we want something like
the hololens you know like wouldn't it
be great if we just and of course this
is exactly what vernor vinge talked
about in his 2006 book rainbows end
where he says let's go 30 years in the
future everybody's wearing all right so
all of us we've got our little contact
lenses popped in me you know that's
enough time that we've miniaturized it
of course if you look back and you think
about about this diagram you real
that that actually has to be diffractive
optics it can't be normal opt it has to
be a little hologram thing because there
is no room there to actually focus so
that's a future technology that's a 10
80 scale but you know we know
theoretically how to do this stuff how
to sort of get coherent stuff that will
focus on the retina from there we just
did a lot of engineering to do so then
he starts looking at the sociology of
when we're all mixing the real and the
virtual but meanwhile we fake it you
know people use these kinds of
transparent screens we and our and our
colleagues we collaborate with sometimes
at the MIT Media Lab we've been doing
these things we just put the Giant you
know 45 degree piece of glass and so I'm
looking at you and we see stuff floating
between us and that looks pretty well
because you're actually focusing at the
right distance for a lot of things and
one of the things that's really changed
everybody's research is that Microsoft
ended up investing in this little
company and they just turned the depth
camera into a commodity item because
they were able to make tens of millions
of them and with custom ASIC chips and
so so now all of my students have at
least one of them I've got one at home
and one in the office and one here and
you just like they're like they're like
Eminem's you know they're just
everywhere so so we don't actually eat
most for most of our own research we
don't use their software we just you
know take the wrapper off when we just
use the depth camera run our own
software and they're wonderful they're a
little rough but there but they're cheap
and they're easy to get and you just
plug them into your computer and of
course there are people who've been
trying to bring this stuff for decades
they're the Steve man there's Thad and
they and the interesting thing is about
these these people is that is that you
need what they would need for this to
really work they need a kind of
consensus group you'd need it for it not
to be oh look I'm the person who's
wearing this stuff you'd need to have
some sociological context where we all
are and I think that it's so it's not a
question just of Technology it's a
question of how you get to the point
where that's the normative thing that's
just theater and so what is the utility
that makes us all stay of course I'm
wearing this thing and so there's
nothing strange about it at all now you
can make you could basically you could
i'm actually argue can actually make
something like this without having to go
all the way
to the babic parvis thing is basically
what's going on here is if you have some
tiny little thing that floats like
extends from the jawbone display all you
need is a little source of light because
in fact if you go down to the to the
nano scale we already can do things like
mirrors and prisms by basically just
doing things which are tens of
nanometers in ordinary materials and
then you can start bending light so this
is this is a this is a real item this
isn't conjectural this is this is a nano
scale a mirror basically if you take
light from the right direction in the
right frequency it will just bend it
refractor to reflect it I'm by using
we're using constructive ways and wave
interference which means you could have
something with a form factor like this
you could put nano scale gradings on a
contact lens and if you have something
that the right with the right frequency
of light coming from the right direction
some of that will deflect into your
retina and we did some we've done some
theoretical calculations and it should
work there's no reason why it shouldn't
work but there's a lot of engineering to
do so so these things are coming one way
or another and while they're coming then
what does it mean well one could argue
that the big question is if I'm walking
around seeing reality not just as it is
but as it could be there's a difference
between I'm holding up my smartphone and
going like this and I'm just looking at
you and these are huge differences I
mean of course there's the good stuff
you know the software that now runs on
the smartphone's that just translates
for you wouldn't it be great if I can
just be like traveling anywhere in the
world and I see if there's the exit side
there's the bathroom there's you know
there's your plane is leaving now kind
of stuff but there's also these other
issues which is we already know that I
can look at a random person and within
limits know right away who they are with
known technologies that you guys have
drawn bunch of and so then the question
is what what do we do about this um I'm
just gonna take a little moment here and
talk about these these issues so
everybody here every single person in
this audience with no exceptions right
now the technology easily exists for
somebody with very little specialized
knowledge to break into your home
steal all your stuff and take it all and
go and you can't stop them you don't
live inside of an order fortress yes you
have a lock on your door yes they'd have
to break your window but if they don't
care they don't care they'll just take
your stuff and yet people here are not
rushing home to protect their home like
I don't say I said that it was like
someone's like oh my god and they're
like rushing out the door and the reason
is because you know that's an unwell
understood security issue you know that
we have societally inside away set up a
whole bunch of stuff that we put into
place so that there are real costs to
that person even if they successfully
break lyrically successfully break the
window they take all the stuff and they
leave they might go to jail they're
going to their lives will be completely
ruined if they're caught there's a whole
bunch of thing stopping them that are
not technological so whatever see argue
that the issue that shows up here the
solutions cannot be technological
solutions have to be everybody gets
together and says what do we want as a
society because the people breaking in
will always be able to overpower the
people with the locks sooner or later
and it's not going to you can't make
inviolable locks so these issues and you
guys are actually very important
component of this these discussions have
to be very public and people have to be
talking about them so that we can figure
out what we all want so that we can go
keep moving ahead with our technology
without everybody looking over their
shoulder and mistrusting it subs a
little round hopefully I'm talking to
the right people um so so no no this
this kind of augmented reality if it has
all kinds of implications right now when
kids by social games together they're
all like looking at the same direction
they're all looking at a screen together
wouldn't it be great if they could be
looking at each other because studies
show that many studies show the kids
actually learn better when they're
directly interacting with each other
then when they're also sort of looking
at something else JK Rowling has said I
think one of the characters i think was
Hagrid said you know the future is very
devilish Lee difficult thing to predict
so we don't know what's going to happen
we do know that there are some
interesting changes and i'll get back to
this little air in my talk that for
example you know right now we live in a
world where there's stuff like this it
could
be in one future reality we walked into
him and we think we see this except each
of us have different favorite books and
actually this is really what's in the
room and accept that until we like we
both look at the same book and that
becomes the same book but maybe other
books you have your selection i have my
selection and we're going to find ways
of integrating the virtual into the real
now predictions notoriously can go wrong
in 1965 Western Electric had this
brilliant idea what we'll do is we'll
take the television I'll take the
telephone television two things people
really want right now I will put him
together one device and nobody bought it
it did died you know this was an actual
magazine ad for this incredible new
device and it went nowhere because they
were making they were right that people
kind of did want to see stuff on TV in
the same place so they wanted to talk to
people but they didn't have the
necessary technology that made that
possible which of course was the
mobility so once you're carrying the
television around in your pocket and the
telephone around in your pocket now it
starts to make sense that they become an
integrated device so it's really really
hard to predict these things because
something else will come in and change
the game and your prediction will be
completely wrong but all we can do is
keep trying things um just you know I
don't know when I was a kid everyone
thought the future is going to look like
this you know there you go they have a
capes and how many people remember this
kind of vision of the future like all
the older people raising their hands
right right of course I actually wanted
the future to look like this but that's
just me and and so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to show a few demos of
some of the ways that we're trying in
our lab at NYU and again we're also
collaborating with her oh she she and
some of his students MIT Media Lab that
we're trying to make some of this happen
without actually having the the waist
and I don't we'll see if this demo works
we had a lot of like technical issues so
this but I can for example go here and I
can start let's say you know draw
something but the objects are Joe could
be smart objects right so I could sort
of say let's let's make this into kind
of a 3d object and let you know give it
some physics or something and final
and and so we can't really do this but
we can start thinking about what would
it be like if we could do this and I
point out that everything I'm doing now
immediately would work over video
teleconferencing we just can't do it in
the physical space between us but I'm
interested in this because it means that
we could start thinking about how to I
mean the kind of stuff that you've been
thinking about for many years we can
then broaden the question of how do i
use the fact that I'm looking right at
you when you're looking around me and we
have these hands and we have these
bodies and we have this eye contact and
start rethinking interfaces so that the
augment what we'd really like to do
which is what people really want to do
is communicate with each other so let me
try it let me try another one let me see
if I can get this working I have no idea
if we're going to get this working okay
looks pretty good let's try okay it
looks like a cave drawing doesn't but of
course you of course now we have modern
technology so this is that like the
thing those people wanted to do thirty
one thousand years ago in those French
Kaiser we're in a hurry up Herzog talks
about it's like they really want to do
this that's so cool very attractive view
right exactly so it's just so much fun
that you have this space where you can
start doing things and what's nice about
this is that you can start you know you
can start answering questions like I
teach like mathematics concepts and
computer graphics and there's certain
concepts that it's actually kind of
difficult to get across and it's nice to
actually just have them right in the
space in front of you so for example i
can start drawing a shape in the air
here and like that and then i can say ok
great note that i can make that a real
cube i can actually move that and I
could start doing things like say well
this is just one example of a
topological space of shapes so this is a
regular regular polyhedron and it's got
a dual so we can actually create the
dual by actually just directly saying
okay we go from this to this and I can
to them about these kinds of
interactions between objects this
through interaction between a cube and
an octahedron and then I could show the
math somewhere else and I can start
building an entire lecture or if I
wanted to I don't know what say I want
to talk about how the eye works for
example this is so i could say here's a
you know here's an eyeball that creepy
whoever it looks at wins a prize and
then you could like you know pull it out
and start talking about like how the eye
works and and and you could imagine
building this into entire lectures about
about these concepts or for example
let's see what's a good one yeah suppose
I want to teach some physics I could say
great let's just um let's just make an
object in the air here make it a 3d
object and if we can start it has
behavior I can interact with this object
so for example let's just stop this
object and say now we know there's a
concept that the relationship between
that period of rotation and that and
that um length is a square a square root
relationship so if I make this for
example if I make this twice as long and
then I swing it it starts going at the
square root of two times slower and I
can directly show this to people and
start building mechanisms for people and
show those benefits so this is the kind
of thing I'd like to be able to while
I'm directly facing my students and
having a laboratory right here between
me and them um and you can really use if
you do it right you can actually use the
space between you so let's make you know
an object here and this could be like a
planet that comes right towards people
and I just love the idea that you have
this space between you and people that
you can work with I mean can I get rid
of this go away go away go away okay
okay um um so we have lots of examples
like this of trying to see what are
things feel like when you play with them
mechanisms physics making invisible
things visible like for example let's
try this one here let's see if i could
get this working there you go create
this
give a little spin so so now I've
created some kind of like virtual
mechanical object and I can take this
object and I could lift it up and I can
start doing stuff like like simulating
air flow for example toward this thing
and I'm running as just a very very
simple particle physics simulation but
now if I start changing the particles
and changing things about it I could
start giving much more interesting
lessons in fact I think I'm not sure if
this one works it might work this idea
of let's see if I can get this to work
so imagine you have a flow field and
this whole idea of making invisible
things visible see if I can see if this
works hold up some magnets I don't know
so there you go oh I can hear you you
can start creating the magnetic lines of
force between objects which is really
cool is it showing up it's a little it's
a little finicky there you go okay wait
yeah they're very weak magnets otherwise
the whole thing would be ah there you so
this idea that you could actually just
integrate physical objects in virtual
objects i find very appealing to the
whole thing and then we start thinking
about what can you do what are the
applications that become possible and
interesting and engaging and you can
interact and you get students interested
and stuff so so for example let's let's
try I make an object here and that
object can actually be an object with
its own a little bit of autonomy so you
know we could be sort of like you know
this is happy object um you know any and
accept that he's if there's nobody
around he gets really sad and then maybe
we just I don't know give him something
to look at mom look there's my finger
he's not he's not very smart
unfortunately he's kind of stupid object
so he knows as a finger but he's not
tracking it very well I'm very sorry but
anyway he gets he gets happy ending he
goes off somewhere Wow um um
so this these are these are all just
experiments in process to like say what
can we track what can me I mean so
example you can actually do some really
interesting things I could for example
say let's say I'm trying to teach
sorting algorithms now there's something
about sorting algorithms if you actually
see the objects move they get really
interesting so let's see if we get let's
just have an array array of objects here
we sort of give them some behavior and
now they're actually really responding
to my finger you know so wherever my
finger is these objects responding and
we can do things like say okay look I'm
going to start exchanging these things
and I'm i'm actually driving the steps
of the sorting exchange of staff so i
could do heap sorts and exchange sorts
and bubble sorts etc and I could get
these things happening automatically I
could get them having the response to me
but the point is that that people are
now really actively engaged in these
things because they see them happening
in front of you so we've given we've
made this challenge to our students to
ask them to try to make little lessons
using these things but the one rule are
using the system we're building the one
rule that we give them is that whatever
you do it has to be real time you're not
allowed to do any post production so
we've set up things like they can do
camera cutaways to a second camera view
because that's how you know if you're
getting news presentations but it has to
be live the system all the virtual
objects have to move in real time and
i'm going to i think i can show a little
video here of what some of the stuff
that some of our grad students came up
with see there it is hopefully this will
all just work
so the first one you're going to see is
a grad student from from MIT who's what
shall shall she's one of her oh she she
students and the second one you're going
to see is a grad student from NYU Murphy
Stein who's one of my students haha them
so let's see if we can drag this over to
the other screen here and hopefully this
will just work how do we depict the 3d
information from a globe onto a 2d map
one way of doing this is by drawing a
cylinder around the globe that centered
at the equator we project the globe onto
the cylinder and simply unroll the
cylinder to form the map this is called
the Mercator projection one useful thing
about the Mercator projection is that
straight lines on the map correspond to
great circles on the globe which made it
especially useful for navigators to plot
straight courses as they filled the
oceans topographic maps are a kind of
map that shows elevation let me show you
how
let's see this map in 3d and let's make
it bigger let's make it steeper and also
add more contour lines which correspond
to the steepness now let's crush it back
down and bring it back to a topographic
map and add color which can show the
absolute height which contour lines
alone can't do bring it back down now
let's rotate it towards you and now
let's fly over the region to see how the
colors and the contour lines change
together to show the shape of the region
cool huh so I want to talk now very
quickly and take you a little behind the
scenes of some of this stuff ok so this
is actually from my dad
obsessive-compulsive blog I keep very
often i I just post little programs that
i wrote that day and this gives you a
little sense of how some of the
underlying technology works this for
example is the actual system that the
little interactive fish that you saw
he's actually a sort of a wait he's
actually a software system that you can
use to this is all just java applets so
the wave this gets made these kinds of
stories is that we we have these hotkeys
you see the hot he's on the left there
um if I hit the the H key he's happy if
I hit the a key he opens his mouth if I
hit the O eagles and but what where our
goal is to be enabled ordinary untrained
people to be able to make their own
movies so so the way we do this is I can
start the timeline going and he can be
like looking at the ball and like you
know examining it and you know backing
up again and then looking at the second
one and maybe he's like really unhappy
because know the ball isn't bouncing and
then we can make the ball bounce maybe
could we make the ball bounce oh ho
let's go make the ball bounce and then
he's like really happy again and so
we're creating a movie as we do this and
so the goal of this research is to
create these really really simple
interfaces for people to like do their
own thing and then you know I don't know
and then maybe maybe they'd both stop
bouncing and it gets unhappy again
oh we're broke that one then we surprise
her and make it grow and now he's like
happy again forever come on be happy so
what we've just done is made a movie we
can go back now and we can we can replay
this movie and we can also edit this
movie so the goal here is to try to
create and a lot of this kind of like
let's quickly make a content and edit it
we think is a lot of the way people are
going to be presenting things in a way
that you you can think about what we
were doing with the augmented reality
system was creating a presentation
system for the future where you open up
the ability for people to use Smart
Objects and smart characters and by
creating really really smart interaction
devices we think that's actually
necessary in order to use the space
between us so there's going to be a
whole kind of authoring for these sorts
of things so as long as I have like
maybe five minutes left okay so let me
just quickly then talk about something
completely different as long as I'm here
and get rid of that and I want to talk
about at some point at some point I
realized that books are a problem two
thousand years ago Scrolls got replaced
by books but they did I chop them up
make codex's and you have the first
random access device how many people
knew that you know and so then suddenly
it be revolutionized technology because
you could actually have instant access
to technology but it's held us back
because ebook readers keep trying to
look like pages but they shouldn't look
like pages so I've been playing around
with ways of making books making ebooks
look more like what they're supposed to
be look like which is the original
intention of the author this is the
great gatsby that's the entire novel so
there is a screen full and there is I'm
reading through it and I can also go
through it anywhere and i'm using the
metadata of the of the chapter headings
to to figure out color and now this is
easy because Gatsby's most of you know
Gatsby is very small Gatsby is a tiny
novel it's only like a quarter of a
quarter of a million characters but I
thought would be really interesting to
take this idea of exploring a novel and
and do it with something a little more
ambitious so let
do it with pride and prejudice which is
actually three quarters of a million
bytes and so there you go so this is all
of Pride and Prejudice I'm here and as
you can see we can we can wander around
in it we can you know move our cursor
and see it I had 61 chapters I'm sure
some of you knew that and but we can
also ask questions of it which are
really interesting is for seeing the
whole novel in one screen and that means
that we can start having a community of
readers and scholars and commenters who
have a geography just like you can talk
about Google Maps because you're all
looking at the same geography of
California or the United States so you
can say where does Elizabeth benefit
then at the main characters well she
shows up everywhere of course because
those are individual words of the novel
because she's the main character so of
course she has a fairly random
distribution everywhere but what about
her object of desire mr. Darcy well he
he comes and flows like he's supposed to
because he's the elusive mr. Darcy and
you can actually see Jane Austen's
method here by making mr. Darcy
disappear for long sections of the novel
and then throwing him back and then what
about the where they're supposed to end
up which is Pemberley where they're
going to live happily ever after his big
estate well I thought when I first read
this it was everywhere turns out it's
only mentioned very briefly here then
hardly at all and them is a big cluster
right around here but why write it
around here it's because if you actually
look at Elizabeth and mr. Darcy they
show up everywhere in the books right
here right in the middle chapter 35 this
is long stretch where neither of them
show up at all why didn't either of them
show up in the very dead so the middle
of book a book which is about them well
it's because that's where how many
people know Pride and Prejudice by the
way I gave this talk to a bunch of high
school students and almost everyone
raised their hands so there's a
generational thing and so he and neither
i'm showing it well mr. Darcy seems to
show up here but it turns out it's
actually a father suicide him this is
the letter that mr. Darcy rights to
Elizabeth that actually makes her
realize for the first time who he really
assoc she's going to start falling in
love with him which is why she agrees to
go visit his estate so you actually see
that just by looking at these things if
you look if you look at the the texture
of these things you can see immediately
where there's dialogue where there's
xsplit going packages and I it passages
and I'm real
interested in people being able to just
let go of the old-fashioned book and
think of a narrative as something you
can visualize directly because you guys
of anyone in the world are the people
who are going to be able to then fill
this with the interesting information
and matching of semantic information
that makes these maps really really
relevant to people in a way that old Mia
simply couldn't so I'm going to stop
there and open it for questions Thank
You wide-ranging and and the demo God's
clearly we're playing with us in advance
but they decided to smile on you after
all my language yeah the reality so we
have about five minutes for question the
mic to anybody who would like to ask
question so that we get it on the video
anybody when I see your demo right now
the obvious thing that seems like you
guys should be doing is clear board with
a connect is that how you're going in
your future yeah well clear board is
clearly an inspiration and one of the
reasons that I'm working with her oh she
is that of course we know we share this
interest in you know you see the mirror
view of the other person etc um we're
deliberately pulling back right now and
starting with presentation tools because
our current research is to figure out
what gesture is a person makes would be
most expressive to another person so
we're starting with the more asymmetric
and then as we understand the vocabulary
we're going to gradually make it more
symmetrical we want to end up with a
perfectly symmetric interaction scenario
but that's so that's that's where we're
going and hopefully after a few years
yeah anybody else
the question is could you do this with
websites as well as with books because
they often have like ads around the
outside instructor it seems to me that I
mean I was particularly interested in
recovering the structure of linear
narratives but it seems to me that what
I'm really trying to do here is what if
you have some amount of information and
it's a relatively stable piece of
information that's the key is that New
Jersey is not going to move west of
Colorado and that's why the whole
overlaying map you know GIS works
because the earth stays where it is
pretty much and so novels are
interesting examples of repositories of
knowledge it's not so much that they're
linear but that they're stable because
then we can start building meaning
overlaying you know the visible human
you know kind of stuff on top of them so
I think to the extent that thing's
actually form stable geographies this
kind of stuff becomes directly
applicable if they're forming unstable
geographies with a lot of plate
tectonics going on in that website then
you probably have to mark up all of
those commentaries and metadata so that
they start moving around with them which
is I think a much harder problem okay
good take nobody's any questions I have
a question I was thinking as you were
doing your demo this time have you
talked to the Khan Academy about whether
or any of the people doing like the
online you know MIT OpenCourseWare any
people who are trying to teach things
online it seems like they could use your
system right away talk to Peter Norvig
soon yes yes that's who that's right
he's doing that yeah i thought i would
give you guys for a shot before going to
sell car all right generous of you okay
great well thanks very much okay thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
