triple is and it is my great pleasure
tonight to be able to introduce Larry
Page with whom I've been acquainted for
at least a little while and it's been an
interesting experience larry was
Google's founding chief executive
officer he grew the company to more than
200 employees and profitability before
moving on to his role as the president
for products in April 2001 he continues
to share the responsibility for Google's
day-to-day operations with Eric Schmidt
and Sergey Brin
he is the son of Michigan State
University computer science professor
dr. Carl Victor paid his love of
computers began at age six he at one
point when he was in college built an
inkjet printer out of Lego bricks he he
earned a Bachelor of Science degree in
engineering I think maybe his thesis was
that Lego printer and while he was in
the ph.d program in computer science at
Stanford University he met Sergey Brin
and together they developed and ran
Google it began operating in 1998 and as
everybody knows the rest is history I
told Larry that the last time I used
Google was at 6 o'clock last night when
I was collecting pictures of my mentors
to use in my presidential address they
all came from from Google Larry in 2002
was named a World Economic Forum global
leader for tomorrow he's a member of the
National Advisory Committee of the
University of Michigan College of
Engineering
together with co-founder Sergey Brin he
was honored with the Marconi Prize in
2004 he's a trustee on the board of the
XPrize and he was elected to the
National Academy of Engineering in 2004
I suspect one of the youngest people
ever to have achieved that particular
honor so it is a great pleasure to give
you Larry Page he will by the way be
taking
questions at the end of his remarks so
those of you who have questions for
Larry we'll have microphones and you can
line up at the microphones and and take
your shot Larry Page
hopefully this work well welcome and
it's a great pleasure to be here
hi hi I was just talking with my
communications person Elliot's here and
said his father always enjoyed coming to
us and I thought you know I wish my
father had enjoyed coming to us I'm sure
he would have really loved it based on
all that I've seen but alas he didn't
and you would have brought me to
actually know his very dear to my heart
to be here I don't give very many kinds
of things like this and I guess I
couldn't say no science and technology
was in San Francisco
and it seemed like it'd be a lot of fun
to come here and also to see all the
other really interesting talks that were
going on and it took me a while actually
I was trying to think about you know
what won't be really important to say to
this audience and you know I guess for
me science engineering technologies sort
of all been interrelated and really
really important and thinking about it I
feel like we have an amazing set of
problems in science technology and what
that really means is we have an amazing
set of opportunities and I think I'll
show you my first slide so I sense my
talk notes to a great person we have a
Google Hal Varian he's the famous
economist at Berkeley and he sent me
back this single picture and I was so so
a good summary of my whole talk that I
want to show it first and basically you
see you know for a thousand years BC and
so on up to now and it's basically the
income per person and you can see
there's one big change right that
happens right around the Industrial
Revolution you know and it's still in
fact going straight up and there's
basically nothing you can ascribe this
to technology and the quote from how
actually was virtually all economic
growth was due to technological progress
and you know I'm not a betting man but
if I was to bet I would probably bet
that now continues to be the case going
forward that virtually all the
Risa's and growth that we had would be
awesome due to technological progress
and I guess being very simple I thought
well of Google you know in fact I I
realized you know Google would have been
possible actually even probably a few
years before we started Google it wasn't
really possible to have computers fast
enough to index that much text you know
Moore's Law had been steadily going on
and doubling every 18 months and it was
actually you know cheap enough and we
could afford to buy computers to do it
and so on and you just think about that
you know something we take for granted
is now as you know typing in a few words
and searching billions and billions of
things and getting them back in a tenth
of a second or so and that was
impossible before these curves and so I
think as a society we're not really
paying attention so that's and I think
you know the question for all of us is
how do we how do we really work on this
how do we get our our policies in place
and how do we get people working on the
right things so now I'm not very good at
companies and business things like that
but I've been pretty lucky and I think I
know I spend a lot of time coming up
with the name Google and you know we
thought about it Lots and so on and I
can tell the science has a serious
marketing problem I'm really sure of
that and you know if you have basically
all the growth that's happened in the
world is to science or technology or
whatever you want to call it and nobody
really pays attention to you then you
have a serious marketing problem so I
think I have a simple analysis of those
two one is that virtually none of the
marketers in the world work for science
so there are lots of people who
specialize in marketing and as far as I
can tell none of them work for you all
right
or anybody related to you guys so okay I
don't want to dwell on problems though
so now this could be actually at
Stanford where I once school for grad
school actually looks very much like
parts of Stanford
and I don't but it's clearly you know an
engineering kind of place
but I don't want to spend too much time
I promise before I let me just summarize
some of the good things I'm going to say
and then I'll go back to problems so I
think there's huge huge opportunities in
science I mean talk about people taking
more power roles in society about taking
bigger challenges and bigger
opportunities about communications
strategies in general about changing the
world and then that leading to
engineering and that sounds premiership
and then the business and then repeat
that and add more money and just keep
going about education and making more
people like all of you but before I do
that I'll talk about problems so oops
actually I don't want to do that yes so
some of the bad things about science
I've been through some of this you know
I'm a PhD not quite finished yet as
Stanford likes to say and I think there
is you know for gender racial national
origin diversity in many parts of
science it's not uniform some fields are
very good some fields are very bad
which I think makes less fun for people
to be in a lot of those fields it also
makes I think the fields less creative
there's science being done for funding
and I was where a lot of this computer
science and I had a simple algorithm
which was wherever you see puppy need
researchers instead of grad students
that's not where you want to be doing
research and the funders can never
figure this out I couldn't quite
understand it but grad students who
aren't being paid you know usually pick
interesting things to work on otherwise
you know they would go get a job and
have a good time so there's long long
education before earning salary and
somebody when I was preparing to send me
a Simpsons clip of Bart Simpson making
fun of oh god soon for earning $600 a
month and cut off his ponytail and you
know that is an issue you know less fun
at parties sometimes less personal
interaction and hard work and
there's a fewer celebrity scientists
right there aren't that many and now
some of the bad things aren't true for
instance I think you really have the
opportunity when you're in science
technology to really have huge impacts
and like a schools an example of that
there are many many other things you
have huge leverage just for
understanding the world butter and you
know really how to change it and so on
and scientific thinking really hugely
benefits most jobs and we've really seen
that in our company we try really hard
to hire a lot of scientific and
technology or nyan people even in
positions they wouldn't normally be in
I'll talk more about that and scientists
are really great citizens I think is
really important to have them in the
world and critical thinking in society
now and it really helps you with blue
blobs understanding them you know there
are a few scientists and engineers in
the world so I just wanted to show some
brief stats but anyway they're not that
many people it depends how you count and
who's choosing the stats and so on and
there's even fewer that are really in
charge of the country and I pulled out
some important leaders and there's a few
more these are ones with graduate
degrees and so on
but there aren't that many such folks
and you know many of you probably
realize that but hadn't necessarily
thought about it this is President of
India who was the rocket scientist and
actually he also understands all the
encoding of the Indian languages on the
web which is not something as normal for
a world leader and I think you know you
really you really want to have people
and power who understand things and
that's basically right and I wanted to
show this this is pretty good thing out
really you have no you have to write
this in less technical terms for me make
it even less technical for my boss even
like technical for our VP even less for
our EVP even less for our CEO and
compared to all other technologies
there's a big difference in the mouth
area this is kind of how countries work
I think with regards to technology and I
don't think it's generally good thing
since that's where all of the economic
growths coming from and all the changes
in people's lives and all those things
and uh it was actually amazing to me so
we're you know Google's and technology
industry and some point we decided we
should hire a CEO and we we embarked on
a long search and we were actually more
than a year probably search for somebody
we have some basic criteria like we
wanted them to understand computer
science so we figured you know that's
what we do we program them and you know
produce software and that's the main
thing that we do and that turned out to
be very very difficult we primarily
hired one of the only guys who had a PhD
in computer science was Eric Schmidt and
just think if you're a CEO you know high
tech executive and you're the only one
who meets the qualifications that's
great right so I'm encouraging all of
you take it to God and do that in Eric's
a great guy of course there's not he's
been absolutely wonderful but it's
amazing how few people in positions of
power have or a deep sort of technical
or scientific background and I have a
theory about this too one is that
basically has to do with meanings and we
try actually very hard to get our
engineers to come to meetings so Google
and they never do they just refuse they
sort of run screaming back to their
computers and hash that's true for me to
some extent too I really don't like
going to meetings but I've fought it so
now I've sort of overcome that that
issue and I can do that and it's very
important still its house and one of the
other things we do actually is we
actually try to automate a lot of our
meetings away with software and so we
have simple kinds of reporting and
things you would typically do with
meetings that we
a program emails even so what did you do
locks last week and then an email is it
to everybody in the group for a little
picture of you house so you can feel
like you're connected to everyone so um
but in case I think it's really
important to take positions of power
it's really to move along and help the
world and the other nice thing about
this is that science funding you know
depending on how you count in the u.s.
maybe 1 or 2 percent of GDP which is
pretty small compared to other things
and you imagine if that's really causing
all the economic growth you know maybe
if that was ten percent maybe you'd have
ten times the growth right or maybe
you'd have even more because it's really
sort of an exponential kind of thing and
so you know that would have a really big
impact and you know presumably that's
possible so I didn't heard you too all
the control funding at the highest
levels rather than funding for all the
scraps easy for me to say so this is the
1999 Google super-sized American logo
and you notice it's bigger than the
current logo we have a wider and what I
wanted to talk about here was really
working on non incremental work and I I
guess I started working on I just
thought I'd talk to history really fast
the research at Google I started working
on downloading the web and my advisor
thought was a good idea to download all
the links on the web and sort of analyze
them and we weren't sure exactly what to
do we thought it'd be fun to reverse
them all which had been done in other
hypertext systems and we thought that
would be a interesting thing to do and
the links were pretty small and we'd be
able to keep them on a small number of
computers and so on and I thought this
would take me a week well that was kind
of optimistic and my advisor Terry kind
of laughed at me so yeah I'm sure it'll
take you a week and you know a few years
later we had a pretty good structure of
the web with maybe 30 million pages and
300 million links or something like that
and then we realized well actually if
you want to allow people to annotate
things
it would actually be useful to be able
to rank those annotations and so we have
the only thing we have latex inside of
desperation we invented a way to rank
things and that's where a PageRank came
and then we realized well actually
annotations were that useful search was
the main application and we should use
page rank to rank web pages for search
and it was completely random it's a
great example of pure research and the
reasons why you want to do it no I was
really struck actually by Steve twos
talk who you stick around you'll see him
tomorrow night's giving a talk and he
actually had a very similar story you
know he's his story which I don't know
he's gonna probably tell a different
story
tomorrow night's you should ask him
questions about this but he basically
didn't know what he was doing he was
sort of failed grad student gave this
wonderful talk to the Hertz fellows that
I saw and he said I didn't know what to
do so I decided I would get really good
at building lasers I wasn't really sure
why but I thought it'd be useful and you
know this eventually ended up with him
getting a Nobel Prize and it totally
also not obviously but the key thing was
that but what the common thread I think
in those two examples is rihanna's set
of links that nobody else in the world
had we have the link structure of the
web and we have pretty good techniques
for processing you Steve had a razor you
know tunable lasers that almost nobody
else had and he understood how to use
them in ways that other people didn't
when you have things like that when you
have some basic technologies you find
interesting things to do with them right
and those things you know if you're
lucky really turn it's something big now
I think the other thing to keep in mind
is really a few people try to do
groundbreaking things and we mentioned
the XPrize in the introduction I was
amazed you know the oh I met the XPrize
guys and they've been working for I
don't know 10 years or something like
that to get people interested in space
the family startups money and they got
surprised established and they finally
got you know how much teams compete on
it and then once they did all this they
got this successful slice here they had
you know billions of media impressions
and a huge amounts of interest and
there's people now working on commercial
space plate and you know the main thing
that happened was there's one guy who
really convinced everybody just about 10
years convincing everybody that was
possible and that was the hard part
it wasn't so much once people believe
it's possible of course possible because
you know we can do a lot of things that
you think they're possible so I think
that's one important thing to focus on
is trying to get people to think things
are possible and the way you do that I
think is you start with the media that's
really where you know most people are
paying attention to the media so that's
an obvious place to start I think I was
just going to use the example of CSI
alright how many people have watched CSI
well this is pressingly a low number you
should watch it it's pretty good show
but it's I think probably will have more
kind seen you in sort of investigators
than we ever need because of that show I
assume I don't know ever researched it
but one surprised me and it's amazing
the things the media that can really
have an impact on and I think the other
good examples I mean who would have
thought a former presidential candidate
would start a TV station which is based
right here in San Francisco's Al Gore's
current TV and he's really trying to
make a difference in that space and get
higher class things into the media I had
some specific suggestions though it's
just I thought it would be good to
encourage engagement by sort of I don't
know want to use tenure and grants money
based up partially on media impacts of
thing
my mother's very there's not a suspicion
in science about you know well the
science is spending all this time
talking to the press whatever but you
know if nobody cares about what you do
it's not a great thing and you're not
gonna get some resources and support and
so on it's really important thing I've
seen some great programs to fund
scientists journalists especially
students so you know we can fund a few
students for not very much money and
have them work at a media organization
and write articles and when that's
happens there's been tremendously better
coverage of those topics you know the
media organizations love it because they
don't have to do the work them right and
they're they're desperate to get stuff
so yeah I guess yes triple-s has a great
program for a policy support for
students where they can go to Washington
and help with public policy awesome I
think those things are really important
those things are probably you know a
thousand times the leverage of the other
things that happened because of the
effect they have on the world now let me
just switch to just talk about changing
the world so when I was about 12 I
decided I want to be an inventor and
somebody gave me an autobiography of
Tesla and you know who's this great
inventor of a electric power and all
sorts of things and then I read his
autobiography and you know I just got
cried at the end because he's basically
a failure
he couldn't fund his research many of
the things great things he invented
maybe people don't even know what they
are today and so on and you know as
always struggling to commercialize this
stuff to really get it out into the
world I said I don't want to be like
Tesla I want to have an easy time
getting things out in the world and make
a real impact and I think for that you
know you do need some integration with
business and engineering and the other
areas as scientists know one of those is
I think science and engineering I don't
really separate them because I feel that
you know you really want to get your
scientific works out there you want
people to understand what to do and the
engineers are the people who do that
yeah you know there should be some mixed
and actually my unfilled computer
science there actually is no computer
science it's only a computer engineering
match the computer engineering something
different all right that means you build
hardware
computer science means you
Engineering on software and there is no
computer science there's no such field I
wish I think it's kind of interesting
it's really computer sciences computer
engineering and computer engineering is
something else so and maybe that's
because it's a newer set of fields and
you're so there's maybe it's not a real
science who knows but anyway I think
it's really important to get
entrepreneurship better involved in
universities and and I was lucky enough
to spend time at Stanford which is
probably the best example in a spent
time in Michigan which is not terrible
but more normal example of how to do
this so no one tells the story quickly
about how Silicon Valley started cuz I
think it's pretty instructive so this is
a chairman at Stanford who basically had
a thousand dollars great local jobs so
we gave him a thousand dollars and he
decided Hewlett and Packard should start
a company and that's Hewlett and Packard
also Unterman and in 1938 they started
up HP based on that and this thing the
whole Silicon Valley really flows from
that you know and from that all these
companies flow directly from Stanford
and the whole valley and I think I also
convinced Shockley who's the inventor of
the transistor has come back and to come
back to Silicon Valley and start a small
company Fairchild which then spun in
that basically directly about to Intel
she's still around today of course and
important now how that came from $1000
in one professor and arguably office
looking valley really came out of that
and all the technology and wealth and
all that associated with that you know
the thing that I really benefited from
at Stanford was that whole culture of
people so there's tons of people who are
very very smart who have had successful
companies who you know had management
positions who been great scientists and
dropouts from Stanford and so on which
most of the companies represented there
and those people actually allowed was
gone that staffer or they fund research
there they found interesting projects
and that that full cycle is an amazing
cycle and it's really what makes the
valley here great I think a lot of
academic scientists really miss that you
know a lot of the research being funded
by kind of strange mechanisms here which
is great it's really a really good thing
so I think you really want to have these
cycles in many other places and I don't
think you know are we how determined but
any of you could go do this and it was
you know fair amount in 1938 but not
that much money right and so it's really
it's not that hard to do this you need
to have the right attitude about it and
you need to think the business and
entrepreneurship are going to be good
things and important parts of science so
I'll just give a quick example of this
this is a SpaceX rocket and I'm good
friend
Elon Musk who's a internet entrepreneur
successful who decided he really wanted
to colonize Mars and the only way to do
that is to make shoot brackets and so he
has his own rocket company and he's got
a whole bunch of contracts now to sell
sold satellite launches to the
government he hasn't quite he launched
one Rock and it didn't quite go up all
the way but he will soon and I think
there's there's a lot of activity in
these pieces as people really got
involved in entrepreneurship in the
technology that and he's hired a lot of
great scientists who are working
incredibly hard on making this real
so education well primary education is
clear problem in science I mean I don't
have to tell you guys that and I have a
radical proposal though is I think
universities should take it over
so now I'm not exactly sure how to do
that but I just feel like universities
are pretty good and secondary schools
aren't and so anyway but anyway if I was
in charge that's what I would do and I
think also there's a lot of opportunity
to education sort of engineer when this
is probably typical situation now that
was really my school experience in early
school and I think that you should
really I think there's a lot of ability
to really use technology and to engineer
better and more efficient ways of doing
education and it just seems like we have
better tools than we did you know when
we designed our current education system
you know when I was at Stanford I
watched all the lectures on video tables
then I don't have to go to class there's
a lot more convenient right before the
exam I could watch the whole semesters
worth of lectures in about a day and a
half and it worked great and I mean I
don't think those things are that hard
how hard is it to do those things that
was not and some of the best classes I
took at Michigan had 600 students
chemistry organic chemistry for example
it was designed for that many students
and they had TAS and so on but they had
the world's greatest professor as a
result it was a great experience that
could have been just as easily ten
thousand students and so there's gotta
be ways to do these things better know
hi gave a keynote probably two years ago
at first which is an amazing amazing
thing started by Dean Kaman where they
take that's something like thirty
thousands of the finals in Georgia Dome
they got too big for Epcot Center and
they moved to the Georgia Dome they have
like 30,000 kids or something like that
in you know building a robots and
competing and you know you talk to these
kids a lot of them are inner-city kids
and so are they have some stats here
about the fact that has of them this
amazing effect on these kids they really
you talk to these kids they want to go
to engineering school they have a whole
new outlook on life and it's done at a
mass scale right it's done all through
donations and goodwill many many people
so there's gotta be other models that we
can use and you know if we're fighting
about evolution or obviously something's
really wrong right okay so let's get
some fun parts so let's talk about
solving some worldwide problems how do
we get people motivated about science
and technology
well I think we want to basically
improve our lot in life by doing really
great things but I think's the matter a
lot and one I think the most obvious one
is transportation and I'll talk a little
bit more about sustainability and energy
and so on
the transportation is a huge use of
people's time of you of the energy in
the world and we basically haven't had
any new systems since a hundred years
ago right we don't have the only
computer that's used in transportation
is an elevator right this is the only
form of transportation that I've seen
that really uses computers you can push
the button it takes you there right you
know planes can do that but they're not
we don't allow them to do that we Stella
pilots most planes can land themselves
now the big ones but of course we
wouldn't want that to happen so I think
this is really obvious one I think
there's tons of things we could do I was
lucky enough to be at the the grant the
DARPA Grand Challenge for the Stanley
this is the Stanford car won by driving
autonomously sort of all day through the
desert and up and down mountains and
things like that so people thought would
never be possible and one I've got 10
million dollars or something like that
and
the guys who do this you know they're
really excited about doing automated
cars and there's a tremendous amount
that they can do I'll just give you some
stats 40,000 people in the US die every
year of auto related accidents now I'm
pretty sure computers were gotten even
Stanley type computers that number would
be a lot lower you know maybe it's a
hundred maybe it's ten right it's a lot
lower and it's not it's not that far
away and I know also there's probably
only a hundred people in the world that
are working on them it's that right I
don't think so I think that's a
tremendous opportunity if you've ever
been spending any time in the developing
world you know that roads are really a
disaster
right there aren't really any roads and
your average speed is probably 10 or 15
miles an hour yeah it's a big issue yeah
you know we're of course two-star roads
here they actually take a lot of
resources to make and maintain that plan
right there which is not particularly
high technology you can go faster than
your car apart goes about 90 miles an
hour and it also goes points point with
no road and it uses actually less fuel
than your car does per mile and so I'm
not so sure that we should be building
roads you know you can argue about
safety and things like that but
computers are pretty good and technology
is pretty good and at some point we'll
be able to make that really safe and I
don't think it's that hard either but I
don't think there's anybody working on
them for very few people one of my
favorite things is artificial
intelligence and I think it's it's kind
of a very bad rap and actually my dad
was very interested in artificial
intelligence and in the the time they
were doing it at Stanford in other
places they had you know the equivalent
of a Commodore 64 and they thought
they're gonna do artificial intelligence
and now your your phone is a hundred
times more powerful than the computers
to help and now we can't even store a
decent photo you know a Commodore 64
we don't wonder why it's not smart right
and so I think there's a lot to be said
for basic amounts of computation there's
a lot of people who agree with me on
this a lot of people who don't but my
prediction is that when AI happens it's
going to be a lot of computation and
that's so much cleverer blackboard
whiteboard kind of stuff clever
algorithms but just a lot of computation
and my theory is that if you look at
your programming your DNA is about 600
megabytes compressed so smaller than any
modern opera is smaller than Linux or
Windows or anything like that your whole
operating that includes booting up your
brain right high definition and so your
program algorithms probably aren't that
complicated it's probably more about the
overall computation but that's my guess
we have some people at Google who are
really trying to build artificial
intelligence and to do it in a large
scale and so on and in fact to make
search better we really need to make you
know to do a perfect job of search you
could ask any query it would give you
the perfect answer and that would be
artificial intelligence right based on
everything being on the web which is
pretty close approximation so I think
we're lucky enough to be working
incrementally closer a lot but again
very very few people are working on this
and I don't think it's that far off
because people think no climate change
of course huge huge issue now I think
one of the big concerns I have is we're
not doing good job modeling and
understanding climate change and that's
really a really important area and I
think you know there's recent press from
this conference on that just today which
is the main amazing C but I asked
thinking would be nice to be able to
modify with climates and one of my
heroes was heroes who's Paul MacCready
who invented this he built this human
powered play and the fuel cost the
English Channel how many of you probably
don't know but his career started in
climate modification
and in fact in seeding the clouds that
was his first company was designed to
see clouds and if you ask him about it
it's no it's very easy to see clouds we
could do a pretty good job who we could
never get around the lawyers so a lot of
things are possible right and I'm
worried as we get into real serious
potential issues the climate changed
there gonna be enough people who want to
act that we're gonna act in some ways
and we're not going to really understand
what they are we might as well get going
on that now and I don't think very many
people working on that either
no let's give you another quick example
google books we actually wanted to
digitize Stanford's library when we are
at Stanford and there's actually a
digital library project there and we
tried to convince people and they they
just didn't think it was really possible
or made sounds and so on and actually we
spent probably five years trying to
convince people that it was possible and
a good idea but mostly that it was
possible and then once we convinced
maybe two or three crazy people that it
was possible you know it's basically
happening
yeah we just made like a 1 million we're
gonna digitize it or another million
books at Princeton and it's sort of
routine now or which is a great thing
but it shows you know how hard it is to
get people going on things that you know
they think maybe aren't that possibly
all right so developing world I've had a
lot of interests there I've been trying
to take all of my long vacations now in
the developing world I encourage you all
to do that too there's a lot of really
interesting places to go there's good
science be done and there's experiences
that you won't have anywhere else and I
think you know the u.s. also has a
marketing problem not just science I
don't know if you've noticed recently
but if you travel around the world
people aren't real happy with us and you
know we're spending a lot on our own
security and things like that but I
think we should spend a lot more on
making friends and
and you know that's especially in the
Middle East in Africa yeah that's where
and there's a lot of things to be done
you know there's issues of clean water
which there's lots of technological and
social and different kinds of issues
there's medicine I was at health which
there's been more progress being made on
recently which is great to see some of
our pharmaceuticals being used that's
certainly gonna cause a lot of goodwill
in the world and food and of course the
scientific version of food has
represented here and as soon this is
genetically modified and lost
communications which actually had a big
impact a lot of these places I was just
in in rural Ghana and you know half the
people there had cell phones which is
pretty amazing you know it's not that
prosperous place but you know it's
important type of communications it's
pretty easy to do these days and of
course poverty yeah I don't know what
all the answers are to these things but
I do know that if you looked at that
curve at the beginning of the graph
about how you know we moved everyone
away from farming and basic sustenance
it was through technology and there's a
lot of technologies that can go into
these places to try to same as the ones
we have here how which can work great
which need all of you to do it we've
been trying to do trying to do this
through google.org and we were lucky
enough whom we went public we put about
1% of our resources
it's a google.org 1% of our stock and 1%
of our time and so on and you know
that's now more than a billion dollars
now in there to be used and you know
we're trying hard to figure out what to
do with it what kind of projects to do
and so on and mostly the thing kinds of
things I just mentioned but we realized
that's really a small amount compared to
what cuts pencil ready and it's not not
clear where you spend it I mean you
actually need good projects and there
are very few people doing these things
so great period opportunities there to
make new friends and to have a huge
impact now
energy environment climates I mean this
is been a huge issue everywhere we go
and it's definitely real I just wanted
to give you some quick fun figures on
this so there's been a lot of talk about
nuclear reactors okay and uh my favorite
statistic is that in Nevada or say some
part of the US or the world that has a
lot of solar radiation the amount of
solar energy that you got per square
mile is 800 megawatts average so over
the whole year day and nights if you
take a square mile Nevada and you cordon
it off you measure the heat energy
that's from the Sun that's 800 megawatts
know you might wonder how big a nuclear
actor is well big ones are a couple
gigawatts and you know I haven't
measured one on Google Earth whatever
but I assume with security and cooling
towel you know cooling ponds and you
know big cooling towers like those they
take a couple square miles so for an
average new killer actor the energy that
hits it from the Sun it's the same
amount that it produces so I'm not sure
this is the best answer for how to
produce energy given all the other
issues
now I hear muted applause but I'm a big
fan of Soler's I'll go through that
quickly so how this is in Southern
California this is a pretty simple
design solar thermal installation and I
think it's 10 megawatts or so it's
pretty small and you know basically just
heats things so he this case it eats oil
in this pipe in the middle from the
parabolic reflector yeah you know this
thing is expensive it's maybe five times
too expensive right now they haven't
really cost reduced it yeah you know I
don't think making a steam from sunlight
is that hard and that's what nuclear
actors do they well they make steam from
nuclear action but you know you can just
easily make the steam from anything else
there are lots of cool designs for this
and again you know there's hundreds of
people working on this not thousands or
10,000 and there hasn't been that much
work done to cost reduce so I'm pretty
optimistic that you'll see and venture
capitalists are starting to fund these
kinds of things we're trying to fund a
few small things that we see that are
interesting but I'm very optimistic
about this and I think our goal should
be once per kilowatt hour electricity
and the reason for that is that then
there's no economic argument
oh we're gonna ruin our economy
switching away from coal which is the
argument China makes because well we can
make a whole heck of a lot more money
selling energy at $0.01 kilowatt hour we
can make a whole lot more stuff we can
have really a big warm swimming pools
that are really cheap so wind of course
is another huge huge I didn't mention I
should back off just for a second I
didn't mention the fault of the tank
things - there's lots of cool things
there and there's lots of interesting
approaches and I think there's a lot of
promise there the front of a tank you
know there's people there's a research
group at MIT that's targeting 50%
efficiency for solar cells and they have
a pretty good plan to do it and the
issue was costs but still the efficiency
is amazing that means you know what
twice the area of your nuclear reactor
you could generate C Mon energy is that
nuclear reactor so you're talking about
six square miles there goes your nuclear
reactor not a lot of space right so we
can figure out a way to make those
things cheap the impacts will be
tremendous just absolutely gigantic
um wind of course is already cheap in
fact the cost to wind energy is already
competitive with coal if you didn't care
when it was generated now the problem of
course it's not windy all the time in
the right you know all the places so the
real cost to wind is more like three
times what the actual cost you were pay
for it is so it's maybe nine cents a
kilowatt hour instead of three which is
what no cost if you're generating it all
the time I'm sorry that's not I didn't
say that right if you're buying wind
energy you'll pay one-third as much for
it because of the variability so the
cost of generating it is only about
three cents so the issue with wind is
distribution and there's been some
studies done if you had wide scale
distribution and I'm talking about all
the way from northern Africa and Morocco
all the way up to northern Europe you
had a good electric grid that connected
those know you could get eighty percent
of Europe's energy and Africa northern
Africa's energy from winds with no
oversubscription something's would be
competitive with coal right now now are
we gonna build that grid I don't know I
doubt it's it's probably a good idea to
do that and that's you know the grid
stuff is amazingly antiquated there's no
power electronics and it's no it's I
think there's a lot of opportunity to
improve grid functioning we're gonna
need that as we bring these new kinds of
energy online that have different kinds
of variability now I want to end with
this image and one other area of high
leverage that I see is scientific
publishing yeah we've been trying to
help out with Google Scholar and Google
Books and things like that and try to
get more of scientific information into
the real public use but every time you
know Google search happens which is
pretty often I'm pretty pains and the
reason is that probably most of the work
that you guys all have done is not
represented in those searches right we
don't have access to it or it's indexed
recently you know I've been doing
research for this talk I got a lot of
results when I got to like I Triple E
firewall or something like that and I
you know
I have plenty of money and I didn't buy
the articles because it sucks a lot you
know I went off and searched for free
ones and so on and we got to make that
process easier we gotta unlock the
wealth of scientific knowledge and get
it to everybody on the Internet
and there's great proposals in those
areas to you know do the time-lapse and
all these kind of things I don't really
care what we all do but we should do
something if the current situation is
not good no
so in closing you know I want to talk
about most of the kite ride to give you
just a flavor of some of the examples I
see where there's big opportunities and
most of those things the same thing we
do at Google is we try to get people
working on these things and it's usually
small teams right these are ten thousand
person efforts right usually like a
small core team of like 10 people is
really what makes it happen and so it's
not a big cost either you know you can
have a really big impact it's really fun
to be one of those ten people right and
so I don't know anywhere there's a
hundred more areas love to talk about of
time but I will take questions then
thank you
we have two microphones in these two
central aisles and I would suggest that
people who want to ask questions line up
behind the two microphones and we'll
just alternate between them so the first
question would be the gentleman here
thank you so very much I've been
following Google in fact I met you guys
at a conference I think in 98 was
interesting but with google.org do you
have a procedure for submitting
proposals do you have a mechanism so
that I'm seriously serious so that when
people have an idea about developing a
technology somewhere in the world you
might have a platform is I just kind of
curious yes but I mean there's actually
a procedure already in place yeah I
think there is it's tough for us this is
a really small team so honestly I've
been trying to get them to focus mostly
on hiring more people because you know
it's like probably less than 20 people
still so their ability to deal with the
whole world is limited just to be honest
let's take the microphone over here
Google the company sponsor or give space
to a lot of Google time for me to see a
number of groups meet there yeah thank
you for that but can you encourage other
companies a lot of them are really tight
about it I mean IBM who have been very
nice thank you great good luck to you
with all the projects with your
perspective because those weren't all my
projects Wow
ones you're interested in with your
perspective you have a very unique
perspective worldwide what do you see is
the most disruptive technology probably
to come along over the say the next 10
20 years
well I mean it's hard to predict I mean
most of the kinds of things that I
mentioned people get confused because
they try to predict how long they'll
take to happen so like how long will I
take to happen the real answer is
there's a 5% chance it'll happen every
year
and most of these things are like that
it's mostly based on whether anybody's
working it
over here for mentioning how you can
listen to encourage participation in
science and so forth and I think that
one thing that has not been mentioned
and perhaps Google and other companies
might get more involved is we come down
in the school system and so forth but
there's one thing that this
conspicuously lacking in this country it
is philosophy in science and education
starting with grammar school I've been
in number of countries where philosophy
is an integral part of the curriculum
such as in Mexico and I find out that
there's an emergence of students with an
awful lot more curiosity and willingness
to participate in science and I find it
there's a again in this country we
really need to introduce that all across
the curriculum in the schools if
necessary by federal mandate that that
is conspicuously absent and I would
encourage Google to support that effort
hi on YouTube and Google video there are
a lot of silly video clips but there are
also some serious clips like in google
Tech Talk for example how do you see IP
video evolving for serious purposes well
one of the things actually I was
thinking about talking about that I
didn't was I always thought it'd be
great to have a little box on the back
of every classroom that you just push
the button and your whatever you said
will go on the internet and Stanford
basically has this which is how I watch
the lectures but they have like a whole
studio and people behind the curtain
ease and it's very expensive but you
know presumably it could just automate
that and have a button you push and I
think you just be important to actually
get all that stuff out there and I do
think the value of all the instruction
that goes on is very high and with
technology we could take that and get it
to everybody or easily thank you back to
this time I was just wondering if you
knew what the most looked up word was on
Google well I can't talk about that
how's three letters
hi Larry I'm deaf I'm deaf myself and I
use in my interpreter I want
congratulation you see they're part of
the YouTube one problem for that
individual is there wasn't completely
accessible the Google videos and the
YouTube because an actor caption I see
we have a captions for the others I
think it's a great idea if you can put
em be a closed captioned and the video
Google beauty and YouTube and me that
would be wonderful
yes he's asking about captioning on
videos youtube and stalling for do you
plan to support this in the future I
think it's very important area also just
to be able to get next all the positive
speech because there's a lot of research
programs that go on that China an index
speech automatically and also just have
people convert the speech also and
attacks so it can be indexed and so that
people can see can see the taxes instead
of just audio so I think it's a very
important area thank you over here hi um
you have moved over from being a science
and engineering person to being a big
business leader I'm actually a business
magazine too much a little bit though
and you also have an enormous amount of
resources both your time and your energy
and your money that you're focusing and
I noticed with Google org you said
something about how you're trying to you
know decide what to do what to do with
this money and make it use it
efficiently so have you do you feel that
there's a need for taking sort of
scientific method and applying it to
business and organizational decisions
and evaluating projects and deciding how
you're going to choose where you're
gonna spend your resources
oh my wish you know business defies a
lot of scientific thinking because you
don't get to do things twice usually so
it's hard to know whether you did the
right thing a lot of times we try to be
as rigorous and sort of analytical as
possible
and I think that's us how with most good
businesses do that over here so when you
pipe to Google often they ask you these
test questions to think how you think
and there was one that I wanted to know
what your response would be to so one of
them I believe is what is the most
beautiful mathematical equation and I
just wanted to know your response to
that I don't think I should give the
answers obviously can I can I venture a
guess
Russell I don't think they would hire me
okay well I thought of that question and
my answer it probably would have been
the x squared plus a constant iterated
over the real and imaginary plane which
is the Mandelbrot set itself yeah that
sounds pretty good okay okay
hi Mary I'm Bill Smith I'm a
statistician I kind of like the equation
infinity I've been doing research on
statistical application of the knowledge
multi-disciplinary and I've been picking
out the numbers for 30 years
I'm from the industrial town stanley
under they made a movie about it and
I've got four nanotechnologies I believe
the solar tax credits cut off because I
wasted energy to do contact lenses
instead of glass sheet you save a lot of
energy with film and I saw this material
when you came up I came in
tardy at the end here and they can do
that with film and I spoke to these guys
with a sickie Sun concentrate they were
interested
last night the speaker said you want to
do multidisciplinary things and he said
you can't clean the atmosphere very
cheaply you want to do with exhaust pipe
likes to house a lot of different people
like the electric auto Association
president and I finally keep coming up
with a statistical information off of
everybody
and I keep sharing it with everybody
it's amazing thing you want to do
multidisciplinary things you want to
have the numbers on things and then you
can go down the road and it's a process
of elimination for the new material for
design you take your physics you get the
chemistry you get the engineering
materials and you come up with
engineering you get the engineering
solutions
and you have a whole new industry I've
got four nanotechnologies for these
alternate technologies and I'm laughing
at these people left and right we need
to get the knowledge here that's where
the jobs are gonna happen I'm doing
military base conversion process I've
got two more nanotechnologies for the
brain and I'm chasing seven
billionaire's so so far because the
system can't cooperate cuz they're not
but do you have our question all I've
got is answers and all emails I'm Bill
Smith I just had a meeting with my Mara
three times they want to do up a new
Institute here clean tech Institute
thank you over here please
hi I have sort of like a question
challenge I have found a way to conserve
heat and I thought I asked you willing
to try what I do I lived for 30 years
without heat in the house and the way I
do it as I simply wear a down jacket and
sleep in a down sleeping bag and it's
amazing how much energy each of us can
save if you don't turn on the heat I
know it seems strange what you'd be
willing to try it for one year come on
give me a break
it's not that bad I live in San
Francisco you live in Palo Alto it's
it's easy here it's you have a wave yeah
well there's an alternative you could
use as much Cayenne as I do too
I keep her warm challenge I don't think
I would be willing to do it in Maine for
a year to show how easy it is it's
actually relatively once you get into
the okay we'll invite you to try Maine
for a year and report back next year
okay the over on the right place by the
way if you built on your new cities with
an extra pipe for just hot water from
the existing power generation
you could probably heat everything for
free which they do in some like the town
I grew up in Lansing Michigan I eat the
whole downtown with the power plant
through Steam well they have geothermal
yup good my name is Charles gene from
mr. Preston speech last night I've
learned on or point to only not point
two percent of the GDP in developed
world ghosts contributed to help the
less developed countries do you think as
as that's cheap exact executive of such
a big cooperation you should Google
should use its wealth its resources and
its its internet power to devote into
helping the pause in the those nations
oh absolutely but I think the the issue
is not so much the money as the will and
the sort of learned helplessness that
people have I mean I think if somebody
convinced everybody it was possible to
solve all the problems in the world
they'd be solved all right it's not and
resources we got allocated and there's a
ton of governments and people and
everybody around the world want to help
if they thought that was working so
that's the trick is to get something
people believe is going to work
don't you think Google should intervene
more with all the foreign governments
and especially some projects that really
work that work at scale and that people
can put a lot of resources into and be
excited about over here
I suppose that a Google employee is the
olders have five years five years they
please but do you get some 50 years old
what are you looking for people who are
older than 50 we're definitely hiring
people thank you over here please thanks
so much for your talk I'm completely Pro
technology improving the lives of
everybody here and in the developing
world but in the short term do you have
any ideas about how the impact of that
technology reducing jobs and
manufacturing and service sectors and
that possibly increasing income
disparity how we can address that
simultaneously in the short term and
clearly the long term answer is more
education but in the near term what can
we do well I think there's an issue I
mean for example if you're reducing
manufacture of farming jobs which we've
done almost to zero
you know those jobs went away but it's
great because we have food and we don't
have to do anything so I think the issue
there is if you're focused on jobs
that's not the right metric I mean I
think you'd be great for you know search
stopping automatically I'm glad that I
don't have to answer them myself to be a
lot of work and I think you know those
weren't jobs that ever existed either so
I think or maybe a few of them did but I
don't think we want to focus on jobs I
think you want to focus on what our
capabilities are as a species to be
happening and how the things we need and
there's a lot of people in the world
they don't have all the things they need
okay over here hi I really appreciate
you talking I appreciate the fact you
took a very broad view however you're
you're running a company on a day to day
basis and you have to deal with some
realities and in particular how do you
my question is how do you balance issues
of safety and political context you know
with various actions of Google's so
we've noticed that recently for example
on Google Earth the Naval Observatory in
DC has been blanked out from the maps
areas like the nuclear station outside
of New York City has not been blanked
out of maps how did you make these
decisions well in general we have lots
lots of issues - like this like there's
something copyrighted as a standard I
mean yeah you know unfortunately we
don't have we don't have very many
people so anywhere we can we try to get
other people to do that work and usually
there's a good way that's already
established to do it so for example on
the internet if you have a copyright
violation and you can sort of go after
the ISP and then they take it down
there's a procedure or part of the DMCA
and so on and actually none of that
generally goes through us and the
satellite data is similar so there's a
system that the government's use with
the people who are taking the pictures
which isn't us and they negotiate over
what happens in whatever data that ends
up there we publish
so in general we can't answer all policy
issues there's tons of complex policy
issues that are very legitimate we just
try to get those make sure there's a
good process established for governments
and generally other people to deal with
them that works pretty well
over here please thank you I found your
talk very inspiring especially because
you had a very can-do attitude that like
on climate change if we just want to
solve it and we put people on it that is
that's my question is there are a lot of
people who have been working on solving
the climate change problem from a
technology perspective and Google has an
amazing and just applying it without I
wonder what people who work on climate
change could learn from that and how
they could get the technology out to the
marketplace to solve the problem well I
think there's a lot of interest in
investment going on in energy which i
think is very very good so I think we
can solve the energy problem which month
they will eventually solve the climate
change problem I think in terms of the
solving the climate change problem
itself with the carbon that's already in
the atmosphere and so on that's awfully
much tougher issue over here good
evening
I have two questions the first ones
concerning Google and the second ones
are on your ideas on energy now the
first one how much do you think Google
is contributed to the abuse of the
internet because I mean undoubtedly it's
been a great help to all of us looking
for information but on the other hand
also those looking for rather nice
pictures via Google Image Search or
worse this is something we think about a
lot is the question of society a kind of
question do you want to have open access
to as much information as possible or
not you know including things that might
be problematic the more extreme examples
and bad images things that you know
could hurt people or things like that
can we've tried to step back a little
bit and just say we're gonna whatever
information is out there we're going to
make available and you know there's
governments and other people that
restrict various kinds of things and we
sort of just try to have that
but that is somewhat a value we have is
for open access yes and the second one
concerning ideas on energy I've only got
three questions first one did you come
here on public transport second one view
have solar energy panels on your home
and third one did you put your computer
on standby off standby when you left
your home no income on public transit I
think other we've Google's really great
we have about 80 buses now we're running
our own buses all around the Bay Area so
we do actually run buses up here and so
on we just did a big solar installation
at Google I've been working on instead
of trying to do it personally and which
is much larger than I would do myself
that's probably about 30% of our
energies and having the campus is pretty
substantial was really a question yeah
but unfortunately all the Google servers
are constant we haven't trying really
hard actually to get out of the industry
to agree to a standard power supply of
12 volts by four computers which would
probably cut 10% of Energy's computers
worldwide good much of what he talked
about was about communication and
grassroots support but if I were to
Google for example you your name a lot
of what I would find is people who are
fundamentally against the publishing of
information on the internet and making
it available at all how would you
respond to that sorry which people
let's say Google Oh
don't like us yeah I don't know it's an
issue that people like controversy and
things like that
um part of that actually is we don't do
necessarily good job of ranking those
things that's partly a probably problem
in how we do ranking because we probably
are giving I mean I think there's
actually this question I'm very
interesting is how you get greater sort
of understanding and will rigor applied
to sites and people's ideas and so on
and those can flow around the web link
like links to but I think that's really
I don't solve problems so you'll see a
lot of various things yeah thanks I
think my question may have been answered
already but I think you used the example
when you're preparing for your speech
you were googling for images or
information and you would hit up a
firewall that would ask you to pay for
an article and then you kind of went off
and found the other information actually
I didn't find the dollar well I guess
that's the question it's that
information is behind a firewall because
there's a value to it someone really
invented something they prepare that
it's their property intellectually but
this is the problem at Google brings us
access to these things we know of it but
we still have to acquire it somehow is
it so I just wanted we have thoughts or
if there's other things she's been
thinking about how to make that other
information legally available and and
maybe in a more direct way that we have
to do right now yeah it's really
important point we've actually we just
released Google Checkout which actually
makes a lot easier to buy things and I
think that'll be really useful for us
it's not that I'm not willing to buy
about information it's that it's too
complicated to do it now a lot of people
wouldn't be willing to buy it I don't
know how you deal with developing
countries and other things are like are
important issues but I think you just
kind of create less friction
right thank you
we take a let's take two or three more
before people gunfire this is heaven
open any question but I was just
wondering what your thoughts were on
politics and government and I don't mean
about like the current administration or
anything but like in theoretically
government is is kind of inefficient and
I was just wondering what you if there
were any thoughts of the reasons behind
that
yes I don't know how amazed there aren't
poor candidates and I think that's
partly a function of the the what it's
really like to be a candidate you know
and I think that would be a relatively
easy thing to fix maybe change our
system so we get a lot more people
involved okay last one so it was
wonderful to hear you speak about the
Grand Challenges in the world apart from
the grand challenge of search and I was
wondering what sorts of initiatives you
have in the short term and long term to
actually address global climate change
within Google we're trying to do we use
quite a bit of energy not compared to
like you know a big Exxon or something
but we use quite a bit of energy and
we're trying to make sure that's
renewable and carbon neutral and all
those kinds of things most thing that's
been a way for us to learn about things
like Cleveland we bought some ocelots
things like that I don't think we're
completely happy with that experience
and there's been a lot of kind of
varying articles about it see other
people are pointing out issues so I
think I don't know that we have really
great ideas about that it seems like the
greatest leverage we can have is to try
to get some really interesting people
doing interesting stuff actually
building things that could generate a
lot of energy so the solar things I
mentioned that we're and then things
like that I'm pretty optimistic that a
small team there could make a huge
difference in the world
in a short amount of time
good when we are 10 minutes overtime so
I want to thank Larry Page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
