you we're very happy to have Victoria
Van Voorhis CEO of second Avenue
software as part of both our serious
games and education at google Tech Talk
series I first met Victoria last year at
gains for the games for change festival
and a learning roundtable with the
Department of Education in both contexts
I was struck by her willingness to talk
about not just the vision and
possibilities for these types of games
but the practical realities of getting
them used in the classroom and getting
them used effectively Victoria brings
that rare combination of hands-on
classroom teaching experience knowledge
of the realities of publishing and
distribution and innovative approaches
to play and learning please join me in
welcoming Victoria van voris to Google
good afternoon can you hear me or do I
need to put this down a little bit
because I'm sure is that better alright
I'd first like to thank Matt for
inviting me here to speak we met as he
mentioned at a conference last spring at
the games for Learning Institute and
I've had the pleasure of continuing a
conversation begun then with a colleague
who's bringing really important insights
to bear on what the future of Education
will hold I began my career working at
the american academy of arts and
sciences and went on to grad school and
was absolutely convinced that i was
going to become a professor and life
intervened and i ended up moving back to
my hometown to take care of my sister
and my career took a completely
different trajectory i taught in the
middle school high school and college
levels and then i worked at xerox
bringing innovative technologies to
market primarily as a business
strategist and now in this most exciting
chapter i'm working as an educator
educational media entrepreneur pulling
all three of these components together
my essential question today is why since
we know that games are an effective
learning tool aren't they coming to
scale I'm part of a really active
dialogue that's going on but Clayton
Christensen at Harvard is talking about
this Jim Shelton at the Department of
that is talking about it the school of
one is
in fabulous innovative things in New
York City as is Katie salen florida
virtual schools and k12 are actively
trying to innovate in this space and of
course Jim G was one of the people who
really started this dialogue and I have
a list of references at the end of my
presentation so you know I'm just one
voice among many who's trying to solve
this problem so let's see oh wait by the
way those are protists for any of you
who are wondering from one of our
virtual investigations on biology so
let's see when Ben Sawyer came here to
chat about serious games he threw down a
gauntlet and said you can't really talk
about being a gamer or gaming unless
you're a gamer and I'm taking a little
bit different tack for those of you who
are born after 1975 you might not
recognize that as a computer tool to
punch card in my first educational game
actually involves stacks of punch cards
I had this teaching typewriter and you
got to feed the punch card in and solve
a math problem and the huge payoff was
that the card progressed through and you
got a ding and that was my motivator and
when you leveled up you got stacks of
different-colored punch cards and you
got to solve harder math problems and
that was my Christmas present when I was
five and I thought that was absolutely
fabulous clearly that's not going to
motivate today's kids and then I moved
on to those of you who ever had an apple
to it ye and played space eggs the lips
were really difficult to get around and
then when I was in college instead of
studying I spent a lot of time playing
virtual chess and then after I graduated
this fabulous thing called SimCity came
out and I'm sure all of you are familiar
with the will write titles and now
because I'm a mom and I run a business I
don't have a lot of time to play myself
but we do play a lot of wii games with
our kids and so while i can't call
myself an avid gamer right now I've
grown up with educational technology and
gaming technology and have a perspective
on it that's probably a little bit
unique compared to other members of my
generation all right I'll tell you
quickly about my company
and then we're just going to move on
we're an educational software company we
focused on creating game based online
activities and we work primarily in stem
we are an award-winning company we've
been a Cody finalist and won a number of
awards of distinction for the
educational materials that we create and
we work primarily at the high school and
college level I'm not really focused on
early early childhood education or
elementary grades these are some of our
clients we do work for a number of them
or actually all of them Pearson is
probably the largest publisher in the
market houghton mifflin harcourt we've
done literally dozens of interactive
learning modules and that's what we
actually have to call serious games to
get them incorporated to curriculum
materials they don't want to actually
call them games and we've done stuff
from mcgraw-hill and Norton and so we do
this blend of big robust learning
management systems and interactive
learning modules and games and we try
and create ways for students to interact
with content in a fundamentally
different way I have a strong prejudice
against multiple choice as an assessment
vehicle and so we're constantly trying
to come up with innovative question
types that get students to think about
the material that they're learning and
to demonstrate their knowledge in a
deeper way a couple of years ago we did
a really quick and dirty game called
star formation for Discover Magazine and
we did it in collaboration with
Professor Adam Frank at the University
of Rochester and it's a really simple
flash game but you know most people when
they read a textbook description of how
stars are formed get lost pretty easily
I'm sure this audience was pretty well
versed and their STEM disciplines and
probably didn't get lost but that's not
true for the vast majority of learners
and so when we created this game we got
you know for over seventy thousand
downloads pretty quickly and then for us
this is really high praise on this game
is like drugs for astrophysicists it's
very addictive it's like bejeweled for
science nerds for us we that was you
know making everybody in our office
feel like they'd been really successful
and as I said this was you know a quick
flash game that we put together for
discover and you know people are still
you know trying to get scores on the
leaderboards higher and higher in fact
we don't understand how they got some of
the high scores they got so we're going
to keep moving here right now in the
United States we spend a tremendous
amount on education so I'm going to
indulge myself and be a policy wonk for
just a minute before we talk about some
of the other perspectives today in the
United States we have an academic
calendar that's based on an agricultural
calendar we had one-room schoolhouses
when we started this country we had
teachers and a student-teacher ratio
that was pretty small and we asked her
primarily her sometimes him to teach
students across a wide variety of
disciplines in small groups and you know
it was really seasonally driven and that
worked when we were an agricultural
economy and now we actually have an
industrial model of Education because in
the end of the 19th century we decided
that in order to have a workforce that
was useful to us we needed to Train far
more people and bring up the level of
education and so our modern schools are
really an industrial model of Education
that are very teacher focused and not
very student focused we have a teacher
who has a classroom and we move students
in and out of his or her classroom she
stands there and she gives a lecture um
for 37 of the 40 minutes there's usually
some question and answer and then she
made grade papers after hours and things
like that but we're not taking advantage
of the best highest use of her or his
time eighty-three percent of our spend
and education is on human resources and
this is the pie chart that that shows
you how its distributed fifty-two
percent is on instruction that's pure
teachers and then if we look at general
admin school admin instructional staff
and student support we add those all up
we get to be around eighty-three percent
and we're not be
very efficient with how we use those
resources nor are we asking them to
perform their highest best value tasks
education is the last industry that's
really benefited from what information
can technology can do to transform an
industry an education is an industry we
can't we can't get ourselves around that
and I'm also going to acknowledge that
we ask schools to do a lot more than
just teach content we ask them to craft
the next generation of citizens who will
vote in elections we ask them to be the
first line of defense in our social
welfare system identifying kids that are
neglected or abused or suffering from
poverty or are having eating disorder
issues or drug abuse or addiction
problems we put a lot of weight on our
teachers and we don't always give them
the resources to handle it so let's just
take a look at educational spend in this
country in 1996 we spent 293 billion
dollars on education and if we adjusted
that for inflation in 2005-2006 it
should have been about three hundred and
seventy three billion not over five
hundred billion in 2009 2010 the spend
was estimated to be about 650 billion
which is a lot of money and in 2010-2011
with increased vigor and focused from
the Obama administration the projections
are over seven hundred billion dollars
now for those of us who lived through
Johnny can't read and Johnny can't write
and Johnny can't add and Johnny can't
subtract and then No Child Left Behind
we must you know be thinking that this
incredible investment in education is
paying off and that we're really you
know moving our dollars in a direction
that's important and it is a direction
that's important but we're not getting
what we pay for oecd des is for those of
you who don't know it's a it's a policy
institute that tracks information across
30 industrialized countries
and then also tracks information about
developing countries and it's really
well vetted so in 1995 and 96 us you
didn't rank sixth out of 30 countries
that we were tracking at that point in
math and science in 2006 us students
ranked 24th and 29th in science and math
respectively so we slid back and not
only did we not keep our place but other
nations are surpassing us in terms of
their total scores so others in a
generation they're eclipsing what we
were able to provide our students at the
graduate level in the u.s. we ranked
20th international and stem and for
those of you are an educator stem is
shorthand for science technology
engineering and math and this is
critical because innovation for the last
century has really been driven by
advances in technology all of you are
here because of that and more than forty
percent of us doctoral students in stem
are foreign nationals so if we look at
the fact that we're 20th internationally
and then we subtract out the fact that
forty percent of the students are
foreign nationals who may or may not
choose to stay in the United States
we're looking at a critical shortage of
people who are going to be well skilled
in STEM disciplines
I understand everybody's passed out of
high school
there are a variety of metrics that they
you know there's tests that we look at
and percentage of students who go on to
achieve equivalent degrees and master's
and doctoral PhDs in the various
disciplines so in the in the k-12 data
they're comparing apples to apples and
you bring up a good point in that in the
master's and PhD program levels we're
looking at degree completions and
percentages of enrollments and those
kinds of metrics alright so work and
play when we're all little we learn by
playing and for those of you who sat in
a high chair and learned how to use a
spoon your mother or father gave you a
spoon and you held it and you threw it
on the floor and your parents picked it
up and they probably weren't quite as
germaphobic as we are now and put it
back in your mouth and fed you some more
and you threw it on the floor again and
then maybe they wiped it off and handed
it back to you and they said oh don't
throw that on the floor and you weren't
just being naughty at that point you
were actually being an experimental
physicist and you were discovering that
gravity actually works and that humans
are designed to learn through play we're
designed to learn through
experimentation and it helps us be
creative you know the percentage of kids
that are ranking high as creative
geniuses in elementary school is pales
in comparison to the kids that are
ranking really high in terms of their
creativity scores preschool as we
introduce them to our current
educational infrastructure we drive
creativity out of them so why games
games map to how our brain actually
works there's lots of cognitive science
to him demonstrate this enables
customized instruction this goes back to
our industrial model of Education when a
teacher goes in and gives her lecture or
his lecture for 40 minutes you know the
normal distribution says that a certain
percentage of students already know it
some are never going to get it and we've
got this middle and then they're going
to get to the end of the year
and based on this normal distribution
you know we're going to have C and D
students in there as well as a and B
students and we're never going to be
able to bring those cnv students up to
the level of the a students because
they're moving on because of our teacher
centric model games provide environments
which promote retention and transfer so
in schools very often people say you
know why do I have to learn this while I
have to understand calculus what
difference does it make if you can
situate educational opportunities and
meaning it promotes transfer and we know
this because the department of defense
spends more on serious games than
anybody else and they wouldn't do it if
it didn't work and it's not just
first-person shooter games of their
designing but cultural immersion games
and they know that this is a highly
effective way to train people with
varying skill sets across a number of
disciplines games offer continuous
feedback in our traditional school model
we have a unit test at the end of three
weeks of instruction maybe we had a quiz
partway through and then we're moving on
to the next unit that's called summative
assessment games can provide something
that teachers in love which is formative
assessment and they don't and other
methods of learning don't really create
that right now a textbook doesn't report
back to a teacher that the student read
it and understood it it's an inert
object a game can report that back to a
teacher and then games can stimulate
both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
through awards challenges and mastery so
we all play games and we love them
because we get coins or we get more
points or we get to be on a leaderboard
and we find it motivating or maybe we
just want to see if we can get to that
next level and part of you know little
kids vernacular now is leveling up when
my first grader moved up from first
grade to kindergarten he said yes mom I
leveled up from kindergarten to first
grade and I realized how pervasive
language around gaming has become meshed
in our culture all right so games are
lecture mary lee mayo at the Kauffman
Foundation is doing some really
interesting research and she picked a
sample of educational games
and then looked at the learning outcomes
based on weather compared to lecture and
in all cases gaming outperformed lecture
at the low end 7.2 percent to over forty
percent on average so we know they work
and if they're designed while they work
really well so three perspectives today
I'm going to talk to you as an educator
as a designer and then as a business
strategist and we'll go on from there I
just want to make sure that I've got
some of my notes here
alright so first we're going to take a
look at a really boring value chain and
this is the way that we currently create
and distribute learning objects in the
marketplace to educators on somebody
authors a book and that it's vetted by a
publisher who does all sorts of
incredible value add things to it they
correlate it to standards they create
professional development materials they
create assessment vehicles and they then
market it um and sell it so they also
manufacture a physical book they
distribute it gets shipped to warehouses
and they sell it through a sales force
either in the k-12 level two states or
districts or at the university level two
individual professors or departments and
then the technology this textbook and
some of the ancillaries that go along
with it are deployed to to audiences a
teacher and a student so we always have
to keep in mind that there are actually
two consumers of educational objects and
learning objects so this is really very
much like manufacturing a screw or a
pair of pliers or any other industrial
object and that doesn't work so well
when we're talking about digital
technology and learning so my sense is
that we're going to have to consolidate
that value chain and we're going to have
to actually insert some functions that
we don't currently have in the serious
game space we have a lot of originator
zuv content in the world of serious
games and a lot of them die by obscurity
they're in you know some professor ed
use web page and they get played
occasionally and then their grant runs
out and they don't have time to update
it and they haven't they don't have any
funding because all the browsers have
changed and they need to you know make
it compatible and they haven't bothered
to correlate it to standards and there's
no professional development wrapped
around it in order to get it used by
teachers and currently they're not
really distributing and selling those
actively there are a few exceptions and
Mary Lee Mayo talks about some of them
but there's really not an effective one
too many distribution and sales
model and they're not being then
deployed effectively to students and
teachers and so right now we have
originator and we don't really have a
publish and a distribution mechanism in
the value chain as it currently stands
for serious games and I think that is
one of the key reasons why they're not
coming to scale so as an educator I
often start with how games will make my
students successful how does any
learning object help my student Master
their content so that they can move on
to the next level and continue to have
doors and opportunities open and
available to them because our
educational system is really fairly high
stakes you know in middle school if
you're not getting good grades in your
science and math classes you get tracked
out of the Honors Program and then by
the time you get to college you're
tracked out of calculus and by the way
you're not going to be able to master
any of those engineering disciplines and
you know we would like to think that we
give an equal education to everybody in
this country we don't and we closed
doors very early even though we don't
have the formal structures that some of
our European counterparts have wait a
minute we lost something
come on come back well I'm hitting the
wrong arrow come on
okay curriculum requirements the first
thing that any teacher has to think
about is is this correlated to standards
if I'm using an object in my classroom
whether it's a textbook or a board game
or a computer game I better be able to
describe how it's correlated to
standards I need to understand how I'm
going to integrate it into my lesson
plans and I really have to not have an
understanding of which one's work best
so let's say I go out to Google which I
do frequently and I type in geometry
games there is a huge number of items
that will come back on the search you
guys are very very good at that and as a
teacher I might have 20 minutes to think
about which one I can integrate into my
curriculum I don't have any information
on whether or not those games are
accurate whether or not they're
effective and whether or not I can you
know actually integrate them into my
classroom because of some other things
that we're going to talk about next
logistics how do i buy access for the
ones that are for sale I don't have a
mechanism for buying access to serious
games most states approve budgets late
and then they distribute something that
I'm sure none of you have seen in years
a three-part carbon form and they give
you a two hundred dollar budget to add
educational supplies to your classroom
that year and that might buy you a
couple of film strips which they still
sell believe it or not maybe some
posters but it certainly isn't going to
buy you a suite of access codes to a
really cool serious game that you think
will help or it's not going to you know
when you put down civilization on the
form and you want to buy it because you
think it's a really effective way of
teaching geography and history which
there are really early adopter educators
that are doing that and they're teaching
them really valuable things they can't
really mean you're going to go to your
district and say yeah I'm buying copies
of civilization to teach geography and
your administrator is going to laugh at
you it's never going to get approved so
then they buy it on their own and they
deploy it but here's the next problem is
that
how am I going to get my IT department
to support it so there are some poor
underpaid soul in the IT department
whose job is to make sure that all the
computers run and God forbid should
students ever trip across content on the
school's computers that they shouldn't
be allowed to touch so all the machines
are ghosted downloads are prohibited so
you better not have any fancy plugins
you you know no way can you require a
graphics accelerator card and you have
to screen for all sorts of content when
I was a teacher I taught French and I
really you know I the textbook
publishers do a great job but if I had
to use another I'm ving green socks at
the metro station lesson for teaching
foreign language I was going to die and
I really wanted my students to have the
opportunity through the internet to look
at authentic sources of information and
so I gave this assignment to my there
were either freshmen or sophomores in
high school they got to pick pick a
topic and then they were supposed to
identify three sources in the relevant
target language that were authentic and
one of my students April came back to me
three days into the assignment and
absolute tears and she had picked what I
thought was a relatively innocuous topic
French bread and she was locked out of
her computer accounts she was getting up
she had teachers upset with her because
she couldn't even submit her papers
through the email system so this was
considered an innovative school by the
way and she couldn't figure out why
until she got a notice on one of those
carbon forms actually that said that she
was locked out for inappropriate use of
school technology and it was because she
had entered the letters Pai n in her
search and in French that means bread
and in English it means pain and so it
was a block search term and I had to
appeal to the local district
administrator to unlock her account in
and convince them that pain was not in
an appropriate search term and so it's
those kinds of logistical challenges the
teachers face so if you have a serious
game that has content that's going to be
considered at all questionable you're
going to have problems and then you know
if it god forbid you ask them to go out
and do some web quests and use the
internet to find materials know that
many of the search terms are going to be
blocked by internal filters the next
thing is support is anybody else done
this is there a community of practice
around it as it worked for them so let's
say I've got this great series scream
that I want to integrate and I don't
have anybody to talk to you about how to
do it I don't know if they use at the
beginning of the lesson or if they used
it as a subnet of experience do I use it
as independent practice if I assign it
for as independent practice now I have
to have all my students have access to
it after hours and I have no idea what
kind of technology infrastructure they
have at home or at their public library
and if I assign it and some of my
students can't do it and I grade it now
I'm in trouble because I've just
participated in the digital divide and
that will bring well one to me from my
administration attitudes how do i
convince parents and administrators that
these are valid learning objects you
know some parents have a zero screen
time policy which it shocks me I mean
like you know I agree that kids need to
be outside they need to play my kids
have used computers since before they
could talk and which I'm embarrassed to
admit but you know that was part of
their environment I didn't feel it was
appropriate to shield them but there are
other parents who feel equally strongly
that kids shouldn't have any screen time
or should be limited to 20 or 30 minutes
a day because of obesity because of you
know developing critical thinking skills
and people don't see how games fit in
this world as learning objects because
they haven't been taught to think about
them that way it's just a game you're
only playing and we've disconnected play
and learning so much that we have
generations of people who
think that those two things are antonyms
okay classroom management all right so
classroom management is totally tricky
you've got 25 kids maybe there are 13
years old and you're a full generation
older than they are and they are all
digital natives I'm sure all of you know
about Marc Prensky concept of digital
immigrants versus digital natives in my
office I'm definitely a digital
immigrant my developers mock me because
you know I can't play games and I you
know ask them to help me with certain
things and if you're a teacher and you
have 25 kids that you need to manage and
control if you try and deploy an
educational game and you can't make it
work you have just lost all credibility
you will have chaos visited on you for
the next half an hour and you're going
to be in big trouble assessment how can
I tell if it's working so I assign games
how do I know that it's actually having
an impact and what role does formative
assessment length we as a teacher if
you're going to assign it you have to be
able to demonstrate that somebody
actually learned something from it or
they're going to question the value of y
you assigned it and we're going to get
we're going to talk more about that when
we get to the design phase okay so now
we're going to talk about use cases and
work in design so we've got two slides
and I'm i divided them between work and
play in terms of designing a serious
game here at Google you guys all
understand that you have to begin with
the user in mind many serious games
aren't developed by people who are
focused on actually creating games for a
living so they don't do some of the
basic blocking and tackling that all of
you do they don't have a use case they
don't know if it has if it's for small
work groups if it's for individual
practice is it technology focused or is
it user-focused mayor and Clark are two
cognitive scientists that have looked a
lot at educational technology and there
were people who thought that radio was
going to be
the end of public education as we knew
it and it wasn't and it's because we
were always focused on the technology
and not the student and we didn't really
have a good way of adapting that
technology to the classroom okay does
the series game have a clearly defined
educational objective and do I have a
Content map have I tied it to standards
or state standards or common core
standards right now there are 50
different states in this country not to
mention the International opportunity
that serious games present they all have
different standards and they're all
equally quirky when we were doing one
set of development materials I got to
see the quirkiness on the left and the
right we had to teach evolution without
mentioning Darwin because then it
wouldn't be adopted in states like
Kansas and when we were doing a unit on
respiration and we were talking about
different methods of respiration we
actually had an in fib Ian jumping into
the water we had a really cool 3d
animation of a frog and there was a
cutscene to like respiration in this an
phibian and some reviewers in California
came back and said we couldn't use that
because the Frog wasn't wearing a
lifejacket and we weren't promoting
sought water safety and we said but it's
an amphibian that's kind of the point
and there that that wasn't going to go
anywhere cognitive development students
have the ability to master different
kinds of concepts at different rates in
different ages and very often serious
games are designed by experts for other
experts and they don't think about the
fact that students may not have
developed certain cognitive processes
and skills to intuit the material that
they want them to integrate and you know
and some of that actually comes back to
physical development Toby selling a who
runs first label productions talks about
how she has to design with motor skills
in mind for different age groups so when
you get to high school they've all
about twitch speed responses but when
you are designing in the k-6 environment
especially k3 their fine motor skills
aren't there yet and so if you give them
something that's twitch speed they're
going to fail and they're not going to
enjoy the game delivery model how's it
going to be delivered is it going to be
web-based is it going to be used on a
whiteboard or we can have a DVD people
are still actually distributing content
on cd-rom and DVD is it going to be for
a handheld device or mobile phone the
United States is way behind Europe and
even many African countries in the
integration of cell phones into the
educational setting and one thing that
you have to keep in mind is that schools
technology is usually good five to seven
years behind what is typically being
sold in the market so graphics
accelerator cards are not standard the
processing speeds are smaller slower and
the bandwidth opportunity that they have
is you know sometimes it's like sipping
data through a cocktail straw because
they're sharing it across an entire
school so you've got to be able to
really think about how to minimize your
download and optimize your use of that
data stream do you have a multiple T
disciplinary team of subject matter
experts so normally when you have a game
design team you've got a bunch of guys
and increasingly a number of women that
are focused on gaming if you're doing a
serious game you need an instructional
designer you need a subject matter
expert you need to be able to actually
have game designers and artists and
illustrators and people who can help you
develop the narrative arc and they need
to be able to effectively collaborate
one of the things that we've spent a lot
of time on is creating that
collaboration mechanism and assessment
how can I tell if a player is learning
is it SCORM compliant do any of you know
what that is it's a Department of
Defense standard for shared content
objects and the whole idea is that
they're supposed to be reusable and be
able to report data out about whether or
not somebody's learning and then how do
I demonstrate efficacy be
cuz when a text book is published and
distributed everybody accepts it as
tautological that's an effective tool
nobody accepts as tautological that
serious games are an effective tool and
they'll always ask you to demonstrate
efficacy so you have to do controlled
studies to demonstrate that you actually
produce a learning outcome and getting
the authorization to do that in public
schools is very difficult and then you
have to tie it back to standards which
we've already beaten to death okay play
design these are our old friends Bert
and Ernie and there's this tension that
our friends the children's television
workshop unpacked years ago and that is
that in order for a serious game to be
effective it also has to be engaging
because if you can click the little box
that closes the game or change the
channel you've lost your audience and so
you have to marry effective content
that's well-designed pedagogically with
fun and if you don't do that you're you
know totally out of it so what helps
drive fun narrative and context genre is
it a puzzle game is it a first-person
game is it an adventure game and we need
to think we need to map that back to the
educational objective we have to have
gameplay mechanics that we can
instrument that can actually help us
then understand whether or not students
are making progress to their game goals
which should be tied back to educational
objectives we need to have motivators
that are age-appropriate in
situationally appropriate woe unto you
if you put up a leaderboard because we
can't have competition in public schools
and make some students feel like they're
not performing there's a lot of research
on both sides of that issue and I have
some sympathy for it but inherently
humans are competitive and we like to
know that we're being successful not
just for ourselves but against someone
else and so we have to find a way of
creating motivation and creating a
healthy sense of competition without
alienating kids that aren't being
successful and we can do that because we
can a
and help them achieve mastery learning
through gameplay gender in the
entertainment industry games initially
were very gender divided and the lines
are blurring now somewhat and more and
more games are being played by both men
and women boys and girls in the k-6
space not so and again Toby who's at
first playable she's you know PhD
scientist incredibly accomplished you
know very outspoken wanted to do like
gritty games for girls when she got to
play testing she discovered that the
more pink and sparkles that she put in
the more they liked it and that just
absolutely dismayed her but there's a
big gender divide in kids in the k-6
space it starts it's still very there's
a lot of friction and tension around it
in middle school and then in high school
some of those lines start to blur
assessment we've talked a little bit
about assessment we need to understand
whether or not games are actually
teaching and then we need to be able to
demonstrate through scores or other
criteria that they're actually learning
and so we need to integrate assessment
either in the game itself or in postgame
opportunities and then we have to have
play testing which is a lot of fun we
have students come into our offices all
the time to play test the other plate
Esther that we can't forget about though
is the teacher because if we don't have
teachers come in and play test and get
their feedback it's not going to be
effective when it's deployed and we have
to after we've done all this we have to
find ways to make it fun so creating
effective and fun serious games is
really a challenge so now I'm going to
talk to you as a strategist I'm sure
many of you know Geoffrey Moore's
crossing the chasm theory you know end
of the 90s beginning of 2000 he was
talking about how technology innovations
go from people who are on the bleeding
edge to mass adoption so you know at
this point cell phones were not you big
quibus and now you know everybody has a
cell phone laptops were not ubiquitous
now everybody has a laptop and we've all
seen how technology goes from being you
know at the margins to the mainstream
and right now we're on the other side of
his chasm there are early adopters and
there are some visionaries out there but
we haven't found a way to cross that
chasm and get it to where the majority
of people are willing to accept and play
this play games to help learn yep yeah
place
but still
no we haven't we haven't gotten of them
but what if said we're just on the verge
right and we should exactly and we've
spent sixty billion dollars putting
computers and classrooms and we haven't
demonstrated any improvement in
educational outcomes for that investment
and I think it's because the games that
we're designing don't meet the standards
that we need to have in order for them
to cross that chasm we don't have good
professional development materials
around them we haven't tied them to
standards and we haven't demonstrated
efficacy all of those things are
incredibly expensive and serious games
have been incredibly underfunded and
we're going to talk a little bit about
why that is on the next slide so for
those of you who read Michael Porter he
has five forces and we can talk a little
bit about this over the past few years
there's been heavy consolidation in the
publishing industry and they've got
great you know they've got huge market
share and they don't have the workflow
the infrastructure a business model to
support game based education because you
know and I have a lot of publishing
clients and they're really trying to do
right by the educational system they
made a couple of strategic blunders
early on one is that they still see the
textbook as the core learning object and
they decided to give the digital media
away for free as marketing spiff will
give you all this virtual content if you
adopt our textbook and they didn't find
a way to effectively monetize the
investment that they were making in
digital technology so it stayed at the
margin and as currents the current
suppliers are really tied to innovating
for their current customer base and so
it's inherently incremental change so if
they do a focus group with a bunch of
teachers who are used to teaching the
way that they have been teaching for the
past 20 years they're going to get
feedback that suggests that incremental
change is the right thing for them to do
current customers
are tied to the status quo and here the
customers or educators and they're
really afraid to cannibalize their
current mode of education because
they're afraid that it's going to
displace them so I am going to find a
way to integrate technology classroom
that doesn't displace me as an educator
because this is what I do this is what
astron it about and so they haven't been
given the freedom or the opportunity to
think about how they could effectively
deploy educational technology in their
classroom without putting themselves at
risk we have fragmented customers with
competing requirements we've got 50
different states common core standards
you know the common core is something
new but we haven't really implemented it
yet and so you're trying to create
materials that you can market across the
country but you know what there are
different textbooks for teaching
geometry for new york state and texas in
california different textbooks for
teaching Giambi i think we'd all agree
that the basic principles of geometry
are you know well documented but every
state has its own riff on how they want
to see it taught and so the cost of
creating content that is specific to
different states is very high new
entrants into this market are
disaggregated and really poorly funded
so if you have a professor that has this
fabulous serious game they don't have a
community and they're totally
underfunded maybe they got an NSF grant
grant runs out they don't have a way to
take it to market and it sits there and
it dies on the vine so how do we ascend
incent innovation and an essentially a
closed system one of the things that was
is really frustrating for us as we spent
this last year working with a major
publisher who's trying to be part of the
solution they're a really valued client
and we spiciest game with them for about
a year that was going to support
multiplayer collaboration and we really
struggled to find a way to do the
development for about five hundred
thousand dollars
five hundred thousand dollars is not
much when you're talking about software
development this publisher killed the
project because they didn't think that
we get enough textbook adoptions to
cover the cost of development so they're
tying this development of new technology
to whether or not they continue to
market and sell their analog bread and
butter which is a textbook all right so
we're I'm just about to wrap up here so
we showed you the the value chain before
and right now on the value the reason I
have this broken out into the different
pieces is because the value chain really
isn't an integrated value chain yet we
have people who are originated errs we
don't know where their funding is coming
from we don't have a good community of
practice on good design and we don't
have we haven't been able to facilitate
iterative design so for example if you
you know grew up in the TQM days total
quality management you understood that
you had to go back to your customers and
look at the data and then determine how
you are going to improve your next
version we don't have a mechanism for
doing that in the serious games market
right now so we don't have a way of
passing along best practices or creating
subsequent versions of serious games
that we can demonstrate to be more
effective we don't have an effective
publisher for serious games that can
provide all of that value add that is
needed to be able to integrate these
materials into the curriculum and then
we don't have an ecology that can make
it sustainable so we don't have a way of
monetizing this value chain that will
create an ecosystem to provide iterative
design and to pass along best practices
and to be able to fund the development
of the professional development
materials and the other you know tying
it to assessments and standards that is
a critical function that publishers
currently play
and then in terms of deployment we have
a real challenge as I said at the
beginning we have an agricultural
calendar in an industrial model we
haven't thought about how we can get our
schools to reinvent themselves and we
haven't found ways to get them to
challenge their existing patterns of
behavior and so until we do that it's
going to be very difficult for us and so
if we can find a way to bring forward
this publishing function and to monetize
the distribution and sale of serious
games we can create that ecology as much
as I would love serious games to be free
the cost of software development is you
all know is incredibly high the cost of
doing the value add for publishing to
create the infrastructure that you need
to effectively deploy these in an
educational setting whether or not it's
a physical classroom in a
bricks-and-mortar school or a blended
learning environment or an online school
is very high and right now we don't have
a distribution and sales model that
allows us to sell one too many you guys
have you know everybody has an app store
and you can buy one to one you can't do
that with a school so this is some of my
reference these are some of my
references I've got lots more if you are
really passionate about the topic and
thank you
thank you
first I said thank you because they
really enjoyed your lecture oh thank you
and what are some of the best examples
of serious games that you have looked at
and water sounds like the best the best
in breed things that you really think
other people can learn from in terms of
game design in effectiveness well I
think the the person who's done the most
is really somebody who sits at the
intersection of edgerton minh tanned
that's will write the simulations and
the gameplay that has been created there
is phenomenal and they've been adapted
to the classrooms many times there are a
number of other serious games that are
out there whyville has a lot of traction
it has a corporate sponsor but honestly
it's painful to play and it's considered
one of the leaders I mean I you know it
it's just it's painful so we have to
find better we have to find better
examples out of those examples which are
out of all the examples that you know of
successful serious games which are the
ones that you've gotten the widest
adoption from the most remote school
children parent parents or schools and
why okay there are a couple of things
that have a couple of games that have
had wide adoption why vill has you know
millions of players right now it's been
supported by a corporation and so it's
had more funding than many other serious
games would have but like i said it's
painful to play and it's been a direct
consumer play it hasn't been direct to
school so it's part of the informal
education process and what was your
sorry i forgot the second part
okay so it's the most widespread because
its head corporate sponsorship it's been
a direct-to-consumer it's not very
effective the other arm material that i
think has gotten a lot of traction is
brainpop they're doing a really great
job and they've created very small
bite-sized lessons that are easily
integrated into a classroom and they're
they're not very you know there's
they've done a good job of making them
easy to digest and they are a snack size
game not an epi systemic game and so
there's traction for some of those
snack-sized games and there's tension
though around the desire to create epi
systemic games which could really create
an entire course inside gameplay that
has great context so let me suggest what
the other side of the chasm might look
like partially based on what textbooks
look look like I've read some number of
future fiction books where people talk
about oh yeah we we all played that
educational game as a kid you know that
it was simply a part of the common
context just like oh yeah we've figured
out what the five parts of a flower are
you know everybody did that in three the
right right it's a common cultural
reference like we all we all need a
theme song to the Brady Bunch once upon
a time right so and the other thing you
said surprised me was the other like
three or four different geometry books
well i was actually surprised that you
said they're kind of implicitly ought to
be only one but once you get the kind of
scale that you have for books software
distribution is practically free by
comparison with the cost of producing a
physical book yes and no I mean there's
the there's the softest service is
expensive to support you have I mean you
all have software sitting on servers and
you have to pay for those servers you
have to pay to maintain them browsers
and operating systems change technology
becomes obsoleted very quickly
I could not have done my presentation
today on a three and a half inch floppy
so as you know textbooks are a really
cheap effective piece of analog
technology and the spine was the first
intellectual property protection digital
content requires tending in care that a
textbook might not text books however do
have a life cycle that's driven by a
business model around adoptions for
states or major universities and all of
those states and universities compete
with each other to get the best textbook
materials and they're in their court you
know in the publishing world can I just
check to see if there are any questions
on bc
hi I'm French so I'm I feel the pain
about the PAI an example that I was
brave funny you spoke about a lot about
the barrier to entrance basically do you
have some solutions in mind like how do
you convince publish' to move toward
developing moss use games schools like
Star xterra I do have quite a number of
thoughts about that but that actually is
work that we're doing internally that
we're currently seeking funding for so I
have to look out for the best interests
of our corporation in terms of what I
share you guys are pretty well
capitalized and have a lot of talent so
we can talk about that later I have a
quick question um i'm i'm a teacher i've
just here for a couple years um I'd
taught math and I've been working with
some math curriculum well here and it
seems that one thing in math and
probably a lot of other subjects that
could be an issue set in my mind games
in in a sense cover a fun game would
cover a more than one topic like if it's
hard to make a really fun game on kaka
you know that involves the slope of a
line only but the way schools are that
you kind of go topic by topic and even
within math there's not like a lot of
integration and there's definitely a lot
of a lack of integration between math
and science and some other subjects that
go together very well so has that been
an issue do you think with adoption like
how do you get it's it's absolutely an
issue and it goes back to the decision
makers and the purchasers and the way
they evaluate learning objects they look
at learning objects from exactly the
perspective that you're describing topic
by topic did you teach somebody how to
calculate slope they don't look at
whether or not somebody has an
integrated set of skills that can
demonstrate their mastery of this set of
principles and so if we can find a way
to shift their lens slightly and look at
mastery of of concepts and integrated
ideas rather than
merely coverage of a particular topic in
a textbook and we can use efficacy
studies to demonstrate that it's a good
way of teaching then I think we can
overcome that hurdle because when you're
in a you know when you're evaluating a
textbook or any other learning object
for a school district or a state you're
going through a checklist does it cover
this topic does it cover this topic does
it cover that topic in a way that i
agree i mean-- texas just wrote
jefferson out of history you know so
until we shift that lens and say not
only do we want these tops to be covered
but we're going to hold our teachers in
our school to a standard where we need
them to demonstrate that all students
are achieving mastery of these topics
which you can do through gameplay
because they can be scaffolded and you
can have a unique experience for each
child who plays through that game we
can't do that with a textbook which is a
monolithic industrial product you know
if you have a game you can get hints and
tips you can you know if you're failing
at solving a problem with a Pythagorean
theorem there could be two or three ways
that the game could coach you so that
you could be successful in a way that a
traditional learning object can't thank
you I think also just a quick comment
that if it's hard to make it work but if
if it worked it'd be a great way to
opportunity for teachers of different
subjects to collaborate and write and
necklace to the context thing so when
you're looking at a particular content
area if you can make it
cross-disciplinary and route it in
meaningful context of the students it
increases retention and transfer so I
think you may have addressed this a
little bit in your last answer but to
what extent are the standards in a sense
locking us into
to a dead tree version of educational
objects and I'm thinking in particular
of situations where even non-computer
things like simulations in inside the
classroom or workshops don't quite seem
to fit that model that favors deep sort
of intuitive understanding of the topic
versus more of a surface check the items
off the list do we need a paradigm shift
there we do need a paradigm shift and
there's somebody that was writing about
this in the 50s and he was in my slides
and that was Benjamin bloom and he
created this thing called Bloom's
taxonomy which is probably the most
quoted and unread educational document
ever and then he actually went on in the
80s to write an article called the two
sigma problem where he noted that if we
had individual teachers working with
students in a student tutor model we
could take students who were see
performers and make them a performers
and at that point in time he said maybe
computers will be able to facilitate
that for us because we clearly can't
afford to have a one-to-one
student-teacher ratio and so if we look
at bloom both his taxonomy and this
model his taxonomy doesn't just talk
about content but it talks about the
higher-order thinking that we need
students to be able to do and what we
don't do in our standards is actually
break out what we need students to be
able to do we need them to be able to
recognize they need to be facile with a
concept they need to be able to
synthesize that they need you know
there's a whole variety of things they
need to be able to generate new content
to participate in a dialogue around it
and so things are much harder to test
for SS they're much harder to test for
an assess in what we've done in many of
our online worlds is we've taken the
scantron and put it online and the
scantron was sort of like this first
innovation in technology to make grading
easier to relieve some of that
industrial pressure on teachers but we
kept that technology and didn't think
about how to make richer assessment
opportunities available you
using serious games or deep
interactivity to do that and there are
good ways to design Interactive's and
simulations that will demonstrate
whether or not a student is actually
understanding things and and working
with them on a higher order and you can
do that through gameplay and you can
instrument game mechanics to understand
whether or not somebody is making
decisions that lead them toward an
outcome that demonstrates that they
understand a concept thank you very much
thank you it was a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
