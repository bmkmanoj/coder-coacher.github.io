thesis but unfortunately nothing go so I
can't present anything about that and
instead I will talk a little bit about
writing chase and race rest api's and go
and I will basically split this this
talking in three parts so first we talk
a little bit all chasing then about some
rest stuff and finally about api's in
general but may first the motivation for
this talk so these days when I'm like on
on Twitter on reddit
I feel like this right everybody is
talking about his newest fancy
microservice and how great it is and
everything and I don't want to discuss
whether that's really the case or not
but I want to kind of give you a reason
that if you use micro-services or
something similar that then kind of go
is a good choice for it and why is that
the case
so the first three points you're kind of
like tom has already presented them I
only want to kind of go into one point
in more detail and that's kind of the
performance aspect and because I could
show you some kind of random benchmarks
here and target of mass I rather want to
kind of show you some use cases where
really where people really use go and
replace something existing and got a
benefit out of it and so for that I have
kind of two blog posts quoted here so
one is from parse comm this is kind of
this this company that Facebook bought
and they do kind of some cloud back-end
stuff and the other use cases repu state
they do kind of like some form of text
analysis and also provided by an API in
stuff and the common thing when you read
those blog posts is that basically all
of them kind of report from a kind of
creating point at performance
improvement in those examples even like
in an order of magnitude right so they
could reduce their resources by 90
percent and also other things like
deploying your stuff because ago you
have like static binaries so you can in
principle you can just help you
binary and you're done and also like
deploying your API all those things
improved and those are just two cases I
think you can talk to two people at
Google and they could have a lot of more
use cases about this and so what I kind
of want to tell you of course not
everybody can just say okay hey boss
let's rewrite our whole API and go I was
on this meetup on Friday it was super
but maybe if you start a new project
something small then maybe you go and
show other people how great it is and
then I think it will kind of spread this
just as a motivation now to the actual
actual technical details and first about
chasing a little bit and you might think
why is this guy talking about Jason
right Chase is so simple and what am I
doing here button go there are some
gotchas and especially if you come like
from python or so which I did there are
some some traps you have to take into
account and actually it's not only me
this is the related text on stack
overflow from goal and the second most
related tag is chasing so you see
apparently behind Google App Engine
being confusing Jason is also confusing
and yeah and that's why and yeah and
that's what I want to show you the the
basic stuff I could talk more about this
but just the basics so the basics is
Marshall and unmarshal so Marshall you
take an object and then you you will
marshal that and you will get the the
byte array right then coded Jason and
the opposite is unmarshal where you pass
your byte array which you got from
somewhere and then also you pass the
object into which you want to decode and
of course both also return an error in
case there was something wrong with it
good so how does this look in practice
if you're coming from Python or from
Ruby I think everyone is kind of like
going okay let's take a map because
that's what you do in Python you just do
a chase and
and you got your map so you want to do
the same and go and then you quickly
realize oh wait
but maps are typed so in only very rare
cases you have kind of a chase and
they're all your peas are only strings
you might have integers strings
boolean's and all that kind of stuff so
then you see okay I need to use
interfaces and specifically the empty
interface and this is what you see here
you can do you see your mouse yes we're
there we're using the empty interface
and all the types implement the empty
interface so that means that kind of we
can decode all the types into this type
but then in in the last line when we
have decoded our value our jason then we
need to do a type assertion and i think
this is something tom has not shown but
what it basically means is we have this
interface which gets matched by
everything but then if we want to use it
because your types a if we have to say
okay what I use now this is supposed to
be a string and if this is not a string
actually then you will get a penny and
this works and yeah if we run it we kind
of get the expected output hello go 1 2
3 4 5 but this is actually right we
don't always want to use these type or
surgeons so what I did was I looked a
little bit more and then I found ok we
can use actually structs to to decode
into and so not knowingly we write our
struct called message 1 and we have
these two fields message string 1 and
their ID is an integer and then we do
the same thing again and who wants to
guess what the output of this program is
if you have been listening carefully so
far you might know it but maybe in the
beginning it's a little bit difficult so
anybody wants to guess nobody thank you
for saying this no it's not an error it
would be nice maybe if it was an arrow
yes right so what we get is empty string
0 and like someone said it would be nice
if it was an arrow because
basically it didn't happen what you
would expect right and why this didn't
happen the reason we already heard today
is that the memo variables they have
kind of not a capital letter in the
beginning and this means that they are
unexploited and so other packages cannot
access these variables and this is true
what what the Chasen package does it
uses reflection but also reflection
can't read this value and so the library
thing is great there's actually nothing
this destruct has no member variable so
we don't need to set anything and it
thinks there's no error and just does
nothing but of course when you kind of
do this your client will not be happy
when you sent this to him and so then we
learn about these that we need to use
capital letters in the beginning and
then we use this and now the first print
line here will actually work now we will
get the expected output but then what we
will do is we will might kind of modify
some values on destruct and then send it
back to the to the user and what we will
now get as an output is again something
unexpected because if you see like in
the first line in our Chasen we have
like message is small the p and now if
we decode this we will actually get as
output the key in the Chasen as again in
capital letters and why is that because
the decoder kind of when decoding it
doesn't case-insensitive match on the
member variable name and so it kind of
matches the message key but when I'm
coding but if it by default it takes the
capital letter and again your client
will probably not be happy because it
would expect a small key and the final
solution then after having wasted some
time you arrive at at struct X and these
truck tags are like a feature of go you
see it in the on the very top in our
message struct struct after the variable
we kind of define this text this tag
string and there we first kind of say
the tag key jason and then the actual
kind of key we want to use for that
chase and once we do this and
use the same code again we get the
expected output and now we have too
small the small key names and
everybody's happy but it took some time
and this is only kind of like the
beginning they're like more complicated
use cases and again I see one of those
questions every day on Segal flow and so
to kind of sum this up the basics be
aware of those tags and use them
otherwise you won't be happy and pass a
reference to unmarshal because unmarshal
needs to set values on your object this
is at least an error if you don't do
this so that's nice another kind of
gotcha is that if kind of let's say you
have like a SAP map in your chassis and
you have this map as type of as a member
of your struct and then you decode this
struct and this actual map was not in
the chase and you decode it you will get
a null map and nil maps are kind of
tricky because reading from them is fine
you could for example use like Len of
this map and it will return 0 but once
you write to it it's an error so check
for those yeah so this just for chasing
I think this is even if you do only some
kind of client stuff side
chase and stuff this will be useful good
now about like I said rest good so the
HTTP standard library is already quite
powerful you saw a basic example in Toms
talk where we defined one of those
handlers but to kind of if you think of
like rs1 I think the the first pattern
people always think of is kind of like
this where you have in a URL path and
you have kind of the ID in the path and
then you match on that and this is not
possible with the standard standard
library and go and so to get that
functionality we use an extra framework
and this framework is called go chase
and rest and one thing that's already
nice about this if there's that there's
like a whole repository only with
examples of off of it and this gets you
started quite quickly and it provides
kind of two features one feature is this
it
Hendra interface and router interface
which we need for a kind of distressed
functionality and the second feature is
kind of a middleware support so that you
have kind of a defined interface for
middlewares
which everybody can then write and to
show you this framework and it's only
one of many there are a lot of
frameworks we want to write a small
example basically kind of the pastebin
application and which will with a chase
an api and we will do this in just three
slides so it's it's pretty simple and
how do we get started
first we kind of need to set up this
framework and this is actually all you
need and there is it might look much in
the beginning but there's actually only
like let's say four functions that you
need to that you need to execute and the
first thing we do is we kind of define
an API object this is from the rest
package new API and on this API object
we will then work and the second in the
second line and the second highlight
line we see that we can kind of use
middlewares and we will come to it later
and then we have this router and this
router what it can do more than the
standard one is that here you see that
we can kind of define a path parameter
with this : and then ID and that means
in our handler we can then read this ID
from from the past that was accessed
once we have done that and checked for
error all we need to do is we on this
API we set the router this means that we
could actually also use a totally
different router and once we have that
we call on the API mech Handler and you
see that we return an HTTP handler and
you don't have to know what this means
now but what we see here is that kind of
it fits nicely with the standard library
right it doesn't need any specific
server or something you just fit it in
in the standard library and that's
something which a lot of frameworks do
and I think that's is kind of a sign
that the standard library is really
strong
in this aspect good now we need kind of
those two handlers right to to get a
paste and then later to post a paste how
does this look more specifically on the
very first line you see our our Han
learn to face and if you remember back
to Tom's talk there you already saw this
interface the only difference is that
now we are not have those types from the
HTTP package but from the rest package
which is like the goat chase and rest
framework and I like this because even
though it's a different type
it's the interfaces is the same and what
those types do is they kind of wrapped
the standard the standard types and then
only add small utility functions that
are useful and we will use the first one
in like the first line of our code and
here on the on the request we will pass
param we call path power method and
extract the ID and here we now get the
actual ID that the user requested and of
course we then have to because it's a
string we have to encode it to an
integer and we do that and if that
worked
we kind of do a store get this is just
my abstraction because I don't want to
annoy you with database stuff now and
the store get returns like the paste if
the space was found and if it was found
it's kind of in this ok variable that's
something you also already saw today and
if we found it what we do is we call
this right chase method and just pass
our struct and what this right chasing
method does on the response writer is
that it abstracts this encoding to trace
in the way so you don't have to do that
to do that yourself and that's it and if
you didn't find the value we call rest
error and there's also an HTTP error
with the same interface but what rest
error does it it returns the error as
Chasen so we see not much the framework
doesn't provide too much functionality
really just what we need and then if we
want to create a paste what do we do
looks pretty similar again we create our
object then we call decode chase and
payload this is the wrapper for Chase
and unmarshal
and this will set the the well use in
our struct that we passed and of course
also return an error if there was one
and then we store a value and this might
for example set the ID of the creator of
the
it's trucked and then we just ride it
back and that's it right now we kind of
have a simple paceman application which
you can use with it with a chasin API
it's not much and a lot of power already
comes from the standard library these
distressed remember only adds like small
utility functions to get a better router
and also handle the chase in part the
the second big thing I mentioned the
beginning was middle of our support so I
don't know who of you has kind of tried
to get some kind of middlewares working
with the standard library and this kind
of gets ugly so this is why there here
is special support for it and to use the
middleware we simply call the use
function which you saw before and pass
our middleware object and how does this
look more specifically so for example if
we want to use chasing that token
authentication we used to chase the web
token middle where we can set here the
key for example the timeout the max
refresh time things like that and once
you have created this this middleware we
use it and then it will automatically
run for every request and another
middleware might be the if middleware so
this is kind of more like let's say
functional thing where depending on the
path we can kind of activate the
middleware or not and the only thing
that's kind of open with middlewares is
is how do they kind of transport state
and this is I think one of the open
questions in with all the frameworks and
go and the way that go Jason rest has
chosen to go is that on the request
object you have kind of a map from a
string to an empty interface so here the
middlewares can set the values and then
for examples chases web token
authentication middleware it sets on the
key remote user it sets the user which
got automatically authenticated and then
you can access that in your handler and
going back to our paste example if we
now wanted to support users and set this
user on the paste we
simply do this like this and again here
you'll see this this type assertion
because this is an empty interface crate
so of course there's more middlewares
for go chase and rest but there's also a
lot more frameworks one thing that's
maybe common to all of them or to most
of them is that they're all not big
right I here showed you in ten minutes
like most of the functionality of go
chase and rest and like I said this a
lot of frameworks have this in common
and this is I think kind of the go
mentality you do something very well but
you don't do too much and so if you're
kind of like a Chango guy this is maybe
not your stuff but I like this because
you can just get started you don't have
to remember too much stuff like don't
define some weird Django configuration
file and you just get started great now
in the final part gets a little bit more
tricky and I hope you stay with me this
is about writing micro services in
general and a common pattern you have
with micro services or with AP is is
that you might have a front-end which
takes the request from the user and then
this front-end queries a lot of other
backends it could be other services it
could be a database it could be other
RPC systems or things like that and the
pattern you find there is that you could
have different scenarios it could be
that you want to do ten requests and you
want to do those ten requests in
parallel because you need all of them
and of course you want to save time it
could be that you kind of query a shard
at back-end and you're actually only
interested in one response from those
ten or you say okay I want to render in
200 milliseconds so all of the services
that have replied to me will get
rendered into the page the rest we are
no longer interested and what you didn't
want to do is in all those cases is you
kind of want to cancel the rest because
you no longer want to to waste resources
right if you have complicated handlers
that do complicated stuff you no longer
want to do this
and go has a nice solution to this
problem and the solution is the net
context package who has heard of this
who of those people are from Google so
it's almost the same amount and the same
people so you might guess where this
package come from comes from and where
it gets used extensively hmm and you see
this X in front of it and was this means
is kind of dislike this golang.org /x
library which is let's say like almost
standard it's kind of like libraries
that are highly maintained at our high
quality and did it at a later point
might get into the standard Larry yes
there's this this this mailing list
thread these days and I think the the
targets like one seven or so right and
so yeah like Matt says this might get
more standard and I think it's great
because what I mentioned before is that
all of the frameworks kind of do
something differently to transfer the
state or to do whatever and if we had
this in the standard library I think it
would be pretty great and at the top you
kind of see the quote from a
documentation so it's not only carrying
values across api's but it's also
carrying a deadline or a cancellation
signal and now how do we do that and
there are kind of two important methods
on this context interface the first is
the done method and what it returns is a
channel of an empty strand so this is
basically a dumb channel and in go you
kind of use this to kind of signal
something which means that if somebody's
listening on this channel and then the
channel gets closed the one who's
listening on it will get notified and
like this we can kind of signal somebody
aha
you're getting cancelled please stop and
the second thing for carrying values is
this value method where we take a key in
interface and then also return
and what's maybe interesting is if you
kind of look into those factory or make
functions that produce a context you see
that all of them take a context as the
first argument so what this means is
that these contexts build a hierarchy
they build a tree of contexts and this
is again create because if you can't
like a note industry all of the children
of this node will be canceled as well
and those children will also have access
to the values which we set in this
context and this fits this pattern I
described in beginning right if you push
off some requests and they again send
some requests you kind of send the
signal through this request tree to
cancel all of those requests and because
this might sound a little bit abstract
now at least it did to me
I kind of want again to walk through a
simple example or symbol might be
relative but I hope you see the concept
and what we do for that is we kind of
implement a weather service which you
can query with a string for example the
city string for example szerik and then
what you will get is the current
temperature for Zurich and the forecast
for Surrey nothing more and how do we do
this for this we kind of use to other
api's other packages one is the city API
we will use this too to show how you can
kind of work with values in contexts and
also the others the weather API which
then does the actual request to kind of
the backend and here we will see the
cancellation come into play so more
specifically the very first thing we do
is we call from a city API to from
request function to extract the query
and this here is really just to help a
function of course it could include some
validation logic and a lot of other
stuff but here it's just to show you
that and once we have that and check for
an error we create our first context and
we create a context with timeout and two
things so first we ask the parent
context you pass context background so
this is kind of like the root context
for everything that you can use and then
we pass the time out of 200 milliseconds
so that means after 200 milliseconds
this context and all its children will
get automatically cancelled and of
course we see here that we want to
respond in in 200 milliseconds if you
don't do that we return an error and we
also get back this cancel function and
this cancel function we can use to
actively cancel a request prematurely if
we had an error or something and once we
have this context we create yet another
another context and this time this time
from the city API and what we pass as
well is the city query so of course what
we do here is we create a context and on
this context we will set the value and
we get the newly created context with
width which is then a child basically of
this context which we created here and
this context we then pass to the weather
API which then does the magic and now we
want to look how this is implemented
more specifically so first the city API
this is really everything so at the
bottom we see this from request function
which just parses the the query string
nothing back there more interestingly is
from context where sorry new context
where we create a context context this
time with a value again the parent
context which we passed and the key and
the value and here you might maybe see
another kind of go îsh thing what we do
is we kind of at the very top we this
pattern we saw quite often today we
define a type key but this type key is
actually just an integer but it's a
different type and that's important and
then we kind of define this constant of
type key with a value of 0 and we use
this key to set the value in the context
and why are we doing this so imagine we
would just pass a 0 here in this case if
another API another package would do the
same you would kind of have a conflict
and if we use both then we wouldn't know
kind of which value we are actually
getting in the context but because we do
it like this and because we use this
special type the way interfaces work in
goaling is that if you compare two
interfaces they only compare equal if
they are of the same type and because we
have this unexploited key type in this
package in the city package this will
never compare equal to any other type
and any other key and like this we can
kind of set our value and be sure that
there will be no collisions and of
course exposing this to the user would
be kind of ugly and that's why we kind
of provide this scatter function from
context where given the context you get
the actual string that we start and
that's it for kind of working with
values and we will later see where we
reach these the city now the weather
package here it gets more complicated so
the very first thing we do is we create
two channels in the first line and we
have this result wrapper type this is
unimportant
and these two channels we will then pass
to do goroutines and those two
goroutines which now actually execute
the real HTTP request will send us their
result back on those channels and now
you see a new concurrency statement in
go I think within cities today it's the
select clause and the Select Clause is I
think what makes channels really
powerful because by default the channels
may be not more than a concurrent queue
right
but with select what we can do is we can
actually read from multiple challenge
channels concurrently or let's say try
to read from multiple channels and
whichever of this channel is ready will
kind of get selected it's like a switch
case but just four channels and if
multiple channels are ready this will be
randomly and so we iterate over this
twice because we need to read from both
of our result channels months and but
what's also interesting is that each
time we are
so select on the thumb channel from the
context and what this means is if the
context gets canceled at this point we
will select this case and return and we
will immediately return return an error
and like that this goroutine or whatever
is executing this query thing will
return immediately and no longer waste
anything and maybe two things that are
implied here is that first of course you
might think and that's right
that those goroutines that we spawned in
the beginning they're still running so
we need to cancel them as well and we
will see in a second how and also kind
of the scenario which we're implementing
is that what we say is we want to
receive both of the values if we read
one but then we get cancelled we will
also return an error right because if
this case gets left at we return the
error immediately even if we had read
one value already so this is kind of
just the concept here and now how do
those goroutines get cancelled because
of there of course we also have to
implement the cancellation and for that
we have the get implementation which is
because get temp and get forecast are
basically the same functions they're
just very different backends so I have
to get in pull here and the first thing
here is that we now see the city API
again because now when we want to do the
actual HTTP request we of course need to
know to which for which city and that's
why here with the city from context we
extract the city query and here we saw
how the city value got carried from the
city API over kind of our handler to our
weather API and once we have that we
create an HTTP request this is cold
stuff not so important here and then we
execute HTTP do and HTTP do kind of know
that's the magic and what do we pass to
it the context again the request we
created and the callback this callback
will be called once HTTP two returns
and then we'll kind of handle the
response which is not important here
because it's just business logic and
also note that HTTP do is blocking so we
can just pass our result kind of into
the into the lambda into the clutter and
set it directly because we only return
an error and once we have that we send
our well you back on our channel but the
actual cancellation is happening in HTTP
do and here kind of we really save
something what we do first is we create
kind of an HTTP transport HTTP client
again go stuff but then we create yet
another channel and we create an error
channel and this error channel will
again only be used for kind of
synchronization and synchronization with
what with another go routine that we
spawn and this go routine now execute
the HTTP request and what the goroutine
that spawned that go routine so you see
a lot of go routines at play here then
select on is again the context on
channel and this error channel it just
created and if this channel here returns
then now HTTP request has returned
oftenly hopefully the error will be nil
and then we return just that but if the
context is being cancelled before our
HTTP request returns what we do is we
call on our transport on our client we
call cancel request and this will cancel
the actual HTTP request and what it also
will do is the callback which will then
be call with the result of the HTTP
request will then have an error set so
the callback can check what's an error
yes I don't have to do any processing
anymore don't have to do maybe any
allocations I do or things like that I
can just return and here is the point
very safe stuff and that's actually
already everything of this example and
it might have been a little bit
confusing with all the goroutines that
respond and kind of like three functions
deep but just to remember back what we
actually implemented was we have two
bis and this one API does two HTTP
requests - maybe two different backends
or - one back-end and if either the the
timeout happens like right we are above
12 milliseconds those two requests will
get cancelled or another case could be
that if one of those requests returns an
error and at that point we know we can
no longer successfully render our page
we also cancel everything and cancel the
other HTTP requests and like this we
have nicely solved this problem which I
described in the beginning and if you
want to have more info on this there is
actually a nice talk from the author
about this and also a blog post about
this and the example I showed you it's
similar to to the blog post you will
also find this HTTP do function there
and yeah yeah and to sum this up maybe
like the beginning goes boring right
writing this this go chase and read
stuff was not particularly exciting
there was no fancy like or m/s or
serialization stuff it's simple but it
gets the job done right you don't need
to learn all those frameworks and also
said that the frameworks are simple are
specific but yeah they get the job done
and the language enables us the
concurrency and that's what we saw in
the last example and it enables
concurrency I think at a very nice style
because we can read the code from the
top to the bottom
and for example if this was in no choice
I would have to jump from call back to
call back and I think you guys would
understand even less than you did now so
I think this is great and then you have
to stand the library which is
already quite powerful and will get even
more powerful with net next net context
and of course this kind of builds on the
concurrency features which are in the
language yeah so that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
