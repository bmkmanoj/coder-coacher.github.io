G fit fitness centers and we're kind of
holding this bone bone safe yoga
presentation and we're going to
introduce we have Kathleen Cody and
shall we shall we powers from the
American bone health and we also have an
e al Bobby who is from yoga force and
she is also one of our Google
instructors so let's welcome them and
enjoy thank you thanks Jen thanks
everybody for coming so we're going to
talk today about bone safe yoga and how
many people who are already doing yoga
want to be doing yoga in 10 years okay
so this is great because there's a lot
of things that are in yoga and the
practice of yoga that as you get older
you need to start thinking about how you
modify those so that you don't injure
yourself and in particular from a bone
health perspective we want to prevent
fractures so today we're going to talk
about how to do yoga safely and so you
can do it for the rest of your life and
annie's we're going to kind of flip back
and forth Andy's going to demonstrate
what to do and what not to do when we
get to some of the pretty standard yoga
poses and I'm going to run through some
slides to talk a little bit about bone
health and osteoporosis so first of all
I just wanted to let you know that I'm
the executive director of American bone
health and we are based in Oakland
California and we're a public education
organization where non-profit and we
trained volunteers to go out into the
community and do talks like this do
workshops all kinds of things that can
help people learn about how to keep
their bones strong and healthy as they
age so osteoporosis is a skeletal
disease it happens throughout the body
it generally starts in your spine and
kind of works its way out it's
characterized by reduced bone mass and
the bones get fragile so if you can see
the slide the picture on the left that
your left is a picture of normal bone
density and you can see there's a nice
strong connection between all of the
matrix inside the bone when you start
losing by
mass that you start to lose the
structure or the internal structure of
the bone and it starts becoming very
fragile looking and that's what we're
trying to prevent as we get older so I
just wanted to give you some sense of
what happens to bone a lot of people
think it's kind of a static hard surface
that's nothing's going on but it's
actually quite metabolically active and
between the ages around 15 to 25 or your
biggest bone building years in fact kids
in their nine min when they're 9 to 14
build more bone than they ever lose in
their entire lifetime so you can see
that slope but in the early ages is
increasing is where you're really
acquiring a lot of bone mass and by the
time you're about 30 you've reached as
much bone as you're ever going to build
in your lifetime so at that point you
really want to try to think about how do
you preserve the bone that you got so
when you're a kid you need to figure out
how do I get as much bone as I can and
then when you get to be about 30 you
want to figure out how do I keep that
bone so when we reach menopause most
women that's around 51 average age
there's a rapid period of bone loss
that's associated with the reduction in
estrogen in your body and then after
you've kind of leveled off the estrogen
you start seeing continued bone loss as
you get older but there the the rate of
bone loss kind of slows down a bit so
what we want to do when we think about
preventing osteoporosis and preventing
fractures is really trying to maximize
our bone throughout our lifetime so
these are some of the risk factors for
osteoporosis and some of them are you
can do something about and other things
you really can so women tend to have
more osteoporosis than men about eighty
percent of the people with osteoporosis
are women it's because of the estrogen
factor hereditary has a lot of lot to do
with bone health if your mother or
father or grandmother or grandfather had
osteoporosis or fractures you've got
probably a 65-percent likelihood that
you inherited their genes so you really
if you look to your parents
you can kind of get a picture of what
you might be looking at as you get older
age is certainly a risk factor smoking
and alcohol are things we can really
modify smoking affects estrogen in the
body so if we can get people to quit
smoking it really has a positive impact
on bone alcohol moderate alcohol
consumption may be okay but anything
more than three drinks a day is a risk
factor for fractures calcium and low
vitamin D I don't see calcium on there
but low vitamin D and chronically low
there it is dietary intake of calcium
the bones are are made up largely of
calcium and if you're not providing them
with calcium throughout your life you're
going to be at risk for bone loss and
then being physically inactive which is
one of the reasons we're here today is
we really want to try to maintain our
yoga practices and go go on doing things
the right way so that we don't increase
our risk for having fractures this is a
slide not to confuse you too much but
just to let people know that there are a
lot of things that affect bone health
and these are some of the medications
and medical conditions that can cause
bone loss and there's a whole wide range
of them and I think people don't realize
often enough that other things that are
going on in their bodies are affecting
their bones and so just to make this
steroids tends to be the most common
cause of pretty rapid bone loss so
anybody who's got some kind of medical
condition that requires the use of oral
steroids really needs to be thinking
about what kind of what's happening to
their bones so we're going to talk just
for a couple of slides about calcium
vitamin D and then we're going to get
into some yoga these are the keys to the
principal keys for bone health is
calcium and vitamin D and they work
together you need to have the vitamin D
to metabolize the calcium the institute
of medicine is recommending about a
thousand to 1,200 milligrams of calcium
every day there's some controversy right
now around calcium supplements so we
like to tell people try to get it in
your diet that'd be about three to four
servings of a calcium rich food and so
start paying attention to the labels
when you're when you're in the grocery
store vitamin D you don't need as much
unless you have a have issues or
concerns about your bone health but you
can check with your doctor about whether
or not you should be concerned about
getting your vitamin D level tested and
you do need weight-bearing exercise
because the month the bones just like
muscles respond to impact so anything
that requires gravity if it's the force
of your body or weights is really good
for stimulating the bone building cells
so we want to do that but we want to do
that safely so in talking about tips for
using exercise to strengthen your bones
we really want to focus on the bones
that we're trying to strengthen so if
its legs we're going to do leg
strengthening exercises if it's the
trunk we want to do we want to do
exercises that impact the spine you want
to work until the muscles get kind of
tired and quivery within 10 repetitions
so it's better to do heavier weight less
time than a lot of repetitions with
little weight that really helps
stimulate the bone building cells two to
three times a week is optimal this is
probably untested there's not really
very much scientific evidence to support
any of this but most people are saying
two to three times a week is the best
thing to do and then a lot of the
exercise people now are saying you
really need to kind of change your
workout routine about once a year
because your body kind of echo mates to
what you're doing and if you don't
change it up it just kind of goes into
just a mode of not really doing anything
different so think about changing your
routine about once a year so today we're
going to talk about yoga preventing
fractures and some of the principles of
bone safe yoga so you all know this
because you're all Yogi's right
of course so it means Union in Sanskrit
and it's a system of postures or asanas
that are practiced to promote spiritual
insight tranquility and control of the
body and mind that sounds kind of nice
it also happens to be really good for
your bone health so here are some of the
benefits of the different aspects of
yoga for your bones so when you're
practicing postures that involve
alignment it really helps prevent spine
fractures because and he's going to talk
about this in a minute how the
importance of alignment and making sure
that you're doing the posture in a way
that is protecting your spine awareness
so as you practice yoga and you start
getting this mind-body connection that
awareness of yourself your body and your
surroundings really helps prevent Falls
and helps you promote better posture
balance which is really kind of one of
the fundamental principles that you end
the benefits you get from yoga helps to
prevent Falls and if you can prevent
Falls you can usually prevent having a
fracture it is also weight-bearing and
the weight-bearing aspect of yoga will
help strengthen the muscles and as you
strengthen muscles the muscles pull on
the bone and that's what stimulates the
bone building cells and then finally
there's we're going to talk a little bit
about extension exercises which is
bending backwards we always want to
avoid bending forward because that puts
too much stress on those spine bones so
bending backward really helps protect
the bones in the vertebrae so there yo
go all those great things about yoga but
there's also some dangers that everybody
needs to be aware of especially as you
get older there are a lot of yoga
postures that involve extreme spinal
flexion side bending and rotation so as
a knee starts to demonstrate how these
postures are with a proper way to do
them so that you can protect
so you want to think about things like
not not doing too much forward flexion
and there's ways to modify those
postures to protect your spine so as you
get older and you'll notice this now
that we've talked about it that there's
this kind of stooped posture that people
get as they get older and partly some of
us who are younger get at tube just
because we're always hunched over our
computers or we're hunched over are
driving their steering wheels and we
have this kind of slumped forehead
forward posture and we want to do with
the practice of yoga's really reverse
that posture and make sure that we're
sitting upright and we're maintaining a
good strong strong spine so we don't
want to we don't want to compound the
this the forward rounding with adding
flexion from yoga on top of it this is a
the third bullet here is from one of the
our board members who is a physical
therapist and she believes that any
woman who's postmenopausal should not
participate in a general yoga class
without knowing what her bone density is
so it really kind of helps you to be
aware of what your bone density is
before you start doing some activity
that might put your bones at risk for
having a fracture and then everybody
needs to really modify their practice to
prevent any fractures so if you've got
low bone mass or osteoporosis you need
extra precautions has anybody in here
had a bone density test yes ok one
person one person here I don't know
about all the people on the screen but
so this is a diagram or it's not it's a
model of a spine and you can see the if
you can see the the vertebrae that are
in the lumbar spine which is closer to
the pelvis are much bigger bones and
there they're picking up a lot of weight
from your body and that's where most of
the weight is transferred you can see
that the bones that are closer to the
neck start to get pretty small those are
the bones that are between your
shoulder blades and there your ribcage
is kind of hooked on to them and if you
add that forward flexion so this person
is pulling the spine in a forward
flexion movement you can see how much
pressure is put on those those bones in
the thoracic spine which is the part to
the left the smaller bones and it's also
putting some torsion torque on the lower
lumbar spine vertebrae to this is a
pretty dramatic view of what happens to
one of those vertebrae in your spine if
you put some pressure on it when you've
lost some bone mass and most of the time
we hear from people who have vertebral
fractures they don't even know they're
happening somebody might hear you know
they might be twisting or sneeze or pick
something up from a cupboard and they'll
hear something kind of crack and once
once it cracks it starts kind of a
cascade for people and and if you notice
some older adults who have the big kind
of hump on their back they call it a
dowager's hump that's most of the time
vertebral fractures that are happening
in those bones in the thoracic spine
between your vertebrae and it's because
what what used to be a square bone now
has has been crushed because of forward
flexion and you get a stack of triangles
instead of a stack of squares so that's
what starts to cause that that rounding
in the back so anybody who's losing if
you know anybody who's older who's
starting to loot get shorter about an
inch and a half anybody who's lost more
than an inch and a half of height is
probably having spinal fractures
anything less than an inch and a half
it's you know it's the kind of the
compression of the discs between the
bones and may not may not be spinal
fractures but anybody who's shrunk more
than an inch and a half probably should
be checked and so this is the
progression of what we call kyphosis
it's that increasing number of fractures
in the bones of the thoracic spine
between the shoulders and so you can see
the cartoon at the top the the woman
farthest to the left has kind of got
this nice straight alignment and posture
and as she starts to get spinal fracture
she starts to get a little bit strong
kinking and then by the time she's got
another ten years of past she's got that
severe osteoporosis and what's really
what's really devastating and sad is
that people don't usually complain about
pain from this kind of thing they can
paint they complain about losing height
they complain about not being able to
breathe because all of your organs that
used to have this nice place to live now
as you get shorter and shorter all kind
of pooch out through your belly and so
they can't breathe they can't really eat
they don't have an appetite their
digestive tract is all screwed up so
it's really it's a really crappy way to
to finish out a long life so we really
want to prevent this from happening so
you'll start to notice some of these
poses that are actually really good for
bone health anything that has to do with
spinal extension and this this looks
like a cobra kind of a modified cobra
pose and it's it's really good and this
there was a study that was done that
showed that even some moderate use of
this kind of a posture can have a
long-lasting effects they measured these
these up these patients out ten years
and they still had they still were able
to maintain their bone density so now
we're going to start doing and we were
probably going to get you guys up off
your chairs so you can practice a little
bit with a knee so we're going to start
with bone safe principle number one
which is all about alignment yeah so do
you want to talk about alignment then
get some is draw hold on one second
you'll see me in a second
okay my name is Annie Appleby and i own
a company called yoga fours WWE yoga
force calm and they also teach here
actually today tuesday for 25 over at
the gym next to building 43 if you want
to come in in today that'd be great feet
placement is a very important and i also
teach little kids yoga and one little
girls started crying because she said I
can't get my feet to our my toes to all
line up because they're all different
sizes so what I say now is try to get
your feet together and get your big toes
to line up so if you guys want to stand
up this really is important and a lot of
yoga teachers don't spend any time about
your feet your feet your toes are
extremely important so what you want to
do is you want to press all four corners
of each foot firmly into the floor like
you're actually getting energy from the
earth and you're going to pull it up
your legs this gives you good posture
and you can see the difference in my
posture in one second so I'm going to
get my third toes down into the floor my
feet are kind of smashed into the earth
I'm going to pull energy up my legs I'm
going to rotate my tailbone under and
push my butt forward I'm going to pull
my stomach in and up I'm going to lift
my rib cage it's high up off of my hips
as possible and then I'm going to go
shoulders up and back and down now you
want your neck to be really straight so
figure out where your face is going to
go so you want to kind of pull your
skull up and away from your heels it's
hard to do it when I'm holding this
microphone but see the difference your
chest is out you're very accuracy or
very presidential Lee because all your
power is coming from your sternum plate
so remember you lift up and out of your
sternum plate and you're taking all the
pressure off of your lower discs and
vertebrae and you can breathe in between
them so what I would I do in the yoga
classes is you close your eyes because
if you shut down one sense you can
concentrate on the other senses and
you're going to breathe in from your
ankles all the way to your skull so you
breathe in about five counts breathe out
about seven counts so it's like this
and it's all nose breathing in yoga and
you do not want your teeth to touch no
upper teeth touch bottom teeth you want
to keep a space there so you have no
pressure in your jaw it's really really
really good you want to throw your
shoulders up and back and down and with
just three deep breaths you can really
feel good if you have to do a
presentation okay so let's try to do
three deep breaths close your eyes
breathe right into your brain okay now
you can open your eyes and blink ok now
this works at home I am very short I'm
like 53 and I like to beat also i always
carry myself up so I people think I'm a
lot taller than I am but when I'm in the
kitchen and I reach for spice I can
never reach it so I hold my breath and I
can never reach it but look what happens
when I breathe you can actually reach
things so that's just a practical thing
about yoga now we have feet positioning
when you're doing a yoga pose so you
guys can probably sit down now um this
mat is patented because I got in an
automobile accident my whole body was
completely out of alignment so I had to
put it back in alignment you'll see
there's stripes so when I teach classes
at Oracle and Google especially because
it's for people who work and they you
know they need to understand yoga but
maybe they don't have enough time to go
more than once a week so it's very
important to get your front foot
perfectly straight in warrior one in way
or two and then your back foot is going
to go so your heel draws a line into
your back middle arch that gives you
stability so you don't fall over you're
going to want to walk your foot out so
your tibia is straight you don't want
your knee to hyperextend or under extend
because it's really bad for your knee
you also want when you're opening up
your hips you want to always open up
your knee to the little toe side if you
can see what I'm doing opening up my
needed my little toe side so that would
be
war two and then war one or you can come
on your back foot but you're you're kind
of twisting which is okay this is a safe
twist now i'm going to show you another
safe twist it's called triangle pose
okay so what you're going to do again
you want to do very good stability with
your feet your back foot sat at
45-degree angle your front foot is
perfectly straight you're putting all
your weight on your whole foot make sure
that no toe gets more energy than
another toe and you're going to slide
into it and I'm going to do straight
like triangle so I'm going to go over
here and you can touch the top of your
leg or you can touch the bottom of your
leg but you cannot put your hand right
on top of your kneecap because it puts
way too much pressure on your knee so
either underneath on your calf muscle or
your shin and you're going to push your
butt forward and open up your chest to
the ceiling okay but never and never on
your knee if you cannot quite touch the
you know your cap go ahead and feel
confident that you can push your hand
right on top of your leg that's good for
you you'll come up and then we'll do
another one called chair pose Kathleen
again I wondering if you could go back
to the Mountain Pose into and show them
how people do it wrong so they know
what's right and what's not right we do
sometimes leaned over in yoga and that's
completely okay if you need / in yoga
but you always have 20 you always have
it's okay if you lean over and yoga but
you always have to get length before you
get depth and this is a pretty standard
position in yoga if you don't feel like
doing it don't do it here Kathleen so
this is the Mountain Pose so you're up
back down so you really good posture
you're using your core muscle to protect
your spinal cord then you're going to do
what I call I Dream of Jeannie pose
you're going to lengthen your spinal
cord get your forehead you can open up
your feet your back usually is you know
governed by everything's connected to
everything else so this one you open up
your feet because it makes your back
feel a lot better
you want to pull your skull out of your
tailbone and pull your stomach in to
protect your back so always get linked
before you get depth if you feel
comfortable you can lean down shake your
head if you want to bend your knees go
ahead and bend your knees but always
keep your stomach in and in your hands
go down towards the floor a lot of
people cannot touch the floor so who
cares you don't try to force yourself to
touch the floor or touch your toes okay
right yes so don't are they have long
torsos and short little legs like me so
I can easily touch the floor on the to
warrior one and warrior to what people
usually do wrong kind of how to correct
that that I notice that people do wrong
is there not lifting up and out of your
power your power center you don't lift
up and out that they slouched over and
their stomach comes out so they don't
really pay attention to their their
posture while they're doing the poses as
long this is the only thing you really
need to know to do something that's
really safe you're breathing up and
you're creating a cushion between each
disc and vertebrae in your spinal cord
so your stomach goes out your your your
chest opens up and you look like
Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt or a
president they never slouch you'll
notice that see everybody just an has
good posture it makes you look like you
know what you're doing okay so that's I
think the most that I've seen are people
that slouch and do their poses now i'm
going to show you i don't want to well
slouching is your stomach goes out
you're not really paying any attention
you're looking at your cell phone okay
and then you're putting your hand on
your knee see that's rounded this i'm
not paying any attention okay now pay
attention so what straight back foot at
an angle i have really good energy
through my feet that's governing my
entire positioning and i'm gonna open up
now i don't need to look up with my neck
hurts why would i open up
that but I'm gonna energize my fingers
I'm pushing my left foot forward and my
moving my my skull away from my hip
bones so I'm creating length creating
length and creating creating length and
creating space is what you need to do in
yoga okay anybody have questions about
that no okay what made you chair yeah a
neuter and then we'll just run through
these slides ok so the this Annie's
running through all three of the
principles that we wanted to talk about
the first one was alignment which was
the Mountain Pose the second one is
dynamic alignment so can you maintain
the alignment when your body when you're
making your body move around and the
third one is like leg strengthening and
we lose a lot of strength in our legs as
we get older and so this these are some
of the poses that are really great for
trying to maintain some leg strength so
chair pose is you just get your feet all
the way together and line up your big
toe so you can actually lift your toes
up spread them apart put them down and
then you're going to slide your butt
back and you're going to open up and
energize your fingers see I want to have
my trunk so it's long and my breath so
it's deep now there's another way you
can do this you can do this at the at
the wall and you can open up your chest
now can I go back can anybody see them
so you can go in your desk if you guys
are at your desk you can go like this
and your feet would be separated about
hip width apart but you again remember
Angelina Jolie take your shoulders move
them up back and down lift up out of
your hips so you don't compress your
spinal cord you're going to go down like
this and if you ski this is one of the
best skiing well I guess if you have
really bad ass do you approach this you
probably shouldn't ski but if you do ski
this is one of the best poses to do lift
up and breathe into your shoulders so
it's like this it really really really
is good to energize your legs it's a
great great exercise okay
um yeah we can balance on one leg okay
so balancing on one leg as Kathleen I
think said at the beginning you can do
this just take it take a leg up and then
when I teach my classes I have you do it
with your eyes shut so you got you get
really wobbly I'll show you all give my
eyes shut and i'll show you how well
believe you so you go tree you put your
fingers together really tight you look
about six feet in front of you on the
floor you move your knee back you move
your pelvis forward you get a really
straight spine now watch I'm all
purposely screw it up see there's
there's a fight between your right brain
and your left brain in your foot in your
head so you'd like that but it's really
good for you to balance now if you have
osteoporosis and you don't want to fall
down and hold on to a wall while you're
doing it but it's it's great to just
everyday try it try to balance on one
foot yep time so one of the most common
things that we know that people do when
they're balancing on one leg is they
when they're doing this dynamic
alignment is kind of jut your hip out
can you should can't show that doing it
incorrectly body alignment okay but look
at my foot you got to get your foot
perfectly straight or you're going to
screw up the whole pose everything comes
from your feet now watch okay very
important thing that most yoga teachers
don't have time to teach in a setting
like Oracle or a Google ok so I wonder
mr. up can we go back to the slides is
that possible they work their solo
they're so enthralled with the
discussion oh I didn't realize you had
to come back no problem so it's just
this button right here sister you all
have the did you pick up one of these
sequences
so these are stick figures it's not as
nice as looking at an e do these
postures but you can get the the you can
start to get the feel for what were what
it is that we're trying to do so this
first save bone safe principle Annie
demonstrated beautifully about foot foot
placement and alignment of the spine and
so you can see that if you practice this
mountain pose and I know when I do yoga
classes Mountain Pose seems like kind of
a silly thing to do but it actually
really starts to improve your awareness
of all the the alignment so you see that
the year the shoulder and the hip are
all in one in one plane in in both of
these figures so do you all feel like
doing a mountain pose again everybody
get up and you want to walk them through
again so with Mountain Pose remember
your feet together and your big toes
line up don't worry about your other
toes just your big toes line up now some
people don't like getting their feet
together as one big foot so if that's
hard for you you can always modify
position so they feel comfortable for
your own body but also the other thing I
notice a lot of people have tension in
their fingers in their wrists you want
to relax your fingers and your wrists
okay so let's go you want to push your
feet right down solid into the floor
getting all four corners into the ground
especially your third toe goes down into
the floor so think of it as getting a
force from the earth and pulling that
great force up your body so start with
your feet pull it pull it up your legs
rotate your tailbone under push your
butt forward pull your stomach in and up
lift your ribcage up off of your hip
bones in a straight line move your
shoulders up and back and down your
power center is now in your sternum
plate that's where you want it all the
time now lift up lengthen your neck try
to feel your neck feeling comfortable
your face might be too far forward so
you just try to move your skull away
from your heels relax your fingers shut
your eyes and move and breathe now some
people can be so intensely through their
nose that their heels come off the floor
a little bit that's okay
that's breathing deep into your entire
spinal cord let's do it three times good
okay nobody feels really great I hope
all of you on your gut your computers
are standing and doing this okay so the
second principle that Annie demonstrated
was this issue of dynamic alignment so
we want to keep the normal curves in
your spine as you move and maintain
pelvic alignment and she demonstrated
how your hip can sometimes if you stand
on one leg kind of poop out and you
really need to put that put that energy
back in that standing leg and stand up
straight over your foot and not like
that hip sag so how about a tree pose
can we get everybody up and do a tree
pose Annie if you want to it's like it's
hard to do it well see a lot of people
without their shoes on oh I oh I always
teach yoga and Pilates with socks off
shoes off because I think toes are
important and highly undervalued in our
society after we turned six years old so
I like working with my toes you can
spread them apart open them up okay I
can't do it oh and I'm not on TV anymore
the slides on so you can just go all the
way up and open up your chest and
remember that foot needs to be straight
and you have to even out that foot
shoulders up back and down and then if
you want to fall over you can shut your
eyes but you can practice that at home
it's really really really really good
for proprioception look that up you're
at Google Google proprioception okay
breathe
no teeth no jaw close your eyes I'm
always the teacher I can look make sure
you're doing it right we shouldn't have
this the i can i can so you can you
could let you guys can go like this to
grab onto your foot and then if you want
to just like that just move that neat
back and down back and down so you're
opening up again and then come take my
class at four o'clock okay yeah that's
good there's a lot of people that don't
have very much balance and so when we go
out and do community programs we try to
encourage them to balance on one leg
every day and the easiest way to
remember that is when you're brushing
your teeth just stand on one leg and see
if you can stand on it while your little
toothbrush is doing its thing okay this
is a dynamic alignment poses that I
wonder if can we get you back up here to
to switch the camera back these are
dynamic alignment opposes that help with
the spine help you improve the spine you
can see that it's Cobra and then the
locust pose and Annie do you want to try
to demonstrate that when we get that
back on yes yes yeah okay so I always
teach it um that we you know people
about i'll show you how to do it
correctly you relax your feet okay so
your toenails are on top of your mat and
your chest is again wide open shoulders
back and shoulders down your hands are
on the floor your this is a this is
pretty much generally good for everybody
and you're just going to open up and
breathe so you're going to breathe right
into your upper back and your
collarbones okay now this is Cobra I'm
going to do it Cobra is bad for some
people some people should never do it
but this one where the one I'm doing
right now is very safe every it's
usually okay for everybody
hurts don't do it go into Child's Pose
here is Cobra where you open up your
hands you whine your thumbs so they're a
straight line right into your chest you
have to use all ten of your fingers they
have to be open like starfish jam your
fingers hard into the floor push down
elbows into rib cage now see how I'm
doing this this is I see this done
incorrectly all the time can you guys
see the difference between this and
collapsing you don't want to collapse
okay now a lot of people can do this but
some people can't and if it hurts never
do it and I don't allow people to do it
if it hurts if you want to go into a
full-on upward facing dog this is a
full-on upward facing dog but again i am
not collapsing and it doesn't hurt my
lower back at all so i do if stopping
yeah but you do not compress in your
lower back ever but see the Cobra here
is this is pretty safe for most people
but since I know Kathleen and about
American bone health I always teach it
in those three stages level 1 level 2
and this is level three but only for
some people if it feels good you can do
it okay it's full on upward dog now to
release it you would go into Child's
Pose and actually when you go into
Child's Pose you let your forehead touch
the mat you relax your head you're
automatically breathing right into your
lower back and that's where it needs it
the most so you want to you want to
listen okay okay what else Mike yeah so
these are really great least remember
from those the studies before there we
had a study slide in here earlier but
took it out because of Tommy interest of
time but they're the pivotal study on
fractures and exercise was done at the
Mayo Clinic and they recruited these
patients and they asked asked half of
them to do crunches and half of them to
do the spinal extension and eighty-nine
percent of the people who were doing the
crunches had spine fractures
and people who did the extension
exercises it was like sixteen percent so
it's really important not to do flexion
exercise that's that was done in
nineteen eighty four it will we will
never be able to ever replicate a study
like that because who wants to sign up
for a study and see if you're going to
break a bone doing an exercise so but i
think it was within a year yep doing
this exercise yeah they did they had a
group doing crunches a group doing
crunches and flexion a group doing
nothing and the actually the group that
was doing nothing was actually the
second worst in terms of fractures so if
you did spinal the crunches that was the
worst if you did nothing that was second
worst if you did a combination of
crunches inflection that was the that
was better but the best was this spinal
flexion no these are older people these
were older women in the study you know
I'd have to go if you want the reference
to the study I can I can get it for you
it's in a different slide deck this is
the third principle that we talked about
was leg strengthening and after age 50
we lose one percent of our leg strength
and a half a percent of our bone density
every year so yoga's really it can be a
really critical way to maintain bone
density as you get older so these are
the legs strengthening exercises that
Annie just showed you the warrior and
the the chair pose and again if you go
to your your sequence you can see the
little stick figures doing chair pose
and and it's a little clearer on the
stick figure that they're not keeping
their back really straight in an in good
alignment that they're rounding over so
these are some of the resources that we
brought today they're in the back of the
room you've got the yoga sequence the
other thing that is really important and
actually was where we got the yoga
sequence from was from a book that we
did called do it right
and it's a little book that I think I
hope you all picked up back there that
shows how you can bring your yoga
practice into your daily activities so
if you look at some of the pictures of
what you're supposed to do versus what
you're not supposed to do you can see
that all of the people who are doing it
right are keeping a nice straight spine
when they take something out of the oven
or when they're they're unloading the
dishwasher rather than rounding down and
doing the flexion and there's some
there's some core exercises in the very
back where you can see the things that
you want to try to avoid doing if you're
in a yoga program oh and finally we have
this really nice piece called drills for
desk warriors and it's really good for
all of you because these are some things
that you can help improve your posture
during the day just do a few of these
during the day and it's we actually have
a screensaver it's available as a
screensaver so it can pop up and remind
you it's time to do a thoracic extension
and really try to open up your your
chest and get some get some life back
into your spine when you're when you're
leaning over your desk all day okay so
here's the summary of what we want to
avoid when we're doing yoga all forward
bends if you have any any concern about
forward bends there's lots of ways to
modify that again as a knee pointed out
the lot of the problem with forward
bends is that people don't have enough
flexibility in their hips so they're
rounding because the yoga instructors
saying touch the floor touch the floor
touch the floor so you're ending up
rounding your spine and if you have
again a fragile spine that's going to
put too much pressure on those spine
bones and it could cause them to have
fractures anybody who has low bone
density or osteoporosis just should stay
away from shoulder stands or plows if
you remember that model of the spine
putting all your weight on those tiny
little bones between your shoulder
blades if you've got low bone mass or
osteoporosis is just kind of a recipe
for a problem in fact sherry Betts who
this piece as well had a client who said
she was doing a plow and she heard kind
of as two or three of her vertebrae
collapsed deep spinal twists our side
Bend so we're not talking about not
doing these things but what you want to
try to avoid and again in yoga classes
sometimes you're you feel a little
competitive and there's there you know
trying to get you to go beyond the range
of motion that you can do just naturally
by moving so you don't want to torque
yourself around you want to take it to
the end point without like grabbing onto
the side of the chair and really moving
so you want to really try to avoid those
kinds of end range beyond the end range
twist some of the people can use pillows
if you're doing some of the locust poses
or the floor poses that can really help
your under your ribs and then pigeon
pokes again this is not for somebody
who's got healthy strong bones but
anybody who thinks they may have an
issue with bone density probably wants
to stay away from putting that enormous
torque on the the neck of the femur
which is where there's the ball in the
socket and there's a little bridge in
between the two that is tends to be
where you break your hip so that forced
rotation of your hip can really impact
the bone pretty badly so finally how you
can help is you can come to our website
we've got lots of resources sign up for
our newsletter we send one out about
every month or so we have a Twitter feed
in a facebook feed so we try to push out
as much information that's coming out
around bone health as is credible and a
band available and then if you're
interested in doing something like this
in your community please let us know we
have a training program where we'll
train people to go out and talk about
bone health and osteoporosis in their
communities and finally we did cover a
lot nanny already mentioned that she's
got her four o'clock class the today you
can always call our hotline if you have
any questions Shelly Powers is in the
back she's the vice president of our
board of directors
and she handles a lot of the hotline
calls that come in the website is
another good resource and then Annie's
contact information is at the bottom
Annie yoga force at AOL com or her
Twitter feed at yoga force and I'm also
on facebook at yoga force it's all one
word so okay so I think that's the end
of the slide so I wonder if anybody has
any questions or comments about what
we've talked about today yes the
question is what if you've had some sort
of lower back injury or a fracture and
it depends if you've had a fracture if
you know what's a fracture you really
need to be modifying the poses that
you're doing you can still do some of
the modified yoga poses and it's good
not to avoid doing not it's better to do
something but you want to do it right
and you want to do it with proper
alignment and proper form but you don't
want to do that twisting and torquing
motion because that's going to
complicate the complicate the the the
bones so have you are is this for
somebody else so have they been
diagnosed with with osteoporosis or with
yeah i think we probably would want they
would want to see a physical therapist
or have that further evaluated before
they went into some any kind of general
yoga program did you want to say
something about that um yeah did they
get in an accident or hurt their hip in
an accident they'd hurt there because
they weren't paying attention in yoga a
yoga teacher got him into a pretzel yeah
um well I got really hurt my hips got
out of alignment in a very bad car
accident in Los Angeles when I was
working at Paramount Pictures and I
fixed it through yoga but initially i
went to an orthopedic surgeon and i had
physical therapy so the physical
therapist told me exactly what to do and
I fixed it nothing no problems so any
other questions one used the question is
I have a fused cervical spine and what
should i avoid four five and six okay
I'll tell you never do plow um I will
show you what plow pose is and you
should never do this ok this is Glaukos
okay never do it this is shoulder stand
okay now look people do this incorrectly
all the time because it seems like their
legs are straight so they bring it over
here like that forward see how my legs
are not straight and then I'm going to
pick up and out again I'm lengthening my
spinal cord instead of compressing into
it you should never do this either those
are two things you should never do if
you've got fused fused vertebrae okay
you gotta be really careful of your neck
are you doing some sort of exercise now
are you doing yoga now tai chi tai Chi
is excellent for bone health Tai Chi is
really good that's a good balance and
strengthening kind of program that you
could probably do some gentle yoga but
you would want to avoid twisting any of
anything beyond an end range just you
know something gentle yes yeah you know
what you can do that the current
recommendations this is it's an argument
that we have with the with the medical
the traditional medical model versus the
public health model which is we don't do
bone density testing until you're 65 and
of course if you're coming at it from
public health model you want to know
when you're 50 where you stand so that
you have a baseline before you start
going through that lot of that bone loss
as you get older but there is a
calculator on the website called the
fracture risk calculator and if you can
demonstrate to your health insurance
company that you may be at risk for
having fractures by going through that
tool you can generally get your
insurance company to cover a bone
density test and if you have other risk
factors yeah so there may be something
you know most of the rheumatologist now
are very aware that the kinds of
medications they put their patients on
affect their bones so that usually would
get them a bone density test but if you
know anybody who's 65 and they haven't
had a bone density test it's covered by
Medicare and they really need to to take
advantage of that right you don't you
want to know well you know what sherry
the physical therapist is on our board
says get a bone density test and you
know the it so you know but it's at you
did you have do you want to add anything
you are younger and you want to get one
your baseline it's really important it
ever is describing it for you and know
what to do with that information once
you have and that you're not really yeah
so you want to we want to be working
with the doctor who knows what to do
with issues around bone health bone
metabolism because there are as you
remember the slide with all of the
medications and medical conditions
there's a lot of things that we are
doing that can impact our bones so we
just we don't know and the only way we
know right now if we have a problem is
breaking a bone or getting a bone
density test so let's see how what
should we do yeah so you can try it
depends on how much of an advocate your
doctor is there are a lot of
gynecologist out there that will let
their female patients you know around
menopause get a bone density test it
kind of kind of depends totally affects
men totally affects men yes no there is
absolutely a way to reverse that by some
of those fine extension exercises
actually I think Shelly you're kind of a
poster child for reversing bone loss
aren't you do you want to come over here
and speak into the microphone it is
harder the older you get so the more
active the more you're doing earlier the
better but I I just I'm 61 and i was
diagnosed with osteoporosis at 53 pretty
severe and I improved my bone density
ten to twelve percent in the last two
years
and a lot of that I can attribute to
some of the great exercises I've been
doing I've added Pilates and the Pilates
is very similar to the yoga in terms of
the safe kinds of the extension as
opposed to flexion and and other kinds
of prone exercises like you have in yoga
and so all of it really matters diet
exercise and as cal you know kathleen
mentioned in our main message vitamin D
and calcium and weight-bearing exercise
and it can make a difference so but the
older you get it's it's it's harder but
it's still possible so another kind of
interesting factoid I'm sorry it's kind
of a bonehead thing is that when you're
in that time between age 30 and 50 and
your bones are remodeling your skeleton
actually replaces itself every 10 years
so these bones that are there like
really cranking in your skeleton take
you know to announce the boat the older
bone and put in a new bone so there's
really it's hopeful that you can make a
change so if you can really try to
influence those bones the cells that are
building bone to do more of it then
you're going to you're going to be in a
better place as you get older yes
there's a well there's they're not it's
not that they're not recommending
calcium supplements there are a lot of
studies that are coming out now that are
trying are linking calcium supplements
with heart attacks but the studies the
studies are kind of you know it's hard
to know that there you have to kind of
read the whole study so it's hard to
control for diet so in some of the
studies it may be that somebody was
having a calcium rich diet and then they
were taking supplements on top of that
which is way too much calcium so calcium
is one of those vitamins that more is
not better and you really don't want to
exceed total with your diet plus
supplements of 15 to 25 hundred a day so
people were really trying to encourage
people to to look at their food labels
to see if they can get it in their diet
if you can't basically if you don't do
dare
you probably need a supplement it's it's
that's the easiest way to get calcium in
your diet so does that make sense good
anything else it's two minutes to 1
according to that clock well thank you
all for your attention okay great well
thanks for your rapt attention we
appreciate that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
