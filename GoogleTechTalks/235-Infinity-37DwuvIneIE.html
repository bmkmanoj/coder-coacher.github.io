to our first-ever a full effect on this
auspicious day when we're packing
everything up and moving and stuff but
um I just want to welcome Paul
hildebrandt up from Denver he seemed
what the president and co-founder of
zouk tools he's going to do some good
demonstration for you here and prove to
you all the powers of what about 235 and
infinite all the way up to me all right
so Paul take it away great yeah I'm
going to try to explain in 45 minutes
what I've been trying to figure out the
last 20 25 years so if we get partway
there that's good anyway you can you can
help out as we go on the important thing
here is in order to understand zone that
helps to be able to jump between
dimensions and that's something we do
all the time right by seeing every time
you look at something you're taking a
projection of that three-dimensional
object on your retina which is a
two-dimensional object that's been
projected on those sphere and so you're
actually jumping between three
dimensions in two dimensions all the
time now in this case I want to bump it
up to four dimensions and then maybe a
little bit higher and if I actually told
you right now what I think zome really
is you think I was either really smart
or really crazy and probably the latter
and so I'm not going to say it again I
mean we're gonna go for a little while
because neither up is really true okay
I'm just an artist that kind of got
sucked up into this a long time ago I've
been working under sense in fact was
about 17 or 16 okay so by weight an
introduction to this I wanted to mention
a relationship between ones and zeros
and the number is 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 right aside
from the fact that 0 plus 1 is 1 1 plus
1 is to 2 plus 1 is 3 3 plus two is five
instead
go on we'll get to that at the end we
have time to get a little fruity but my
dad had the honor of working with john
von neumann on first electronic digital
computer back in about nineteen
forty-seven in princeton IAS project
needs to improve faster and i asked him
once because we sometimes sit up and
drink beer cuz he's about 84 years old
and i asked him what do you think von
Neumann thought was the most far-out
application of the computer he could
possibly come up with the Wonder toy and
he said well I think Johnny probably
thought that some day they'd be able to
do computer graphics with this or maybe
even predict the weather right so it
kind of kind of did get things mundane
tasks like word processing or automated
accounting and never even touched upon
is kind of information ecology that
Google's help you create right and
that's all what you can do with ones and
zeros well so ms about what you can do
with twos threes and fives and beyond
that and so we're going to start with
that and gives all the numbers more
tackles you recall when we were in
school we started out and numbers were
these abstract symbols scratched on the
chalkboard right which didn't have a
whole lot to do with anything right
and then sort of loses you right when in
fact when were born we already have it
intuitive number sense right because
soon we crawl out of the womb one we see
we see Bobby's face wow that's pretty
cool too full for complexion century and
after that next thing it's lunch time
and go what you be there too long it's a
great way to find out about the number
to be on yonder the kind of visual and
tactile cues about numbers we're getting
them all the way as we're growing up
right within the car seat we go over the
railroad tracks when you get bub up
above all right there's a number for two
times two and you're feeling right or
when our parents read us bedtime stories
we get one fish two fish red fish blue
fish right there's two cute right two
two two and two right so what our
parents are doing is they're creating
kind of a bridge between is an intuitive
sense of what words mean to this very
abstract concept of literacy right and
that's why reading is so important it
opens up a whole world to us but
numeracy is completely ignored right so
we end up with this in first grade
nobody builds the bridge we get math
anxiety and you know its history and
they pass it on I think is the most
elementary school teachers are women who
got math anxiety got the virus when they
were growing up they pass it on to to
all the kids in school and it follows
ideas breath cheating anxiety still
right so anyway two three and five are
represented by in so the rectangle
the triangle and the Pentagon is fairly
obvious why the Pentagon would be the
number five right he's got five points
it's got five lines he's got four five
fold symmetry and five different
directions it also has reflection
symmetry so the two is embedded in there
the likewise with the trying now I don't
know you might be wondering why didn't
why didn't we make the the third line
the number two just a line right the two
points well it's kind of hard to make
struts that only have two dimensions so
so we chose the rectangle which has 2
times 2 inches 2 times 2 quarters and
they're different right you can see if
you look at the zone ball really closely
can you see that and think so how about
this right here's here's a big zone ball
you can see that the ball is actually
shaped coated it has the number to hear
the number three here the number five
there because that is that's really
clear I could make a show you a
flattened out ball here if you turn on
the projector right
I can take the ball and I can I can
flatten it out like that right and in
fact you can get that very sad up with
some see it again you can see there's
number two number three number Five's
the whole thing is paid up those numbers
that those are also the cross sections
of the struts so those those three base
are fairly obvious two three and five it
makes sense that we use those for the
through the cross section of this but it
also makes sense that you can build a
square using the number two struts right
the square has two fold symmetry in two
different directions right actually it's
two times two points it's 2 times 2
edges everything about the square is
similar to the number 4 it's like a two
dimensional number four if I took this
in Sketchup and I extruded it what would
I get not any much the cute right and of
course here it is it's also made up of
the blue struts right because it it's
made up of how many squares six squares
right well
six is two times three so those got to
be a three embedded in there somewhere
and most of us don't see that there's a
good reason why we don't see that it's
called gravity rank the cube is almost
always oriented to gravity and space the
z-axis right and yeah that's a good
thing right it's got a nice solid base
and we actually grow up with cubes right
our first exposure too cute for most of
us is in kindergarten playing with
blocks right and and this is a this is a
really brilliant mathematical
manipulative just playing with cubes and
derivatives of cubes you know which
include Lego bricks and so forth the guy
that invented kindergarten in mid 19th
century Friedrich Froebel had this
radical idea the kids were not just
small stupid adults but that they
actually need to be nurtured and he used
cubes or these kiddo garden boxes four
of the six grounding principles for the
kindergarten concept and that really had
a radical effect on the 20th century any
people I Pablo Picasso of Frank Lloyd
Wright Buckminster Fuller were all
graduates of variables style
kindergarten and of course it also led
to Montessori schools
that but if you're if you're playing
with you because you're always orienting
it to gravity there is plan on the table
em again and in fact you know as adults
we played cubes to we build our
buildings we create our cities
everything is based on that pretty much
we like to line it up with three axes it
stays right x y and z or left right well
it's I east west north south and up down
right and in fact this cube because it's
so familiar i'm going to keep returning
to it as we go through the talk because
it's sort of a grounding concept and we
can derive an everything that i'm going
to talk about today thank you and
another thing to think about is that the
cube is it is what we call a three-zone
so nahin dhryn and you might see there
but the relationship between that and
the name zone it's based on agree the
name is sort of a rock of the word dome
and zona heatran and what that means is
really quickly here's a star of the
other thing is that it's just Cartesian
coordinates and you can see that that
all the edges of the Q are going to be
parallel with one of those three lines
and so that's all it is but if I hug
around here I've got one zone if i go
around there you can see these edges are
all parallel that's another zone if i go
around this way that's a third zone
that's the z axis that we always need to
respect that we're building compressive
buildings on the earth because otherwise
they'll fall over so again the reason
that we don't know that there's a number
three that in the kiln is because we
don't normally stand the cubano if we
did we see that there's there's three
squares coming here
and so that's the yellow one it's got a
triangular cross-section right here okay
and I pass them around you'll be able to
feel it it's also constraints twisted
and middle as its applied wine that's an
interesting question where the odd
numbers twisted and the even numbers
straight that is the to this straight
and the three of the five or twisted it
has nothing to do with sexual
orientation it's just an interesting
question so if I stick this this yellow
line into the cube here and I rotate it
three times it lines up with yourself
right for better way to see if you turn
on the light I'll show you you can
actually project a shadow along that
threefold axis of symmetry it's only
been a hexagon right which is like 22
times three in two dimensions it's
Benson it's a number six or two times
three in two dimensions now so far what
I phone you is there's a relationship
between the shape of the strut it's
vector in space right that is coming off
here that's a vector in space and and
the number that represents but what
about the length i put this shredded
here you can see the length is right
across that diagonal of the cube active
my shoulders
you see that it's a fishy a body
centered cube by angle and if we want to
calculate the length of it you could
take the factors 12 hour plus one
squared goes well it's worth square root
of that is root 3 over 2 you know which
turns out to be cosine 30 30 goes into
360 right because it's 30 degrees is a
piece of a circle 12 times right which
is two times two times three that's
interesting also you can see really
clearly the length of the yellow line is
exactly the height of an equilateral
triangle make with these strokes so
disappears there's this intimate
relationship between now in order to
understand so we're going to go to four
dimensions a couple of times actually
with the number three the number four if
you'll accept that the tubes like a
three dimensional lumber for and with
the number five where it gets a little
interesting so I'm going to start out
with the number three because here we
have this line this line segment two
points make a line right and and i'm
calling it a one dimensional number 3
i'm pulling the ball point so it's a
zero dimensional number three why what
you call anything plane could be a
projection of anything it does
right to be Einstein's brain give
yourself eating watermelon anything you
want question so we call a point zero
dimensional three now we all remember
that the distance between the shortest
distance between two points is a
straight line right and I've made up
these little things this morning I don't
think they're going to they may not work
but I've got these two points here and
if I have more time you can see using
bubbles and this is another way actually
to figure out the relationship between
points in space and you see that that
bubble maybe I can roll it up against of
the screen you can see that the bubble
being very lazy wants to make a line
between the two points get equal you
just sort of see that line right so the
bubbles tell you it's a shortest
distance between two points that's
that's pretty simple right we're all
nerds we kind of knew that already what
about the shortest distance between
three points i play guess what's your
name let me the cars loro game it's the
shortest distance between three balls
three points a B and C right you got
there they are if you see into the
triangle way anything just draw an idea
yeah
well how gonna try them right say your
cable guy and you need to wire these
three houses together and you okay put a
line each one source just to 10 points
of the lines over so yeah three points
with us your three lines of course your
boss composes worry about this right you
can still you just as easily done it be
the question is is there more elegant
solution and in fact there is the bubble
nose and what it is like you're gonna
that looks like them and if you turn on
the light we can show you seeing
solution okay and that actually works it
would work with those three points but
i'm not going to chance it so you can
see the real the real shortest distance
between two three points is is that
symbol is on your hubcap alright so now
we know i can even do the fortis charts
distance between four points because we
got assistant right anyway what's it
going to be
facility center point okay this will be
an X to the square right okay let's
let's let's try and find out and and
again you could do this with with four
points it was there all along I don't
see this and in fact is when your life
no I can you see what what we're getting
here it tricked you right it looks like
that's all this one up cousin some honey
can you see right the student and in
fact I mean you can actually put the X
in a box you can let you can those are
green lines in zone you can measure but
it's actually longer than then these
things aurealis one blue line for some
reason and anyway this is kind of an
interesting shape and we'll get to it
later you might ask you what the
shortest distance between five points is
since i'm talking about two three and
five all right but I'll get to it
instead i'm going to show you there's a
relationship between this and the number
five and does it later okay now we need
to get up to four dimensions real quick
now tell me what time it is we've gone
so we're halfway through is this is 45
minutes or 60 I that's how you can go
from okay well I'll try not to go over
but I'll have to talk fast alright so
we're getting back to this we're calling
this on two-dimensional number three
right and this would be or one
dimensional number three is to be a zero
dimension buggers remember pretty right
so 1.0 dimensions two points one
dimension how many lines make a triangle
okay so three lines two dimensions how
many triangles make a tetrahedron for ya
tetrahedrons for facebook pretty cheap
now for those of you they're not
grounded or don't know the tetrahedra
it's really easy to find right let's
take the q here and we put
check mark in every box or a slash
across every box to in order to connect
the partners and we get this model to
technically group that's oriented in a
way that we've not used used to it it
looks normal equally oriented to gravity
it looks like this pyramid with the
triangle for the base okay alright so
now now that we've gotten grounded now
you know the chapter here it's easy to
derive from the cube we need to go to
four dimensions now we have a pattern
here right one point through two points
one to mention three lines two
dimensions for triangles three
dimensions right so how many
three-dimensional triangles make a fort
mitchell triangle one two three four
times five you're right okay let's do it
and see if we if we think a bubble go
ahead you're on the Lightning's you can
see that you can you see the reflection
yes this would be a shadow of four
dimensional cube now if it were a
regular tetrahedron a regular four
dimensional number three right and then
all these lines would be the same length
they've been squashed right they've been
sort of flattened out and you can do
some other cool things with this going
to deconstructivism you can make a
catenary curve see that good first
architects right that's that's the best
shape for a park or if I if I not got
another one of these I get a hyperbolic
paraboloid and that would be the
universe Einstein's four dimensional
universe that's worth my time it's kind
of a million
so anyway we've gone to four dimensions
let me let me show you once again here's
another model of that thing you can see
what we have actually inside here it is
a tetrahedron a carbon tetrahedron right
and of course I if you look at diamond
it will take this form it'll actually
use those those those tetrahedra in
their most relaxed form if it actually
is more difficult to come by but once it
gets there it's very very very stable
it's the hardest natural material own
planet if it were the normal form of
carbon we see is graphite which is just
made up hexagons and they kind of slough
off each other so they're they're a
little bit weaker than than the diamond
shape and of course the carbon actually
opens up a whole world of of
nanotechnology buckyballs and so forth
and I didn't bring buckyball today but
you can build on the zone you can do all
kinds of weird things now to Bucky years
you name it it's this Creek it's pretty
amazing what you can do with this not
and we have to think that there is a
relationship that geometry is actually
kind of embedded in space and that's why
you can bill too many of these things
by the way Richards molly was one of our
customers I don't know if Harry proto
ever guy got ahold of us azone kit but
Richard Smalling is longer discovered
buckminsterfullerene he said it would be
a lot easier if he'd had some biz East
but you took a six-pack of beer a bunch
of paper plates and was cutting things
all night trying to figure out what this
the c60 Adam could possibly look like
it's a bunch of hexagons peg I'm gonna
whip it off in two or three minutes
what's all but issue where am I like to
get through the water but let's see I
think we can go on to the
three-dimensional are the four
dimensional number four
which is really cute we're still calling
the queue a three dimensional number
four and as we already said the square
is a two dimensional number four so a
line segment of length 2 zone would be a
one dimensional number four right now I
haven't thought about this for a second
but slipped our minds we'll get back to
it I guess the idea that you need to
know when we're going four dimensions
with this particular object is the idea
perpendicularity right which we all get
because we're on earth but the fact that
matter is anybody that could walk gets
perpendicularity right because you can't
walk without getting perpendicular okay
but I do this with kids I have something
come up and try to knock me over I was
they like myself because I'm
perpendicular to earth parallel force of
gravity so the idea is if you take my
take up a point and I drag it through
space for a certain amount of time say
one medium blue struck per second one
one-thousand i trace out a one
dimensional number four let's call it
that if i drag that through space in the
direction perpendicular again a two
dimensional number for the cube if i
drag that in a direction perpendicular
to the other to extrude right when we
get
right and the left the rest would be
left to the reader is an exercise right
it's obvious how to get to four
dimensions which I keep which I keep
talking about this day because this is
really fun okay now the cool thing is
you can do things by analogy and so if
you imagine that I was a two-dimensional
artist living in this plane go ahead and
turn on the light but work with that and
I said look there's this thing called
three dimensions in fact it could take a
square you can make a three-dimensional
square it's called Q Roman calling you
and all you have to do is drag the Cuban
a direction or the square depression
perpendicular to the other two
directions so wait a second you know
we're stuck in a pipe I can't possibly
do that right but if we were just then I
say okay let's just try dragging the
square in an arbitrary direction it
doesn't really matter right just just
slide along and we'll trace out a shadow
of this three-dimensional cube and so
that's what we do take this and we
dragged along these speed line you can
see what we get it traces out this day
right
which we can see
it's pretty similar right to the shadow
that I hope here
but of course the flattening do
something you're you're living in the
chalkboard with me right now I'm really
forget that in you said that this the
cube was going to be made up of six
squares you can't call that a square
right there's no way things to flattened
out right you can't call that is where I
see those two but the rest of them were
distorted oh yeah well that's because of
the projection from three dimensions ok
so now if we jump back to three
dimensions will do the same thing will
say ok let's just drag the cube through
space in a direction that's
perpendicular to the upper three he's
right anybody want to do it for me come
on we're gonna kid we ran out of
dimensions what time
oh I better go like it's over well
actually what if we were to do the same
thing just drag it through space that in
an arbitrary direction along the speed
lines and we'll assume that it will
trace out a shadow of a fourth before
dimensional cube right now in real life
all these lines can be the same language
all the cubes would be perpendicular to
each other all eyes would be right
here's the star of that right now we've
thrown in a fourth dimension right these
these three blue lines in space are
obviously perpendicular with this yellow
lines also in particular it's just been
flattened out when we pressed it into
our hyperplane so I could have that see
it now of course the doubting Thomases
will say well how come there you've
gotta love squash cubes in it well same
thing was distorted by perspective and
you can count them you see those two
regular news and then there's going to
be six of these babies that line up with
x y and z
and squash pierced okay now was that
convincing argument for good thing let's
predict how many cubes there really are
I've got two points like a line four
lines make a square six squares make a
cube how many cubes make a hypercube
yeah hey of course the number pattern
works out great and then and you can
also do it with with the number of
points right in one dimension you have
two points the two dimensions you have 2
squared points the three dimensions you
have three cubed points right so yeah
eight times in four dimensions you have
2 to the 4 16 so you can just keep going
forever if you wanted to build a 61
dimensional cube projected in the three
space you would need at our current rate
of production of a good day to the 61
balls which would take us about 731
billion years to make now why in the
world would you want to build a 61
dimensional hypercube projected in the
three space we'll get to that okay trust
me right over that time okay um now so
far I've just been talking about the
numbers two and three and they have some
pretty neat relationships in space but
five is much more cool oh I forgot what
it put the hypercube into a different
perspective does anybody have a pen
light well let's pretend you do
here I feel like this go ahead turn 11
yeah I can show you see that that shadow
you can think of that as a perspective
shadow of the cube right okay here it is
let's be completely squashed in fact if
you're looking down a hallway then
that's what you see right and you see
that the little squares far away that's
the wall in the back of the hall the big
square is closed up and all these other
ones are sort of receding away again
doubting Thomases in to eventually see
what I you knowyou know you're kidding
that's a square at all totally distorted
trapezoid but but we see all the time we
project three dimensional cubes or three
zones on a Hedra on to our red not a
two-dimensional surface all the time and
move around so now all you have to do is
think uh Kevin four-dimensional eyeball
and of course I have to do this because
I get to do a cool bottle so here we go
see if I can get it here
oops
okay so there it is right it's a
prospective shadow of a four dimensional
cube and of course the little cube is
far away from your four-dimensional
eyeball but big cubes close up and all
the other ones are receiving the white
not it doesn't make sense because the
little cubes in the center but remember
this thing is completely blacked out I
mean this thing is embedded in the
hyperplane of your retina so it's been
completely squashed and so it doesn't
really make sense to say well that's in
the center so how can it be the first
furthest thing away it's just a
projection system and likewise we saw
here we can look we can do the math
again we've got one little cube in the
middle a big cube on the outside and
then we've got all these squash cubes
right there's three four five six seven
eight so it's consistent we can see
there's eight points and little eight
points on the outside so it's got 16
vertices everything is mathematically
consistent so who dealt negative for
conventional it exists in fact I hope
you accept something number five okay
once again if you want to get to the
number five let's start with a cube I'm
still having to put in 10 computers okay
and all you have to do to get to a three
dimensional number five is just put a
hip roof on it right well that's I guess
not all oh yeah here it is all right
nice little house I'm sure this is
something we could make its ketchup
right
now if we keep putting groups on it all
the way around we get this shape
this is a donut
it just means it's got 12 faces at each
face is a number five a two-dimensional
number five right remember we're calling
that that zone the pentagonal strut is
enough for finding space now let's let
backup right I'm going to say that this
Pentagon here here's a pentagonal strut
it's a one dimensional number five
because I want to prove again or at
least indicate I can't prove anything
artists right and just see my seat but
this has a length of cosine 18 and so
we're calling it a one dimensional
number 5 cosine 18 is what it's about
well it's exactly a twentieth of a servo
which is two times two times five what
do you know and the height is really
cool to find Pentagon real quick but
here we're just do it like that can you
see that coming on you can see it's
exactly the height of a Pentagon the
shorts blue sweats so once again I'm
claiming that there's a relationship
between the length of the scrub the
shape and strut then the scribe and the
number represents but what again what
about the vector and here's a cool think
somebody just take this red strut and
stick it into anyone of the red wolf
anyone it doesn't matter which put in
the inside the outside the ball whatever
weird if I casting a shadow with that
and all we have to do is have this
parallel with the light rays
sorry there it is see what we have there
what what's the outside shape can you
see it
it's got a coming aside 1010 sighs it's
a decagon right which is 12 times five
in two dimensions so there's a
relationship between the vector 2 and
you really literally could have put this
into any one of the holes and there's 12
to choose from on every ball so it's 144
holes to choose from always works out so
we've got this model question is can we
bump it up to four dimensions right what
I'm claiming is that again the number to
another five sprout the red struttin
zone is a one dimensional number five
the Pentagon would be a two dimensional
number five we mention all number five
this would be a three dimensional number
five anybody want to try to do this
stupid numbers right here we're going
two points to align the Bible Astrid
hang up 12 Pentagon's to a dodecahedron
what's next what's important measures
yeah I wouldn't try to do it turns out
to be it's 2 times 5 times 12 or 120 so
there's 120 dodecahedra cells glued
together face to face to make the
four-dimensional Pentagon yeah some
people are looking over here I suppose I
should hold it up and it's been
creatively named by the mathematicians
120 cells when and turn on the light
makes us cool shadows I don't know we'd
see it's always fun to cash out with
five me along with five hold access to
see that that's kind of fun there's a
number five again you can put a red
strutting in any hole if that works i'll
lose it about a number two
it's much easier to do this with a
parallel light source like go outside
doing with sunlight because it really is
cool there's thought for instance he's
not a square in this whole thing and get
squares pop out you see the squares the
corners and that weird and then I think
I can do a number three Trump I left
here others
there's a three-fold be can you see how
there's there's three all over the place
it's kind of powder months we've got a
chat with you you know it had a long
difficult axis of symmetry that you got
six everywhere now this is kind of an
interesting shape because if you'll
notice it's got a regular donated you
note with not just three dimensional
number five in the middle and then as
you go out and get flatter and flatter
and this is it this could be sort of
explained if we take the pentagon we
start to rotate it in space so what we
do that turn on the light again and I'll
show you here's so this is parallel with
the viewing screen then that would be a
regular pentagon if I start rotating
like that it squashes and squashes again
if I keep going and flattens out
completely on the line segments and you
can actually see that I mean here they
are here's a fat squashes Guinea squad
from the line segments you could then
they're actually it's like they're these
hot spots in zone so kind of when I'm
rotating this big kind of goes kachunk
and it sticks into one chunk it sticks
into another the kitchen it's flattened
out completely and those show up in this
model although in fact the whole model
is made from those four different
Pentagon's a regular one and then and
then to squashes in the flat one that
works in in three dimensions as well
Thor to take a regular dodecahedron here
it is
back there and I start rotating it in a
hyper plane that's different from our
own what happens is it starts getting
squashed cheap right there's there's a
Squatch one and then it gets squashed a
little bit more that was a body fat five
fullest squash alone flat fold axis of
symmetry here's a three-fold one here's
the skinny 502 again right and then
finally you get this dystopic platform
which is yeah of course what I did here
was I put it that has the cube in the
middle of right so if I for example
shuffled up does that look familiar at
all tell me it is like what's familiar
about them
so on this was that not on to something
i trick you now you're talking about
what I drew all right well I guess I'll
turn like this and I put the blue on in
there and you see that yeah there's the
Q inside the dodecahedron and now look
it's got that weird shaking milk which
is what is just see that sure it's just
the shortest distance between four lines
know that to me we're traveling through
another dimension not a dimension of
sight or sound with mine next stop the
twilight zone that happens I I have
those moments with this thing just you
know it just it just works that way it's
really weird it all these coincidences
that are offended and I think it has to
do with those hot spots anyway let me
one other thing if you check this thing
out I want to all go ahead passed around
this pretty sturdy model noticed it on
the surface there Holly's flattened out
dodecahedra being completely flat all
over the place there's like 30 oh and
that's kind of weird to the idea is as
you travel out from that dodecahedron in
the center the things get more and more
squash and write like this until they're
completely flat on the surface because
again it's a projection from four
dimensions in the three dimensions and
the hyperplane this dodecahedron is in
is perpendicular to ours so it's
completely flat just like what I turned
the Pentagon around turning to align say
it's the very same thing
so it works by Ali now course I already
did bubble models of the cube and the
DOTA game demos were tagged cool right
the Cuban the tetrahedron right the
three dimensional number for the four
dimensional number three was this one
this one right the four-dimensional
number four if you'll indulge me would
be this one right so you want to see the
four-dimensional number five yeah but
you can't sorry but but it's such a cool
but I'll do it anyway assuming that the
gods are with me because this is a
little interesting to me
ok
see if I can get
like I said look tricky right away
okay can I call that
now that this this is not the
four-dimensional number five but to
later it actually is the seed from which
that will grow because you're starting
out with a regular dodecahedron to the
center than these squash ones 12 in the
squadron's surrounding and in fact is
that there's an article in the notices
of the AMS american mathematical society
that shows the whole thing they had a
bubble it just really is literally to be
done as as a bubble model they had to be
done with a computer graph here because
I don't know somebody's good enough for
the straw okay how am i doing on time oh
okay stop the hours to me no you go for
good tender oh thank you thank you so
much I'll go fast okay no one thing
about about this model it's got that one
cube in it right but you can see if I
were to take the pentagonal face and I
were to draw that line link to the light
on there's this this is one edge of a
cube right but guess what there's up
there's four other what that means is
there's actually five cubes embedded in
the dodecahedron and for those of you
who think real estate it stays expensive
well as because we're living in only one
of the five fields right for other sir
did we have any pics floor again
now if you were to take the intersection
of those five cubes on the inside of
that you would get on the inside of the
dodecahedron you would get this object
which is really cool i love it because
you make all of its shadows what's up
here's that there's one along a two-fold
axis lipsy like it'll do something same
time
sorry you see
pretty sometimes
and what's cool about this is on this
model here this is made up of diamonds
in the divine proportion I don't know if
you remember from a dog with docket
mathmagic land they did this so he had
heard the bone proportion and they do
the start and they draw another one side
they say oh this was a secret symbol and
what was it the Pythagorean society and
people have been killed for this
information being given out well it's
pretty cool I mean the divine proportion
actually determines all the links in
zone right there for x those
one-dimensional two three and five but
anyway in this case if you look at this
to this you get you get the golden
proportion and if you look and then when
it projects down you get this nutty
rectangle with golden proportions which
is really strange right like it's going
from from one set of hot spots in space
to another but it's preserving that
divine proportion sort of like when we
have the cubes in that biggie right or
the squares that show up along two-fold
axis of symmetry is really weird now if
I look at our Long a three-fold axis
system can this will be a little
familiar
probably looks like that the cube that
we didn't want to go and why not right
because it's actually 5 cubed and again
here is this is visible at the shoutout
build the very same playing zone if you
look at it long the number 5 which will
do it here went right in you get this
really interesting shape which again you
can see the outside is the decking on
the number 10 in space and you've got
all these interpenetrating stars so here
it is no it's cool is it better to do
hidden line removal in that drawing I
would get this guy which is a Penrose
tiling this is good if this is cool okay
here you know about you know about Roger
Penrose he's the Sun physicist
mathematician who's been called a 21st
century Einstein because he's been doing
all this stuff with string theory 10
dimensions 11 dimensions maybe but I
digress anyway he came up as a magic was
dye actually we could call this a
rickard tiling to with the scientific
matters Clark record who is an artist
who helped to develop zone in the 60s
actually came up with the diamonds and
Penrose had a a more crude version of
what he called kites and dart but what
he did was he came up with matching
rules which proved that these things
could tile the 2-dimensional plane
infinitely and never repeat themselves
nobody whoa what's up what's up with
that well theoretical physicist grabbed
on this and they said well maybe it can
be done in three dimensions and in fact
a cab and you can tile the plane
infinitely would be babies right these
are these are squashed cubes and they
fit together if you take actually 10 of
each you can build this guy and you can
actually go forever and it will never
repeat himself okay the cameras picked
up on this and this is really nice they
said well hey you can make crystals like
and then this guy gags checkland Israeli
scientists working at the National
Institute for Standards abducted in
technology and gaithersburg out here
anyway he actually discovered them and
he took him into the office of his boss
who it adds multiple 20 get in my office
no way but actually it proved to be true
and it actually caused what they say is
a Copernican revolution in
crystallography which up to that point
and then called the clothes discipline
you know you could not have crystals
with fivefold symmetry nor could you
have crystals that have patterns that
would repeat infinitely but never repeat
themselves I mean that they vivid tile
if but that never repeat themselves so
was it was a big moment in
crystallography when they came up of
course all of the quasi crystal
scientists from many of them bought zone
kids in a very crude form from us
including dr. Penrose and and also minus
Paul and right before he died because he
was trying to prove the quasi crystals
don't exist go figure but anyway what I
think is really cool about this is you
start out with start right here's Clark
burger playing around with it in the
early 60s making making these patterns
right and then Roger Penrose formalizes
the mat and then it goes to the
theoretical physicist medic chemists and
finally it becomes a reality now what's
up with that it's like we created these
things in our minds and then and then
there it was possible to make them for
reals Nene you know and not only that we
started out making them they're really
hard to make it would take you to have
to take this aluminum manganese alloy
and they would cool it at the rate of
millions of degrees per second in order
to get these things and what would
happen i think is all those you know
normally would it would crystallize out
into a cubic pattern the atoms have
their time to think about it but if you
did it
in this really strange they have to jump
into any one of the five cubes and they
were just say okay we'll just take
people tick whatever we can get if you
have another time to think about it but
after a while they were able to anneal
these things for days and still get
blood all over the planet okay well now
I'm gonna get to the really weird part
okay this this thing could be called a
shadow of a six dimensional cube and
some of the Russian causing crystal
scientist even proposed that that's what
prosecutors work that they were some
projection from the sixth dimension can
you see why here's the star and it's got
six lines passing through space if these
were all perpendicular that it would be
six dimensions a guy named fedorov a
Russian crystallographer actually said
that there's a relationship between and
end zones on a heater like this this is
six songs on the unit and an
n-dimensional outer shell of a cube
shuttle so that's what this is the
shadow is X dimensional cube now you can
go with the yellow lines there's there's
actually 10 lines in space with the blue
ones there's 15 if you add together you
get 31 if you throw in the green lines
you get 61 and this is what I'm saying
that zome is actually a projection of a
61 dimensional hypercube unless in three
space so you have you told you to leave
for myself first but that that's how
those hot spots are created and that's
where you get this this amazing number
five one other thing to note is remember
on this one you go to 512 120 been
opposed to infinity can you get there's
no such thing is that object was fine
fivefold symmetry to find emotions it
has something to do with the fact that
there's no
kind of equation but don't ask me about
a mathematician so I was going to do
fruits and vegetables real quick okay
because what we didn't really get to is
the divine proportion if you look at an
apple for instance what like it's if you
can do this remember Jaime Escalante oh
my god I get the star in the mill of the
Apple right so it's a it's a
thoughtfulness the banana right you get
a three-fold and it's y'all right Dean
color-coded What's Up dad but what's
really cool is on those numbers get
together remember 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21
one of those numbers anyway Fibonacci
right they show up everywhere in nature
here is a an artichoke when Colonel
Adams me to see this an artichoke which
has spirals eight spirals in one
direction five spirals in the other
direction right or if you look at it at
a rose it's got spirals of three and
five or if you look at the pineapple
it's got this really turns got 13 21 and
34 now what's going on here why are they
using these numbers well I don't really
know but you can see it everywhere me
when you get done with this and I'll be
done in three minutes okay look around
but at the plants here you'll see these
fires everywhere it's just as part of as
part of nature's design and in fact if
you go to infinity add infinity two
consecutive numbers and then Fibonacci
sequence the ratio of the tool that's
what anybody
the divine proportion right which is
embedded in filaments everywhere so what
I think about what I think about what
nature is doing I think nature is doing
this kind of rational approximation of
the Divine Right it's a ratio of two
numbers and it's an approximation of the
divine proportion i'm not talking about
creationism or anything like that it's
also kind of weird so once again I'm
going I'll conclude with that what I was
saying about what you can do with ones
and zeroes right it's an amazing thing
it's a beautiful creation that we've
made this information economy or ecology
creating access to the masses to the
world's information it's unbelievable
well that's ones and zeros and it's and
it's a virtual reality that is
incredible and it empowers us an
incredible way what nature is doing with
the numbers 2 3 &amp;amp; 5 it's real virtuosity
and it's been there all along but it's
completely unexplored we work right now
we're about in the same place with
understanding this as fun Nolan was in
1947 right I talked a little bit about
attitudes I talked a little bit about
quasi crystals I talked about how nature
manifests these numbers and yet that's
nothing compared to the power of these
numbers they can think of it in terms of
architecture or or superconducting
batteries and cars any number of
applications that dinner that are based
in the real world right we haven't even
begun to explore what you can do
with those relationships between those
numbers because what's going on really
my opinion is that these numbers 2 3 &amp;amp; 5
are knotted together form the structure
of the universe the Greeks thought that
these five platonic solid I'll we showed
you three of them right the cube the
tetrahedron we're actually the five
elements fine this earth air water and
fire right but what about this way they
decided this was the shape of the
universe the Kepler Johannes Kepler was
so impressed that all of those can be
derived from each other just like I
built him up to the cube that he came up
with this kind of 16th century theory of
everything in which the planets the
distance between the planets were
determined by seeing these these five
platonic solids in hemispheres right and
so that that was his theory it was a
spectacular failure in history and he
laid the groundwork of modern cosmology
by failing so badly right today there's
actually radio telescope e data that
shows the universe may in fact be shaped
like an empty angry it's about 18
billion light years across so don't
worry about keeping the border anytime
soon and if you did it's like a house of
mirrors and poppers of that
side anyway something to think about
anyway something but uh anyway it was
fine because thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
