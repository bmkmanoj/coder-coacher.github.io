the open source software series speaker
a lot of asses their speaker series I'm
Mike Pinkerton I'm a software engineer
at Google and I'm going to be talking
about a variety of things especially
encompassing the the lessons that we
learned from Mozilla and specifically
convenience it's sort of one of the
first questions you know what do I have
to say why why come listen to anything
that I have to say I've done quite a bit
in the open source community in the last
six or seven or eight years I was an
engineer at Netscape for about five
years I was on the team that opened the
source open the netscape communicator
source to the public as part of the
Mozilla project I was on the team that
designed zool dar cross-platform user
interface language which is what Firefox
is built in so I was I was on that
original engineering team i'm also a
super reviewer as part of mozilla which
means that i have for secondary level of
review over all the code that gets
checked in so i can i can say yay or nay
on pretty much anything that goes in the
entire mozilla source base i'm also the
project lead of a little mac browser
called the called Kamino which is
probably the main reason why you're here
but what we're going to what we're
really going to be talking about is not
necessarily so much Camino we there is
going to be a good amount of Kamino talk
but what I also want to highlight is a
lot of the lessons that we've learned
through the entire process so starting
with opening up the source from Mozilla
and how that caused us to need to do
Camino and what lessons we then learn
from from interacting with the community
moving forward but to really understand
all that to understand why we are where
we are today we have to understand how
all of this got started you know why is
there a camino why is there a Firefox
why is there even a Mozilla so we need
to go back to nineteen ninety-eight
so if everyone sort of joins me in our
way back machine back to nineteen
ninety-eight there was really only two
browsers at the time there was Netscape
communicator and microsoft internet
explorer IE for had just was either just
coming out or had already come out i
don't remember exactly and they were
starting to to rapidly gained market
share by undercutting netscape's
business model which was at the time
selling communicator for thirty or forty
dollars through retail channels and
giving away you know giving away to to
academics so the the business model for
the company as a whole was selling this
product and microsoft was giving it away
for free so there's you know there's an
obvious consumer choice do i do i pay or
do i download for free it's usually
pretty obvious so netscape was watching
its its market share dwindle and we
realized we had to change the rules
there was really nothing else that we
could do in terms of competing directly
with microsoft because they had vastly
greater resources they had vastly
greater monetary resources and also
engineering you know microsoft was in a
position where they wanted that they had
a target on that scape and they would do
and spend any amount of money in order
to to realize that goal so they very
easily could have put 500 engineers on
on internet explorer and just out
engineer us and just do a lot more than
we could possibly do as a small company
in netscape was a big deal but even in
1998 it was still a relatively small
company by by today's standards so we
realized we had to change the rules as
internet explorer was was slowly
becoming more and more a part of the
operating system with with 98 we knew
that there was that microsoft was was
going down a path of no return the more
that they were building into the
operating system meant that they
couldn't easily pull it out later so we
wanted to go somewhere that we knew they
couldn't go and that one of one of those
places was open source
we could open source our browser we
could open source all of the all of the
technologies involved and Microsoft
couldn't follow us because to do that
they've locked themselves into the
operating system and they certainly
weren't going to go into open source
windows 98 so this was certainly one one
area that we could go where we knew we
had a few steps on them before that they
could they could switch everything and
catch up the other thing that we wanted
to harness was this this great community
of hackers and developers in the open
source that would come to our rescue
they come flocking to help netscape
defeat Microsoft and having the code
available to them would allow them to
you know to help us fix bugs to help us
add features to help us make the product
a lot better and again Microsoft
wouldn't be able to leverage the same
resources because they wouldn't be able
to open source so we were looking at
this great hacker community and we were
looking at the the general anti
Microsoft sediment which there there is
still a lot of today and we wanted to
capture and harness that so we created
this project called source 331 and the
source 331 project was to take the
Netscape communicator source code which
was then just down to the browser for
logistical purposes and released that on
March thirty first nineteen ninety-eight
that's where the 331 comes from so i can
i can probably stand up here and talk
for about six hours just about that
specific project thankfully a during the
time that we were doing that there was a
documentary film crew who's following us
around the company they sort of started
a little bit before and then they
finished up about six to eight months
later but they made a PBS documentary
called code rush which you can go and go
to your local library and rent or I
think you can still buy it off PBS's
website so if you're if you're
interested about that period of time
with taking taking the the closed source
communicator and moving that into the
Mozilla world that's an excellent video
to watch and it's it's still interesting
to this day even even for
very engineering centric crowd what I
what I will say is that it it was a lot
of fun it was one of the one of the most
interesting projects I've ever been on
in terms of the group coming together
realizing this is we have to hit this
date we have to get this out we have to
do this for the community you know it
became more than just us doing something
to ship a product because it was it was
the birth of Mozilla it was you know day
one of Mozilla March thirty first
nineteen ninety-eight and we knew that
there was something bigger out there
that we were opening the door to
something that they could eventually
become really really great and also
helped Netscape kill Microsoft or at
least get them off our back a little bit
so we wouldn't we did that and
everything was a success 331 came and
win and we shipped on time great press
all of that and then we kind of had to
go back to work so what we were doing
during the time was we were working on
Netscape 5 and since we had just now
opened up the source for what was going
to be Netscape 5 all of the people in
engineering had to wear two hats we had
to wear our open source hat where we
wanted to do everything in public we
wanted to involve the community in every
decision we wanted to be upfront and
honest and you know not not hide
anything from our users from our
developers you know design documents
were in that we're in the open bug
system was in the open all of our
process was out there and we wanted to
really live in a fishbowl so that
everybody could see every part of our
process so as engineers we're adding new
features to the product we're fixing
bugs we're taking some patches from the
community like hey you know this this is
actually sort of working and and we
start making some pretty good progress
so we're we're probably a few months
from from beta of netscape 5 and
management comes to us and they say
we've got this other rendering engine
that we think that we think is really
good it's really fast it's really small
it does all of these w3c standards XML
HTML CSS download
whatever you know just all the HTML but
all the w3c buzzwords and you know we'd
like to investigate using this for
netscape 5 because you know one area
where microsoft was really starting to
kill us was web standards and
compatibility because they had a lot
more engineers than we did so we took a
look at doing something drastic like
switching layout engines so the
engineering groups stopped what we were
doing on netscape 5 and took about two
or three weeks to do a little bit of you
know just a little bit of sanity
checking we looked through the code we
tried to plot out a schedule for what it
would take to actually switch over the
product to use this new engine so the
the engine at the time was a grad
student project gone horribly wrong it
was very difficult to extend it was very
difficult to fix it was probably meant
to last no later than Netscape 1 and
here we are in netscape 5 so the fact of
moving to a cleaner codebase moving to
something that had been better
architected was something that everybody
wanted and that that project that new
other browser or that new other
rendering engine was called the Raptor
project and it was done by a group down
in San Diego from a company that we
purchased and had been rewritten it
started in Java or sardine C++ and was
rewritten in Java than it was ported by
back to C++ so they done a lot of
architecture and engineering and
thinking about it was a lot cleaner than
the spaghetti mess that we had Sarah was
really excited about it we took a lot we
we did a lot of research on it we said
you know you know this is just going to
take too long we figure it's going to
take a few months we're so close to
shipping beta let's just get beta out
there and then we'll go and we'll do it
so management said alright sounds good
thank you very much go back you know go
back on your merry way and so we kept
working on that scape five so me on the
Mac front-end team and Dave Hyatt who is
on the windows front-end team we were
just we just kept working you know all
the all the engineering teams just kept
moving along towards with a singular
focus of Netscape five then about eight
weeks later management came to us and
they got us all in a room they SAT us
down and they said you know that Raptor
project thing that we asked you about
the he said we didn't have time
to do what we're going to do it and your
projects dead so equity mean your
projects dead well what what we've been
working towards Nets k 5 which we'd
called grommet which was our code name
for for that project they came to us and
they said grommets dead we're not going
to do that we're going to completely
shift gears and we're going to base
everything off of this new rendering
engine okay great you know no engineer
likes to be told that all of their work
is just down the toilet but especially
no engineer likes to be told that you
know the last eight weeks when
management knew that are going to make
this decision anyway you know why didn't
they tell us eight weeks ago but it's
one thing for just us engineers just us
in the building at Netscape okay
management made a decision great big
deal you know management they change
their mind all the time they make these
crazy decisions that's why they're not
writing code but it's more than just us
at this point it's also the open source
community you know the engineers we've
been wearing our open source hats and
we'd been playing by the rules we've
been sharing everything that we that we
knew and everything we wanted to do and
everything we'd been doing with this
community this growing burgeoning
community and suddenly management came
and with a closed door decision said
we're not going to do any more of that
we're going to do this other thing and
they didn't bother to tell anybody in
the community they didn't let on they
didn't make any notion or you know any
any type of communication to the open
source community and so what what Dave
Hyatt did was he went into the bug
system and he took all two hundred and
something of his bugs at one time
checked them all and mark them as won't
fix and the comment was grommet is dead
or doing something else and that is how
the open source community found out that
we were doing this new thing which is
just just astounding that that would be
the only communication for this major
project to make a major change in
direction and the only communication was
a developer marking all their bugs won't
fix and so needless to say
the open source community was pretty
angry with us we lost a lot of Street
credit on that day there probably wasn't
much of a better way to do it I mean
there's given where we were given the
decision had already been made there
really weren't any good ways to tell the
community but this certainly wasn't the
right way and a lot of developers just
fled because they you know they said if
this is how you're going to work with
the open source community we don't want
anything to do with you and we lost a
tremendous amount of Street credit so
where were we well we no longer have
grommet sin you know now we're starting
from scratch and we no longer have a
huge chunk of our open source community
all right well the next sort of shoe to
drop was that management came to us and
they said you know before where we had
multiple multiple platform teams we had
a Windows team and a Mac team and a
Linux team we don't have the money to do
that anymore so you guys can either
figure out how to do it in one team
where we're going to do it for windows
only and the engineers kind of looked at
her we looked at each other and Netscape
had it at the time had a very rich
history of being cross platform
basically from day one it was
cross-platform and we were very proud of
the fact that we were able to ship on 20
platforms at the same time with every
single release and so it was ingrained
in our culture to not just ship for
windows certainly it was a priority at
the company because that's where all the
money was but in the engineering
community it was hard grained into us to
be cross-platform so what we did was we
we came up we took a step back and we
came up with a new plan we realized that
you know if we were going to do this
cross platform that we needed we needed
something new we looked around at all
the cross-platform toolkits and there
really wasn't anything that was
worthwhile but we also made the
realization that there's sort of two
camps when it comes to designing
software there's the people that that
have the experience doing design and HCI
and you know all of the all of the good
user interface background like that's
what they've gone to school for they
know certain certain technologies like J
believe they know web standards they
know HTML because they've been doing web
layout web design you know they're
they're good at Photoshop they can
probably right a little bit of
JavaScript so you know that's that's
sort of one camp those are the people
that that know how to design software
for users and then there's the other
camp which is the programmers the people
that actually take what the designers
say and implement it and the programmers
well they can't design to save their
lives and all they know is this magical
language that converts you know English
text to bits and bytes C++ or you know
whatever programming language the
designers don't know C++ and the people
that know C++ don't know how to do
design and so there's this huge mismatch
between what the designers hand over and
what the programmers end up implementing
it also really takes the designers out
of the process because you know they
they're just sort of handing things over
the wall and then magic happens magic
that nobody understands unless you have
a CS degree and you know 15 years of
school behind you to to make something
actually show up on the screen so that
you taking the two camps in and they
were very separated so we wanted to we
wanted to reduce that gap we wanted to
to take the abilities that these
designers had the very strong you I
skills and make it easy for them to make
you eyes themselves so how do we do that
well we give them tools that use the the
languages and the the skills that they
already have HTML Dom javascript CSS XML
and that's how zool came about so we
were able to make a cross-platform you I
language that allowed designers to
actually put bits on the screen that you
could interact with so now you no longer
had to go to UI design or UI tests and
show people pieces of paper and move
little scraps of paper around they could
actually make real you is that did
things and they didn't have to have ten
years of schooling to do it so it really
sort of changed change the world but of
course we had to build all of this you
know it's a great idea but now someone's
actually got a code
so in addition to building with a new
layout engine we were building on top of
that a UI layer which you know writing
from scratch and on top of that our
marketing department told us that this
new version of Netscape had to have
every single feature of the old version
of Netscape plus more because who wants
to download just the same old thing so
we were making an exact copy of Netscape
communicator and adding more features
while we were at it on top of a UI layer
that was being written from scratch on
top of a rendering engine that barely
laid out the top 100 pages if that so
needless to say we had a lot of work
ahead of us and we certainly had we
certainly had some difficulties so after
a few years of going through this pain
you know trying to involve the open
source community at every turn but we
didn't really get a lot of involvement
because we sort of told them to go away
earlier we get to the point where we
have to make a call and we have to ship
something for the fear of completely
becoming obsolete you know nobody would
remember who Netscape was unless we
actually ship something to users so what
we ended up doing is we just took the
whole ball we called it netscape 6 and
we shipped it and that was in I think
2000 and it was crap it was absolute
total unadulterated crap I feel I feel
terrible that my name is connected
somehow with that software project
because it was just something that I
wouldn't even tell my friends to use you
know it's not something that was really
fit for human consumption it was just we
have to get this out or we'll face being
obsolete so certainly you know we we
took our pounds in the press because
we'd spent two or more years I mean it'd
been almost three years since I stayed
for had shipped and here we ship this
brand new thing on this great new
rendering engine and nobody wants to use
it for good reason so we went back to
the drawing board and we
we were actually able to spend the time
that we needed to do some improvements
we were able to improve performance we
were able to improve memory consumption
we were able to spend the time to do a
lot of the polish that we didn't have
time for the first go around so that was
Netscape 6.1 and you know it sort of
sucked a little less you know it was
something that we could almost use on a
daily basis and then 6.2 came out and
you know it was actually usable it was
actually pretty good you know from from
the history of you know starting over
from scratch and the whole debacle of
Netscape 6 by the time it got to 62
people could actually use it and it was
actually something that you'd want to
tell your friends that you worked on
then went to Netscape 7 was the next
major release and people to this day
still use Netscape 7 as their browser
you know given given all the badness in
its history it actually turned out
pretty good so where am I okay the
problem that we face though especially
on the mac side is that we were
constrained by a lot of the
infrastructure decisions that were made
long long ago on the Raptor side and
wrapped her then became gecko which
you've probably all heard of gecko a lot
of the decisions in the infrastructure
of gecko were very window centric it was
designed for windows it was built for
windows the fact that it could be ported
to other operating systems was an
afterthought and we actually had to go
and do that after we'd already decided
that we were going to use this and so
through through that and into zool we
were constrained by a lot of the things
we were able to do we weren't really
able to make it as native feeling or
even as native looking as we wanted
because a lot of those very low level
constraints and a bunch of us started
thinking you know should we spend ten
years putting all of this effort into
making zool better or should we try
something else should we try and you
know should we go in a different
direction at about that same time Apple
approach
full approach Netscape and said you know
we're thinking about doing a new browser
can you guys mock something up work
something up so that maybe we can put
gecko into a Coco browser like okay sure
sounds great so Vitter and I did a lot
of work to to take the carbon widget
layer that was in that was in gecko at
the time poured it to Coco and then be
able to wrap that in a browser view and
so the very beginning of that was NS
browser view so we had something that we
could stick into a Coco application and
make just a very simple browser and we
called it NS browser view because you
know I had every intention that Apple is
going to take this and build a browser
and we were going to stick gecko into
the operating system it is all going to
be great obviously that didn't happen
but that's another story for another day
so we handle this code to allow people
to to put gecko into a Coco application
and with all of this swirl about well
you know how do we make zool be be
really good on the Mac we took a look at
we said well we've got this other thing
why don't we just build something in
cocoa directly YMS was all at all it's
you know it what Mac users really want
they want it to feel native they want it
to be fast they want it they want all of
their keyboard shortcuts to work right
they want the menus to work right they
want the buttons to to look the same way
as they do in all the other applications
you know these are things that are very
important to Mac users and you know
maybe maybe let's try something on the
side so a couple of us went off and high
it sort of started it and a bunch of us
sort of came in and we started doing
this little Coco browser wrapped around
gecko and we did it as part of Mazda org
and not initially is part of Mozilla and
people in the community took notice I
said you know this is kind of neat you
know because it's fast it's native and
it's gecko which meant that it had all
of the power and all of the rendering
compatibility that it's big brother in
netscape 7 had
so people in the community started to
gravitate to this they saw that we had
something you know it didn't really have
bookmarks and you know you could go back
and forth and maybe it maybe had a
bookmark bar at the time but it
certainly wasn't a full fried
full-fledged browser but they saw the
promise you know they saw these guys are
going in the right direction i think i'm
gonna i'm going to follow them and so
through it was it was chimera at the
time camara 01 02 03 serious very quick
iterations we got to the point where we
had a sizable community following it
wasn't too many developers it was mostly
just a user following but even though it
didn't do everything its big brother did
people were really attracted to it and
as part of that we were actually able to
get by off at Netscape to work on this
full-time so me and Simon Fraser Chris
sorry Kathy Brady Conrad Carlin a few
other folks this was our job our job was
to make a Netscape branded browser for
the Mac out of this little cocoa
open-source thing and we ended up
calling that Project X at the time so
I'd already moved back to move back to
Virginia I was still working for
netscape at the time so I guess this was
2000 2001 2002 we were working for AOL
they well it had purchased Netscape and
we were working full time on Project X
we had dedicated QA we had dedicated
engineering we're just the small little
team of Mac people working on something
that we finally felt really good about
after the debacle of Netscape 6 where
you know none of us we all felt like we
just wanted to hang up our hats and not
even be software developers anymore it
was that bad we finally felt like we
were working on something that we're
proud of this is going to be really
great this is going to be you know
world-changing for netscape in terms of
its ability to say look we take the Mac
community seriously if this is what Mac
users want we're going to give it to you
so we created Project X we took the
Chimera open source we did a little bit
of rebranding
you know paid Netscape developers
working on it and we are going to
release it at macworld that year the the
January macworld so we printed up all
these CDs I still got 10 or 20 of them
we printed up like 500 CDs we're going
to hand them out of macworld two days
before that macworld a nail executive
named david gang who we all refer to as
dr. evil got wind project x he was like
what's this project X chimera thing I
don't understand it and it boiled down
to the fact that Netscape already had a
browser at Netscape seven or maybe 71 by
then and he as vp of marketing or
whatever position he was that at the
time he didn't he couldn't found them
how to actually market to browsers like
why ship this other one if you already
have Netscape 7 I can't understand no
don't do it so he pulled the plug on us
two days before macworld so you know
needless to say we're all completely
devastated to gank yeah we had CDs
burned in everything we're all ready to
go and then they pulled the plug on us
so we couldn't just let this thing die
you know we put so much work in all
right we're so proud of it we knew it
was going to be something and so sort of
on the side a bunch of us just kept
working on it you know just the
day-to-day we'd spend a few hours some
of our QA people they'd been reassigned
but they kept working on it and we
finished it up we got it to a point
where it was really stable it was really
high quality and we called that at that
point Camino we had to ship ship the
name for copyright reasons we call the
Camino oh point seven and we push that
out the door and that was sort of a last
effort product of Netscape for for the
for the community and people loved it
they went crazy you know they even if
they hadn't been following the whole
history they saw this and they tell
their friends and they tell two friends
and so on and so on and the word of
mouth was just it was just insane people
love this little browser was fast it
rendered the whole internet it was Mac
native you know it did all the things
that they wanted a brow
to do and so we were all very encouraged
like wow you know we can actually do
something that people really like it's
not it's not another Netscape 6 we ship
something people like and they one of
the main reasons they liked it was the
quality was so high you know it barely
crashed you know it didn't have very
many problems at all because we had this
very high bar for release you know we
wouldn't ship it unless we were positive
that it was going to it was going to be
incredible incredible quality so now
what do we do next all right well
Netscape isn't around anymore to work on
it you know none of those engineers so
we sort of have to we have to find other
people to work on it well that's our
community you know those are all those
people who had gravitated to the project
because of its ease of use and its speed
and it's growing success now started to
become our open source community and so
408 we were able to to do it an entire
release cycle entirely done through the
open source community there was no
Netscape you know no assistance from any
paid corporation at that point it was
done entirely by the open source
community we had QA you know people
downloading nightly builds and testing
them we found a lot of good developers
people who are good in cocoa people who
understood the back end of gecko who
could help us out you know it really was
done entirely by the community and it
was sort of a big step up for us because
we realize not just that people want to
use this but people want to participate
in this people want to become part of
this community because we're doing the
right thing you know they even though
they see that we don't have all the
bells and whistles you know it's not
completely done yet but they see the
promise and they see that they want to
be a part of that so after we shipped
out on 8 which was which people loved
even more than 0 dot 7 and part of that
was because the quality was even higher
we knew we had a tall order ahead of us
you know what what is the the big
milestone in any open source
well it's it's that magical one point
out you know probably ninety nine
percent of open-source projects get to
version 01 297 a 4b and you know they're
just stuck that way on fresh meat for
the rest of their existence but we
wanted that we wanted real users to to
download our software and so we knew we
had to have that magical one point out
so if we didn't people would just look
at it and compare us to those fresh meat
things and say well what's the guarantee
this won't delete my hard drive it's not
done yet you know people have this
barrier at one point o that they won't
touch anything before that so we had to
get to that major milestone and getting
to that major milestone meant that we
had to have a quality that was as high
or higher than 08 which is really hard
because we'd already set an incredibly
high bar for for ourselves with the
previous two releases so it came down to
really just drawing a line in the sand
and saying we have to get this out we
can't just delay it until it's perfect
because we know it's never going to be
perfect we're the developers we see all
the warts the community reports the bugs
every day they see the warts you know we
don't we're not able to take a step back
and see all of the all of the promise of
this little application so finally we
just made the call we say you know at
the point we get it to the quality we're
going to fix these you know 20 bugs and
we're going to one point out at the same
time we also had a documentation group
who rebranded our entire website along
with one point oh so not only was it a
user release with a user-friendly
version number but we also switched to a
user-friendly website and all talk some
more about that and we realize you know
we we finally got there we shipped one
point oh I think februari of last year
when we did it you know we went from
Ground Zero to something that gets you
know 100,000 or 200,000 downloads every
little dot revision that we that we
release solely through this community
this community of testers of designers
of engineers
you know people who just download bugs
and download builds and file bugs and
that's their only connection to the
project you know this this little
community was able to ship something
that my mom and dad would use you know
it wasn't this geeky project that had
200,000 preferences and you know you
could send secure email from the URL bar
it was something that people actually
wanted to use and we did it so what do
we learn from all of this so this is
where a lot of the Mozilla history
really really plays in in terms of
everything that we learned certainly
from the the grommet Raptor debacle
killing grommet we have to be completely
open you know you have to be open with
your open source community Eric Raymond
said it best in cathedral Mazzarri said
be open almost to the point of
promiscuity you know just everything
that you can possibly share you have to
let your community in on because you
lose a tremendous amount of Street
credit with them if you don't if you're
going to make back you know back room
decisions then you're you're cutting
them out of their ability to feel like
they're part of the project when when
people feel like they're connected to a
project then they're going to be more
excited about it they're going to
evangelize it to their friends they're
going to be willing to download daily
builds even though the quality from day
to day isn't that great and do their
normal work with them you know and then
they'll go the extra mile of when they
find a bug they'll actually file it for
you because they care you know if you
can get people excited if you can get
people to to see the promise of your
application though they'll get
personally involved in helping you
realize that goal and two then withhold
information from them is to completely
lock them out of that completely lock
them out of that cycle so they'll just
say yeah well you know if you really
don't want to know what I have to say
you know I'm just going to go use
something else if you want them to be
excited you want them to evangelize you
want them to
build your community because the
developers are all busy working you know
you we can't do it ourselves we need our
community yeah another thing we learned
through Mozilla certainly was your
communications with your users all needs
to be user centric so when Mozilla first
started out 331 98 it was specifically
meant for developers you know Mozilla
wanted to distance itself from Netscape
completely and that Mozilla provided
source code you know all they did their
only product was source code and if
somebody wanted to build it and put a
logo on it and turn that into a product
they were free to do that from the
licenses and they felt that Netscape was
going to be the one doing that so they
didn't want to release any binaries to
provide so there wouldn't be any
confusion and the website the mozilla
org who followed that same principle I
told you how to download the source I
told you how to build it it told you
know some developer documentation but
there was absolutely no user
documentation on the website and that
progressed for years and years and years
it just became more and more and more
developer centric because that was the
target audience even after they started
releasing builds there was almost no
user documentation so somebody would go
to missoula org they might find how to
download one of the nightly builds or
one of the milestone builds and they'd
have no recourse to you know how do I
use this how do I set preferences how do
i do anything you know there was there
was no there's no priority on building a
user community so we started out that
way with camino as well as well i was
doing the website in my spare time and
my main goal was helping other
developers contribute to the project so
our website was was very developer
centric it was difficult for users you
know we were targeting normal users we
weren't targeting geeks so it's very
difficult for a lot of our users to to
figure out some of the ins and outs of
our software and they had again they had
no recourse so we needed a way to to
help both developers and you
become part of this community and so I
was talking about with one point o weary
retin rebranded our website in order to
to make it much more user approachable I
think like the first four tabs of the
website are now completely about being a
user about getting your questions
answered about finding ways to submit
feedback you know user forums all of
that and then the very last tab is you
know oh by the way developers if you're
really interested you can do all of this
and that shift really helped us grow our
user community because now but before if
they had a problem either they'd they'd
have a problem they wouldn't be able to
use the product for some reason or
another and they'd have no recourse
nowhere to turn but now we have the
website and we could probably solve
their question in two minutes and now
we've turned a user that was probably
going to throw camino into the trash
into somebody who's really excited about
the project is you know it was just that
last one percent that they need it and
now they have it and they're really
excited and they're going to tell two
friends and two friends and two friends
and so on so we've turned minus one user
into a whole bunch of users just through
our website just by having the right
focus on the website another very big
lesson that we learned from Mozilla was
about ownership when we release the
software through mozilla org every every
module every architectural component of
the application had an owner such that
you know one person that that knew the
software they knew that piece of the
product better than anybody else so that
if changes needed to be made to that
product to that section of the product
that person would be able to say yes
that's a good no that's not you know I
know how most of this stuff really works
so you know this is good or it isn't the
problem was probably ninety nine percent
of those initial module owners were
Netscape employees because that in we
were the ones working on it we were the
developers and so you know we were the
ones that knew the code the best so when
that transitioned over to mozilla org
all of those Netscape employees became
those module owners and we're now
working with people in the open source
community directly well you know when
you're working in a corporation there's
no guarantee that any particular person
is motivated or interested or you know
even cares about showing up to work
people as a whole are generally lazy and
they just love collecting that paycheck
if they can sit there and play solitaire
all day and still get a paycheck heck
they're going to do that but the problem
becomes what if that person is module
owner well they don't care you know they
probably don't even want to be a module
owner but they were given this job
solely because that's the piece of code
they were working on before it was open
sourced so now everything has to go
through that person to fix bugs to make
architectural changes to make any kinds
of improvements or feature additions and
if that person is completely
unresponsive the whole process breaks
down it just backs up the community in
general in general open source
communities they tend to highly respect
ownership so if there's no owner
somebody will step up or the community
itself can decide all right these are
the right things to do because nobody
else you know nobody else has the final
say but if there is an owner then the
community sort of takes a step back and
defers all the decisions to that owner
just out of respect this person was
granted this position for a reason you
know this is a this is a community where
you know where hard work and good work
is rewarded through you know through
through more ownership and so just in
general the open source community takes
a step back when there is a de facto
owner and if that owner isn't doing
anything then it makes it very hard for
the community to step up they don't want
to assert that that you know that that
privilege that had been bestowed upon
that module owner you know don't want to
step on their toes you know they were
given it for a reason so who are we to
question them
but if they're not doing anything it
puts everybody in a really bad position
so one of the most important things I
think I've learned throughout this
entire process is that a week owner is
worse than no owner at all it's better
not to have any ownership of a module
let the community sort it out then to
put a figure head up there who's not
going to do anything who doesn't care
who doesn't want to be there because
they're going to make it even worse than
if they weren't there at all the other
thing I've learned certainly through
Camino is that testers are your most
valuable resource hands down when you
know I talked in the beginning about how
we wanted to harness this great hacker
community to come and fix our bugs and
add new features and help us defeat
Microsoft as you know through writing
all this code those developers never
came you know we years and years went by
and we got a few people and we generally
ended up hiring them so there weren't
really all that many people in the open
source community who are doing
development we're submitting patches who
are doing any kind of riorca tech ting
you know those those developers those
hoards of angry hackers who hated
Microsoft never showed up and it's a
variety of reasons you know we can we
can go into them at length but the fact
is they just didn't the people that did
show up and this surprised everybody was
testers they didn't run away when we
switched architectures because they
didn't really care most of them aren't
technical you know most of them don't
have CS degrees they don't care one
rendering engine or another they just
want to browser to use and so they
didn't run screaming when we canceled
grommet and we switch to something else
they just started testing something else
your testers are also the people that
help keep you honest there are the ones
that download your nightly builds and
you know and provide you a sanity check
all those things you checked in
yesterday do they work or do they not
work because it's easier to find out you
know if I do a check-in today I'd rather
know tomorrow that's something I broke
that's something i did broke it rather
than
six weeks down the road because in six
weeks you've got six weeks worth of
possible changes that could be you know
that could break things and it's your
testers who are the ones who are testing
in these environments that you can't
even imagine especially for something
like a web browser where there is an
infinite number of inputs you know
people can throw anything at a web
browser and it has to be expected to
either do the right thing and certainly
not crash but most developers certainly
ones working on a web browser you know
you only go to 15 or 20 sites a day just
in your general surfing you know you go
to the new site you read the blog's that
you read or you know some of the other
just weather sites but you don't go to
that site in Pakistan that's going to
crash your browser but someone in your
testing community because they're spread
throughout the entire world they're not
just in cubes next to you doing the
exact same thing they're the ones who
are testing in these different
situations they're the ones behind
different firewalls they're the ones who
have different proxies they're the ones
on completely different operating
systems with totally different software
installed and more importantly they're
the ones throwing different input at it
foreign languages you know websites
behind security that you couldn't get to
all of these wonderful bits of
information that you and your little
room of testers never would have found
you know so you know you've you've
opened up from from just a small amount
of a small amount of testing to
literally anybody can help you test and
those people really are the ones who are
most valuable the the other thing that a
lot of the testers I've run into a
really good at is they're good at
recognizing patterns they don't have to
have a CS background yet they're still
able to contribute very good analysis of
what a bug probably is you know they'll
go they'll be able to look at the bug
database and see what was checked in
they'll be able to look at some of the
files that may have been modified and
just even by their file names you know
if something crashes in a text field and
yesterday somebody checked in something
in NS text field
chances are probably good that they're
related and you don't you know you don't
need ten years of cs to be able to make
that connection and so it's it's these
people who have the time who aren't just
head down fixing bugs day in and day out
who can make these types of connections
you can say oh this is similar to that
other bug because they have a similar
stack trace and now the developer only
has to fix one thing instead of two
because the community has done that
triage for them the community has
recognized the patterns that so that the
developer doesn't have to and that is
that is a very as a very strong trait of
a lot of QA communities is they can see
these patterns develop and they can make
a lot of very very accurate descriptions
about what is going on without actual
knowledge of or understanding of what
goes on under it what's key to that is
having an open bug database if you don't
have an open bug database you've cut out
a tremendous amount of information from
your testers you know their their main
ability to make these connections or to
be able to see other bugs or see what
was fixed or see what other things may
have come up in the last couple of weeks
that could be other duplicates of this
or just other manifestations of this or
somehow related and if you if you take
all of that information away from them
they're just flying blind you know you
people would file bugs and they go into
the ether and you would have absolutely
no idea as a reporter if you were right
or you know if or able to make a
connection to something to to another
bug or another issue and end up saving a
developer a tremendous amount of time
doing here okay the other thing i didn't
mention on the previous slide is that
testers are also very good at reducing
test cases making making very small
reduced test cases the again the
developer doesn't have to waste a
tremendous amount of time picking
through 200k of HTML on CNN com to find
why a table is off by three pixels you
know if somebody would just file a bug
and say the tables off by three pixels
that
probably two weeks of work for the
developer but if someone in the
community if that's their donation if
that's their contribution to the project
can take a week or week and a half and
narrow wittle all of that down to five
lines of HTML and some CSS and then give
that to the developer the developer
could probably fix that in a day you
know so that is a tremendous
contribution to a project even though it
doesn't really it never shows up in
terms of actual written code it is still
a very very sizable contribution the
last bullet here about process is also
very useful time back to being open
Mozilla does a reasonable job of putting
all of its release process into the bug
system so you can tell when bugs are
going to be filed when they've been
targeted to be fixed when they have been
fixed when they're not going to be fixed
etc so everybody knows when the product
is getting ready for release because
they can see okay the the number of bugs
that we have to fix for Firefox two
point oh whatever is down to four things
because they can do that query in the
bug system and directly see the
developers are getting close you know
you don't need to talk directly to the
product management you can infer quite a
bit about how the project works and how
the project does its releases through
the bug system so again if your bug
system is closed you've cut off a
tremendous amount of information from
your community because your community
really cares when you're getting ready
to ship that's when you know that's when
they want to step it up themselves
because any bugs it you know any bugs
that they don't find are in some sense
and reflection on them if they consider
them their contribution to be testing
they want to find all the bugs so they
want to make sure they step up when you
get ready to to release and if you don't
communicate any of that you've lost that
that huge contribution another major
thing that we learned throughout the
entire Mozilla process is you just can't
please everybody you really shouldn't
even try they're always going to be
people out there who want their pet
feature who just completely disagree
with everything that youre
trying to do and sometimes you just have
to state take a step back and say I'm
sorry you know we we can't make this
work what Mozilla tried to do in the
beginning because we lost so many
developers at the start when we switch
rendering engines or weren't very
receptive to things from from the
community when developers did start to
show up you know we were so overjoyed we
didn't want to say anything that could
possibly turn them away we never wanted
to say no we never wanted to anger these
people so that they'd run off again so
we always said yes you know someone
would come to us with a feature to add
sending mail from the URL bar and it
would be perfectly written code you know
perfectly optimized it was you know
rocket fast and didn't call slowdowns
anywhere else it didn't leak all the one
you know very well architected and we'd
say awesome thank you for your
contribution we're going to stick it in
so that you feel like you've contributed
to this open-source project and you feel
important and nobody ever stop to ask
wait a minute do we really want to be
able to send mail from the URL bar
probably not and so we ended up with a
product that was full of all of these
weird little features all of these weird
preferences because all right so we'd
add this send mail from the URL bar
feature and what we couldn't really
agree or disagree on whether we wanted
so let's add a pref so let the user
decide whether or not they want to add
that so now we've added this feature
that we probably don't want it all and
now we have an extra preference so
you've got you know tons of features
that just bog everything down make the
architecture more complicated make it
more difficult for developer for other
developers to contribute because you got
to wade through all this extra craft and
you've also added a lot of extra cruft
visibly to your user in terms of
enabling and disabling all these weird
little things that ninety-nine point
nine percent of them don't even
understand let alone care about
so there comes there comes a time when
you absolutely need to be able to say no
to somebody you know it doesn't matter
if the patch is perfect if it's well
architected if it's a beautiful
implementation if it's not a feature you
want you have to be prepared to say no
and thank you very much but we don't
want this and that was one of the main
problems that that Mozilla sort of still
has to this day but it's one thing that
we decided very early on in Camino was
going to be sort of a you know a guiding
principle that we were going to say no
more than we were going to say yes and
that's part of the that I think that's a
major reason for a lot of its success it
doesn't have all of these crazy weird
features it doesn't have 300 preferences
you know in addition to that it's not
just me as the owner stepping up and
saying no it's the community being able
to police that and enforce that if you
can teach your community that this is
important that in order to ship
something that real people can
understand we can't say yes to
everything then the community has to be
self policing the community has to be
able to tell itself you know I know you
really want to work on this but you
should be working on this other thing
instead because I don't have time as the
lead to do that for everybody and once
once you you teach your community how to
do that it becomes self-sustaining new
people that come on try and do something
and they get their hands slapped and
they get the religion and they
understand you know where the project is
going and what is important and what is
not important and they then can help
teach other people who come into the
community and a single person doesn't
have to do a tell a single person
doesn't have to do everything all right
so where we going for now we released
1.1 a to about a week ago which is a you
know it's it's got a scary long fresh
meat version number on it but it's
actually really stable it's quite good
I'm using it and I generally don't
update to nightly builds or anything but
one of the things that it's really drove
home to me is that are our goal of
perfect
Shin of not being even a smidge worse
than the last release has given us this
this paralysis we're afraid to ship
anything because oh my god what if it
what if it crashes or what if it's a
little bit slower or what if it doesn't
do everything perfectly and we set this
very high bar and it's part of what's
made camino very successful but it's
it's tied our hands behind our back
we're not able to to get things out and
release things to our user community and
get that feedback and get that that
cycle of you know they submit us
feedback we integrate it and we push out
another bill to sort of release early
release often which is very very useful
in open source communities we've lost
all of that because we're so terrified
of well you know we've added so many new
features and its really great but on
this one website it might crash
sometimes we can't ship it and so we
need to get out of that we need to find
a way out of that you know may be doing
more frequent alphas is a way to to help
build us out of that but we really need
to put 1.1 to bed and ship it you know
it's been like a year and a half since 1
point 0 and we have so many new features
and I can't even I can probably talk for
an hour on the new features that we've
added to it and they're all good things
they're not geeky things they're things
that people in our in our community have
been asking for for a very long time so
we have to find a way to ship and I
think the only way we can do that is
draw a line in the sand ship it and move
on move on to 1.2 so we're really trying
to get one point at one point one out in
February or march and then we're going
to hopefully do a very quick release in
1.2 for the bigger things that we
couldn't actually get to in 1.1 and just
start a more frequent release train
because this paralysis is just killing
the project
moving forward beyond that where do we
go there's a lot of different directions
what does a two point O mean you know
one point o was a gigantic milestone for
an open source project what is to point
out what about leaving behind some of
the older operating systems right now we
go back to 10 3 1 point 0 goes back to
10 to how many people are still on 10 2
there's a lot of things that Apple's
coming out with core animation is
spectacular is there any you know maybe
if we make to point out leopard only we
can do all of these awesome things that
our users really want that flash that
polished that apple style and deliver
that in such a way you know with a
really good browsing experience you know
just supporting all of these previous
operating systems tie our hands maybe we
should think about WebKit top of the
trunk on WebKit really really fast
problem is it still doesn't render half
the web you know that's one of the big
that's one of the big features of Kamino
is this that Mozilla power it renders
the web you know it you don't run into
the same problems you do in Safari I
can't surf with Safari that's the main
reason I'm still doing Camino I can't
use Safari you know we also have a big
question about what are we going to do
moving forward with the Mozilla
Foundation the Mozilla Foundation has
made it fairly clear certainly through
the corporation that all they care about
is Firefox it's all it's all Firefox all
the time if you're not firefox you are
not important and that is pretty much
the the direct message we received from
certainly from the corporation there are
some people within the foundation who
are still very helpful to us but by and
large if you're not firefox you know why
are you here and so that brings up a big
question of so why are we still why are
we still tying ourselves to Mozilla if
they don't care about us at all camino
really is the redheaded stepchild of
mozilla you know we're trying so hard to
be a good community citizen for our
parents provide all of this extra
testing through you know through our own
testing community through our own QA
community and we get very little in
return what we do get in return is
tender
foxes use of the bug system in the bug
system is very important we don't want
to really fork the bugs because most of
the bugs are in the rendering engine
that's shared with firefox we want to be
in the same bug system we also want to
be using their build system their build
machines because they're inside the
firewall so we can use talkback and if
we didn't you know if we weren't on that
same system we wouldn't be able to
upload symbols we we think we may have a
solution for that in the medium term but
nothing in the short term so we're sort
of tied to them for some process but
we're really not at all tied to them in
terms of goals so that's a big question
for me and some of the other leads on
the project is you know how do we how do
we keep up this relationship with the
Mozilla Foundation after all they've all
they've done for us and all they haven't
done for us so that's actually all i
have for the talk i wanted to open up
for for QA for about 10 or 15 minutes i
want to remind everybody that this is
being broadcast publicly it's being
recorded for public broadcast so please
don't ask anything google sensitive
because then we won't be able to do that
if it's possible if you could go up to
the mic to ask the questions that make
it so that i don't have to repeat it but
i will certainly repeat questions for
the people on the phone they're already
so the question was how many users do we
have we don't have a really good
estimate of that we really only have
just download numbers but probably over
time over all the different versions i
would imagine we've amassed about about
a quarter of a million maybe 200,000
that's that's a very rough guess yep oh
I'm sorry I didn't say that the name of
the documentary is called code rush it's
a PBS documentary sorry about that yeah
sure sure so certainly in web kits favor
it's much simpler like four for new
developers coming on to the Camino
project or even to any gecko project the
learning curve is tremendous gecko is a
very complicated very very
unapproachable system and so anybody who
wants to try and do any sort of
development unless they can stay at the
most the very highest level and not have
to get down into any of the rendering
engine stuff you know they they need to
learn X be calm and all of just all of
the the crazy in Phest
it's much easier
to get your brain around so it's much
more approachable to new developers so
we think we might with sort of a switch
like that we might be able to get a lot
more developers coming to our cause just
because they don't have to learn all of
this craziness of gecko you know
certainly the obvious differences of web
compatibility which is another main
reason we're sticking with gekka right
now but you know Apple has full-time
people paid to work on this project and
so you know they're they're working
really hard on improving that that
compatibility WebKit has gotten quite a
bit faster so even though you know Steve
Jobs likes to stand up and say safaris
the fastest web browser on the Mac I
can't see why he's saying that because
pretty much every user that we get
feedback from says camino feels so much
faster than safari so you know take that
for what it's worth but that's you know
that's what I hear from from the user
community but none of them are running
the WebKit that is top of the trunk that
is in the open source builds right now
that hasn't shipped yet and it's in
theory a lot faster so some of the speed
improvements maybe may narrow that gap
quite a bit but mostly mostly it's the
brain print that's that's the biggest
one yeah well Marcus how do you deal
with the Rocksteady get go back so
stupid around
years and years somehow they're very
vague but they never get fixed yet so
the question is how do we how do we deal
with the long-standing gecko bugs that
have been there forever like the
four-digit ones and and all of that
sometimes they do get fixed sometimes we
we get people who are just so absolutely
annoyed by them that they take it upon
themselves to go and fix them most of
the time however they just stay there
you know we we hope that people being
paid by the mozilla corporation will fix
them because that you know they're
they're actually paid to work on Firefox
and fix those types of bugs and there
are a couple of people at the
corporation like Josh who are paid to do
Mac stuff so we sort of like to let Josh
do a lot of that some of them also end
up going away by moving to newer
technologies like a lot of the bugs that
we had in not being able to render some
internationalisation or do some kind of
different types of international layout
are solved by the new rent the new
graphics layer cairo that they're
putting in because it's on top of courts
instead of carbon so we get some of that
for free but there are still quite a few
four digit bugs that you know every Mac
user just shakes their head and says
yeah this really should be better but
you know it's a volunteer project so we
need somebody just to step up and do it
yeah
wondering that like the you know
over to bargain
better than the catfisher
right the question is camino seems to
support a lot of Google applications
better than WebKit a lot of it is we we
get we get a lot of that for free
through gecko now our use of gecko just
allows us to just work but there is a
lot of there is also a job of JavaScript
side of it so I think that's about all I
can say in public so anyone else
this is crazy I'm all about the crazy
get the rendering
not that I know of but that is a really
good idea I mean I
so the question was it has anybody taken
a look at at putting WebKit api's on top
of geckos embedding api's and the short
answer is no the longer answer is it's
certainly something to think about
moving forward but there hasn't really
been a lot of desire nobody's really
asked for that you know so it would be
great to be able to put gecko inside
safari or something happy like that but
we we aren't finding companies coming to
the Mozilla Foundation and saying you
know we want to build this this web app
this native web app on the mac and it
would be wonderful but we want to use
gecko instead can you give us these
types of api's you know nobody's
nobody's really asking for it because
safari web kits already on the machine
and it's good enough so people don't you
know you don't want to take the extra
download hit you don't want to take the
extra complexity you know bugs you know
it to some extent you you you have a
more open process with the bugs but for
a developer it's also a lot more
difficult because you know you're not
just working with something already
present on the operating system so I you
know I I can see how it would be useful
and we sort of thought about that when
WebKit first came out but since nobody
ever asked for it it kind of dropped by
the wayside
ok well if nobody else has any questions
I want to thank you all for coming and
certainly thank our host Lesley
Hawthorne the on the open source speaker
series and good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
