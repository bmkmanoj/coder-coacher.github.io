quality group here we're responsible for
ranking so if you do a search and the
results don't get you what you need it's
my fault I've been doing search for 20
years I've done it in other companies as
well but let me go directly to the
slides they'll start actually with
something that may goes against the
grain of some of what you're talking
about but I'll do it anyway and I try to
make a pretty bold statement which is
that so far we build the infrastructure
we build an amazing infrastructure and
not just computers build dams and
airplanes and roads that's what the 20th
century was we more or less conquer
nature at least the first step now comes
the next step how do we get people how
do we understand people how do we get
societies to be better how do we get
education to be better i do communicate
better and so on if people think you
know people studied social science for a
while it's going to be very different
with instant communication Facebook and
Twitter and all n of course search we
are getting into all posts of different
applications that will completely change
how we live so I'd like to think of
course I'm biased but I'd like to think
the 21st century will be about
understanding understanding people
particularly so it's a lot more than
show structure now we have the
infrastructure what do we do with it we
have now the ability we have DNA we have
instant communication we have all the
facility we have all the ability to do
that I like to think the search is one
of the leaders in this area and i'll
show you some of the things that we're
doing of course i'm limited I can't talk
about you don't pronounce things so I'm
gonna I can't talk to tell you about
things that we haven't announced yet
obviously I can't talk in detail about
the algorithms we use but I can show you
lots of the stuff that we doing
I like the idea analogy to rocket
science you know that's what kind of
triggered a lot of the science of the
20th century almost about 50 years ago
you know John Kennedy's stood before
everybody said we're going to send a man
to the moon and that was incredibly
incredibly exciting I can't do something
like that with understanding people it's
much more subtle than that and for some
no Joe Kennedy but I like to think of
what we do is sort of rocket science in
fact I would argue that we sort of do
rocket science that you take for granted
this is our new type of rocket science i
call it quiet rocket science you can't
actually tell that it is you completely
take it for granted it's there it works
and that's exactly the way we wanted
that's exactly the way it should be okay
so let me start with a really really
trivial example and I chose this example
because my daughter sent it to me she
keeps sending me examples of things that
don't work once in a while she sent me
example nothing to do work um and this
is an example where she said she was
looking for a particular music store
Griffin music Palo Alto if you notice
the spelling is completely different the
name of the store is Griffin in fact
spell checking didn't catch it there is
no did you mean synonyms didn't catch it
it's way too far from that the match is
not particularly good Palo Alto appeared
not none of their words appear in the
title Palo Alto is somewhere in their
music is actually not that high talk
about American music somewhere in there
on the page yet not only did we find it
not only did we put it at the first
position we even added if you notice
those things we call them cycling's that
means we are pretty certain that that's
exactly what you meant so we gave you
some more information into the site so
you take an example where the match is
very weak but we really know what you
meant this is an also an example where
you probably wouldn't have thought twice
about it you did the search you got the
results you go there everything
works everything fine you don't see how
much actual how much smartness goes into
something like that okay so let me go
back and start talking about search
search is much harder than anything even
after taking that into account it's
really really hard and in particular the
point I want to make is expectation
grill whatever we solve today tomorrow
is going to be harder because people are
need more they want more and they expect
us to do more I think at some point in
the last few years we cross the
threshold from you go and do a search
and you feel lucky that you actually
found the results so you're going to do
a search and if you didn't find the
right result something went wrong
somebody did something wrong but you
expect to find the right results this is
a nice way it doesn't mean that you
always find the right result we didn't
go from zero percent two hundred percent
you know but it's in people's
expectation we made a big difference so
when we do the search here we obviously
have huge huge amount of resources we
have lots of storage we have lots of
machines we have lots of everything I
kind of I couldn't resist when I put
this slide together I'm using PowerPoint
PowerPoint resisted the word petabyte
and suggested you know maybe I meant
megabytes or pet bites so besides the
air is to make fun of somebody else
there is a point here which is when we
designed spell checking we didn't hire a
few linguist to figure out how the
language works we hired a few in very
few engineers to figure out how to
handle the data so our spell checking is
updated all the time it's recent it
really is depend on the vast amount of
data that we get that's out there so the
the results obviously have to be very
fast very relevant very comprehensive
and as fresh as possible but these are
all obvious characteristics we have
teams reasonably large teams working on
each part of that but my main point is
even that's not enough
right because we always have to start
from the most important thing which is
we have to solve the users problem this
is what we need this is what the user is
asking us to do we always have to think
about the user and I'll show you several
examples of that but in general i like i
like this slides very much if there's
any problem we see it as our problem if
the user can't spell it's our problems
they don't know how to form the query
it's our problem even if they don't
speak the language it's our problem if
the information is not there it's our
problems the way is too slow it's our
problem we have to look at the whole
problem when we do and we'll see
examples of each one of them just
quickly we make time puns don't change
research most of those are invisible to
most people the transparent you take it
for granted your search gets better and
better all the time so it's not
something that going back to the rocket
science analogy you don't hear this huge
rocket goes up and all the excitement
around it it just things get better we
build a nice system to allow engineers
to innovate very quickly it's all based
on data we know how to analyze results
we let we give our engineers all the
infrastructure they need so they can run
all the experiments they have their own
copies of the web their own copies of
everything that's running they can run
things they can figure out how well
they're working we minimize the friction
this is just I put several slides of the
kind of grass we look at hundreds of
different graphs every day we have
dozens of mathematicians and
statisticians and computer scientists
who do nothing but evaluate how good the
results are that's one of the secrets of
search is that it you have to know how
to evaluate let me very quickly tell you
I know how many of you know how search
works so I'll spend two minutes just
give you the basic it's actually very
simple the way we do search we analyze
every document we take every word in
every document storied in a word table
with a point there where he found the
word
right when you put several words as a
query we look at the location the list
of all the documents that contain this
word in the second the list of all
document contain that word and so on we
get the list of all documents contain
all the words each document is also
associated with some weight some
importance of the document page rank is
one such example but there are many
other parameters many other ways to
evaluate it and then there is this you
know this magic step happens the ranking
function takes over and picks up the
first 10 results or first hundred
results whatever you ask for that's kind
of the the right the most important step
is how do you take those usually
millions of results and find the best
one but we do better than that this is
way over simplifying we in trying to
understand things I can't say that we
understand things in the in the you know
the full AI notion to really understand
but we come as close as we can which is
we don't just look at the document as a
collection of words we try to understand
connection between words influences we
summarize the document then we do the
same thing for your query we somehow
summarize your query more than just your
words there's a lot more than that and
then we somehow figure out a way to
summarize done to match those summaries
so there's a lot more going on in a
search than just you know the old 40
year old boolean match dis + match dist
doing intersection and be done with it
here are some examples of what goes into
some summaries it could be a language so
we understand the child care with the
space is same as day care and child care
without space it's not just felt
checking its usage of words we
understand time and time is actually
very hard to work with you can argue we
always should give you the freshest
results that would be wrong some queries
you want to want to know what happened
today some queries it doesn't really
matter when the document was written you
want the best document
and if it was written two years ago
that's absolutely fine it really depends
on the query place we understand places
so we can tell that you know one place
is close to the other which means that
their similarity we understand context
it's the examples of that and obviously
we want to understand you so we put a
lot of effort into personalized let me
show you some examples I mean at the end
of the day I spent a lot of my time just
looking at random queries a lot of my
team just looking at lots and lots of
random queries because that's what it is
and you get some insight if you start
seeing what people are searching for in
the back of your mind you're thinking
about what you're searching for and you
think that this is it in fact it gets
very very diverse so here are some
examples this is an example these are
all examples of Randall queries that I
just picked up again I'm looking at lots
of queries trying to figure out the user
intent that's always one of the most
important and difficult things in this
case it looks like what they're looking
for is a particular Excel program that
does something like this if you know
computer science you know how hard that
is to look for program to do something
like this there's a program with those
words obviously it'd be easy but doing
something like this is not this is also
pretty clear what the user was looking
forward over the form of the way the
query was form is more talking rather
than actually query sometimes you know
this is probably very important this may
be less important but it may be very
important when I look at queries I only
see the queries I have no idea where
they come from nor do I care no I want
to understand the person intent but this
could be very very important that person
for all I know here's here's how
specific it could be these are again
just random queries that I picked out
here's another very specific I actually
spent quite a bit of time to look for
this it turns out there was a crash two
days before in southwestern Utah that's
how hard it is sometimes you know I keep
saying that no queries are bad it's
always our fault but some queries get
close to it this is an example of a
query that's you know pretty hard to do
we could probably build a system that
can do that but I'm not sure it's a good
thing but we get queries like this this
one is a query that's interesting see if
you can figure out the intent of this
query anybody can guess because I have a
guest I have no idea because I don't
know who did this no that's it again
it's all guesses no we don't know but
here's a good guess my guess is the
person type this into google I'm going
to win the lottery and then fickle I'm
feeling lucky that's my guess and i gave
a talk with this example and somebody
raises and it says yes i did that let me
give you another example in the example
here shows that a good and interesting
point which is where we needs to give
you what you need not necessarily what
you said that's a distinction the query
is how many calories in a pound what is
the intent i did this grit so I'm
looking at this random queries and I did
the query and it turns out that google
generated the results right away there
was a one box on top and you gave and
they gave the results and the result was
you know 9,000 trillions nine times 10
to the 15 how do we get that I would
argue that's actually the correct answer
it came in from the google calculator
the google calculator knows how to
transfer between units look at the
question it asks how to transfer a unit
of mass to unit of energy pound is the
unit of mass you want to convert it to
you
energy we know how to convert mass to
energy there's a formula for that that's
the formula okay so actually my
interpretation was they think of this
pool user who looks at this and says I
probably shouldn't have this quarter
pounder right hi those nine thousand
trillion calories don't feel that good
right now so the point is we gave the
correct answer but it wasn't the correct
answer it's not what the user had in
mind and we did a disservice so this was
removed the same day I wish I'd kept a
copy but it's not longer there and you
can see the problem it's not enough to
look at just straight answer you really
have to understand intent okay so let me
give you more examples of the kind of
new things that we've done in search
that really improve how you can find
things so we know where you are please
for many people either because you told
us in many different ways or because we
can take it from your IP address and so
if i go and i did a search for 500
magdalena street it turns out there
isn't any mention on the web for this
particular address is not far from my
home and there are some discussion of
somewhere in philadelphia and there is a
saint magdalena on flickr but we know
that I did this query for mountain view
there is a street called Magdalena in
los altos not too far from here we gave
you an address of a map directly on that
street you don't actually have to say
which town it is because we can take
that into account and even better
example if I just search for plumbers
when it figures out that well you
probably want plumbers near mountain
view give me a list of plumbers okay so
results are much better just because we
get more information we can get you
there faster or speed well you know that
speed is usually the killer app and it's
amazing how many people don't know that
I don't realize it so here's a very
small thing that we've done
um you know those flash introduction
that some sites have we don't like them
because they just slow you down in fact
if you go to that site I pick something
that I hope I don't offend anybody here
but if you go that side that's what you
get for a while don't know why they
think it's a good idea but we build a
system that allows you if you so wish to
skip those we can do it automatically
small thing but interesting let me
actually skip this example I'll go back
to maybe later we can use we try to use
as much data as we can not necessarily
just web pages here's a simple example
if i search for alaska 301 will tell you
the exact status of that flight as we
speak will give you real-time data about
what happens to that flight that's
probably what you want because if we
just search the web for that query it
turns out this is the first result for
that query because it's it is actually
the best results it's the only result on
the web that alaska 301 is the title it
is a pretty good site it's flickr it
just turns out to be well not that
relevant but you have to look at it to
know that ok so if you want historical
data maybe that's correct translation is
a big deal you know most of the people
in the world don't have access to most
of the information because they don't
speak the language we want to solve that
we have a lot of work on automatic
translation and we put it into search so
here's an example you go to this is in
Egypt if someone searching again it's a
real query they search for Disney movie
songs at the bottom of the query right
there what it says is look for results
translated from English if you click on
that you get to this page you can go to
this page directly and search from any
language or not any language but many
many languages too many many other
images and what it does is it takes the
Arabic query translate it to english
does the search in english in this
particular query chances are that the
English web has much better results than
the Arabic world our web takes the
results in English then translate the
results back to our arabic so if you
only speak Arabic you're just looking at
this area it's only in Arabic you get
the Arabic result that you want if you
click on one of those it will
automatically translate the whole page
to Arabic for you so translation is not
perfect but you cannot get access to
that information without speaking the
language again it's not that easy to do
it's not just translation we have to
figure out when to do it and when not to
do it because for a lot of queries they
might be local you don't actually want
to translate from some beings web and of
course we have to worry about abuse not
everybody plays by the rules there are
tons of examples we have a large team
that deals with that in a large degree
we kind of I wouldn't say we beat it
because we have to you know to work on
it every day but it's definitely much
better than it was three years ago let
me show you some examples let me take
you know this is it looks like a real
content but in fact if you look at it
for every different disease it says the
same thing or take this example a
particular blog which if you look at it
well it doesn't make any sense but the
search engine has to be smart enough to
read this and say no that doesn't make
any sense that's not real content even
though it uses good words and I should
ignore that we're doing things all the
way to trying to figure out how much
information to give you in the search
results we call them the slip it in the
snippets so that you can make a
determination whether you want to go to
that site or not so if the query is
longer we think we need more room will
give you a longer snippet if it's
shorter we might give you a shorter
snippet we work a lot to understand the
query in such a way that we can give you
other suggestions in this case a good
example principle of physics well
angular momentum big bank these are not
the same strings
but they actually have the right meaning
let me go quickly this is a good example
I like this story I was actually looking
for a talk this is different time I need
to prepare a talk I want to take a
previous topkapi some slides I couldn't
find my on my desktop I was looking at
my laptop couldn't find the laptop are
looking at the backup tape I couldn't
find it there and then it hit me I just
search google for it turns out the talk
was public somebody copied it it was on
the web i found it much easier than
going to backup tape all kinds of nice
example let me go quickly to it because
i want to leave room for questions i
think we will see as I said expectation
grow quite a bit and my best analogy
there is this drives I have orders a
relative magnitude mode disk drive today
than I did 20 years ago and I run out of
disk more now than it did 20 years ago
right we want to fulfill those
expectation I am a big fan of cartoons i
took this cartoon to be the sort of the
logo of our group in fact somebody
somebody took that and made even better
fortuna out of it and let me in there
any questions one of the things I've
noticed that it feels like it's a deep
secret because I just wasn't aware of it
that could be under stingray that when
you type stuff into the Google search
bar it actually does computations and
tries to literally answer questions may
if you if you put in a request of what's
50 degrees fahrenheit in centigrade it
does the computation there appear to be
quite a few cases along those lines do
we document that anywhere or is this one
of those things it spreads by virally or
what's what's the story there
documentation is hard because people
don't tend to read documentation in fact
we upgraded the help pages recently by
quite a bit and I say that all the
buyers possible because I
Rhodes the new help pages are not too
many people go there unfortunately i
really recommend that you do that soon
it's very short it's only two pages but
it gives you quite a few of those
example and tell you about its but let
me just the basic answer door is you
don't have to know any of this you just
have to think go to the search box and
tell us what you need and we will have
to figure out what you need an answer
your question this is why we're looking
at the logs all the time and find out
what people are missing or what doesn't
work and we edit we don't want you to
learn all the different syntaxes and all
the different ways we wanted to make it
as simple as possible you just tell us
what you need well I guess I'm going to
push back a little bit on that because I
think if I had maybe I'll go look at the
help page so if i had seen examples of
things i could reasonably do it might be
inclined to try to quote some whereas
before i wouldn't occur to me to do that
I guess that's the issue I say we don't
want you to do this you don't want you
to have to do it i suppose the more you
learn the better you are so i'm not
against learning in any way don't take
that but our goal is to solve all the
problems without the need for a learning
syntax yeah sort of two questions when
when ism is the enterprise search that
you think he sells a separate sort of
product have different issues that you
have for the internet type search that's
one question the other one is a you said
you wish you would have saved something
and then this triggered a thought in my
mind when Google I guess earth came out
recently it added under water but it
also added history so you could go look
at a place that it used to look at and I
remember in the audience gore noticing
the you know lack of ice and changes and
things like that do you do you now will
you whatever maybe can answer keep
historical views we would be able to do
searches back in time do you have that
capability I can't answer that in this
case it was a buck so wasn't historical
data it was just a bug that it was
triggering the wrong time
and I you had an engine I mean you're
you're evolving the search engine is a
functional cure and I so really
understand the need and understand
completely what what you're asking but
again i can't i can't announce something
that hasn't been announced the other one
was the enterprise the the enterprise
i'm not this is not the part of my group
so i don't know that much about the
enterprise yes just out of curiosity how
many of these inferential routines do
you have I'm not sure what you mean by
in torrential teens right how many of
these it must be just an enormous number
of patterns so the code is complex but
it's not you know it's not a collection
of if then else it's much more
complicated that obviously we have
learning mechanism but we have lots of
other things as well I think I computed
at some point that more than a thousand
men year went into the search code
already so it is when I say rocket
science it is actually very very complex
good yes sir so how has google affected
the connectivity of the graph like the
degree of the nodes like before before
Google search most of the people had to
put like hyperlinks from one page to
another how did that change maybe it was
maybe it was because of google maybe it
was like you know a different effect but
like haha you know how is the
connectivity of the web right that's
that's a good question i don't have
empirical information for that i haven't
I never looked at that but i think if i
were to rephrase your question 15 years
ago when the web started and yellow
started collecting the list of things
and other people collected a list of
things it was very important because the
only way to find something is to find a
list then Google came along and you
don't need a list anymore you just put
the query and you got it so there's less
incentive for people to create lists
right you don't need lowest you can just
search google that may suggest that
people do last links because they don't
do the work as it turns out
my feeling is people found other ways I
mean they then write blogs and the blog
want to point to an interesting thing or
they Twitter and they point to something
they find other reasons to point through
to two interesting things that's one
thing the other thing is of course we
improved our algorithm we don't depend
just on one thing we have we understood
we see how things change we adapt to it
right so we can do just as good job of
fact much better job yeah but I suspect
people are studying the sort of the
historical change in the web
connectivity there I'm sure there are
some results in that I just don't know
they are okay thank you very much and
would you care to characterize the kinds
of problems that are still really hard
that is you know if there were some
specific nutsy would want to crack what
could they be like okay let me mention a
couple one is inference of course
knowing that this implies that the other
one is connected connecting things that
is a few search for one thing and you
know what that thing is we'll find it
for you if you search for one thing and
you mean something else you search for
what's the effect of this on this but we
have to take two different things and
somehow connected we have to make some
kind of inference or more than insurance
we have to make some analysis of
language or analysis of something that
that gets to be much much more
complicated I'll give you an example of
something that happened to me I wanted
to have a monitor that swivel I wanted
to move my monitor back and forth so I
was looking for you know swivel monitor
and there are some it's kind of
expensive but I found some and I kind of
thinking about whether to buy them or
not and I think accidentally I don't
remember how it happened but then I
realized that there actually monitor
arms that can attach to any monitor
there's a standard
and those things swivel they're much
less expensive I don't have to replace
my monitor it's not a special monitor
it's just an arm you can buy back for
fifty dollars if I if I had known by
searching swivel monitor will tell me
you know what this is the problem you
have you might be able to solve it with
something else we're very close to the
very often we actually will tell you
through the refine refinement or through
other ways I'd love to do a lot more
than that that goes into understanding
this is something we can solve I think
to some degree we are solving it already
I'd love to do more of that how much I
think we're going to win because now you
open it to the selling more things right
it's not necessarily that I'll buy
cheaper things I made by more expensive
thing so I right now I'm looking for one
thing but in fact it turns out there are
five other things that I might be
interested in if anything I think
that'll be better but there is by if I
didn't say that there is a very clear
distinction between advertising and
search I work on the search part it's we
don't think about advertising we don't
think about revenues at all yes
this is a question that got asked of
folks from YouTube and Facebook and and
maps earth yesterday to what extent are
you constrained by infrastructure are
there are there problems in your space
that you're having to work around
because the way that you want to do it
isn't supported by the infrastructure
underneath or and so obviously we
completely absolutely depend on
infrastructure the stories about the
pigeon rank and all those goats that
going around they don't have they don't
have searched at all it's all
infrastructure we have very good
infrastructure I don't often get think
the situation where I say well I wish I
had better infrastructure that's what's
stopping me from doing that it happens
once in a while and definitely we're
trying to be good better infrastructure
we're trying to make it cheaper we're
trying to make it more efficient we
trying to make it faster and so on but
we're not in a situation where that's
the main blocker the main blocker is
ideas main blocker software may block
his development in search having said
that I think and that's because I think
we sort of again passed this special i
think five years ago there was a limit
on how many pages you can search almost
doesn't exist now we really can see
almost or web I'm not infrastructure guy
so maybe I'm under estimating because
it's very possible next week somebody
will come up with this unbelievable a
break to an infrastructure will allow us
to do a lot more that's definitely
possible I attempt to paraphrase there
was a question that was asked yesterday
I think was more than actually
infrastructure I thought the question he
was asking of several startups was what
elements of the internet you know held
you back technologically so this is
actually hard to do because you live
within the constraints and you don't get
to change them that's a very very sneaky
questions what things should change in
the world and this gets closer to the
meeting the significance of this meeting
what things do you wish it
change are changing and you want to
change okay that could really improve
the world search okay so I thought the
question was internally what I can do
better for outside the question to me
the answer is very very clear speed
latency the difference in your behavior
with content if it's 50 milliseconds
faster not to mention two seconds faster
is enormous you really interact with it
differently we have lots of experiments
we're running all kinds of different
user interfaces experiment and i can
tell you personally I see myself I
didn't think about it before i see
myself interact with content completely
different if i can get it within less
than a second or forget in two seconds
do you think why the hell would be such
a difference between two seconds there's
a huge difference in seconds if there's
anything I can do is really ask people
design website to think about the user
and try to make it as fast as possible
for them there is a sort of a maximun in
the fast food industry that six seconds
faster serving of food is one percent of
revenues if you can do it 6x second
faster that's one percent of revenues I
don't know if it's on the web if it's
six milliseconds so maybe 60
milliseconds probably in between
somewhere it's definitely not six
seconds okay and this the second is not
just the time it takes you to render
it's the time it takes the user to get
what they need if you put an extra page
in between and it requires an extra
click whatever you do think about every
millisecond that you caused the user to
wait more it's unbelievable loss of
revenues for you but it's lots of
usability to the user we are completely
completely religious about latency I can
see that bill is here thank you very
much
okay well this is a special treat
because bill corn is one of our most
senior people in the company and to have
him take time out of a busy day means a
great deal to me and I hope it means a
lot to you as well in the course of
composing this symposium i mentioned
that i had left out Serj i also left out
cloud computing and I was beaten over
the head and shoulders politely for that
and then cast about to figure out
whether there was someone who was
willing to take some time to talk about
it and Bill kindly offered to give us a
kind of a sense for sort of the state of
cloud computing and its significance in
in Google's world as you can imagine it
it looms very large in our ability to do
the things that duty was mentioning
faster and faster so bill I really
appreciate you taking the time I'll turn
this over to you and got to 15 or 20
minutes to go so I've been in the
computing business for quite a while
maybe not as long as some of you but
I've seen cloud computing appear as a
possibility multiple times and it's it's
always failed for variety of reasons so
some of which are technological and I'll
talk a little bit about some of that
some of it actually fails because of
public policy reasons and so forth and
I'll touch on that so these are these
are slides that just kind of set the
framework in it and I'll I'll rather
than talk to to them indeed there's no
detail here there's sort of cartoons to
talk about the developments over the
last few decades we've basically gone
towards the
no the personal computing model where
everybody gets to be an IT specialist
everybody has to figure out how networks
work you know everybody gets to figure
out how to remove spyware and you know
malware and whatever whatever where gets
on your computer that you wish you
didn't have it's clearly reduced our
ability to do large-scale computation
and storage we're very limited although
I am amused these days that personal
computers I think have about as much as
the early crate computers I used in my
in my younger days so things have
changed a lot I think that Internet is
taking us back towards the sort of the
cloud computing model and it's come come
a long way in that direction and and I
want to talk about what Google's trying
to do here I think in and I'll talk
about what's in our way so we're we've
launched a lot of products and we've
launched a lot of research ideas and so
forth into the community we we believe
that the right model for the end
customer the thing that would make the
end customer happiest is if the devices
that you worked with were stateless by
that i mean the devices we come throw
away and they're probably evolutions of
your cell phone we can debate that I
think you know I see all of u busily
doing your email or you know doing
whatever you're doing on your laptops
but I think that I see an evolutionary
path particularly with things like
netbooks and other things evolving where
where it will become possible to hit
much different price points with fairly
large screen devices if people wanted to
do it and and get your data in the cloud
so we're trying to enable that you know
we've put out things like online
documents we've put out things like App
Engine and we've put it we have other
things in the works that we're planning
to put out
we're trying to enable some new
developments in the mobile area with
things like Android and so forth what
we're trying to help change the dynamics
of the operating system and application
offerings on mobile devices and we're
going to do more in that space but
basically what I think of as cloud
computing is get get the user data out
of their homes and out of the devices
that carry around and get them into the
cloud now there's all kinds of technical
challenges right you need people want
control of their data they want to be
able to get their data back you know
those questions about cryptography and
encryption and what can government's do
to me to see the data that I have and so
forces as a whole bunch of public policy
issues connected with that as well but I
my belief is that a lot of people would
prefer a once they've sort of figured
out there their address book and what
they use for their day-to-day computing
and thinking about you know how they go
about their lives and so forth how they
do shopping and so it would be better
not to have to copy that data around and
reset settings and every device and so
forth but that would become part of the
cloud and and so we're we're moving
towards that vision I think this this
vision has happened before I saw it
probably in a in a clear form probably
about 15 years ago and it didn't happen
partly I think because there was not
sufficient wireless connectivity and
there wasn't sufficient wireline
connectivity at least in the developed
world where it was possible to you know
make that go I think there's now enough
networks built out sadly I think that
the networks are better outside the
United States than they are inside the
United States at least on in the sense
of last mile and wireless but
nevertheless I do think there's enough
connectivity now for people to actually
do more of their computing I think the
the other thing that's interesting
thing for cloud computing is you know so
we want to enable things like making the
cloud more accessible and make the
client more powerful at the same time
but stateless but one of the interesting
thing that google has is lots of data so
one of the things we get requests for
all the time is can we get access to the
data you collect so you know we've
exposed things like that a lot of the
Geo data we have through Maps API is and
we're exposing other api's people i
think would like access to our web
repositories and so forth and so we're
kind of debating lots of interesting
questions about what do we expose and
what don't we expose and of course is a
as a for-profit enterprise we really
have to think about you know what's a
business model it makes sense at the
same time we're trying to figure out
what would be useful for our user
communities but I think one of the
things that will happen with cloud
computing this time and you see it
happening is you'll see people wanting
access interesting data repositories and
I and I think that's that's going to be
part of this cycle when I saw this 15
years ago and then again probably seven
years ago try to come to fruition there
wasn't really the data sources and
repositories available that there are
now and I think that will be an
additional driver towards actually
making it happen now it'll raise
interesting questions because you won't
be a surprise to hear that Google's
advertising customers would love to get
access to data we have about people
you've seen some of the companies that
are working in the social networking
space have stubbed their toe a few times
trying to figure out how to monetize
their properties by essentially selling
data about people citizen once again I
think one of the big by you know one of
the big difficulties in this area is the
data about what people are interested in
is very important I think to this
initiative but how to do that in a way
that doesn't necessarily expose
individuals and what they care about
particularly people who are sensitive to
privacy is going to be a real challenge
and one of one of the things I've
noticed is you know I have college and
post college age kids and they were very
comfortable posting everything about
them on the internet and and they were
you know like the blog and give away
information they're becoming less and
less comfortable with that and there I
think they're also finding that the
Internet has this terrible propensity to
remember everything they ever posted I
seems to be the fault of this thing
called google I don't know why but the I
think so one of the challenges in this
is figuring out what the right public
public policy is right I've said public
policy many times but one of things i
want to emphasize here is cloud
computing in the sense of replacing
things like office applications and
figuring out your address book for your
mail and so forth is actually pretty
easy and i think sometimes we we mistake
that it takes you know large complicated
expensive software to actually do that I
think all that stuff's going to die and
and that that will be the easy part it's
the actual what do you do with the
personal data and how do you use it to
advantage people how do you do things
like find out more about diseases and
outbreaks and things like that we've
done some of that with the data we've
had just to expose you know what's
possible and so forth but there's a lot
of applications like that and that's all
wrapped up in this general area that's
called cloud computing so I think people
talk about it in the sense of low-level
computation and storage but it's a much
bigger topic than that I think those are
just enabling technologies as opposed to
being really interesting services that
we can offer but I just wanted to come
by and get get a chance to throw some of
these ideas into this group I think this
is going to be one of the drivers for
the Internet as it continues to evolve I
think there's going to be a lot more
demand for uplink bandwidth from homes
and from devices I think there's going
to be a lot more demand for fairly
secure encryption and privacy controls
and trust models and so forth I think
all of that has to evolve as part of the
part of the Internet in order to make
cloud computing really take on this
full-fledged thing not just replacing
mainframes not just replacing laptops
but actually becoming kind of a powerful
set of services that we can offer to a
broad set of global users but you know I
think this is an interesting group to
think about those issues and kind of
toss them around I would say cloud
computing is a very formative stage and
I'm hoping this time it sticks so with
that I'd be happy to take some questions
so my curiosity is that you talked and
large part about cloud computing and
privacy issues in the context individual
but in fact when I look at cloud
computing I see tremendous opportunities
and challenges for businesses and also
for municipalities I've had some
interactions with municipal governments
yet routinely are starved for computing
power often are not backing up their tax
records and other sorts of things and
the disasters are rather profound but
also small businesses where routinely
the founder of the business has a vision
about what she or he is trying to
achieve and becoming a computer
specialist is not part of that process
and they often realize at some level
that a lot of their important corporate
assets are sitting on that laptop which
they're not backing up enough and so
forth but there are too many other
things in front of them and and I say
that and I understand all the
accelerators that we also be provided to
a small business owner with cloud
computing but I'm saying there's an
opportunity there but but then you come
back to the question of that data is
their business and at some level your
privacy concerns from the cloud and the
question that we came up with in a
previous session about suddenly the fact
that it's off your premises and so the
ability to have it subpoenaed by because
it's in the hands of a third party goes
up become even more cute than they do
necessarily for individuals perhaps and
I just want it on your perspective so
you're right I concentrated on
individual users here all that's true
and for example the google docs stuff
that we put out is pretty heavily
adopted by a set of startup groups and
and small to medium businesses a number
of municipalities and so forth of jumped
on now of course the offering price for
them is the right one which is zero
right at least for a lot of them I think
there's some profound issues here one of
the reasons I said public policy about
15 times in my brief set of comments is
the issues here are not fundamentally
technical it's it's a question of what
are we comfortable with right the so for
example I can say in these Google
applications the docs in the mail and so
forth one of the challenges talking to
businesses about whether they would like
to move their data to Google
to the host in effect is they want some
assurances about the security there's
lots of legal questions like who can
subpoena my data you know if your data
centers in Europe what does it mean if
your data centers in the US what does it
mean if it's an Asia and so forth I
talked to some peeps some small
businesses and and some government
people in Australia who would strangely
enough prefer that their data not be
accessible by people who can have the
u.s. Patriot Act enforced against the
night so I'm not a I'm not an attorney
but the public policy questions are
fundamental here and so one of the one
of the I think there's going to be a lot
of questions about liability governments
and so forth and by the way there are a
number of governments that are moving
towards insisting that these kind of
services be offered in country and and
as that happens you know I have the same
reaction to it you know Google in some
sense as a global organization we're
trying to provide global services this
will tend to nationalize things right
and then the internet tried to avoid
that I see this is another round of
various governments trying to factor
into their current set of laws and
regulations how do we actually live with
this and right now they can't so we need
a very vigorous debate around what's the
right contract law what's the right you
know kind of opinions at the
governmental level in terms of national
security so we're be very challenging
but you're absolutely right tie the
question that's it's probably about data
and partly about the applications that
we can run against that data one of the
one of the tenses has been with more
centralization of the data is a less
choice on the applications we can run
against that data once the data is up on
Flickr or on a gmail that's correct that
only one application it didn't used to
be like that right I'm partly channeling
monocle I am who you know my colleagues
at Stanford who has been bending my ear
about this for the last few months but I
think she has a very good point that
that at some point in the future
presumably and hopefully were at a point
where the the data that we're holding is
under our control and who can see that
there were that anybody else is holding
is under our control if it's the data
about us and that we have some choice
over the application that is that is
using that data and that that seems
slightly at odds with the way that we're
going doesn't seem it's certainly not
technically infeasible so what's this no
I that's a that's a very complicated
question that I'll try to at least give
it a partial answer so so for instance
we're actively looking at could we
expose one of the primitive tools we use
which is called MapReduce to let people
look at at sets of data and I should
self identify myself I'm like an old
UNIX guy so to me all data should these
dreams of bytes and we shouldn't add all
this horrible metadata and formats and
so I because that's all evil stuff they
so I think introducing more general
programmatic interfaces is something we
need to look at the problem is Emmanuel
interfaces and my colleague I think Eric
gross was here yesterday the security
people get nervous I would which all
characterize it that way that maybe
that's not such a great idea is it some
interesting things there I think the
other the other thing for me is what's
your audience right so what sometimes
when I talk to people about what they
want to do with cloud computing I find
myself in the supercomputer wards again
they want to talk about very large scale
batch processing for weather and so
forth the real world for most people has
become their grocery list and there you
know what's my task list for this and so
people people who use computers and even
some quote unquote programmers who by
which programming now means writing
Excel
crows and you know things like that it's
a hole there is set of people out there
who view computers through applications
and wouldn't know how to write a line at
C code or C++ code or Java if their life
depended on right so that I think one of
the questions is what level do you come
in I as a professional computer
scientist I would rather come in at the
code level and get down to it most of
the user community now views web apps as
basic building blocks on which they add
things right so I think part of is
what's the right what's the right set of
abstractions to expose and what are most
of the users going to use it's a hard
problem well Facebook API insane or
Facebook kpi's absolutely facebook I'm
here within yes so actually bill I think
I'm probably going to go down a similar
path to to Nick I've been observing the
cloud computing phenomenon and noticing
the first its buzzword so it is no
additional there's some definitional
problems with it but setting that aside
for a moment there are a number of
organizations that characterize what
they're doing as cloud computing and
some of Amazon and Microsoft it's a very
popular trend what's term with startups
who are looking for fun that you also do
yeah so but attending for just a moment
that there is actually some commonality
among all these assertions about we run
clouds I've been thinking that the
ability to move information between
clouds might turn out to be an important
capability and I have the feeling that
we're at the same place in that context
as we were 30 years ago when there were
networks but they didn't talk to each
other because there wasn't any way from
one network to refer to another one
because there was no vocabulary for that
and I keep thinking well we promised
people that they can take information
out of our cloud and put it elsewhere it
means we have to have interfaces to do
that the example I'm taking stuff from
cloudy and moving at the cloud be and
it's protected in cloudy under some set
of you know reference references to who
has access to the documents
to them that's metadata which I
understand you consider evil but I'm
going to have to point out that that
that is maybe a necessary evil to deal
with access controls but if I want to
move the data from one place to another
I'm going to have to also Express not
only what the data is but also what the
access controls are and everything else
I don't think there's any vocabulary for
that and I i guess my primary question
is whether you whether you would agree
that that's an area that's worthy of
research and development having
mentioned it I think you should
absolutely and immediately the trademark
the term intercloud to prevent other
people from getting at that and the haha
oh thank you yes did I fail to do that
in the other case no I it's clear that
in the same way the internet evolved by
developing some open standards and so
forth we need to do the same thing here
I think part of what I'm what I was
trying to say here is that I believe the
most interesting aspects of the cloud
stuff which is as you point out a
buzzword is tackling the lots of data
making the endpoint devices stateless
and so forth going fairly far up the
application stack I it's absolutely the
case that the way the data is stored in
access so the low-level storage stuff
the API is that wireline protocols and
so forth we need to agree on and I think
as an industry and as a an academic
community and work towards a common sort
of thing so you can move stuff around
now in the same way with the internet
people will fight that because some of
the you know some of this is proprietary
advantage will go through you know will
go through the usual debate but I and I
think the other thing that's important
is I think people are going to want to
be able to pull their data out of the
cloud or occasionally make backups out
of the cloud I'm still one of these
people that doesn't believe even though
i've been told nine times that that data
is backed up i still try to keep
personal copies of it because i don't
kind of believe anybody that they
actually backed it up so the the you
know i'm not the only parent
but I mean I think I think a set of
interoperability standards they're going
to have to be created at the
particularly the storage level we will
level storage level if I'm the only
thing holding you from lunch so I should</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
